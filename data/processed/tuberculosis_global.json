        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment (TPT) is crucial for preventing infection with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> from progressing to TB disease, especially among people in high-risk groups. The expansion of novel TPT regimens for drug-susceptible TB is a notable advancement in TB care. However, managing contacts of drug-resistant TB patients remains a major challenge, particularly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended TPT for high-risk household contacts of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB patients; this was further reinforced in 2024 with a recommendation of a 6-month levofloxacin (6-Lfx) regimen. This Perspective discusses the early adoption of 6-Lfx for MDR/RR-TPT in the WHO European Region. In 2023, 38 of 53 WHO European Region countries reported on 6-Lfx use, with only eight confirming its use for MDR-TB contact persons. Accelerating the adoption of the 6-Lfx regimen and other evidence-backed TPT regimens is crucial for achieving TB elimination in the WHO European Region. Addressing challenges such as slow uptake of the recommendations, low awareness in affected communities and resource shortages are essential for success.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate and characterize the diverse MRI findings in central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB) and the role of other laboratory investigations to aid in early detection and appropriate management. This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed clinical and imaging data from 43 patients with confirmed CNS TB. The diagnosis was confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, biopsy, or clinical and radiological improvement post-antitubercular therapy (ATT). MRI findings were categorized into meningeal and parenchymal forms, with further subtyping based on lesion characteristics. Chi-square statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) to correlate CNS TB with clinical parameters.  Results: The mean age of the 43 patients was 33 years, and 58% were male. The most common clinical symptoms were headache (86%) and fever (79%). MRI findings revealed meningeal TB (leptomeningitis and pachymeningitis) and parenchymal TB (tuberculomas, tubercular abscesses, cerebritis, rhombencephalitis, and encephalopathy). Frequent observations included ring-enhancing lesions and perilesional edema. Parenchymal tuberculomas showed varying stages. Advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion imaging were useful in differentiating tuberculomas from neoplastic and infectious differentials. CNS TB presents with diverse MRI patterns, including both typical and atypical manifestations. Accurate radiological assessment, combined with clinical correlation, is essential for early diagnosis and management. Prompt initiation of ATT is critical in preventing long-term neurological complications. Future research should focus on refining imaging biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) treatment is challenged by a long duration, poor adherence, and the high risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). T-cell immunity is essential for anti-mycobacterial defense, but current immune-monitoring methods poorly reflect disease severity and treatment response. Correlations of immune subpopulations with TB severity, DILI, and treatment prognosis remain poorly understood. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from confirmed TB patients (n = 40). Multiparameter flow cytometry analysis was used to assess previously defined TB-associated T-cell phenotypes based on the co-expression of cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules following stimulation with two Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptides: culture filtrate protein 10 and early secreted antigenic target 6. Patients were subgrouped by disease severity, DILI, and treatment regimen (16-week short course vs. 24-week standard). Specific subsets (14/124) were found to be associated with disease severity. Notably, six of 14 subsets were positive for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), indicating its potential role in disease progression. DILI was associated with three interleukin (IL)-21<sup>+</sup> subsets (naïve CD4<sup>+</sup>, memory CD8<sup>+</sup>, and interferon [IFN]-γ<sup>-</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) and IL-17<sup>+</sup> memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, along with PD-L1<sup>+</sup>TIM-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (all p < 0.05). The 16-week and 24-week treatment groups showed a significant difference in IFN-γ<sup>+</sup> naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at week 16 (p = 0.013), but not at treatment completion (p = 0.393), despite the different durations. This study identifies specific T-cell phenotypes associated with TB severity, DILI, and treatment dynamics, highlighting potential immune markers for disease monitoring and DILI prediction.",

        "title": "Pre-treatment loss to follow-up and associated factors among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients diagnosed in Wakiso district, central Uganda.",
        "abstract": "Tuberculosis ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. The Sub-Saharan African region faces increasing trends of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB), further complicating the existing efforts for prevention, control, and eradication. Pre-treatment loss to follow-up (LTFU) among diagnosed DR-TB patients also signifies a setback in the timely prevention of disease progression and transmission, especially in low-resource settings. This study assessed the magnitude of and factors associated with pre-treatment LTFU among DR-TB patients within Wakiso district, central Uganda. A sequential explanatory study design was adopted to analyze electronic case-based surveillance (eCBSS) data between 2017 to 2022 from the Ministry of Health, Uganda. Participants for qualitative data comprised of six (6) key informant interviews and 2 focus group discussions among health workers and DR-TB patients respectively. Out of the 972 records retrieved from the eCBSS system for patients treated at Mulago National Referral Hospital from 2017 to 2022; 253 were analyzed. The majority of the participants, 62% (157/253), were male. The median age of study participants was 34 years (range: 18- 85). The prevalence of pretreatment LTFU was 13.4% (34/253). The qualitative findings reinforced and provided context to the quantitative results, revealing how behavioral, social, and system-level factors contribute to pre-treatment loss to follow-up (LTFU) among DR-TB patients. Significant associations were observed in patients who lacked a recorded telephone contact in TB register (adjusted PR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.80) and those without documented home address (adjusted PR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.27-0.97); qualitatively, this was linked to patients' fear of stigma, lack of trust in the health system, and unstable living conditions, leading them to avoid being traced. The analysis also showed that tobacco use (adjusted PR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.00-3.87) and illicit drug use (adjusted PR = 4.00, 95% CI: 1.76-9.08) significantly increased the risk of LTFU, which was supported by narratives describing substance use as contributing to hopelessness and neglect of health. Furthermore, patients with a history of treatment failure had 2.4 times the risk of being lost to follow-up (adjusted PR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.08-5.36), consistent with qualitative reports of discouragement, denial, and lack of awareness about the severity of DR-TB. Relapse cases had 69% higher prevalence of loss to follow-up (adjusted PR = 1.69, 95% CI 0.78-3.70) compared to new cases. Although factors such as alcohol use and family support did not reach statistical significance in the quantitative model, they were prominent in the qualitative data, suggesting under-recognized barriers related to psychosocial distress and poverty. Together, these findings demonstrate a strong convergence between data strands while highlighting that some influential factors particularly social and psychological may be underrepresented in routine health data. The study found a 13.4% prevalence of pre-treatment LTFU among DR-TB patients in Wakiso District. Quantitative analysis identified significant predictors, including lack of contact information, prior treatment failure, tobacco use, and illicit drug use, while protective factors included having a recorded home address and telephone contact recorded in relevant TB registers/electronic systems. These findings were reinforced by qualitative insights, which revealed that fear of stigma, denial of illness, substance abuse, poor health system responsiveness, and lack of social support contributed to patient disengagement. The integration of both data strands highlights the need for a patient-centered approach that strengthens communication, addresses behavioral health needs, and improves follow-up systems to reduce pre-treatment LTFU and improve DR-TB outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) strains presents a significant challenge to global tuberculosis (TB) control efforts. This study was conducted to explore the distribution and prevalence of mutations at various sites within the 81 bp Rifampicin (RIF) resistance-determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB gene in M.tb, as detected by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. This retrospective analysis encompassed 9,867 non-repeating patients diagnosed with TB between 2021 and 2023. Cases with RR detected by the Xpert were included in further detailed analysis. The study utilized Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests to identify statistically significant differences in demographic variables and the prevalence of rpoB gene mutations between RResistant TB (RR-TB) and non-RR-TB groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the relationship between probe types and demographic variables, with a P-value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Over the three-year study period, M. tb was identified in 2,927 cases, with 485 being RR-TB. While individuals aged ≥ 65 years constituted the largest absolute number of RR-TB cases, the highest relative risk was observed in children aged 5-14 years (OR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.16-6.22, P = 0.02) compared to the ≥ 65 reference group. probe E missing emerged as the predominant mutation site, particularly prevalent in pulmonary specimens and among individuals aged 55-64 years, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). An upward trend in probe B mutations was also observed, reaching statistical significance (χ2 = 6.614, P = 0.037).This molecular epidemiological study has identified the mutation patterns within the rpoB gene that contribute to RR, as identified through the use of Xpert technology over a three-year span in Jiangxi Province. The insights gained are instrumental in informing individualized treatment regimens for RR-TB patients by correlating mutation locations with resistance levels (e.g., probe E mutations confer high-level resistance requiring second-line drugs, while probe B mutations like D435Y may confer low-level \"disputed\" resistance). This facilitates precision therapy, avoids unnecessary second-line treatments, and reduces transmission. Future advancements in technology, such as large-scale sequencing studies, could build upon these findings to further elucidate the genetic variations at play. Ultimately, these discoveries could be corroborated through rigorous in vitro and in vivo experimental research, reinforcing the foundation of our understanding and response to antimicrobial resistance in M.tb.",

Data were collected for TB treatment outcome, hematologic inflammatory indices, anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT)-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level questionnaire to evaluate the effect of probiotics supplementation. In all, 177 patients with drug-sensitive pulmonary TB were enrolled. TB treatment success rates in the study group (SG) and the reference group (RG) were 85.1% and 84.6%, respectively (<i>p</i> = 1.000). Among hematologic inflammatory indices, only the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) showed a statistically significant reduction after probiotic supplementation (<i>p</i> = 0.048). No significant changes were observed in HRQoL scores at various time points. ATT-induced ADRs were significantly lower in the SG than the RG (14.8% vs 61.3%; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Probiotic supplementation did not significantly influence TB treatment success or HRQoL outcomes. However, it showed a favorable impact on systemic inflammation and a significant reduction in the incidence of ATT-induced ADRs, especially gastrointestinal side effects. These findings suggest a potential role for probiotics as a supportive adjunct to ameliorate ATT-induced ADRs. Future studies should focus on assessing long-term supplementation effects to investigate humanistic outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Sarcoidosis is a complex, multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, often presenting a diagnostic challenge due to its highly variable clinical manifestations and its overlap with infectious and neoplastic diseases. This is especially problematic in regions with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB), such as India, where the clinical and radiological features of sarcoidosis and TB can be remarkably similar. Early, accurate diagnosis is imperative to guide treatment and avoid inappropriate therapy, yet no universally accepted diagnostic scoring system exists. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a novel, composite clinical scoring tool named the Yuvarajan Sarcoidosis Diagnostic Score (YSDS) to aid in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis using routinely available clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and histopathologic parameters. A retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in South India. Medical records of 94 patients evaluated for suspected sarcoidosis between January 2022 and January 2025 were reviewed. Patients were categorized into sarcoidosis (n = 63) and non-sarcoidosis groups (n = 31) based on histopathological confirmation, radiological features, and exclusion of differential diagnoses. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant independent predictors of sarcoidosis. These predictors were used to create a weighted diagnostic score, and their diagnostic accuracy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Five independent predictors were identified: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) on chest imaging, elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, histologic presence of non-caseating granulomas, negative Mantoux test, and characteristic extrapulmonary manifestations such as uveitis, parotid gland enlargement, or lupus pernio. Each parameter was assigned a score based on the regression coefficient. The YSDS score ranged from 0 to 13, with a cutoff ≥8 yielding a sensitivity of 87.3% (55/63), specificity of 83.9% (26/31), positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.6% (55/61), negative predictive value (NPV) of 80.6% (26/33), and an overall accuracy of 85.9% (81/94). The area under the ROC curve was 0.90, indicating excellent discriminatory power. The YSDS is a statistically robust, easy-to-implement clinical tool that enhances diagnostic confidence in sarcoidosis, particularly in settings where TB and other granulomatous diseases are prevalent. It offers a promising strategy for standardized diagnostic assessment and warrants external validation in larger, prospective cohorts.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks tuberculosis (TB) as one of the top 10 causes of deaths worldwide. Notably, tobacco smoking represents a significant promoting factor in TB progression, being associated with poorer treatment outcomes, delayed conversion to negative smear or culture, and higher dropout rates from treatment plans. Remarkably, high rates of smoking and TB frequently overlaps in the same countries, warranting the need for targeted public health interventions. Prioritising smoking cessation is essential for smokers with TB, as sustained abstinence has been associated with reduced mortality and a more successful cure. This review examines the intricate relationship between cigarette smoking, smoking cessation therapies and anti-TB drugs, focusing on the impact of tobacco smoking compounds on liver detoxifying systems, such as influence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes mostly, and on metabolism of antituberculous medications. Integrating smoking cessation and TB treatment programmes must also take into account potential drug-drug interactions between smoking cessation medications and anti-TB drugs, a critical area for patient safety and effective TB management. This review article aims to provide healthcare professionals with the knowledge to better support TB patients who smoke or are intending to quit, to ensure tailored and effective treatment strategies, while highlighting gaps in current research and advocating for further studies to fill these gaps.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), particularly drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB), remains a major public health threat in China. Despite global efforts, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) complicates control strategies. Wenzhou, a densely populated coastal city, lacks localized data on TB drug resistance trends. This study analyzes DR-TB patterns (2014-2023) and identifies MDR-TB risk factors to inform targeted interventions. A retrospective study included 10,993 TB patients from Wenzhou Central Hospital. Sociodemographic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) data were extracted from the Tuberculosis Information Management System (TBIMS) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and hospital databases. Resistance definitions followed World Health Organization criteria. Trends in resistance rates and risk factors for MDR-TB were evaluated using chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression. Among 10,993 patients, 20.41% had DR-TB. Resistance rates in new patients were highest for isoniazid (12.15%) and streptomycin (10.89%), while retreated patients showed higher resistance to isoniazid (34.61%) and rifampicin (27.04%). The overall drug resistance rate of DR-TB decreased from 26.01% (2014) to 19.31% (2023), driven by a decline in retreated cases (64.19%-28.57%), whereas the proportion in new cases remained stable (∼18%). The proportion of MDR-TB in retreated patients fell from 47.30% to 18.37%, but increased slightly in new cases (2.51%-3.86%). Risk factors for MDR-TB included age <65 years (OR = 1.496-1.640), Han ethnicity (OR = 1.911), migrant status (OR = 1.296), unemployment (OR = 1.819), and prior TB treatment (OR = 7.513). Drug-resistant tuberculosis prevalence in Wenzhou declined over the decade, largely due to improved management of retreated cases. However, persistent primary DR-TB transmission among new patients highlights the need for enhanced active screening and targeted interventions. High-risk groups, including young people, individuals of Han ethnicity, migrants, unemployed individuals, and retreated patients, require prioritized attention in TB control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have a higher incidence of tuberculosis (TB)infection compared to the general healthy population. The use of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents for SLE management further elevates TB risk. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in SLE patients and explore risk factors for progression to active TB (ATB) in those with concurrent SLE and LTBI. We conducted a retrospective analysis of SLE patients treated at the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, between 2014 and 2023. During a five - year follow - up period, LTBI was detected in 122 patients (24.11%). Of these, 11 individuals (all from the subgroup of 108 patients who did not receive tuberculosis preventive treatment [TPT]) progressed to ATB. A comparative analysis between the 11 ATB cases and 111 non-progressing LTBI patients revealed significant differences: ATB cases showed higher cyclophosphamide (CTX) usage, elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, and less frequent hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)administration. These findings underscore the need for regular monitoring during prolonged CTX therapy, especially in moderate-to-high TB burden regions, and highlight the potential protective role of HCQ.",

        "abstract": "Rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) remains a major challenge to global TB control efforts. In Fujian Province, Southeast China, where RR-TB prevalence has been notably high, understanding epidemiological trends and treatment outcomes is crucial for optimizing interventions. This study aimed to analyze RR-TB characteristics, resistance patterns, and treatment outcomes to inform evidence-based control strategies. An observational study was conducted utilizing data from China's National Tuberculosis Information Management System, focusing on bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis cases reported in Fujian Province during 2019-2024. Epidemiological characteristics, drug resistance and outcomes of RR-TB were described as frequency (n) and percentage (%). Risk factors for unsuccessful outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. A total of 1,368 RR-TB patients were detected, with an overall resistance rate of 3.7%. The RR rate showed a steady decline year by year (<i>χ<sup>2</sup></i>  = 76.214, <i>p</i> < 0.001), mainly due to the decrease in new TB cases (<i>χ<sup>2</sup></i>  = 60.966, <i>p</i> < 0.001). RR-TB patients exhibited higher co-resistance to isoniazid (71.9% vs. 6.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and ofloxacin (29.8% vs. 1.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to rifampicin-sensitive TB. Of 1,056 RR-TB patients initiated on treatment, 720 had outcome data, revealing a low success rate (58.6%) due to high loss to follow-up (31.1%) and mortality (9.3%). Multivariate analysis identified male sex (<i>AOR</i> = 1.67, <i>95%</i> CI: 1.11-2.52, <i>p</i> = 0.014), age ≥45 years (<i>AOR</i> = 2.27, <i>95% CI:</i> 1.58-3.26, <i>p</i> < 0.001), high-risk group status (<i>AOR</i> = 1.42, <i>95% CI</i>: 1.04-1.94, <i>p</i> = 0.026), and occupation as farmer/worker (<i>AOR</i> = 2.17, <i>95% CI</i>: 1.10-4.26, <i>p</i> = 0.025) as independent risk factors of unsuccessful treatment. Fujian Province has demonstrated a steady decline in rifampicin resistance rates, primarily driven by reductions in new TB cases. However, treatment inclusion rate and success rate remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for targeted interventions-including enhanced adherence support, intensive follow-up, and adverse event management-particularly for high-risk groups such as older males and manual laborers. These findings can guide tailored strategies to further reduce RR-TB burden in similar settings.",

We leveraged the INPUT study to characterise the clinical presentations and factors associated with TB diagnosis and treatment success in children under 5 years in Cameroon and Kenya. We conducted a prospective cohort analysis nested in the INPUT study, implemented from May 2019 to June 2021 to assess the integration of paediatric TB services into child healthcare services. All children presenting in participating health facilities, presumed with TB and eligible to the INPUT study, were enrolled and followed up from diagnosis to treatment initiation and completion. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore factors associated with TB diagnosis. Of the 790 children enrolled in the cohort, 458 (58.0%) were aged <2 years; the most frequent suggestive TB symptoms were cough (76.5%), fever (34.9%), night sweats (21.2%), loss of appetite (33.5%) and fatigue (35.9%). Overall, 157 (19.9%) children were diagnosed with TB disease, including 13/157 (8.3%) bacteriologically confirmed and 84/157 (53.5%) with a chest radiography evocative of TB. In multivariable analysis, living in rural area (aOR 1.9; 95% CI (1.1 to 3.5)), presenting with fever >10 days (aOR 1.8; 95% CI (1.1 to 3.1)), having HIV (aOR 3.9; 95% CI (1.7 to 8.9)), presenting with acute malnutrition (aOR 2.8; 95% CI (1.5 to 5.2)), living with someone coughing in the household for more than 2 weeks (aOR 1.8; 95% CI (1.0 to 3.0)) and presenting with peripheral lymphadenitis (aOR 9.5; 95% CI (4.3 to 20.9)) were significantly associated with TB diagnosis in children under 5 years with signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. All children diagnosed with TB were initiated on treatment; 136 (86.6%) achieved treatment success according to WHO definition. In the context of integrated, decentralised evaluation of paediatric TB in the INPUT study, most TB diagnoses in children under 5 years old were made clinically-radiologically. Decentralised strategies enhancing the clinical diagnosis, including repeated capacitation of clinicians to the use of treatment decision algorithms and increased access to chest radiography, could overcome underdiagnosis of paediatric TB.

        "abstract": "Establishing efficacy benchmarks in preclinical tuberculosis (TB) models is essential for optimizing and prioritizing therapeutic regimens. However, standardized classification methods for comparing high-performing regimens are currently lacking. This study defines a quantitative framework utilizing rifampicin-based regimens in a high-burden aerosol BALB/c mouse model, incorporating both male and female mice to assess potential sex-specific treatment responses. Mice were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Erdman strain and treated for 4 or 8 weeks with rifampicin (R), rifampicin plus pyrazinamide (RZ), or rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide (RHZ). Treatments were administered orally five days a week. The bacterial burden in the lungs and spleens was quantified by CFU enumeration. Pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed drug exposures. To establish classification benchmarks, treatment efficacy was evaluated using quartile performance thresholds and Cohen's d effect size analysis. All regimens reduced lung CFUs compared to controls. RHZ demonstrated a high benchmark, achieving mean reductions of 3 ± 0.5 Log<sub>10</sub> CFUs at 4 weeks and 4 ± 0.4 Log<sub>10</sub> CFUs at 8 weeks, with clearance below detection limits in most mice. The R and RZ regimens achieved intermediate reductions. No statistically significant sex differences in bacterial clearance were observed. Pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed equivalent drug exposures across sexes. Quartile ranking (> 75th percentile) and Cohen's d calculations (Cohen's d > 15) consistently classified RHZ as the benchmark high-performing regimen at both time points, showing exceptional efficacy. This study establishes a quantitative framework for evaluating TB treatments in a preclinical high-burden BALB/c mouse model. The dual-metric classification framework provides sex-inclusive, quantitative performance criteria that enhance the translational relevance of preclinical efficacy studies. This approach sets relative benchmarks that support the comparative evaluation of novel regimens and helps to align preclinical performance with clinical expectations.",

There is an urgent medical need to develop new drugs that shorten the treatment duration to combat widespread multi-drug-resistant and extensive-drug-resistant Mtb. Here, we present a preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, that contains an aryl fluorosulfate (SuFEx)<sup>2</sup> warhead and uniquely targets the acyltransferase domain of Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis. CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection. Inhibition by CMX410 is irreversible through a previously undescribed mechanism: CMX410 reacts with the catalytic serine of the AT domain of Pks13, rapidly and irreversibly disabling the active site by forming a β-lactam. CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens.",

Here, we present the overall results of the entire population of U-ENDURE (N = 673). Clinical responders to 12 weeks of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) induction were randomized (1:1:1) to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 221), upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 229), or placebo (N = 223) as maintenance therapy for 52 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 52. Safety was assessed through week 52. At week 52, more upadacitinib-treated versus placebo patients achieved CDAI clinical remission (upadacitinib 15 mg, 36.2% and upadacitinib 30 mg, 51.5% versus placebo, 15.2%). The rates of endoscopic response were 27.3% for upadacitinib 15 mg and 40.7% for upadacitinib 30 mg vs 7.2% for placebo. Exposure-adjusted event rates for treatment-emergent adverse events were numerically lower with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg versus placebo (351.3 and 324.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively, versus 462.8 per 100 patient-years) except for COVID-19 and adverse events leading to early discontinuation of study treatment. No deaths, active tuberculosis, lymphoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, adjudicated major cardiovascular adverse events, or venous thromboembolic events were reported from any treatment group. Herpes zoster infections occurred more frequently in the upadacitinib groups compared to placebo; all were non-serious and most involved a single dermatome. Consistent with the primary analysis, upadacitinib was more efficacious than placebo in achieving clinical and endoscopic endpoints in patients with Crohn's disease.

However, it remains challenging to determine the direct targets of a drug and which disrupted cellular processes lead to bacterial killing. We developed a computational tool, DECIPHAER (decoding cross-modal information of pharmacologies via autoencoders), to select the important correlated transcriptional and morphological responses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to treatment. By finding a reduced feature space, DECIPHAER highlighted essential features of cellular damage. DECIPHAER provides cell-death-relevant insight into uni-modal datasets, enabling interrogation of drug treatment responses for which transcriptional data are unavailable. Using morphological data alone with DECIPHAER, we discovered that respiration inhibition by the polypharmacological drugs SQ109 and BM212 can influence cell death more than their effects on the cell wall.

        "abstract": "Despite the potential of digital adherence technologies to support patient-centered monitoring for tuberculosis (TB), there is limited research on incorporating indirect and direct adherence monitoring or assessing patients' experiences with these technologies. The TB Treatment Support Tools (TB-TST) includes a comprehensive mobile app for patients and health care providers and a direct adherence metabolite test to report and monitor adherence. This paper describes the iterative refinement process of the TB-TST intervention. To refine the TB-TST intervention, we used an iterative approach involving multiple embedded mixed methods studies guided by the Information Systems Research framework and Design Thinking Process. Embedded studies included a randomized controlled pilot study, interviews, usability testing, and surveys with patients and experts to inform ongoing refinements. The project consisted of interface evaluation, high-level system design, and iterative redesign. The TB-TST intervention was refined through 3 iterative phases. In Phase 1, based on feedback from pilot study participants and 4 experts in TB, improvements included an in-app discussion board, submission confirmations, and enhanced account recovery. Cultural adaptation was based on Hofstede's dimensions. Phase 2 involved 4 Directed Research Groups and 19 stakeholders to redesign user flows, simplify reporting, and transition the app to a progressive web app, improving device compatibility. Phase 3 included usability testing cycles with 48 participants (26 patients and 22 health care professionals), yielding high satisfaction scores: patient app Mobile Health App Usability Questionnaire, mean 5.96 (SD 0.46); provider mobile dashboard IT Usability Evaluation Scale scores ranged from 5.83 to 6.23 out of 7, and optimization of interface and dashboard. Refinements included larger icons, streamlined onboarding, symptom summary enhancements, and a new cohort-level adherence graph. These modifications improved navigation, usability, and remote monitoring for patients with TB and providers in preparation for a multisite clinical trial. Combining multiple methods guided by the Information Systems Research framework and elements of the Design Thinking Process can help researchers and developers leverage the strengths of mixed methods iterative designs to create highly personalized and effective digital health interventions.",

        "abstract": "<b>Introduction.</b> This study underscores the critical role of identifying heteroresistant infections of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) in enhancing the diagnostics of tuberculosis (TB). These conditions complicate diagnostics and treatment, underlining the need for advanced techniques to detect and characterize resistant populations effectively.<b>Hypothesis/Gap statement.</b> Current diagnostics may fail to identify heteroresistance and mixed infections, limiting the understanding of their impact on treatment outcomes.<b>Aim.</b> This pilot study aimed to phenotypically and genotypically characterize rifampicin-heteroresistant clinical isolates and assess their genetic diversity and resistance patterns.<b>Methodology.</b> A retrospective analysis of 2,917 Mtb genomes from Peru (1999-2020) was conducted using MTBseq and TB-Profiler. Techniques included indirect microscopic observation drug susceptibility, MIC determination via tetrazolium microplate assay, agar proportion method and sequencing. From each clinical isolate, three colonies were isolated from both rifampicin-supplemented (1 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and drug-free media for subsequent phenotypic and genotypic characterization, including <i>rpoB</i> sequencing.<b>Results.</b> Of the 2,917 genomes analysed, 14.6% were classified as mixed infections, 3.8% exhibited heteroresistance to at least 1 drug between 21 antibiotics analysed and 0.79% were rifampicin-heteroresistant. Colonies from rifampicin-supplemented media displayed high resistance (MIC >1 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>) with mutations such as S450L in the RpoB protein. In contrast, those from drug-free media exhibited sensitivity to rifampicin (MIC <1 µg ml<sup>-1</sup>), harbouring other RpoB mutations including D435Y, L452P and L430P. Notably, some colonies retained WT RpoB sequences, suggesting a diversity of subpopulations within isolates.<b>Conclusion.</b> Whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic analysis confirmed the coexistence of rifampicin-susceptible and rifampicin-resistant Mtb populations within single clinical isolates. Subculturing in drug-free media favoured the selection of sensitive strains, emphasizing the critical need for advanced diagnostic tools to accurately detect and characterize heteroresistant and mixed infections.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the research trends, patterns of opportunistic infections in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their impact on patient management strategies, especially in the context of the widespread use of DMARDs. Research papers on RA and opportunistic infections were analysed by performing a literature search in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, covering the period from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2023. Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOS viewer and Cite Space software, including country and institution analyses, journal and co-citation journal analyses, author and co-citation author analyses, and key word co-occurrence and clustering analyses. Two hundred and ninety-three research papers were analysed, and it was found that research publications on RA-associated opportunistic infections have shown a general upward trend over the past three decades, with a significant increase especially between 2007 and 2021. Japan, the United States, and China have the highest research output in this area, with institutions such as Yang Ming University and Taichung Veterans General Hospital being more active. Key word analysis revealed 'infection', 'risk', 'treatment', and 'infliximab' as research hotspots. Cluster analysis showed that tuberculosis, latent tuberculosis infection and hepatitis B virus were the focus of attention. Research on opportunistic infections in RA has shown a clear trend of growth and extensive international collaboration, reflecting a deep understanding of the risk of opportunistic infections in RA patients treated with DMARDs. Future studies should strengthen the identification of high-risk patient groups, the use of biomarkers, the balance of safety and efficacy in treatment regimens, and patient education to promote the optimisation of RA management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Isolated splenic tuberculosis (TB) is rare. Here, we report a case of isolated splenic TB in a 70-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patient presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of epigastric pain and hematemesis. For RA treatment, a combination of methotrexate (8 mg) and baricitinib (4 mg) had been initiated 2 years prior. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and intrasplenic involvement. Following endoscopic hemostasis, we performed endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration via the stomach due to suspected pancreatic cancer. At an outpatient follow-up visit 1 month later, fever and elevated C-reactive protein (9.02 mg/dL) levels were observed. CT imaging showed enlarged necrotic lymph nodes near the gastroesophageal junction, left mesentery of the colon, and the greater curvature of the pylorus, along with an increased low-density area in the spleen. Subsequently, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and ultrasound-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytology were performed. Cultures from the abscesses tested positive for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, which was susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. No lesions were identified, thus confirming a diagnosis of isolated splenic TB. Oral anti-TB treatment with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) was initiated. After 6 months of treatment, the splenic lesions had shrunk. Nine months after completing therapy, RA treatment was resumed without relapse. Therefore, early diagnosis and anti-TB treatment can successfully manage splenic TB without requiring splenectomy.",

        "abstract": "Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after open window thoracostomy effectively reduces empyema cavity volume, but fistula control remains challenging in cases of bronchopleural/alveolopleural fistula. We report the successful treatment of chronic tuberculous empyema with bronchopleural and/or alveolopleural fistulas through primary closure during thoracostomy, combined with simultaneous NPWT. A woman in her 90s, with a history of left upper lobectomy (60 years prior), developed chronic tuberculous empyema with a cutaneous fistula. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed an air-containing empyema cavity with surrounding pneumonia. Despite spontaneous cutaneous fistula closure, thoracic drainage confirmed an air leak, and <i>Mycobacterium</i> <i>tuberculosis</i> was isolated. Open window thoracostomy was performed with fourth-ninth rib resection (20 cm incision), alveolopleural fistula coverage using a pedicled serratus anterior flap, and cavity volume reduction with latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior flaps. NPWT commenced on postoperative day 3, continuing for six weeks after negative foam cultures. The empyema cavity decreased by 88.8%, from 118.2 cm³ to 13.2 cm³, facilitating gauze-based wound care and enabling patient transfer on day 65. Primary fistula closure during open window thoracostomy enables early implementation of NPWT, facilitating marked cavity reduction in chronic tuberculous empyema with fistula and representing a novel therapeutic strategy.",

This distinct morphology arises from enlarged mediastinal adenopathy, specifically involving lymph nodes such as those in the subcarinal or right paratracheal areas, which encircle the adjacent airway or esophagus. We report the case of a 55-year-old female who presented with a constellation of non-specific constitutional symptoms, including chronic cough, significant weight loss, diminished appetite, and recurrent evening fevers. Diagnostic imaging revealed extensive mediastinal adenopathy that bore a striking resemblance to the classic \"Medu Vada\" configuration. Subsequent investigations confirmed a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this specific imaging pattern, which we propose to formally name the \"Medu Vada sign,\" as it can serve as a valuable clue in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal pathology, particularly in areas where tuberculosis is endemic.",

        "abstract": "The global burden of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the rise of drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M. tuberculosis</i>), underscores the need for alternative intervention strategies. One promising approach is to block the infection at its earliest stage-bacterial adhesion to host cells-thereby preventing colonization and transmission without exerting selective pressure. Adhesins, surface-exposed molecules mediating this critical interaction, have therefore emerged as attractive targets for early prevention. This review outlines the infection process driven by bacterial adhesion and describes the architecture of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> outer envelope, emphasizing components that contribute to host interaction. We comprehensively summarize both non-protein and protein adhesins, detailing their host receptors, biological roles, and experimental evidence. Recent progress in the computational prediction of adhesins, particularly neural network-based tools like SPAAN, is also discussed, highlighting its potential to accelerate adhesin discovery. Additionally, we present a detailed, generalized workflow for predicting <i>M. tuberculosis</i> adhesins, which synthesizes current approaches and provides a comprehensive framework for future studies. Targeting bacterial adhesion presents a therapeutic strategy that interferes with the early stages of infection while minimizing the risk of developing drug resistance. Consequently, anti-adhesion strategies may serve as valuable complements to conventional therapies and support the development of next-generation TB vaccines and treatments.",

        "abstract": "The distinctive nature of ferroptosis is that it is induced chemically and signifies a regulated cell death dependent on iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. The mechanism of ferroptosis involves oxidative damage to the membrane lipids. It differs from apoptosis and necroptosis, triggering metabolic changes in the iron-lipid homeostasis and antioxidant defense, such as glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Herein, the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and its role in the tumorigenesis process and infection-related diseases are presented. It also discusses metabolic reprogramming as a factor that modifies the levels of cell-sensitizing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), iron dysregulation, and oxidative stress in aggressive cancers and inflammatory diseases such as sepsis, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Particular attention is given to chemical modulators of ferroptosis, including synthetic inducers and inhibitors, as well as bioactive natural compounds. Our focus is on the significance of analytical tools, such as lipidomics and metabolomics, in understanding the phenomenon of ferroptosis. Finally, we explore novel therapeutic approaches targeting ferroptosis in cancer and infectious diseases, while navigating both the opportunities and challenges in drug development. The review then draws on chemical biology and disease pathology to propose promising areas of study for ferroptosis-related therapies.",

        "abstract": "The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine confers broad, non-specific immunity that may bolster defenses against respiratory viruses. While NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2)-driven pathways are central to innate immune responses, the contribution of surface receptor modulation on monocytes to shaping these responses remains underexplored. We analyzed whole-blood cultures from BCG-vaccinated Polish children, stratified by serostatus to SARS-CoV-2 and RSV, and stimulated for 48 h with live BCG, purified viral antigens, or both. RT-qPCR quantified mRNA levels of NOD2 and key cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF), while flow cytometry assessed CD14, HLA-DR, CD11b, and CD206 expression. Co-stimulation with BCG + RSV elicited the strongest transcriptional response, notably a 2-4-fold upregulation of NOD2, IL-1β, and IL-6 versus RSV alone. In SARS-CoV-2(+) donors, RSV alone induced higher NOD2 expression than BCG or BCG + RSV, while IL-2 peaked following BCG + SARS-CoV-2. Across conditions, NOD2 positively correlated with IL-4 and IL-6 but negatively correlated with IL-1β in SARS-CoV-2 cultures. Viral antigens increased CD14 and HLA-DR on monocytes, suggesting activation; CD206 rose only in dual-seropositive children. Our findings indicate that BCG stimulation affects pediatric antiviral immunity through NOD2-related cytokine production and induction of a CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> phenotype, supporting its potential role in boosting innate defenses against respiratory pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be distributed in various bodily fluids, such as serum and urine, and play an essential role in immune regulation, substance transport, and other aspects. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>), which places a tremendous burden on public health prevention and control within society. Researchers are committed to developing various diagnoses and treatment plans to eliminate TB effectively. The results of some studies conducted to date demonstrate that the serum EVs of TB patients, which carry components related to <i>Mtb</i>, can be used as relevant markers for TB detection and improve diagnostic efficiency. However, no relevant reports exist on the particular physiological functions such EVs perform, thus warranting further exploration. In this study, we collected serum EVs from both healthy individuals and TB patients. After identifying the morphology, concentration, and expression of classic markers (CD63, CD81, and CD9) of EVs, we explored their physiological functions at the cellular level and their physiological functions and effects on BCG colonization in the lungs at the mouse level. It was found that EVs were abundant in TB patients and healthy individuals, and the number of CD63 and CD9 markers co-expressed on the surface of serum EVs in healthy individuals was greater than that in TB patients. Serum EVs in patients with TB can stimulate cells to secrete more immune cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, compared with those in healthy individuals; induce an increase in the M1/M2 ratio of macrophages in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of mice; and inhibit the colonization of <i>Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Guérin</i> (BCG) in the lungs of mice. In addition, they can inhibit the occurrence of inflammatory responses in the lung tissue of mice. The above results suggest that serum EVs in TB patients may exert their physiological function by regulating immune responses. This finding also indicates that exploring serum EVs in TB patients with regard to their physiological functions shows excellent potential.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Blood-borne inflammatory ratios have been proposed as inexpensive prognostic tools across a range of diseases, but their role in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains uncertain. In this retrospective case-control analysis, we explored whether composite indices derived from routine haematology-namely the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and a novel CRP-Fibrinogen Index (CFI)-could enhance risk stratification beyond established cytokine measurements among Romanian adults with culture-confirmed pulmonary T. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Data were drawn from 80 consecutive TB in-patients and 50 community controls. Full blood counts, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and four multiplex cytokines were extracted from electronic records, and composite indices were calculated according to standard formulas. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality within 90 days and length of stay (LOS). <i>Results</i>: Among TB patients, the median NLR was 3.70 (IQR 2.54-6.14), PLR was 200 (140-277) and SII was 1.36 × 10<sup>6</sup> µL<sup>-1</sup> (0.74-2.34 × 10<sup>6</sup>), compared with 1.8 (1.4-2.3), 117 (95-140) and 0.46 × 10<sup>6</sup> µL<sup>-1</sup> (0.30-0.60 × 10<sup>6</sup>) in controls. Those with SII above the cohort median exhibited more pronounced acute-phase responses (median CRP 96 vs. 12 mg L<sup>-1</sup>; fibrinogen 578 vs. 458 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>), yet median LOS remained virtually identical (29 vs. 28 days) and early mortality was low in both groups (8% vs. 2%). The CFI showed no clear gradient in hospital stay across its quartiles, and composite ratios-while tightly inter-correlated-demonstrated only minimal association with cytokine levels and LOS. <i>Conclusions</i>: Composite cell-count indices were markedly elevated but did not predict early death or prolonged admission. In low-event European cohorts, their chief value may lie in serving as cost-free gatekeepers, flagging those who should proceed to more advanced cytokine or genomic testing. Although routine reporting of NLR and SII may support low-cost surveillance, validation in larger, multicentre cohorts with serial sampling is needed before these indices can be integrated into clinical decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Rifaximin (RFX) has recently been suggested as an alternative treatment option for Clostridioides difficile infection. This study reports the survey on RFX susceptibility within a C. difficile test cohort that represents the five clinically relevant phylogenetic clades. Agar dilution assays were conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of RFX for 129 clinical C. difficile isolates from Germany (86), Indonesia (29), and Ghana (14). Genome sequence data were obtained for 50 representative isolates, including all those with a minimum inhibitory concentration MIC[RFX] of ≥ 32.0 µg/mL, to identify the underlying rpoB gene resistance alleles, determine the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (STs), and infer phylogenetic relatedness. 10.1% of the isolates were found to be resistant to RFX. The resistance rate varies by region, with 4.7% in Germany, 27.6% in Indonesia, and 7.1% in Ghana. Three distinct rpoB alleles were associated with RFX resistance. The presence of a specific rpoB allele correlates with the MLST-based ST of the isolate, indicating that the rifaximin-resistant isolates belong to phylogenetic clades 1, 2, and 4. These isolates are represented by six different ribotypes: 010, 017, 027, 046, 084, and 131. Furthermore, we identified seven amino acid substitutions resulting from SNPs in the rpoB gene through alignment analysis. These substitutions are found in both RFX-resistant and susceptible isolates, suggesting that they are neutral mutations in relation to RFX susceptibility. These observations also indicate that RFX resistance arose independently in different clades. A substantial rate of RFX resistance, particularly among Indonesian isolates, was observed. This may be attributed to the prolonged use of rifampicin, especially in the treatment of tuberculosis. RFX resistance has been linked to specific amino acid substitutions in the β-subunit of RNA polymerase encoded by the rpoB gene. To the best of our knowledge, one of the identified RFX resistance-associated rpoB alleles (H502N, R505K, I750M) has not been previously described, whereupon, the amino acid substitutions I750M as well as I750V, E1037Q, A1205V, N1207A, A1208T, and D1232E were identified as neutral mutations that do not confer resistance to RFX.",

Inhibition of KasA could disrupt the integrity of the mycobacterial cell wall, which is crucial for its survival and virulence. In this study, we screened a library of 730 Molluscan metabolites using molecular docking techniques via the Glide tool, identifying ten compounds with significant binding affinities ranging from - 7.535 to -6.517 kcal/mol. The ADMET profiles of these compounds were evaluated, revealing acceptable toxicity levels for four selected candidates: CMNPD7125, CMNPD22991, CMNPD4542, and CMNPD12265. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of these compounds within the KasA binding pocket, reinforcing their potential as effective inhibitors. This integrated approach combining molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and dynamic simulations advances the search for innovative treatments against drug-resistant TB and supports rational drug design efforts for future anti-tubercular agents.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with stigma, mental health issues, and alcohol use significantly affecting treatment outcomes. Stigma delays TB diagnosis, reduces treatment adherence, and disrupts care continuity. Mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, further undermine adherence, whereas alcohol use accelerates TB disease progression and leads to poor treatment outcomes. Current TB care models in SSA lack integrated support for psychosocial and behavioral health needs. This article advocates for a comprehensive care model that integrates mental health screening, counseling, psychosocial support, alcohol use disorder screening, and harm reduction strategies into TB programs. Effective implementation requires collaboration among TB care providers, mental health specialists, and alcohol use counselors supported by research, provider training, and community engagement. By addressing stigma, mental health, and alcohol use, this model can enhance treatment adherence and outcomes, advancing the WHO's End TB Strategy in SSA.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide each year. Traditional diagnostic methods primarily rely on light and fluorescence microscopy. However, the low sensitivity of light microscopy and the high cost and complexity associated with fluorescence microscopy limit their effectiveness in resource-limited settings. This study presents the design of an alternative sensing platform capable of detecting TB cells with enhanced sensitivity. The system leverages the natural autofluorescence (AF) signal emitted from Mycobacterium cells. The key innovation of the proposed platform is the integration of an onboard heating element, that significantly amplifies the AF signal, allowing detection at concentrations as low as 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml. The designed platform is standalone, low-cost, and compact and built around a smartphone. Housed within a 3D-printed enclosure, it ensures portability and ease of use-making it suitable for deployment in resourced limited environment. The proposed system holds promise to develop as an alternative platform for TB diagnosis in areas where access to advanced healthcare facilities is still very limited.",

        "abstract": "We asked if SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in HIV/TB co-infected patients plays a role in precipitating active tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals and alters inflammatory status. A prospective study was conducted on HIV/TB co-infected patients presenting with pulmonary (<i>n</i> = 20) or extrapulmonary (<i>n</i> = 12) tuberculosis. Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG kits assessed the presence of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies. Inflammatory markers viz. osteopontin, total and full-length galectin-9, and C-reactive protein were tested at baseline and the end of antituberculosis treatment. The inflammatory score (INS) was assessed based on the percentage of reduction in the inflammatory markers' levels at the end of the treatment. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in five male patients diagnosed with pulmonary (<i>n</i> = 2) and extrapulmonary (<i>n</i> = 3) TB. None of them reported symptomatic COVID-19. Inflammatory marker levels did not differ significantly at baseline compared to those in seronegative patients. However, the INS correlated negatively with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (<i>r</i> = -0.386, <i>p</i> = 0.039), indicating persistently raised inflammatory markers in these patients at the end of the treatment compared to seronegative individuals. Among the four markers studied, total galectin-9 levels failed to decrease significantly in these patients (<i>p</i> = 0.030). The majority of HIV/TB co-infected patients enrolled in our study (84.5%) were SARS-CoV-2-seronegative, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection might not have played a role in precipitating TB reactivation.",

        "abstract": "Prior clinical trials established the safety, but not the efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conducted a prospective, double-blind, multi-center randomized phase 2b clinical trial of one dose of intravenous MSCs (10 x 10<sup>6</sup>/kg predicted body weight) versus placebo in 120 ventilated patients with ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> < 250 mmHg). The primary endpoint was change in oxygenation index (OI) over 36 hours from baseline. Enrollment began in January 2020. Due to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the majority of subjects (101/120, 84%) developed ARDS from COVID-19. There were no significant baseline differences in severity of illness between patients treated with MSCs and those who received placebo in the entire cohort of 120 patients or in the 101 patients with COVID-19 ARDS. There was no difference in the primary endpoint of change in oxygenation index from baseline over 36 hours after study product administration for the entire cohort or the COVID-19 subgroup, nor were there significant differences in mortality at 14, 28, 60 or 180 days. Plasma protein biomarker and gene expression analyses identified sub-groups of patients with differential treatment responses in terms of clinical outcomes. This phase 2b clinical trial identified no physiologic or clinical benefit from a single dose of MSCs in patients with ARDS, including those with COVID-19 ARDS. In future trials, baseline plasma biological markers may help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from MSCs therapy.

        "abstract": "Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that simultaneously detects tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. This review updates a comparative accuracy Cochrane review of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra as Xpert Ultra has replaced Xpert MTB/RIF. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents with presumptive tuberculosis based on signs or symptoms or with an abnormal chest x-ray suggestive of tuberculosis. We searched seven databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, plus two trial registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP) to 16 October 2023 without language restrictions. A WHO Public Call for ongoing and unpublished studies was made between 30 November 2023 and 15 February 2024. We included cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that provided data on the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra using respiratory specimens in adolescents (aged 10 to 14 years) and adults (aged 15 years and older) with presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis. For pulmonary tuberculosis detection, the reference standards were culture and a composite reference standard. For rifampicin resistance, the reference standards were culture-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing with or without whole genome sequencing. Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardised form. We assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2. We performed meta-analyses using a bivariate model to produce summary sensitivities and specificities, separately for pulmonary tuberculosis detection and rifampicin resistance detection. We performed subgroup analyses by smear status, HIV status, and history of tuberculosis. We summarised Xpert Ultra trace-positive results. Pulmonary tuberculosis detection For detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity against culture were 90.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.2 to 92.7) and 94.8% (95% CI 92.8 to 96.3) (32 studies, 12,529 participants; high-certainty evidence). Most studies had low risk of bias in all QUADAS-2 domains. If the point estimates for Xpert Ultra are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people, where 100 of those presenting with symptoms have pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra will miss nine cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis would be 47. In people living with HIV, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% (82.0 to 91.7) and 95.3% (92.2 to 97.2) (11 studies, 1164 participants). Amongst people with smear-negative, culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 80.7% (75.4 to 85.0) and 94.0% (91.3 to 95.9) (16 studies, 6460 participants). In people with a history of tuberculosis, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 84.8% (78.2 to 89.7) and 86.2% (78.9 to 91.3) (9 studies, 809 participants). The proportion of Ultra trace-positive results that were true positives compared to the microbiological reference standard was 38.8%. Reclassifying trace-positive results as Xpert Ultra-negative led to a reduction in sensitivity and modest increase in specificity. Rifampicin resistance detection For detection of rifampicin resistance, Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 95.8% (93.2 to 97.4) and 98.3% (97.0 to 99.0) (10 studies, 1644 participants; high-certainty evidence). Most studies had low risk of bias in all QUADAS-2 domains. If the point estimates for Xpert Ultra are applied to a hypothetical cohort of 1000 people, where 100 of those presenting with symptoms have rifampicin resistance, Xpert Ultra will miss four cases. The number of people wrongly diagnosed with rifampicin resistance would be 16 out of the 900 who do not have rifampicin resistance. Xpert Ultra performed similarly, for rifampicin resistance, in people with smear-positive and smear-negative tuberculosis. Xpert Ultra has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis rifampicin resistance. Xpert Ultra for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis has lower sensitivity in people with smear-negative/culture-positive tuberculosis and lower sensitivity and specificity in people with a history of tuberculosis. Xpert Ultra trace-positive results were common. Strengths of this review include the approach to identifying relevant studies, the number of studies and participants included in this systematic review, and that most studies were at low risk of bias. The small number of studies (six) and participants who were adolescents is a limitation to our accuracy estimates in this age group. Xpert Ultra testing provides accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of treatment for rifampicin-resistant and multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis. The WHO supported this systematic review.

Donor-derived tuberculosis usually presents sooner than reactivation tuberculosis, and the most common finding is fever. We present 3 cases of donor-derived tuberculosis in the recipients of 2 kidneys and 1 liver from the same donor, who presented with unexplained fevers occurring 4-5 weeks after transplantation. Initial antibacterial therapy failed in all 3 patients, leading to further testing, which identified <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by culture and molecular studies. All recipients successfully received tuberculosis therapy but had significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays.

The common symptoms of ear tuberculosis include otorrhea, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis, and if left untreated, it can lead to complete deafness. Diagnosing ear tuberculosis can be challenging, as its symptoms often overlap with those of otitis media, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for a favorable prognosis. Delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment can result in severe complications, including irreversible hearing loss and chronic ear problems. Therefore, raising awareness among healthcare providers about the clinical features and diagnostic approach to ear tuberculosis is critical for improving patient outcomes. This study presents the case of a 28-year-old patient with tuberculous otitis media (TOM), presenting with otorrhea, hearing loss, and facial paralysis. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review of 492 records published over the past decade in PubMed and the Web of Science databases was conducted.

        "abstract": "The prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is on the rise worldwide. The diagnosis of NTM lung disease (NTM-LD) is a dilemma. The 2020 guidelines jointly established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) outline the criteria for diagnosing pulmonary NTM disease. Herein, we report a series of cases with an analysis of relevant literature to gain insight into the pathogenicity of NTM species, the risk factors involved, and treatment strategies. This is a prospective observational study starting from April 2023 to December 2023. A total of 370 suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients were included. Clinical specimens were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen staining, GeneXpert <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB)/RIF assay, and culture. Culture-positive mycobacteria were classified as MTB complex or NTM based on detection of MPT64 antigen. The NTM isolates were speciated by line probe assay using GenoType<sup>®</sup> Mycobacterium common mycobacteria (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany). The criteria of ATS/IDSA were applied to confirm NTM-LD. Nine (<i>n</i> = 9) patients were diagnosed as cases of NTM-LD. Bronchiectasis and previous TB were the most common comorbidities. <i>Mycobacterium scrofulaceum</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>Mycobacterium szulgai</i> (<i>n</i> = 2), <i>Mycobacterium intracellulare</i> (<i>n</i> = 1), <i>Mycobacterium kansasii</i> (<i>n</i> = 1), <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> (<i>n</i> = 1), <i>Mycobacterium fortuitum</i> (<i>n</i> = 1), and <i>Mycobacterium interjectum</i> (<i>n</i> = 1) were the species involved. Specific therapeutic drug regimens were administered in four cases, which resulted in clinical improvement. People with comorbid (LDs) are at risk of NTM-LD. The severity of NTM-LD and mortality also depend on the species involved. New guidelines with evidence-based recommendations should be formulated to simplify the diagnosis and treatment of NTM-LD caused by an array of more than 190 species.",

        "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease with a high risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection, especially in those living in TB-endemic areas. Isoniazid (INH), an anti-tuberculosis drug, is recommended as preventive therapy in TB susceptible groups, however, its use in SLE is still controversial. SLE patients are more likely to have compromised liver function which can influence the kinetic of INH. The aim of the study was to explore the pharmacokinetic profile of INH and acetylator status in SLE patients. This was a descriptive observational study with a purposive sampling technique, including adult female SLE at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital Bandung, conducted in January - August 2023. Inclusion criteria were SLE patients in remission with no TB infection; whereas the exclusion criteria were INH allergy, liver or kidney disorders, pregnant or lactating patients, and malignancy. Pharmacokinetic data was collected from six blood collection time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 hours) after 10 days of daily INH 300 mg administration on an empty stomach. In total, 20 female SLE patients were included. The C<sub>max</sub> value was 8.73 (2.55-18.27) mg/L and AUC<sub>0-24</sub> was 28.01 (8.82-79.40) mg.h/L. In terms of pharmacokinetic features, preventive isoniazid (INH) daily use of 300mg in SLE is sufficient to provide the prospect of protection from TB. These findings suggest that INH prophylaxis may be a viable strategy for TB prevention in SLE patients, warranting further investigation into long-term safety and efficacy.",

During the conflict, the health system fragmentation under differing geopolitical control led to unequal access to TB prevention, diagnostics and management social determinants such as poverty, malnutrition, inadequate water and sanitation, and lack of proper shelter, along with risks associated with disadvantaged groups, including internally displaced people, detainees, former detainees, and rural communities, not only increase the risk of TB transmission and the activation of latent infections but also hinder active case finding. Tackling these risks requires re-establishing the National TB Program (NTP) across the country, which acts equitably across all geographical areas to identify new cases, support robust surveillance activities, ensure drug resistance is identified promptly, and monitor treatment. Leadership from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, with support from other stakeholders e.g., humanitarian, civil society or private sector can support the NTP and optimize health worker education and referral pathways. Beyond this, addressing the social determinants, which contribute to TB in Syria, is an essential component of TB control in post-conflict Syria.",

Elevated ADA levels in pleural have been shown to correlate with inflammatory exudates, making it a valuable biomarker for differentiating between inflammatory and non-inflammatory effusions. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated the treatment function of ADA in inflammation- related pleural effusion syndrome.

It is particularly prevalent in the first 10 days postpartum, a period when women are more prone to developing this condition. The right ovarian vein is often affected due to its tortuous nature and less competent valves. OVT presents similarly to acute abdominal conditions, such as acute appendicitis, especially when the right ovarian vein is involved. Given the overlap in clinical presentation, diagnosis requires high-quality imaging techniques and a high degree of suspicion. Herein, we report a rare case of OVT in a young postpartum female who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen. The patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. A provisional diagnosis of a perforated appendix was made, and a lower midline exploratory laparotomy was planned. During surgery, the appendix and intestines appeared normal, but a distended and thrombosed right ovarian vein was found. The affected ovarian vein was excised, and the patient was placed on anticoagulants postoperatively. The recovery was unremarkable, and anticoagulants were continued for six months. OVT is most commonly seen in the early postpartum period, especially within the first 10 days. Due to its anatomical characteristics, the right ovarian vein is more commonly involved. The clinical presentation of OVT can closely mimic acute abdomen or acute appendicitis, making diagnosis challenging. Accurate diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and advanced imaging techniques to differentiate OVT from other conditions with similar presentations.",

The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA.

Understanding the risk factors for TB and its unsuccessful treatment is essential for guiding effective interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the association of sociodemographic and clinical factors with TB occurrence and to identify predictors of unsuccessful TB treatment outcomes among patients in Davao City. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 521 patients diagnosed with drug-susceptible TB at Davao Chest Center between January 2021 and May 2024. The sociodemographic and clinical profiles of the patients were described using descriptive statistics. Chi-square tests were used to assess the associations between sociodemographic and clinical variables with TB risk and treatment outcomes. The patient cohort was predominantly aged 31-50 years (n = 201, 38.58%), male (n = 284, 54.51%), and married (n = 285, 54.70%), with most residing in Districts I and II (n = 98, 38% each), and had no previous TB treatment (n = 344, 66.03%). Among the 456 patients assessed for comorbidities, 56.14% (n = 256) had at least one comorbidity. Evaluation of the risk factors for TB occurrence among the study population revealed that comorbidity status was not significantly associated with an increased risk of TB diagnosis (<i>p</i> = 0.682). However, among patients diagnosed with TB, the presence of comorbidities was significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes (<i>p</i> = 0.003). Although sociodemographic factors did not significantly influence TB risk or treatment outcomes, the presence of comorbidities was a significant predictor of unsuccessful TB treatment.

        "abstract": "The war between humans and bacteria started centuries ago. With the advent of antibiotics, there was a temporary ceasefire in this war, but the scenario soon started becoming worse with the emergence of drug-resistant strains within years of the deployment of antibiotics in the market. With the surge in the misuse of antibiotics, there was a drastic increase in the number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant bacterial strains, even to antibiotics like Methicillin and vancomycin, aggravating the healthcare scenario. The threat of MDR ESKAPE pathogens is particularly high in nosocomial infections, where biofilms formed by bacteria create a protective barrier that makes them highly resistant to antibiotics, complicating the treatment efforts. Scientists are looking at natural and sustainable solutions, as several studies have projected deaths contributed by drug-resistant bacteria to go beyond 50 million by 2050. Many plant-derived metabolites have shown excellent antibacterial and antibiofilm properties that can be tapped for combating superbugs. The present review explores the current status of various studies on antibacterial plant metabolites like alkaloids and flavonoids and their mechanisms in disrupting biofilms and killing bacteria by way of inhibiting key survival strategies of bacteria like motility, quorum-sensing, reactive oxygen species production, and adhesion. These mechanisms were found to be varied in Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and acid-fast bacteria like <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, which will be discussed in detail. The successful tapping of the benefits of such plant-derived chemicals in combination with evolving techniques of nanotechnology and targeted drug delivery can go a long way in achieving the goal of One Health, which advocates the unity of multiple practices for the optimal health of people, animals, and the environment.",

A total of 295 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) isolates were collected from surveillance sites in Sichuan from 2019 to 2021. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 12 anti-TB drugs were acquired using the broth microdilution method, followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. Of 268 MTB isolates with both WGS and drug-susceptibility testing (DST) results, 159 (59.3%, 159/268) strains belonged to the Beijing lineage (L2). Isoniazid had the highest resistance rate (15.3%, 41/268), followed by rifampicin (9.3%, 25/268). The sensitivity of WGS to predict drug resistance varied from 75% to 97.6%, and the specificity was above 96.0% for all. <i>rpoB</i> Ser450Leu (41.7%, 10/24) and <i>katG</i> Ser315Thr (70%, 28/40) were the most frequent mutations in rifampicin and isoniazid resistance isolates, respectively.

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat, with the current <i>Bacillus Calmette-Guérin</i> (BCG) vaccine having limited efficacy against adult pulmonary disease. Trained immunity (TI) is a form of innate immune memory that enhances antimicrobial defense. It is characterized by the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells and holds promise as a promising approach to prevent TB. In this study, we investigated the capacity of heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), a methylated antigen of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, to induce TI in murine RAW264.7 macrophages, human-derived THP-1 macrophages, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). HBHA-trained macrophages exhibited the enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) following secondary lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The epigenetic profiling indicated elevated levels of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 histone marks at cytokine gene loci. Further, metabolic analysis revealed heightened lactate production and the increased expression of glycolytic enzymes. Functionally, HBHA-trained macrophages exhibited improved control of intracellular mycobacteria, as evidenced by a significant reduction in colony-forming units following BCG infection. These findings elucidate that HBHA induces a functional TI phenotype via coordinated epigenetic and metabolic changes, and suggest HBHA may serve as a valuable tool for studying TI and its relevance to host defense against mycobacterial infections, pending further in vivo and clinical validation.",

The samples, including sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate and body fluid, were initially tested with MGIT culture and then analyzed using both PCR kits. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy were evaluated. Discrepant results between the two PCR assays were further investigated using sequencing to identify the detected mycobacterial species, and final diagnoses were verified by culture results and review of electronic medical records. <b>Results:</b> Of the 390 specimens, both AdvanSure<sup>TM</sup> and PowerChek<sup>TM</sup> real-time PCR assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity for both MTB and NTM detection. For MTB detection, AdvanSure<sup>TM</sup> demonstrated a specificity of 100%, with a PPV, NPV, and overall accuracy all reaching 100%.

The co-occurrence and clustering of multiple diseases can cause a syndemic, synergistically interacting epidemics, driven by context. This cross-sectional study investigated potential syndemics in Eswatini, by determining geospatial disease concentration and estimating interaction between four diseases and the impact of context on these interactions. Using data from the WHOPEN@Scale household survey, we estimated generalised linear models with a quasi-Poisson link, incorporating three-way interaction terms. Joint effect estimates and the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) between diseases and contextual factors were estimated. Conditions with comorbid depression were concentrated in the middle of the country near the capital, and the combinations without depression mostly in the north. Additive interaction was found between HIV and diabetes across all three contextual factors, in particular for people who are the sole household member aged 30 or above RERI: 0.46 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.80) and those who had lost their partner RERI: 0.44 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.86). We show that HIV and diabetes exhibit syndemic properties, indicated by geospatial variation, additive interaction as well as interaction with context. The lifelong chronicity and stigmatising nature of both diseases emphasise the importance of the social and financial context surrounding affected individuals. While the other disease pairs did not exhibit syndemic properties, the worst health outcomes among the double-exposed stipulate that comorbidity remains important within treatment guidelines.",

        "abstract": "The increasing rates of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have made controlling tuberculosis more challenging. Excessive programmed cell death helps mediate Mtb transmission. Salvianolic acid B (Sal B), a water-soluble extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been reported to inhibit programmed cell death and excessive inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the potential inhibitory mechanism of Sal B on PANoptosis. The inhibitory effect of Sal B on PANoptosis was evaluated by western blotting, ELISA, and other techniques in an in vitro model of Mtb H37Ra-infected macrophages. The roles of ZBP1 and TNFR1 in PANoptosis were explored by small interfering RNA transfection. In addition, the inhibitory effect of Sal B on PANoptosis and the hyperinflammatory response was verified by western blotting, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry in an in vivo model of inflammatory injury in the lungs of LPS-infected mice. Sal B inhibited the protein levels of key molecules of Mtb-mediated PANoptosis and hindered the assembly of the PANoptosome consisting of ASC, ZBP1, RIPK1, RIPK3, and Caspase 8. Sal B may further inhibit PANoptosis by binding to TNFR1 and suppressing ZBP1 levels. In addition, the results of in vivo studies verified that Sal B could ameliorate LPS-induced pathological injury in mouse lung tissues. Sal B can target TNFR1 to achieve a regulatory effect on macrophage PANoptosis. This provides new ideas for Sal B as a host-directed therapy drug to attenuate the excessive inflammatory response induced by Mtb infection.",

        "title": "Engagement With Digital Adherence Technologies as Measures of Intervention Fidelity Among Adults With Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis and Health Care Providers: Descriptive Analysis Using Data From Cluster-Randomized Trials in Five Countries.",
        "abstract": "Digital adherence technologies (DATs) are promising tools for supporting tuberculosis (TB) treatment. DATs can serve as reminders for people with TB to take their medication and act as proxies for adherence monitoring. Strong engagement with DATs, from both the person with TB and health care provider (HCP) perspectives, is essential for ensuring intervention fidelity. The Adherence Support Coalition to End TB (ASCENT) project evaluated 2 types of DATs, pillboxes and medication labels (99DOTS), in cluster-randomized trials across 5 countries. This study aims to investigate participant and HCP engagement with DATs for TB treatment, stratified by DAT type and country. This study is a subanalysis of data generated through the ASCENT trials, which enrolled adults with drug-susceptible TB. A digital dose was defined as either a pillbox opening (for pillbox users) or a dosing confirmation SMS text message sent by the participant (for label users), both of which were recorded on the adherence platform. Descriptive analysis was used to provide an overview of dose-day outcomes. DAT engagement was assessed from both participant and HCP perspectives. To enhance participant engagement, we summarized the frequency of digital engagement overall and by treatment phase, as well as the frequency of consecutive days without engagement. For HCP engagement, we summarized the frequency of doses added manually, the number of days between the actual dose day and when a manual dose was added, and instances of consecutive manual dosing lasting more than 3 and more than 7 days, where doses were added more than 1 week after the dose day. Of the 9511 participants included, 6719 (70.64%) were using the pillbox, 3544 (37.26%) were female, and the median age was 40 years. Across DAT types, there were 1,384,879 dose days, with 973,876 (70.32%) contributed by pillbox users. Of all dose days, 1,165,195 (84.14%) were recorded as digital, 156,664 (11.31%) as manual, 59,045 (4.26%) had no information, and 3975 (0.29%) were confirmed as missed. Digital dosing decreased slightly from the intensive to the continuation phase. The percentage of digital dose days was higher among pillbox users (851,496/973,876, 87.43%) compared with label users (313,699/411,003, 76.33%). Among label users, manual dosing was most common in the Philippines (37,919/171,786, 22.07%) and least common in Tanzania (11,108/76,231, 14.57%). Among pillbox users, manual dosing was most common in the Philippines (24,015/208,130, 11.54%) and Ukraine (13,209/111,901, 11.80%). Overall, 512 out of 2792 (18.34%) label users and 588 out of 6719 (8.75%) pillbox users experienced a run of more than 7 consecutive nondigital dose days that were resolved more than 1 week after the dose day. The highest occurrence was observed in the Philippines (368/1142, 32.22%, for label users and 224/1351, 16.58%, for pillbox users). There was considerable variation in DAT engagement across countries and DAT types, reflecting differences in how the intervention was implemented. Further refinement of the intervention and improvements in its delivery may be necessary to enhance outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization recommends evaluation of all household contacts (HHC) of index tuberculosis (TB) patients for TB disease (TBD) and TB infection (TBI). Tests to identify TBI and TBD are preferred but can be skipped in persons living with HIV and children <5 years. There is equipoise on the need for these tests in other HHC. We conducted a superiority, open label cluster-randomized trial in Benin and Brazil to compare three strategies to evaluate HHC aged 5-50 of persons newly diagnosed with drug susceptible pulmonary TBD: Standard: tuberculin skin testing (TST) for TBI and if positive, chest X-ray (CXR) to rule out TBD; rapid molecular test (RMT): same as Standard, except CXR replaced by an RMT; and No-TST: CXR for all but no TST. Randomization was computer-generated and stratified by country, in blocks of variable length. The primary outcome was TB preventive therapy (TPT) initiation among HHC considered eligible (positive TST, if done, and no evidence of TBD on CXR or RMT). Secondary outcomes were: completion of investigations to detect TBI and TBD, detection of TBD, TPT completion, severe adverse events, and societal costs. Among 1,589 participating HHC enrolled from 29 January 2020, to 30 November 2022, 474 were randomized to the standard, 583 to the RMT, and 532 to the no-TST strategies; all were included in the analyses. Of 848 HHC considered eligible for TPT, 802 (94.6%) initiated TPT, with no difference between strategies (95%, 94%, and 95% for the standard, RMT, and no-TST strategies, respectively). Of the secondary outcomes, protocol-mandated investigations to detect TBI and exclude possible TBD were completed for 93.4% overall, with slight differences between arms (93%, 95%, and 93% for the standard, RMT, and no-TST strategies, respectively). Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of TPT occurred in 3 (0.4%) participants in total (with 1, 0, and 2 events among participants in the Standard, RMT, and no-TST arms, respectively). The proportion completing TPT was similar with Standard and RMT strategies but was 13% lower (95% confidence interval: 3% to 23% lower) with the No-TST strategy. Societal costs per HHC completing investigations were $61 ($56-$65) with the standard strategy, compared to $52 ($49-$55) with the RMT strategy and $74 ($72-$77) with the no-TST strategy. This randomized trial provides high-quality evidence that TST followed by selected use of CXR or an RMT to exclude disease can achieve high rates of TPT initiation at reasonable costs. A limitation of the trial is the potential study effect, which may have affected adherence by providers and HHCs. RMT could replace CXR in the management of HHC in resource limited settings. clinicaltrials.gov NCT04528823.",

The aim of this study was to examine the difficulty of the diagnostic process in 89 cases that applied to different clinics in our hospital, with different complaints. A total of 89 patients diagnosed with EPTB between March 2020 and March 2024 were included in the study. EPTB diagnosis was determined by excluding patients with primary PTB. The mean age of the cases was 47.84 ± 19.23 years, and 52 (58.4%) of the patients were women. There was a significant relationship between the affected area and gender (p < 0.001). The rate of peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP) involvement was much higher in women than that in men (85.2% vs. 14.8%). Pleural involvement was 6.5-fold higher in men than in women (51.4% vs. 7.8%). There was also a significant relationship between the affected area and the time to diagnosis (p < 0.001). While peripheral LAP cases were diagnosed late, patients with pleural involvement were diagnosed more quickly (p < 0.001). The rate of smoking addiction was high in males with pleural involvement (79.9%). Quinolone use was 77.4% in the early-diagnosed group and 54.9% in the late-diagnosed group (p = 0.110). Due to the difficulty of diagnosis, EPTB should be included in the differential diagnoses of all relevant medical specialties, and insistence should be made for the diagnosis in the presence of clinical suspicion.",

To develop alternative vaccines against TB, we generated <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H37Rv (Mtb)-derived vaccine strains by rationally deleting key virulent genes, resulting in single (<i>SKO; ΔfbpA</i>), double (DKO; <i>ΔfbpA-ΔsapM</i>), triple (TKO-D; <i>ΔfbpA-ΔsapM-ΔdosR</i> and TKO-Z; <i>ΔfbpA-ΔsapM-Δzmp1</i>), and quadruple (QKO; <i>ΔfbpA-ΔsapM-Δzmp1-dosR</i>) strains. To understand how macrophages, the host cells that defend against infection and process antigens for presentation to immune cells, respond to these vaccine strains, we performed transcriptomic analyses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) infected with these strains. The transcriptomic data were compared with similar data obtained from macrophages infected with Mtb H37Rv and BCG. Our analyses revealed that genes associated with various immune and cell signaling pathways, such as NF-kappa B signaling, TNF signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, hematopoietic cell lineage, Toll-like receptor signaling, IL-17 signaling, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, and T cell receptor signaling were differentially expressed in BMDMs infected with our vaccine strains. Enhanced expression of cytokines and chemokines, including proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, GM-CSF, and IL-1, which are essential for the immune response against Mtb infection, was also observed in BMDMs infected with these strains. In particular, BMDMs infected with all vaccine strains exhibited a significant upregulation of genes associated with the IL-17 pathway. These results may indicate that our vaccine strains could induce a protective immune response against TB.",

Using clinical diagnosis as reference standard, the diagnostic accuracy indicators such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the curve (AUC) for the tests in question were evaluated. In total, 132 patients were eligible for inclusion. Nanopore sequencing showed sensitivity of 93.3%, specificity of 85.2%, PPV of 96.1%, NPV of 76.7%, and AUC of 0.89 for tuberculous serous effusions. The diagnostic accuracy of nanopore sequencing was significantly superior than that of Xpert MTB/RIF and culture. Similar results were observed in different types of tuberculous serous effusions (pleural tuberculosis, pericardial tuberculosis, and peritoneal tuberculosis). Nanopore sequencing was efficient for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculous serous effusions and had a very positive effect.

School students, oriented by NTEP staff, screened their family members using a 12-question format that addresses TB symptoms and risk factors. Data from 2,210 individuals were compiled and analyzed using Jamovi version 2.3.28 (Computer Software; retrieved from https://www.jamovi.org).  Thirty percent with appetite loss and 26% with >5 kg weight loss underwent TB testing, with these symptoms showing strong associations with testing (p < 0.001). Only four individuals were diagnosed with TB. History of TB in the past one to two years and generalized weakness were significant predictors of diagnosis. Logistic regression revealed age, symptom count, and TB history as significant predictors of testing and diagnosis.  School-based ACF is a feasible and promising strategy for TB detection in tribal areas. While the diagnostic yield was low, the model showed potential for broader implementation and community mobilization. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term impact and optimize the implementation.",

This study employed an in-silico approach to design a multi-epitope vaccine targeting the PE_PGRS16 protein, a conserved virulence factor found across both species, including drug-resistant strains. PE_PGRS16 was chosen due to its extracellular localization, adhesion properties, and virulence characteristics, making it a promising vaccine target. Epitopes for B-cells, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes, and Helper T Lymphocytes were selected based on antigenicity, non-toxicity, and immune response potential. The vaccine construct demonstrated favorable properties, including high antigenicity, solubility, and stability, with a low instability index (-31.31) and binding energy (-44.566) when docked to TLR4, suggesting its potential for immune activation. Griselimycin was incorporated as an adjuvant to enhance immunogenicity, as predicted by C-ImmSim simulations. Population coverage analysis for East Africa revealed high applicability, with 98.35% coverage for Class I epitopes, 100% coverage for Class II epitopes, and 100% combined coverage, with average hit values of 8.4, 12.26, and 20.66, respectively. These results suggest broad potential for global vaccine deployment. This study presents a novel multi-epitope vaccine targeting PE_PGRS16, with the potential to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis infections, including drug-resistant forms. Further experimental validation is necessary to confirm its efficacy and safety.",

        "abstract": "The article presents modern data on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors. The tendency of increasing mortality from NCDs due to increase in the number and aging of the population is noted. The data is presented testifying that, in addition to biological risk factors, influence of environmental factors is increasing, including atmospheric and household air pollution, the levels of which are high in a significant number of countries. It is emphasized that green spaces (e.g., trees, grass, forests and parks) and blue spaces (e.g., lakes, rivers, ponds, etc.) provide beneficial effect on human health, being in fact protective factors for NCDs. The NCD risk factors are found to interact closely with each other: air pollution, depression, tobacco smoking, high blood pressure and obesity have been linked to all NCDs. The evidence is provided that presence of behavioral risk factors for NCDs exacerbates severity of infectious pathology, particularly COVID-19 and other infectious diseases (influenza, HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, etc.). Given that NCD risk factors can occur in early childhood, promoting healthy lifestyles among expectant mothers and adolescents should be a priority to reduce NCD risks, especially in low- and middle-income countries.",

This narrative review unravels the \"tale of two ecosystems,\" exploring how pre-transplant chemotherapy, radiation, and antibiotics induce recipient dysbiosis-marked by loss of beneficial taxa (Clostridia, Faecalibacterium) and dominance of pathobionts (Enterococcus). These shifts impair barrier integrity, fuel systemic inflammation, and skew immune responses toward pro-inflammatory T-cell subsets, exacerbating GVHD. Conversely, emerging evidence implicates donor microbiota in modulating post-transplant immune reconstitution, though its role remains underexplored. Therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), demonstrate promise in restoring microbial balance, enhancing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-driven immune regulation, and reducing GVHD severity. However, challenges such as strain-specific efficacy, safety in immunocompromised hosts, and protocol standardization persist. By bridging microbial ecology and immunology, this review underscores the microbiome's transformative potential in redefining GVHD management and advocates for personalized, microbiome-targeted interventions to improve HSCT outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Leprosy prevalence in Pakistan has declined since multidrug therapy was introduced in the 1980s. In 1996, prevalence dropped below one per 10 000, the target set for elimination of leprosy as a public health problem. We explored trends in incidence, prevalence, and patient characteristics at national and subnational levels using routine data. In this retrospective cohort study, we compiled leprosy incidence and prevalence rates from the database collected by the Pakistani National Leprosy Control Programme between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2022 at the national level, with subnational-level analyses from Jan 1, 2001, to Dec 31, 2022. At the provincial level we explored trends in age distribution and disability grading of incident cases. At the subdistrict level we compiled the new WHO Leprosy Elimination Monitoring Tool (LEMT) over four periods and we conducted a spatial scan statistic (SaTScan) analysis to identify current high-incidence clusters. We found 40 859 episodes of leprosy, with 30 522 from the 1980-2000 period and 10 337 from the 2001-22 period. Incidence and prevalence of leprosy have decreased significantly, with incidence decreasing from 23·5 per 1 million in 1980 to 1·1 per 1 million in 2022 and prevalence from 167·4 to 0·9 per 1 million. Trends are driven by the two largest provinces, Sindh and Punjab. Since 2001, the decline in incidence has been mainly driven by Sindh, whereas incidence in Punjab has remained stagnant. Nationally, the proportion of children among new cases has not significantly decreased (odds ratio per year 0·996 [95% CI 0·985-1·008]), suggesting ongoing transmission. The mean annual proportion of new patients with grade 2 disabilities also remains high (20·7%, SD 3·1). The LEMT and SaTScan analyses identified largely overlapping areas of ongoing transmission. Although leprosy incidence has decreased, some high-incidence areas persist, requiring intensified interventions. Stable proportions of child cases also indicate ongoing transmission. In addition to LEMT, new tools such as geospatial mapping and phylogenetic analysis might help to better target elimination efforts. Marie Adelaide Leprosy Center.",

We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

Accurate TB diagnosis and detection of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in real-world settings are crucial for prompt treatment and surveillance. We therefore compared multiple methods for TB detection and drug resistance profiling, including a cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT), line probe assay (LPA), and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) with targeted long-read next generation sequencing (tNGS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 133 patients in West Java, Indonesia. WGS enabled comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and insights into TB evolution and drug resistance patterns, but its low read counts limit practicality for clinical use. Comparatively, tNGS demonstrated superior sensitivity and specificity, effectively identifying resistance profiles across multiple first-line and second-line drugs with rapid turnaround times. Notably, when compared to LPA, tNGS showed positive percent agreement (PPA) values of 100 % for rifampicin, isoniazid and ethionamide, and an overall agreement of 94 % across multiple drugs. In comparison with CBNAAT, the tNGS PPA for rifampicin remained high at 91 %. The results show that long-read tNGS technology offers a robust tool for enhanced TB treatment and surveillance, ensuring both timely detection and enabling effective tracing through in-depth genetic analysis.

This condition often presents with mildly elevated PSA levels and imaging findings that may resemble those of advanced prostate cancer. This case holds significant value due to the rarity of documented reports worldwide and diagnostic challenges. It provides an essential perspective for physicians, encouraging them to maintain a heightened index of suspicion for prostatic tuberculosis in patients presenting with vague lower urinary tract symptoms and features of anemia, particularly in endemic regions. Our case is a 75-year-old male patient who presented with non-specific lower urinary tract symptoms and features of anemia. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of primary tuberculosis with nodular prostatic hyperplasia. Following anti-Tb treatment he showed notable improvement. The spread of infection to the prostate is primarily hematogenous. Prostatic tuberculosis is usually asymptomatic or subclinical in the early stage and nonspecific irritating micturition in the late stage. The mainstay of management for TB prostatitis is medical treatment using multiple anti-TB drug combinations. Surgical therapy can be considered if patients do not respond to medical therapy. Isolated prostatic tuberculosis is a rare clinical entity in which it can mimic non-specific prostatitis and prostatic carcinoma by its similar clinical presentation and digital rectal examination finding.

There are several reported inhibitors of the Cyt-bd oxidase, predominantly featuring quinoline and quinazoline scaffolds. This study explores benzothiazole amides as potential inhibitors of Cyt-bd oxidase for their ability to deplete ATP in the presence of the Cyt-bc<sub>1</sub>:aa<sub>3</sub> inhibitor Q203. These compounds demonstrated significant bactericidal activity against both replicating and non-replicating Mtb strains in this combined approach. Methylene blue assays confirmed their ability to inhibit oxygen consumption, validating their Cyt-bd inhibitory mechanism. Moreover, cytotoxicity studies indicated low toxicity and high selectivity for bacterial cells over mammalian cells. Molecular docking studies elucidated favourable binding interactions with the Cyt-bd protein, while in silico ADME profiling suggested promising pharmacokinetic properties. These results highlight the potential of benzothiazole amides as promising candidates for anti-TB drug development, specifically targeting the Cyt-bd oxidase. Future research will focus on further optimising these compounds and conducting preclinical evaluations to realize their clinical potential as adjuncts in TB therapy.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) poses a persistent global health threat exacerbated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains; hence, there is a continuous quest for novel antimicrobial agents. Despite efforts to develop effective therapies, existing treatments require a relatively long duration of therapy to eradicate the pathogen due to its virulence factors, pathogenesis patterns, and ability to enter dormant states. This can lead to a higher risk of treatment failure due to poor patient adherence to the complex regimen. As a result, considerable research is necessary to identify alternative antituberculosis agents. The marine environment, particularly marine-derived fungi, has recently gained interest due to its potential as an abundant source of bioactive natural products. This review covers 19 genera of marine-derived fungi and 139 metabolites, 131 of which exhibit antimycobacterial activity. The integrated dataset pinpoints the fungal genera and chemical classes that most frequently yield potent antimycobacterial hits while simultaneously exposing critical gaps, such as the minimal evaluation of compounds against dormant bacilli and the presence of underexplored ecological niches and fungal genera. Several compounds exhibit potent activity through uncommon mechanisms, including the inhibition of mycobacterial protein tyrosine phosphatases (MptpB/MptpA), protein kinase PknG, ATP synthase and the disruption of mycobacterial DNA via G-quadruplex stabilization. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends are highlighted for the most potent agents, illuminating how specific functional groups underpin target engagement and potency. This review also briefly proposes a dereplication strategy and approaches for toxicity mitigation in the exploration of marine-derived fungi's natural products. Through this analysis, we offer insights into the potency and challenges of marine-derived fungi's natural products as hit compounds or scaffolds for further antimycobacterial research.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important tool in global health, improving disease diagnosis and management. Despite advancements, tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where diagnostic methods are limited. In this scoping review, we aim to examine the potential role of AI in TB control. We conducted a search on 25 August 2024 for the past five years, in the PubMed database using keywords related to AI and TB. We included laboratory-based and observational studies focussing on AI applications in TB, excluding non-original research. There were 34 eligible studies, identifying eight overarching aspects associated with TB control, including active case finding (ACF), triage, pleural effusion diagnosis, multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, differential diagnosis distinguishing active TB from TB infection and other pulmonary communicable diseases, TB and other pulmonary communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), treatment outcome prediction, pleural effusion, and predictions of regional and national trends. AI may transform TB control through enhanced ACF methods and triage, improving detection rates in high-burden regions. With high accuracy, AI may diagnose pleural diagnosis, differentiate TB active and TB infection, TB and non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, COVID-19, and pulmonary NCDs. AI applications may facilitate the prediction of treatment success and adverse effects. Furthermore, AI-driven hotspot mapping may identify undiagnosed TB cases at rates surpassing traditional notification methods. Lastly, predictive modelling and clinical decision support systems may improve the management of MDR-TB. This scoping review highlights the potential of AI-driven predictions in national TB programmes to enhance diagnostics, track trends, and strengthen public health surveillance. While promising for reducing transmission and supporting TB care in low-resource settings, these models require large-scale validation to ensure real-world applicability, especially for high-risk groups.",

        "abstract": "CD1-restricted T cells constitute an unconventional arm of immunity that recognises lipid antigens, a feature particularly pertinent to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), a pathogen with a lipid-rich cell wall. Unlike classical MHC-restricted responses, CD1-mediated lipid antigen presentation includes donor-unrestricted T cell responses, offering a promising pathway for universally protective tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. This review explores the biology of CD1 isoforms, the functional diversity of CD1-restricted T cell subsets, and their roles in TB immunity. We discuss Mtb's lipid antigens, mechanisms of CD1 trafficking and antigen presentation, immune evasion strategies, and emerging translational insights. By highlighting key knowledge gaps and future directions, we argue that harnessing CD1-restricted T cells could unlock novel vaccine strategies against the world's leading infectious killer.",

        "title": "Assessing the determinants of drug-resistant tuberculosis in selected hospitals in Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia: a case-control study.",
        "abstract": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a significant challenge to the national tuberculosis (TB) control program in Ethiopia. The Tigray region in northern Ethiopia has shown a surge in the incidence of DR-TB cases. However, the determinants of DR-TB in the region are not studied. This study is aimed at identifying the factors associated with the development of DR-TB in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia. The study used an unmatched case-control design to identify determinants of DR-TB in the Tigray region, northern Ethiopia, whereby 86 patients and 86 controls who registered for TB treatment follow-up in selected hospitals were recruited. Trained nurses collected both primary and secondary data, which were analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. The test statistics was conducted with a 95% confidence level, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The study included 86 patients with DR-TB (cases) and an equal number of patients with drug-susceptible (controls). The case and control groups had 38 (44.2%) and 47 (54.7%) males, respectively. The study revealed the study participants with male gender (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI: 1.2-19.9), single marital status (AOR = 13.6, 95% CI: 2.3-81.2), history of TB treatment (AOR = 58.2, 95% CI: 11.2-302.1), experienced a delay of more than 60 days before TB diagnosis (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.2-19.3), interrupted treatment at least once (AOR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.02-23.9), and unsuccessful treatment outcome at first treatment (AOR = 7.6, 95% CI: 1.8-35.9) had a higher risk of DR-TB. The study highlights determinants of DR-TB in the region, including gender, marital status, delayed diagnosis (over 60 days), previous treatment history, interrupted treatment, and unsuccessful treatment outcomes during initial treatment. It is recommended that healthcare providers focus on targeted interventions, such as supporting males and unmarried individuals, ensuring early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment, improving treatment adherence, and providing tailored support for patients with histories of incomplete treatment and unsuccessful initial treatment outcomes.",

        "title": "The effects of decentralisation on patient and service outcomes: a case of the 2018 decentralisation of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Zambia.",
        "abstract": "The Zambian government decentralised tuberculosis control programs by transferring responsibility for the care and treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients from a two-national hospital model to provincial hospitals and other lower-level healthcare structures. Limited evidence exists on the effects of decentralisation on the quality of TB care provided through public sector decentralisation. In this paper, we explored the impact of decentralising MDR-TB on patient and service outcomes. This study used a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were collected through a survey of 244 MDR-TB patients, while qualitative data was collected through interviews with TB coordinators, healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers. Participants were drawn from health facilities and the Ministry of Health. Quantitative data was analysed in STATA version 16.0, while thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data. Decentralisation has improved patient care and management by increasing access to essential commodities such as medication and diagnostic testing. It has led to more equitable distribution of MDR-TB healthcare services and resources across different population groups, regardless of social, economic, or demographic factors. Furthermore, the quality of life for MDR-TB patients has improved, with better adherence to medication resulting from increased family support. Due to decentralisation, tailored community and patient-centred services have been integrated resulting in reduced congestion at facilities. The study also identified challenges, including heavy workload for healthcare staff, fragmented coordination of supervisory responsibilities, and confusion over roles in patient management, which negatively impacted the decentralisation process. The decentralisation of MDR TB services offers significant benefits but is not a guaranteed solution, as poor planning or implementation can lead to challenges in service delivery.",

        "abstract": "The frequency of clinical isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) is increasing, but its relevance remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the frequency of NTM isolation and its clinical relevance in respiratory specimens from MDR/RR-TB patients in Wenzhou, China. Medical records of MDR/RR-TB patients with NTM isolated from 2014 to 2022 were reviewed retrospectively. To establish the clinical relevance, the diagnostic criteria for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) were applied. Between 2014 and 2022, a total of 922 patients were enrolled, among whom 45 (4.9%) cases yielded NTM isolates, resulting in the isolation of 68 distinct NTM strains. The most prevalent NTM species was M. abscessus, accounting for 36.8% (25/68) of the isolates, followed by M. intracellulare at 22.1% (15/68) and M. avium at 8.8% (6/68). Notably, only five cases (0.54%) met the microbiologic criteria specified in the ATS/IDSA guidelines. Four of these cases received no specific NTM treatment and achieved a favorable prognosis with anti-TB therapy. Remarkably, a single case out of 922 (0.11%) was identified as having concomitant MDR/RR-TB and NTM-PD. The clinical relevance of respiratory NTM isolates in patients with MDR/RR-TB is generally low, with the overwhelming majority of these NTM isolates being either colonizers or contaminants. Consequently, in most cases, those with concomitant NTM isolates do not require specific therapy.",

Often secondary and associated with concurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, it may clinically manifest as chronic or recurrent tonsillitis, occasionally mimicking malignant conditions. Diagnosis of this condition is often delayed and complex, frequently necessitating histopathological examination for confirmation. Its management predominantly hinges on antitubercular medications.We present two distinct cases of tonsillar tuberculosis. The first case involves a 64-year-old male receiving anti-TNF therapy for ulcerative colitis. He was hospitalized for lateral neck swelling and persistent ulceronecrotic angina despite initial antibiotic treatments. Tonsillar tuberculosis was suspected and confirmed by histopathological analysis. The second case involves a 46-year-old female presenting with right ulceronecrotic angina associated with ipsilateral jugulo-carotid adenopathy. The diagnosis of caseous-follicular tonsillar tuberculosis was confirmed by biopsy. The patient was initiated on antitubercular treatment for a period of 6 months, resulting in a significant improvement in symptoms. Neither patient had pulmonary tuberculosis.",
