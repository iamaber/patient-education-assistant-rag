The prevalence of ZVF was 44.1%. Lower odds of ZVF were observed among older children and those whose mothers had higher levels of education, media exposure or belonged to wealthier households. In contrast, children with recent illnesses and urban residents had higher odds of ZVF. Targeted interventions for younger and socioeconomically disadvantaged children, alongside maternal nutrition education, are essential to promote fruit and vegetable intake in early childhood.",

        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of global child mortality continues to be diarrhoea where rotavirus contributed to about 24% of deaths among all diarrhoeal deaths, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Rotavirus vaccination programmes have contributed to the reduction of mortality from 24% to 19% in rotavirus infections among hospitalised children, but the burden of rotaviral diarrhoea remains high, especially in settings with undernutrition. We aimed to determine the association of rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology with prior vaccination, socioeconomic status and clinical factors in children to see their utility in clinical settings. We analysed secondary data from a multicentre clinical trial on antibiotic impact in children with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We used stored stool samples of 6697 children aged 2-23 months old, presenting to a health facility with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We determined rotavirus aetiology prevalence using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and looked at its association with the patient's rotaviral vaccination status, clinical symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models; if they did not converge, log-Poisson models were used. Rotavirus prevalence of 21.1% was observed. There was a weak and statistically non-significant inverse association between rotavirus vaccination and rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology (adjusted PR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03). Of the five tested clinical symptoms, shorter diarrhoea duration was associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.45). Of the seven tested socioeconomic characteristics, only maternal and paternal secondary education compared with no formal education were associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, PR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00 respectively). Rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology cannot accurately be determined with prior receipt of rotavirus vaccination among children presenting to facilities with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. Short diarrhoea duration and parental secondary education were associated with increased prevalence of rotaviral aetiology; however, their utility in clinical care remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "A child's exposure to arsenic (As) can begin in utero through placental transfer to the fetus. There is a growing body of epidemiologic evidence suggesting an association between As exposure and neuropsychological development. Therefore, our objective was to describe the consequences of maternal and/or childhood As exposure on children's neuropsychological development. We conducted a scoping review with a systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases. We included studies that assessed the association between maternal and/or childhood As exposure and neuropsychological development in children up to an average of 12 years of age. A total of 77 studies were included, most of which were published between 2020 and 2024 (44.1%), conducted in the United States of America (18.2%) and Bangladesh (16.9%), and involved participants with a median age of 6.6 years. Most studies performed cross-sectional analyses (51.9%) and assessed exposure to elements other than As (64.9%). Childhood was the most frequently studied exposure window (57.2%), and urine was the most commonly used biomarker of exposure (58.4%), followed by blood or serum (32.3%). Cognition was the most frequently evaluated neuropsychological domain (94.8%), followed by psychomotor function (40.3%) and social-emotional function (29.9%). Most studies reported evidence of a negative impact of As exposure on children's neuropsychological development (73.7%), while some found no changes (27.3%) and a few suggested an improvement (1.3%). An important limitation is that most studies measured total urinary As without speciation into inorganic versus organic forms, which limits the validity of dose-response conclusions based on total arsenic concentrations. This review highlights the potential deleterious neuropsychological effects of maternal and/or childhood As exposure while also identifying areas where the evidence remains inconclusive.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal depression can have lasting adverse impacts on child health. Little is known about the impact of floods on prenatal depression in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 881 pregnant women from September 24, 2023 to July 19, 2024 in riverine communities in rural Bangladesh. We recorded participant-reported flooding in the past 6 months, administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and obtained water level data and remote sensing data on distance to surface water. We fit generalized linear and log-linear models adjusting for month, wealth, education, age, and gestational age. We conducted 2 focus group discussions with 20 adult women. 3.6% of compounds were flooded in the past 6 months. Flooding of compounds was associated with elevated depression (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 2.08, 95% CI 1.24, 3.51) and thoughts of self-harm (aPR = 8.40, 95% CI 4.19, 16.10). Latrine flooding was associated with higher depression (aPR = 3.58, 95% CI 2.22, 5.75)). Higher water levels and shorter distance to permanent surface water were significantly associated with mean EPDS scores. Focus groups revealed that domestic violence, inadequate sanitation, gendered vulnerabilities in accessing latrines, childcare difficulties, and food insecurity were key drivers of depression due to floods. Flood preparedness strategies included relocation, storing food, and home modifications. In summary, in rural Bangladesh, flooding, higher water levels, and proximity to water bodies were associated with prenatal depression, and depression following floods was strongly influenced by inadequate sanitation and hygiene infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this review is to identify which environmental toxicants are linked to infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by synthesizing available evidence. It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants. Findings advocate for reducing environmental pollution exposure in LMICs to mitigate infectious disease risk.",

        "abstract": "Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh, are experiencing a nutritional transition characterized by rising unhealthy food consumption (UFC), which increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies and chronic diseases in children. Despite this concern, research on UFC among Bangladeshi children aged 6-23 months is limited. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the prevalence and identify the factors contributing to UFC in this age group. This study analyzed the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 dataset, including 2,499 children aged 6-23 months. UFC was defined as the consumption of sweetened beverages or sentinel unhealthy foods within the past 24 hours. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with UFC. The prevalence of UFC among children was 61.8%, with 49.2% consuming sentinel unhealthy foods and 31.4% consuming sweetened beverages. The strongest predictor of UFC was older child aged 18-23 months (AOR: 3.31, 95% CI: 2.55-4.32), and consuming minimum diversified diet (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.98-3.15). Other significant factors included recent morbidity (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01-1.53), maternal employment (AOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.04-1.77), media exposure (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59), and lower paternal education [primary (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.21-2.44); secondary (AOR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.14-2.18)]. However, maternal decision-making power (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.96) and intended pregnancies (AOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97) were associated with lower odds of UFC. Regional disparities were observed, with higher UFC prevalence in Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, and Rangpur. The study highlights Bangladeshi children's high prevalence of UFC, which demands public health interventions together with integrating behavior change communication into health, community and family-level services.",

        "abstract": "Under-five mortality (U5M) is a key indicator and major concern of population health globally, which reflects the quality of maternal and childcare facilities and health services. Despite the significant decline globally, the challenge remains, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, although Tanzania, a lower-middle-income country, is showing notable improvements, yet still needs attention to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Therefore, this study aims to explore the socioeconomic, maternal, child and environmental risk factors of U5M in Tanzania. This study is based on the secondary data extracted from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2022. The data consisting of 10 884 children were analysed through bivariate analysis, spatial analysis and a multilevel logistic regression model. It is observed that U5M was more prevalent in rural areas (adjusted OR (AOR): 1.878, 95% CI: 1.877 to 1.878). Findings also revealed that households that use improved drinking water (AOR: 0.921, 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.921) and are exposed to media (AOR: 0.945, 95% CI: 0.945 to 0.945) have lower odds for U5M. Multiple births (AOR: 5.518, 95% CI: 5.517 to 5.52) increased the odds of U5M, while postnatal care (AOR: 1.878, 95% CI: 1.877 to 1.878) and wealth index (poorer-AOR: 1.908, 95% CI: 1.908 to 1.909; middle-AOR: 1.533, 95% CI: 1.533 to 1.534; richer-AOR: 1.706, 95% CI: 1.705 to 1.706; richest-AOR: 2.950, 95% CI: 2.949 to 2.951) revealed counterintuitive results. It also revealed that minimum dietary diversity (AOR: 0.057, 95% CI: 0.057 to 0.057) reduces the chances of U5M, and the odds of mortality increase with child age. The study highlights the spatial variability and risk factors of U5M in Tanzania. Therefore, it is necessary to address the identified determinants for reducing U5M in Tanzania to achieve the targeted interventions by policymakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve child survival rates and meet the SDGs by 2030.",

Studies on assessing the prevalence, trends, and determinants of DBM at household in Pakistan are scarce, so this study measured the prevalence, trends, and determinants of DBM at household level using nationally representative datasets. <b>Methods:</b> Data of last two waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Pakistan conducted in 2012-2013 and 2017-2018 were used to assess the DBM prevalence, trends, and determinants at the household level. Data of mother-child dyads aged between 15 and 49 years and 0 and 59 months was included, while data with incomplete anthropometry or anthropometric outliers was excluded. <b>Results:</b> Across two survey periods, there has been a significant decrease in pediatrics stunting from 45% to 37.3%, while a rapid proliferation of maternal obesity from 45% to 52.3% was reported. Similarly, the prevalence of DBM at household level was 17.3% in 2012-2013, which increased to 18.9% in 2017-2018. Among different provinces of Pakistan, Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) have significantly higher prevalence of DBM at household than Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). Factors such as child age, birth order, and socioeconomic status were significantly associated with DBM in Pakistani households. <b>Conclusion:</b> DBM in Pakistan is a complex and chronic challenge, which affects almost one-fifth of households. There is need to urgently address the issues of DBM and to improvise nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions to curtail the issues pertaining to DBM at household.",

        "abstract": "Although the prevalence of childhood stunting has reduced in Bangladesh over time, it is still considered a major public health issue. While research has determined the risk factors for childhood stunting in Bangladesh, the factors that lead to reductions in stunting have received very little attention. Hence, we examined the factors contributing to the changes in childhood stunting over time in Bangladesh using a decomposition approach. In this study, data on childhood stunting of 41,013 under-5 children (U5C) were utilized from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2012 and 2019, which are nation-wide cross-sectional surveys. Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was adopted to identify the predictors of childhood stunting, and multivariate decomposition analysis was used to examine the factors contributing to the changes in childhood stunting over time. The prevalence of stunting declined from 41.9% in 2012 to 28.0% in 2019. Regression analysis showed that lower education of household head and mothers, older children, lower wealth status of households, unimproved sanitation facilities, and being urban residents were significant predictors of childhood stunting. The decomposition analysis revealed that around 86% of the overall decline in stunting resulted from the differences in the effect of independent variables. Furthermore, children's age, maternal education, place of residence, and regions were significant factors contributing to the decline in childhood stunting prevalence over time based on both compositional and behavioral changes in these factors. Although childhood stunting has decreased in Bangladesh over time, the current prevalence remains high. Over 86% of the overall decline in stunting was due to the differences in the effect of independent variables. Interventions targeting children of mothers with lower education, infants, rural children, and children from households with lower wealth status and unimproved sanitation facilities may help to reduce the stunting prevalence in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Meta-analysis of trials of multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) compared with iron-folic acid (IFA) suggests an overall benefit of 12% on low birth weight (LBW). Building on prior work showing that MMS is more effective in anemic and higher body mass index females; this paper explores whether dietary quality modifies the effect of MMS on birth weight. A 7-d food frequency questionnaire was administered in late pregnancy to 19,160 pregnant participants in the JiVitA-3 cluster-randomized controlled trial of MMS compared with IFA supplementation in Bangladesh. A 10-item dietary diversity score (DDS) was created by summing the number of food groups consumed ≥4 times/wk. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of MMS compared with IFA on LBW were estimated by DDS. The interaction between DDS and MMS was tested using a generalized estimating equations log-binomial regression model to account for the cluster randomization. Point estimates and 95% CI for the effect of MMS on LBW were estimated at each DDS. Models were adjusted for confounders. We used P < 0.1 to determine the statistical significance of the interaction. The median DDS was 3 (interquartile range: 2, 4), and 18.6% of PW had a score ≥ 5. The fully adjusted protective effect of MMS on LBW was inversely associated with dietary diversity [MMS×DDS RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.04), P-interaction = 0.05]. The effect was greatest at the lowest DDS [DDS= 1, RR LBW: 0.86 (0.81, 0.91)] and decreased at higher scores [DDS = 7, RR: 0.92 (0.84, 1.00)]. In rural Bangladesh, where maternal dietary diversity was generally low, MMS (compared with IFA) supplementation had the strongest effect on reducing low birth weight among pregnant females with the least diverse diet, possibly reflecting the additional benefit of supplementation in this vulnerable group. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00860470.",

        "abstract": "Angiogenesis is essential for placental growth and development. Improper placental vascular development can reduce blood flow to the fetus and increase the risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on placental angiogenic factors and terminal villi, and associations between angiogenic factors, terminal villi and birth outcomes. This is a secondary analysis using data and specimens from the Maternal Vitamin D for Infant Growth trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh (n = 1298). Participants were enrolled at 17-24 weeks gestation and randomized to receive (IU/week): placebo, 4200, 16,800 or 28,000 vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplement until birth. Newborns and placentas were measured at birth. We examined a subset of randomly selected placentas (n = 80). Tissue sections were evaluated for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) using immunofluorescence. We measured intensity and percent area of expression for angiogenic factors, and total number and surface area of terminal villi. Vitamin D treatment effect was estimated using ANOVA. Regression models were used to assess associations of markers of placental angiogenesis with birth outcomes. Interactions by infant sex were examined. The overall mean (SD) percent area of expression was 17.0 (4.0) for VEGF-A and 15.0 (1.9) for PlGF. The mean (SD) number of terminal villi was 39 (15) per 12 in<sup>2</sup>, and surface area was 0.096 (0.040) in<sup>2</sup>. Vitamin D treatment groups were similar to placebo for all outcomes. No associations were observed between angiogenic factors or terminal villi placental and birth outcomes. Vitamin D supplementation starting from mid-pregnancy until birth did not affect expression of two key angiogenic factors or terminal villi in the placenta. Placental angiogenic factors or terminal villi did not have an association with birth outcomes. These results do not support a role of maternal vitamin D starting mid-pregnancy in impacting placental development.",

        "abstract": "Stunting, wasting and underweight are the three widely recognised indicators of child undernutrition. This study aimed to simultaneously model all indicators while accounting for their association using a joint modelling technique to identify their risk factors. This was a cross-sectional study design. The anthropometric data of children were elicited from the Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. Stunting, wasting and underweight were the main outcome measures of child undernutrition. Initially, a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) was developed for each indicator separately to identify the underlying risk factors by considering children within the cluster (district level) as hierarchically nested. Finally, a joint model was developed by combining the separate GLMMs with the condition of correlated cluster-specific (district-specific) random effects. The developed joint model provided precise effects of the risk factors and quantified the association among stunting, wasting and underweight. The joint correlations of underweight with stunting [Formula: see text] and underweight with wasting [Formula: see text] were significantly positive based on the predictors in the joint model. The age of children, household wealth status, and maternal education were risk factors for both stunting and underweight. The mother's age at first birth and the episode of fever were significantly correlated with both underweight and wasting, while the episode of fever was significantly associated with underweight. The region, residence and sex of children were significantly associated with all undernutrition indicators. This study demonstrates the application of a joint model to simultaneously identify the risk factors associated with indicators of child undernutrition. The study findings reveal a substantial positive association between stunting and underweight, as well as between underweight and wasting, with shared risk factors contributing to the disparity in the prevalence of all forms of child undernutrition in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "There is a need for continuing professional development in obstetric anaesthesia in low- and middle-income countries to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. The Safer Anaesthesia From Education (SAFE) Obstetrics training course was developed to meet this need and has been delivered to over 3,355 healthcare providers in 40 countries. The impact the training course has on behavioural influences and behaviour change is not known. The study aimed to evaluate the impact on behaviour and behavioural influences following the SAFE Obstetric training course in four new locations across Africa and Asia (Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Nepal and Bangladesh). Participants knowledge, skills and behavioural influences (perceptions of capability, opportunity and motivation) were explored via a questionnaire and skills assessments at three different time points; baseline, post-training and at follow-up (3-9 months). A subset of participants were observed in their own workplace at follow-up using a structured checklist to assess any changes in behaviour. Three-hundred and sixty-one participants completed the behavioural influences assessments, knowledge and skills both improved after the course and improvements were maintained at follow-up. Other behavioural influences did not show change over time. Completion of behaviours in a subset of 78 participants to SAFE standards varied widely, ranging from 10% for performing inflation breaths to 96% for measuring blood pressure before administering spinal anaesthetic. There is evidence of efficacy of the course to increase capabilities. However, for conclusions to be drawn about behavioural influences and behaviour change, more resources need to be made available for robust data collection.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a critical psychiatric condition that is spreading faster among adolescents than adults around the globe. In low and middle-income countries, married female adolescents are more vulnerable to MDD than unmarried female adolescents. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of MDD among currently married female adolescents (CMFAs) in Bangladesh and determine its association with sociodemographic factors, factors related to marriage and childbearing, and social safety. We used data from the Bangladesh Adolescent Health and Well-being Survey (BAHWS) 2019-20, the first national-level survey conducted on adolescents ages 15-19 in Bangladesh. The BAHWS 2019-20 included a total of 2408 CMFAs aged 15-19 years and collected depression data using the modified Indian Bangla version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which is specific to adolescents. We used multivariable logistic regression and Poisson regression with robust variance to examine the factors associated with MDD. The estimated prevalence of MDD among CMFAs aged 15-19 years is 14.6%. The odds of MDD did not vary by age, education, wealth, residence type, or region. The CMFAs who felt connected with their husband and mother-in-law were 31% (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.91) and 34% (aOR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.47-0.92) less likely to have MDD than the rest, respectively. The odds of MDD were almost 2-fold (aOR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.24-2.52) among pregnant CMFAs than their non-pregnant counterparts. We found significantly higher odds of MDD among CMFAs who experienced physical violence from their husbands (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.31-2.85) or others (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.15-3.71), any form of sexual harassment (aOR = 2.25-95% CI = 1.49-3.42), and cyberbullying (aOR = 3.73; 95% CI = 2.01-6.93) than those who did not experience such adverse events. We observed a high prevalence of MDD among CMFAs, without clustering in any specific sociodemographic group. It is associated with not feeling connected with husband and mother-in-law, having a health condition (pregnancy), and experiencing physical, sexual, and cyber abuse. Findings suggest integrating mental health programs in maternity care and preventing violence against women may help prevent and manage MDD.",

        "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are essential for individuals' health, well-being, survival, and economic development. A stakeholder-led approach to research prioritisation was essential to guide SRHR-related research in Bangladesh. Accordingly, we conducted a research prioritisation exercise to identify health research priorities related to SRHR in Bangladesh. We adopted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method for this study. Five themes - adolescent Health (AH), fertility, gynaecological issues (GI), maternal and neonatal health (MNH), and SRH of key populations (SRHKP) - were selected from the broader field of SRHR. Seventy-six experts submitted 454 research questions (RQs), which were then condensed into 197 unique RQs and distributed to all experts for scoring based on five pre-selected criteria. Weighted and unweighted research priority scores (RPS) and average expert agreement (AEA) were calculated to compile a list of top-ranked RQs. The weighted RPSs for the 197 RQs ranged from 0.944 to 0.623, with a median of 0.848. Among the top 20 list, six RQs belonged to AH, one to Fertility, two to GI, six to MNH, and five to SRHKP. For AH, top ranked RQs included adolescent pregnancy, sexual health education, and mental health. Promoting proper birth spacing among newlywed and underaged married women were top RQs for fertility. GI priorities emphasised early detection of gynaecological cancers, including HPV testing for cervical cancer screening. The MNH research focused on Newborn Stabilizing Units at sub-district hospitals, PPH bundle approaches, and counselling on danger signs to prevent adverse birth outcomes. The top-ranked RQs in SRHKP addressed stigma and discrimination towards key populations (KPs) and their impact on SRH behaviours. There was significant overlap between the top 20 RQs ranked by RPS and AEA. The study emphasises the need for intervention research to address barriers, assess effectiveness, and enhance the uptake of evidence-based and innovative interventions for SRHR in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the key determinants and barriers to effective WASH facilities in Bangladesh, which are crucial for mitigating health issues and ensuring equitable access. By analyzing the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data and accounting for design clustering using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), this study's methodology demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional logistic regression, as supported by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio test (LRT). The study found that basic handwashing facility was significantly linked to the household head's age, partner's education, media exposure, women's empowerment, wealth index, and maternal factors such as - age and education of mothers of under 5 children. Basic sanitation was associated with regional factors, the household head's sex and age, household size, partner's education, working status, wealth index, and maternal factors. Access to basic drinking water was largely driven by the wealth index, while combined WASH facilities were influenced by household head's sex and age, household size, partner's education, working status, media exposure, wealth index, and maternal characteristics. The findings indicate that addressing WASH challenges in Bangladesh requires an integrated, multi-dimensional policy approach that considers key socio-demographic and economic factors-a strategy essential for achieving 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).",

        "abstract": "Climate change and health issues pose a global threat, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh. Within the socio-economic structure in coastal regions, women played a crucial role in contributing livelihood and living resources, while new climatic ecology creates chaotic relationships between environment and human health. The emerging adverse climatic ecology is directly and indirectly affecting them in the sphere of their both outdoor and indoor activism. This study explores the health impacts of climate change on the women of reproductive age (ages between 14 and 49 from the Bangladeshi perspective) living in coastal communities, i.e., Satkhira, Bangladesh. To choose study locations, this study conducted a literature survey to find out the most vulnerable coastal region of Bangladesh. The study has selected the five most vulnerable unions of Shyamnagar upazila in Satkhira district. This study adopted a multi-method approach combining in-depth interviews and KIIs. Based on this methodological guide, this study interviewed 25 women and 5 married men, while their responses have further been supplemented and validated by KIIs with health workers and medical officers. Findings show that climate change posture to new climatic ecology facilitating adverse situations that lead to the intrusion of saline water within communities, lack of fresh and drinkable water, women exposure to waterborne diseases resulting from both salinity and scarcity of fresh usable water, skin disorders, gynaecological and reproductive illnesses, and vector-borne diseases. Women also bear an encountered burden in their struggle to acquire water and good health, including limited hygiene facilities and maternal care. This dilemma is even worsened during the summer season, which exposes women to heat waves, resulting in physical complications such as anaemia, pregnancy risks, heat stroke, dehydration, hypertension and psychological complications like anxiety, stress and depression. Breaches in awareness and prevention practices were outlined from the study, as there is a need to realize integrated solutions to address the environmental and health challenges of the populations. Further, there is an absolute need to continue improving access to safe water, healthcare services, and education as a way to build resilience in affected communities.",

        "abstract": "In 2021, over 1.5 million adolescents (aged 10-19 years) and young adults (aged 20-24 years) died globally, approximately 4500 deaths daily. However, research on causes and factors influencing deaths among adolescents and young adults in Bangladesh is limited. We aimed to address this gap by identifying the leading causes of mortality and the factors affecting adolescent and young adult deaths. We conducted two cross-sectional, population-based surveys in urban Dhaka (December 2022) and rural Sitakunda (May 2023), covering 53 680 households and 250 249 individuals, with 72 530 aged 10-24 years. Between 2018-22, 163 deaths in this age group were recorded. We conducted verbal autopsies using the World Health Organization tool and assigned causes of death using the InSilicoVA algorithm. With descriptive statistics, we reported cause-specific mortality and utilised Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations with background characteristics. Road traffic accidents were the primary cause of death, accounting for 10% (n = 17) among adolescents and 10% (n = 16) among young adults, followed by respiratory diseases (14% in adolescents and 3% in young adults). Older adolescents (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-3.0) and young adults (AHR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-1.4) had a higher risk of death compared to early adolescents. Individuals with high wealth status had a lower risk of death (AHR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3-0.8) compared to those with low wealth status. Adolescents and young adults with no education had a higher likelihood of dying compared to those with education (AHR = 5.6; 95% CI = 3.7-8.2). To prevent untimely mortality among adolescents and young adults, efforts should prioritise leading causes such as road traffic accidents and respiratory diseases, and address vulnerabilities among rural residents, the uneducated, and those with low socioeconomic status. We recommend strengthening existing health programs for adolescents and young adults to reduce preventable deaths.",

        "abstract": "Maternity care satisfaction for pregnant women and recently delivered mothers is linked to both short- and long-term complications. For health care providers, dissatisfaction can lead to high turnover, reduced efficiency, and decreased service quality. Increased midwifery care coverage enhances satisfaction; however, the Government of Bangladesh-sanctioned midwife positions are limited to the primary health care level only, not extending to secondary or tertiary health tiers. We aimed to evaluate the impact of introducing midwifery care at secondary-level health care facilities in Bangladesh by comparing the satisfaction levels of both providers and patients with those receiving regular care. We conducted a quasi-experimental study from September 2021 to December 2023 at two secondary-level health facilities - Sunamganj District Hospital (DH) (intervention) and Khagrachari DH (control). The primary outcome was the mean (x̄) percentage score of maternal satisfaction with antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) services, along with providers' satisfaction regarding their working environment, training, logistical support, and overall patient and service satisfaction at both facilities. We screened for eligibility a total of 200 pregnant women or recently delivered mothers who visited the facility for ANC, delivery, or PNC services. The satisfaction scores were significantly higher among women who received midwifery care compared to those who received regular care. The scores were for ANC x̄ = 97.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 96.6-99.0) vs. x̄ = 71.0 (95% CI = 68.7-73.4), for delivery x̄ = 97.9 (95% CI = 97.4-98.3) vs. x̄ = 83.3 (95% CI = 80.2-86.3), and for PNC x̄ = 97.5 (95% CI = 96.5-98.4) vs. x̄ = 77.7 (95% CI = 73.8-81.6). Similarly, the satisfaction score among midwives was significantly higher than among providers in regular care facilities (x̄ = 88.7; 95% CI = 82.9-94.5 vs. x̄ = 77.7; 95% CI = 73.0-82.3).

Reducing child mortality and improving health are central to this mission, particularly through breastfeeding and complementary feeding. This study aims to analyse these practices in Belize using data from three past Multi Indicator Cluster Studies (MICS) and conducted a research study that explores barriers and factors influencing breastfeeding, including the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, with a focus on maternal mental health. The study examines breastfeeding within the first hour after birth, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months (EBF), and continued breastfeeding for up to two years and beyond. A mixed-methods design was used, combining quantitative MICS data (2006, 2011, 2015-16), desk reviews, and qualitative data collected in Belize in August-September 2022, to assess the context and psychosocial factors, including maternal mental health, that influence breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices among caregivers. Data collection involved 45 face-to-face interviews mainly with female caretakers of children under two, Key Informant Interviews, and Focus Group Discussions with caretakers and healthcare staff. Maternal mental health was assessed using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The findings indicate that two out of three children were not exclusively breastfed for the first six months. Among the 45 interviewed caretakers, 93% reported overall breastfeeding (exclusive, non-exclusive, or complementary), 82% practiced EBF during the first six months, and 78% breastfed within one hour after birth. While general breastfeeding was common, EBF showed increasing trends, and early initiation was less frequent. Half of the woman interviewed were at risk of common mental health disorders. There was no significant direct association between mental health and breastfeeding. Correlation analysis showed that mothers with poorer mental health had more children, less education, lower socioeconomic status, and greater awareness of breastfeeding barriers. While breastfeeding rates in Belize are improving, psychosocial vulnerabilities persist. Indirect links between maternal mental health and structural disadvantage, as well as the identified barriers to breastfeeding highlight the need for integrated, equity-focused public health interventions to enhance breastfeeding outcomes and address broader child nutrition challenges.",

Despite its high prevalence, maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding zinc deficiency remain understudied, especially in vulnerable coastal regions. Hence, this study aimed to assess maternal KAP relating to zinc deficiency and explore their interrelationships using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in coastal Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to July 2023 across three coastal districts (Noakhali, Lakshmipur, and Chattogram) of Bangladesh. Data were collected from 378 mothers with under-five children using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. SEM was employed to assess the relationships among maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding zinc deficiency. The majority of mothers (96 %) exhibited low knowledge about zinc deficiency, while around 41 % held positive attitudes toward addressing zinc deficiency, and only 10 % reported good practices related to addressing zinc deficiency. SEM analysis revealed a significant positive effect of maternal knowledge on maternal attitudes toward zinc deficiency (β = 0.03, <i>P</i> = 0.003). Additionally, maternal attitudes toward zinc deficiency had a significant and notable influence on practices related to addressing zinc deficiency (β = 0.08, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Maternal KAP regarding zinc deficiency was suboptimal, with attitudes serving as a key driver of practices. Interventions should prioritize community-based education and attitude modification to improve zinc-related practices and mitigate deficiency in coastal Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Early Childhood Development (ECD) inequality among different socioeconomic groups is a rising concern in developing countries. This paper aimed to identify and decompose the ECD inequality among poor and non-poor groups in Bangladesh. For measuring inequality in ECD, concentration curves and their corresponding indices were used in this study utilizing the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019 data. Furthermore, a standard decomposition approach has been used to decompose the inequality. Findings reveal that children from poor families consistently exhibit lower scores across all ECD domains. Notably, a significant disparity exists in the literacy-numeracy domain, with a concentration index of 0.1825. A lower proportion of poor children (34.17%) meet developmental milestones compared to their well-off counterparts (65.83%). Key determinants influencing ECD outcomes among the poor group include attendance at early childhood education (ECE) programs, sex of the child, multiple childcare involvement of mother, and supervision quality. Additionally, wealth-based disparities in ECD outcomes can be attributed to factors such as maternal education, access to books, nutrition, and the quality of childcare provided. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy reforms aimed at addressing the specific needs of disadvantaged children, especially for literacy and numeracy skills. By prioritizing poverty reduction initiatives, access to quality Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs, provision of books, improving maternal education, and enhancing supervision quality, efforts can be made to narrow the wealth-based gap in ECD.",

Using data from a randomized trial of azithromycin for watery diarrhea (NCT03130114), we develop personalized treatment rules given sets of diagnostic, child, and clinical characteristics, employing a robust ensemble machine learning-based procedure. This procedure estimates the child-level expected benefit for a given set of covariates by combining predictions from a library of statistical models. For each rule, we estimate the proportion treated under the rule and the average benefits of treatment. Among 6692 children, treatment under the most comprehensive rule is recommended on average for one third of children. The risk of diarrhea on day 3 is 10.1% lower (95% CI: 5.4, 14.9) with azithromycin compared to placebo among children recommended for treatment (NNT: 10). For day 90 re-hospitalization and death, risk is 2.4% lower (95% CI: 0.6, 4.1; NNT: 42). While pathogen diagnostics are strong determinants of azithromycin effects on diarrhea duration, host characteristics may better predict benefits for re-hospitalization or death. This suggests that targeting antibiotic treatment for severe outcomes among children with watery diarrhea may be possible without access to pathogen diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The children of female sex workers are the victims of their circumstances from the beginning and are deprived of an environment that encourages optimal physical and psychological development. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among adolescent offspring of female sex workers and compare that with adolescent offspring of slum-dwellers in Daulatdia and Dhaka city, Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 394 adolescent children (196 adolescent offspring of sex workers and 198 adolescent offspring of slum dwellers) from March 2024 to May 2024 using a structured questionnaire. The study was conducted through face-to-face interviews where sociodemographic details, along with information regarding emotional and behavioral health problems, were assessed through the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scale, and health-related quality of life was assessed through the Kidscreen-10 scale. Descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis, and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems was 13% for adolescent offspring of Daulatdia and 15% for Korail slum. Age and gender in brothel settings and HRQoL in both settings were found to be significantly associated with emotional and behavioral difficulties. Adolescent offspring of FSWs with low HRQoL (OR = 4.09, p-value < 0.05, CI 1.579-10.595) were 4.09 times more likely to suffer from abnormal mental disorders than those with average or high HRQoL. While in a slum setting, it is 2.825 times higher (OR = 2.825, p-value < 0.05, CI 1.142-6.987). The study concluded that the overall prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems for adolescent offspring of FSWs was significantly lower than for adolescent offspring of slum dwellers in the emotional problem subscale. Tailored interventions should be developed to address the specific needs of individuals with emotional and behavioral health problems while minimizing the detrimental impacts of their stigmatized identity.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between economic growth and nutrition is not yet fully understood in the context of the new nutrition reality where most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face an increasing double burden of malnutrition. We aimed to investigate the association between early life exposure to economic shocks and multiple forms of childhood malnutrition in LMICs. We pooled cross-sectional data on children younger than 5 years from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 1990 to 2022 and longitudinal income data from the World Inequality Database. An economic shock was defined as any negative income growth and was tested at intensity levels of less than -1%, -5%, and -10%. Malnutrition outcomes variables comprised stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, concurrent wasting and stunting (WaSt), and double burden of malnutrition (child is both stunted and overweight). Adjusted associations of economic shocks, at different critical windows (year of the interview, birth, first 1000 days of life), with malnutrition outcomes were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression models with robust errors. The associations were interpreted using prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs. A total of 1 643 898 children across 230 surveys in 68 LMICs were included in this study. Negative income shocks in the year of interview were associated with a 5·4% (PR 1·054 [95% CI 1·029-1·080]) increase in the prevalence of wasting and a 12·7% (1·127 [1·079-1·176]) increase in severe wasting. A dose-response association according to the intensity levels of income shock in the year of birth was found for stunting (-1%: PR 1·019 [95% CI 1·011-1·027]; -5%: 1·033 [1·025-1·042]; and -10%: 1·061 [1·051-1·072]) and severe stunting (-1%: 1·041 [1·026-1·055]; -5%: 1·059 [1·044-1·074]; and -10%: 1·099 [1·081-1·118]). In children aged 2-4 years, income shocks during the first 1000 days of life strongly increased the prevalence of double burden of malnutrition by 30·3% (PR 1·303 [95% CI 1·221-1·391]), obesity by 14·3% (1·143 [1·046-1·249]), and overweight by 13·8% (1·138 [1·090-1·188]). We also found a strong dose-response association between the intensity of income shock during the first 1000 days and double burden of malnutrition (-1%: PR 1·216 [95% CI 1·141-1·295]; -5%: 1·299 [1·192-1·416]; -10%: 1·350 [1·185-1·537]). Exposure to negative income shocks can significantly increase the risk of various forms of malnutrition during childhood, with critical windows of vulnerability that vary based on the timing of economic instability and the specific type of malnutrition. Policymakers and public health practitioners must recognise these critical periods and develop targeted interventions to safeguard maternal and child nutrition, particularly during times of economic crises.

        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) causes severe diseases in humans with a high case fatality rate. The primary risk factors for NiV infection in Bangladesh are drinking raw date palm sap (DPS) contaminated with Pteropus fruit bat secretions/excretions or close contact with or exposure to the body fluid of an individual with NiV infection. During the 2023 NiV outbreak investigation in Bangladesh, the breast milk of a NiV-infected nursing mother was tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of NiV-RNA. The newborn was also tested as a suspected NiV-infected subject. NiV, specifically NiV RNA, was detected in the breast milk sample. Through the investigation, it was determined that the mother consumed raw DPS 9 days before the delivery. The newborn was also confirmed as NiV positive and had exposure to maternal bodily fluid while breastfeeding, and was in prolonged maternal contact during caregiving. Although the detection of NiV RNA in breast milk does not equate to viability and transmissibility of the virus, this finding provides preliminary evidence that warrants further investigation into the potential role of breast milk in postnatal transmission of NiV. Our findings advocate incorporating breast milk testing into NiV diagnostic protocols for symptomatic mothers. This advancement will broaden our understanding of postnatal transmission of NiV and pave the way for more effective containment strategies.",

        "abstract": "A Stillbirth is the birth of a newborn after 28th completed week (weighing 1000 gm or more) when the baby does not breathe or show any signs of life after delivery. It has an enormous impact on mothers, families, health care professionals and the community. Bangladesh has high stillbirth rate due to lack of access to antenatal care, home trial, high parity, social norms and customs etc. Multiple maternal and fetal risk factors have been identified that are associated with stillbirth. This study is intended to provide information for proper antepartum surveillance and also build up awareness in the community to prevent perinatal mortality. Objective of this study was evaluation of risk factors associated with stillbirth. This was cross-sectional observational study conducted from 10th February 2019 to 10th August 2019. Consecutive 100 pregnant women admitted in Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of MMCH and had delivered stillbirth baby were included in the study. Data was collected through a pre-designed questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS Version 26.0. In this study, 76.0% women were found between 20 to 30 years of age. Most of the women studied were gravida second and third (72.0%). Most stillbirth baby were preterm with gestational age between 35 to 36 weeks (60.0%). Maternal hypertensive disorder was the commonest medical disorder associated with stillbirth (34.0%), followed by DM (6.0%). Obstetric complications associated with stillbirth were PROM (12.0%), prolonged labour (8.0%), obstructed labour (5.0%), abruptio placentae (6.0%), placenta praevia (2.0%) and cord accident (6.0%). Fetal factor accounted for 8.0% of stillbirth of which majority was due to multiple congenital anomalies (6.0%). Apparently no identifiable risk factors were found in 8.0% cases. It was observed that maternal hypertensive disorders were the predominant risk factors of stillbirth. Majority of women had emergency admission and did not receive adequate antenatal care at all. Significant proportion of stillbirth was preventable by proper and regular antenatal checkup, timely referral and hospital delivery.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the current state of andrology practice worldwide, identifies challenges faced by clinicians, and explores training, certification, and research opportunities. It also seeks to redefine the qualifications necessary to be recognized as an andrologist and to propose areas for standardization and improvement. A global, cross-sectional survey was conducted using a 48-question online questionnaire designed by international experts. The survey, distributed in English, covered various domains of modern andrology practice. Responses from 405 participants across 59 countries were analyzed using R version 4.1.2, with categorical variables reported as frequencies and percentages. Among respondents, 47.3% held medical doctor (MD) degrees, with urologists (31.1%) and clinical andrologists (25.3%) being the most represented specialties. Formal, board-certified andrological training was reported as available in only 48.1% of countries. While half of the respondents identified as andrologists based on experience, only one-third did so through certification, obtained from diverse, nationally recognized organizations. The primary areas of practice included male infertility (36.7%), male sexual dysfunction (27.2%), and sexually transmitted infections (14.5%). Many participants were actively engaged in assisted reproductive technologies, imaging, and andrological surgical emergencies. Despite strong interest in clinical, basic, and translational research, respondents highlighted significant challenges, including inconsistent training pathways, insufficient certification standards, and the complexity of managing diverse andrological conditions. Andrology is an evolving multidisciplinary specialty where board-certified urologists, clinical andrologists, and reproductive medicine specialists collaborate to address male reproductive and sexual health challenges. Despite their advanced competencies in medical, surgical, and laboratory interventions, specialists face significant global disparities in training and certification. This survey highlights the urgent need for standardized training, evidence-based guidelines, and unified certification to ensure consistency, enhance patient care, and advance andrology's academic and clinical excellence worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining an appropriate gap between childbirths is essential for promoting the health of both the mother and the child. This practice lowers the risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Inadequate birth spacing is a multifaceted issue linked to increase infant mortality and has the potential to impact the health and demographic landscape of the nation. This study aims to assess the prevalence of short birth spacing (SBS) in association with demographic and socio-economic factors in India with special reference to maternal and child health. This study investigated SBS in India using a cross-sectional design and data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The analysis included data from 636,699 households, encompassing 724,115 women and 139,660 birth intervals. The primary outcome was SBS, and secondary outcomes included maternal undernutrition, full antenatal care (ANC), low birth weight (LBW), infant mortality, and child mortality. The analysis incorporated demographic and socio-economic variables as explanatory factors for SBS. Data analysis was conducted after checking its normality. The data characteristics were summarised and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In India, SBS is more prevalent (50.8%) with a median of 32 months. Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have shortest spacing (27 months), while Lakshadweep has longest (63.9 months). The Central zone has highest SBS prevalence (53.8%), especially in rural areas (55.9%). SBS is significantly associated with lack of maternal education, younger maternal age, unwanted pregnancies, larger families, and poor wealth index. Additionally, it is found that the explanatory variables have a significant impact on SBS, with area under the curve (AUC) covering 68% to 71% (p < 0.001). Furthermore, SBS has a detrimental effect on maternal and child health as secondary outcomes. This study emphasizes the substantial influence of socio-demographic factors on the practice of SBS. It is crucial to provide educational programs for mothers that focus on the importance of birth spacing and using family planning services. The study highlights the need to implement economic development initiatives within families to address the factors contributing to inadequate birth spacing. These measures enhance maternal and child health and align with the SDGs in India.",

        "abstract": "Despite the global burden of stunting, data regarding the determinants of stunting observed on follow-up after discharge from health care facilities among children treated for severe diarrhoea are limited. We investigated factors influencing stunting during post-discharge follow-up among under-2 children treated for severe diarrhoea. We developed a predictive model to estimate stunting prevalence and identify risk factors without post-discharge anthropometry. We analysed data from two sites in Bangladesh participating in the multi-country, double-blind, randomised clinical trial on Antibiotics for Children with Severe Diarrhoea among children aged 2-23 months, from 2017 to 2019. Severe diarrhoea was defined as a child who had acute diarrhoea with severe/some dehydration, or moderate wasting, or severe stunting on admission. Multiple linear regression was constructed to predict the independent factors associated with stunting among the enrolled children who were followed for 180 days after hospital discharge. We developed a predictive model for stunting using 75% of the available data for training, with the remaining 25% reserved as a test set to evaluate model performance. We then applied this predictive model to the children not enrolled in the trial but admitted to the hospital for diarrhoea to estimate the predictive prevalence and determinants of post-discharge stunting at 180 days. Of the 1431 enrolled children, 589 (41.2%) were stunted at enrolment. By day 180, stunting increased to 698 (49.3%). Linear growth of diarrhoeal children over this follow-up period was positively associated with enrolment length-for-age z score (LAZ), maternal body mass index (BMI), maternal education, duration of diarrhoea, and breastfeeding. We applied the predictive model developed on the enrolled patients' data to the 33 341 children admitted for diarrhoea but not enrolled in the trial. The model estimated that 6142 children (18.4%) in this non-follow-up group would have been stunted at 180 days. Persistent stunting at 180 days for these not-followed children was predicted to be positively associated with dehydration on admission and a higher number of children in the household, while a negative association was predicted with formal parental education and increased maternal BMI. Our study highlights the need for targeted interventions to mitigate persistent stunting in this vulnerable group recovering from diarrhoea.",

        "abstract": "The WHO's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) in young infants <2 months of age includes the identification and management of signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI). However, equal importance is given to all the PSBI signs, which signal the need for referral and hospital management, except for fast breathing in infants aged 7-59 days, for which outpatient treatment by clinical staff working at a health facility is recommended. Moreover, studies to validate the importance of clinical signs of PSBI have mostly used the need for hospitalisation as the outcome. There is a need to further examine the association of signs of PSBI individually and in combination with risk of mortality and to analyse global data to inform global recommendations. We will create a dataset that integrates data from population-based studies globally with similar designs that have examined the presence of signs of PSBI identified by frontline health workers throughout the young infant period (days 0 to <60) and that have also recorded infant vital status. We will conduct pooled, individual-level analyses of the frequency of identification of signs individually and in combinations and will conduct three types of analyses of association of signs of PSBI with mortality: (1) case fatality, which has been used in a multisite study of mortality risk associated with signs of PSBI in young infants in Africa; (2) Cox regression, which will enable time-varying analysis of exposure in relation to mortality, as has been done in a multisite study in Asia and (3) machine learning analysis, which has not previously been applied to any of the available data. All prior studies incorporated into our pooled analysis were approved by the independent local ethics committee/institutional review board (IRB) at each study site in each country, and all study participants provided informed consent. This project was approved by the Stanford University School of Medicine IRB protocol 74456.

        "abstract": "Numerous reviews have explored specific aspects of violence prevention apps, but given the rapid development of new apps, increased violence during COVID-19, and gaps in understanding functionalities and geographical distribution, an updated review is needed. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the trends, geographical distribution, functional categories, available features, and feature evolution of mobile apps designed to prevent violence against women and girls (VAWG). We conducted a systematic search on app reselling platforms and search engines from April 24, 2024 to May 28, 2024, using terms related to VAWG in multiple languages. We included apps meeting our criteria for addressing VAWG, without restrictions on date or language. We conducted content analysis of app and apps were categorized by functionality and feature type. We performed descriptive analyses, trend analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and geographical mapping. Out of 432 apps initially identified, 178 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 99 apps were available on both Google Play and the App Store, and 64 were exclusive to Google Play. Most apps were implemented in North America (48/178, 27%), followed by South Asia (31/178, 17%) and Europe and Central Asia (31/178, 17%). Emergency and support apps were most prevalent across regions. Most apps (132/178, 74%) originated from the private sector and were designed for survivor (121/178, 68%), were free without in-app purchases (100/178, 56%), had a website (148/178, 83%), and offered GPS features (142/178, 80%), but only 15% (27/178) provided offline functionality. App releases peaked in 2020 (33/178, 19%), followed by a decline. Regression analysis indicated a significant trend (P=.01) increase in app release, with a 2.40 unit increase per year before 2020 and a 7.01 unit decrease after, showing a post-2020 decline of 4.61 units per year. Apps were primarily categorized as emergency (n=110) or support (n=81), with most emergency apps in the 10,000 to ≥100,000 downloads range. Network analysis showed that emergency services (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911), location sharing (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911), SOS (Save Our Souls) alerts (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911), and educational resources (degree=10, clustering coefficient=0.911) features highly co-occurred in the same app. We found a gradual shift towards more sophisticated and comprehensive safety tools, evolving from basic GPS tracking and SOS alerts to advanced features such as real-time communication, panic buttons, peer support, and group communication, culminating in multifunctional platforms offering personalized safety, community engagement, and proactive risk identification. Most apps to prevent VAWG emphasize emergency and support functions, and although initial releases increased, there has been a recent decline, with a shift towards integrating more comprehensive safety solutions such as communication, reporting, and community engagement. Future app development should prioritize cross-platform availability, offline functionality, public sector collaboration, and the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence.",

        "title": "Comparing Folic Acid Interventions and Arsenic Reduction Strategies for Neural Tube Defect Prevention in Bangladesh: A Systematic Review and Decision Analysis.",
        "abstract": "Maternal intake of folic acid prevents most cases of neural tube defects (NTDs), and arsenic exposure may increase NTD risk. In Bangladesh, where arsenic exposures are high, understanding the potential impacts of arsenic reduction and folic acid-based interventions can guide decision-making. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of NTDs in Bangladesh. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Global Health, and Bangladesh Journals Online and extracted data using standardized forms. We used forest plots and random effects models to estimate the prevalence of all NTDs and spina bifida. Decision analysis used assumptions from the literature to compare expected NTD prevalence under strategies incorporating combinations of folic acid supplementation, fortification, and arsenic filters. Sensitivity analyses aimed to quantify the influence of adherence to supplements on estimates. Eleven studies were included. Prevalences of NTD and spina bifida were 27.4 and 11.2 per 10,000 births, respectively; however, when estimated from population red blood cell folate concentrations, NTD prevalence was higher in both high arsenic exposure (drinking water ≥ 50 μg/L) and lower arsenic exposure groups (34.3 and 25.3 per 10,000 births, respectively). Folic acid fortification reduced the prevalence of NTDs to 11.1 and 9.1 per 10,000 births among high exposure and low exposure groups, respectively. Arsenic filters provided little marginal benefit. Benefits of supplements equaled those of fortification when adherence to supplements exceeded 90%. Bangladesh has high rates of NTDs and high arsenic exposures. Folic acid fortification is projected to be the most effective strategy for NTD prevention.",

        "title": "Prevalence and Determinants of the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure in Children Under Five Years in Bangladesh: Insights From a National Survey.",
        "abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a significant public health issue in Bangladesh, with high rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight. The Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) offers a comprehensive tool for assessing overall undernutrition. Although previous studies in Bangladesh have utilized CIAF, they have relied on older datasets. Estimating the current status is essential for designing and implementing targeted interventions due to the dynamic nature of undernutrition. This study aimed to provide updated insights by analyzing the CIAF and its determinants among children under 5 years, using the most recent 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data. A total of 3950 under-5-year-old children were included. The modified Poisson regression was employed to identify the associated factors. The overall prevalence of CIAF was 33.7%, with subgroups of wasted and underweight (4.7%), stunted and underweight (10.8%), wasting, stunting, and underweight (3.4%), only wasted (3%), only stunted (8.8%), and only underweight (3%). Factors associated with higher risk of CIAF included older aged child, higher birth order (ARR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08-1.58), smaller birth size (ARR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.24-1.70), uneducated mothers (ARR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.16-1.93), maternal underweight (ARR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13-1.46), short stature (ARR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.40-1.70). Children from the poorest households (ARR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.53) and Sylhet (ARR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02-1.47) also had a higher risk. This study suggests strengthening community-based nutrition-specific programs along with improving access to healthcare, family planning, food assistance, and income opportunities to reduce child undernutrition in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) Framework has been instrumental in helping countries plan and monitor maternal health services for over 20 years. Given evolving health systems, the changing expectations of both patients and health providers, and the expanded evidence base, the \"Re-Visioning EmONC\" project was initiated to update this framework to better meet countries' needs. To understand the needs of its primary intended users, the project used human-centered design (HCD) to conduct in-depth studies in three countries with extensive experience using the EmONC Framework: Bangladesh, Malawi, and Senegal. The study employed HCD methods to conduct interviews, focus groups, and consultative workshops with 337 participants (e.g., health managers, health providers, and service users) across the three countries. Each country team developed their own themes to explore within the boundaries of the overall Re-Visioning EmONC project's global objectives and developed unique generative activities based on the primary research questions and the category of participants. Multi-stage data analysis was conducted using affinity diagrams and either atlas.ti or Nvivo. Seven key cross-country insights emerged that together can be summarized as follows: when health systems fail, the burden of accessing and providing EmONC shifts to individuals - women, families, and health providers - who must improvise solutions, leading not only to poor quality of care, but also to huge out of pocket expenses, poor wellbeing and a profound mistrust in each other and in the system. The insights informed revisions to the EmONC Framework, including enhanced guidance on context-specific planning, new indicators for facility readiness, incorporation of workforce wellbeing, and increased focus on integrated maternal-newborn care. The HCD approach enabled meaningful integration of user perspectives into the revised EmONC Framework. The revised framework provides a roadmap for strengthening health systems and improving outcomes for women with obstetric complications and small and sick newborns.",

        "abstract": "Evidence regarding the impact of the private health sector on healthcare outcomes is often fragmented. Knowledge gaps remain around the impact of private sector care on health outcomes. This systematic review examines the quality of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care delivery by private sector providers. The review aims to systematically assess the evidence from studies reporting outcome data on morbidity and mortality among mothers, newborns, and children. Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, EconLit, Excerpta Medica Database, International Bibliography of the Social Science, Popline, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) and two websites and supplemented with hand-searches and expert recommendations. We conducted the searches and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA method. For inclusion, studies in low- and middle-income countries must have examined at least one of the following primary outcomes: maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, newborn morbidity, newborn mortality, child morbidity, or child mortality. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 46 studies included, most studies were conducted in India, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Kenya. Thirty-six studies were quantitative, and over one-third implemented a specific intervention that went beyond the broad delivery of quality care in the private sector. Studies indicated that the outcomes of private sector delivery of MNCH care across health systems were mixed. Studies frequently reported on the utilization of health facilities for the treatment of morbidities. Interventions to improve MNCH care included improved coverage and contracting services, community-based training, and public-private partnerships. Studies often did not provide greater contextual detail, including the complexities and realities of people seeking care across provider types. Future research should disaggregate data on quality of care, as well as describe the methods and specific facility details in their sample.",

We also find improvements in other health inputs (e.g., antenatal care) and in child health outcomes (e.g., mortality).

        "abstract": "Worldwide, hypertension is more prevalent among men aged 30 and older, but a national survey from Bangladesh shows a different trend. This paper explores the differences in hypertension by sex and age among the Bangladeshi adult population throughout their life span. We conducted the secondary analysis using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. This nationally representative survey involved a two-stage stratified sample of 675 households in urban (250) and rural (425) enumeration areas (EAs). The analytical sample comprised 12 476 individuals aged 18 or older (6955 women and 5521 men). We performed univariate and bivariate tests to investigate variations in hypertension across sex, age, and other factors. We applied multivariable logistic regression models and logit-based marginal probabilities to explore age and sex differences as well as their interactions in hypertension while estimating the marginal effects of sex for each age group to assess the significance of sex differentials in hypertension throughout the life course. Our study revealed a noteworthy trend: Women have a hypertension prevalence that is five percentage points lower than that of men in their early twenties. However, this trend reverses in their early thirties, with women exhibiting a five-percentage point higher prevalence than men. After adjusting for confounders and age-sex interactions in women, the odds of hypertension were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.6) in the 35-39-year-old age group, which may contribute to a combined burden of chronic and reproductive morbidity. With rising hypertension and stagnant maternal health in Bangladesh, women of reproductive age face higher risks of chronic and reproductive complications. The complex health system in Bangladesh, which starts at the community level, primarily focuses on maternal and child health; however, some recent initiatives show a shift in focus to address significant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through public health facilities. Considering that more women seek health care from public facilities, recognising common factors contributing to early hypertension in Bangladeshi women enables targeted interventions, model testing, and strategic adjustments to the primary health care-focused national non-communicable disease management pathway.",

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies were those that reported on menopause-related knowledge, symptom prevalence or management in LMICs. Data were extracted and synthesised descriptively and thematically. From 10,758 records, 252 studies from 41 LMICs were included. Most were cross-sectional (85%) and relied on non-probability sampling (62%), with only 4% being nationally representative. Menopause classification methods were often inconsistent, with only 17.5% of studies using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) +10 or World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. National-level data on age at menopause are lacking across all LMICs. The prevalences of vasomotor symptoms, joint pain and sexual concerns were comparable with high-income countries. However, data on the severity and burden of symptoms were scarce. Knowledge about menopause and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was poor, especially in low-income and rural settings. Cultural stigma, misconceptions and healthcare provider knowledge gaps contributed to low uptake of evidence-based menopause care. MHT use was consistently low, with women predominantly using traditional remedies. Provider hesitancy, lack of training and structural health system barriers were key limitations in service delivery. Despite a growing population of postmenopausal women, menopause remains a neglected health issue across LMICs. There is an urgent need to integrate menopause into reproductive and non-communicable disease policies, invest in provider education and ensure equitable access to evidence-based menopause care, including MHT, for women in LMICs.",

This study using Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data, 2017-18 examined the effects of different migration streams on maternal healthcare service utilization, particularly four or more antenatal care (≥4 ANC) visits and institutional delivery (ID) care services. The analysis identified significant variations in using antenatal and institutional delivery care services between migrants and non-migrants. The rural non-migrants were found to be the most disadvantaged group, particularly when different forms of migration streams were considered. For instance, after adjusting for covariates, urban to urban migrants (≥4 ANC = 1.866, <i>p</i> < 0.01; ID = 2.247, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and urban to rural migrants (≥ 4 ANC = 1.24, <i>p</i> > 0.05; ID = 1.689, <i>p</i> < 0.05) were more likely to utilize both types of maternal healthcare services than rural non-migrants. However, migrants of all streams were less likely to use any type of maternal healthcare services when compared against the urban non-migrants. Addressing the effects of migration in designing and implementing maternal healthcare service delivery programs may address the needs and challenges faced by migrants.",

        "abstract": "In women during pregnancy and in infants during the first months after birth, skin health is challenged. However, evidence about the structural and functional changes of the skin during and after pregnancy is largely lacking. The first prospective cohort study was conducted, following women from pregnancy through the postpartum period and their infants until 6 months of age, with skin structure and function measured at different time points. Due to the explorative character of the study, descriptive statistics were used. Over the study period, transepidermal water loss, epidermal thickness, and skin roughness in women increased. Pregnancy and postpartum period affected skin parameters such as skin roughness, epidermal thickness, and transepidermal water loss, whereas stratum corneum hydration, pH, skin stiffness, and skin elasticity were not affected in women. Infants' skin barrier function matched literature values for healthy skin, with roughness and dryness decreasing through 6 months of age. Infants' skin barrier function characteristics matched literature values for healthy skin, with skin roughness and dryness decreasing by 6 months of age. Based on the findings of this observational cohort study, we found no statistically significant correlation between maternal health and skin characteristics and skin characteristics of infants except for women's skin roughness and infants' skin stiffness and skin elasticity and women's skin stiffness and skin elasticity and infants' skin elasticity. Therefore, based on our findings it may be justified to consider using skin care for maintaining barrier quality and function: (a) in pregnant women with a positive effect on skin roughness and transepidermal water loss and (b) in infants improving dry skin and skin roughness.",

This study investigated the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women and cord blood Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity of their newborns in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, and South Africa. Randomly selected paired maternal and cord blood samples (n = 101 each site) taken at delivery were tested for HBsAg and Hepatitis B extractable antigen (HBeAg) in the women using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Similarly, cord blood sample of newborn was assessed for HBsAg reactivity. HBV DNA was quantified using the Xpert® HBV viral load assay, followed by genotyping. The overall prevalence of maternal HBsAg positivity was 5.5 % (95 %CI: 0.4 %-7.1 %; n = 50/909). HBsAg positivity was higher in African countries (7.3 %; 95 %CI: 5.4 %-9.6 %; n = 44/606) compared to South Asian countries (2.0 %; 95 %CI: 0.8 %-4.3 %; n = 6/303; p = 0.002).

No cord blood HBsAg positivity was observed in South Asia. Genotypic analysis revealed HBV genotypes A (41.7 %) and E (58.3 %) were pre-dominant. The high rate of cord blood positivity (28.0 %) for HBsAg underscores the urgency of enhancing HBV prevention strategies to meet the World Health Organization's target of a 90 % reduction in new HBV infections by 2030.",

This study assessed maternal awareness of self-harm prevalence and associated risk factors among high school children in rural and urban Bangladesh. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2024 in 16 purposively selected schools (eight rural, eight urban) across three divisions of Bangladesh. A total of 480 randomly selected mothers of children in grades six-ten were interviewed using pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics summarized demographics and regression identified self-harm risk factors. The awareness about children's self-harm was higher among urban mother's (30 %) compared to rural mother's (23.3 %). More urban mothers were concern of self-harm among high school going children as a significant issue (85.8 % vs. 35.8 %, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and were more likely to seek additional information and resources (98.3 % vs. 75 %, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) to get a solution. Cutting and hitting were the common methods of self-harm in both settings, while starvation was more prevalent in urban areas (30.6 % vs. 10.7 %). Emotional distress, academic pressures, and social media were key triggers for urban adolescents, while rural children faced more family-related stressors. Urban parents were more inclined to seek professional help (22.2 % vs. 3.6 %, <i>p</i> < 0.05), while rural parents preferred community counseling. Significant rural-urban disparities exist among mother's awareness on self-harm and associated risk factors. Interventions to control emotional distress, academic pressure, and family related stressors are essential to address self-harm among adolescents in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Despite numerous efforts, South Asia is the second most leading region for maternal mortality and morbidity. Although there have been notable advancements on this continent, progress in maternal healthcare access has been slow. Inequalities remain in different maternal health services across diverse population groups. The aim of this study is to better understand the socioeconomic inequalities in maternal healthcare access in South Asian countries. Two databases (MEDLINE and Google Scholar) were searched for identifying studies. Studies with data on socioeconomic factors, maternal healthcare, inequality, and South-Asian countries were included. Mixed method appraisal tool was used for quality assessment of the identified studies. A total of 55 studies from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan were included in the final analysis. Overall, quantitative study showed that maternal healthcare access is linked to economic status, education, occupation, and women's autonomy. Qualitative studies demonstrated poverty, lack of awareness of complication and service and inability in decision making on healthcare was the reason for not accessing maternal health care. Significant finding from this review includes effect of education mostly evident after secondary education and paternal occupation was significant rather than maternal occupation. Findings of this review indicates a large disparity in access to maternal health care services. Policymakers should create interventions and financial schemes that are tailored to the mothers from low socioeconomic background.",

        "abstract": "Most vaccinations in the immunization schedule need two or more doses to elicit a protective immune response. Therefore, completion of all doses is crucial for achieving the best possible immunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing missed opportunities of polio vaccination in children between the ages of 1-3 years in urban Dhaka. In 2018, according to the immunization card records or histories from parents/guardians, we sorted1-3-year-old children from areas of Dhaka South City Corporation who were not fully immunized. Immunization records were obtained from the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) card or maternal recall. Reasons for non-vaccination were documented. A total of 501 children were tracked down to determine the causes of their incomplete polio doses. Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities were assessed by using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model. The households with a child who had not received all the recommended vaccines had a considerably lower monthly income (18,000 BDT; p < 0.001). In both the complete and partial vaccination groups, the average family size was five people, and the average child age was 28 months. Education level of the household head after adjustment (AOR), the odds of the event occurring decrease by 25% with primary education (95% CI: 0.66, 0.85), p-value: < 0.001). Occupation of the household head for rickshaw/van/cart puller, AOR, the odds increase even more, with the event being 3.15 times more likely for this occupation (95% CI: 1.95, 5.08) and statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Again, for daily wager AOR, 2.16 times higher for daily wagers (95% CI: 1.35, 3.45) and statistical significance (p-value: 0.001). This study identifies sociodemographic factors that influence incomplete childhood immunization in this urban area of Dhaka. In order to improve the coverage, the identified factors need to be mitigated and policymakers should focus on enhancing community engagement, combating misinformation and increasing the accessibility of vaccination services.",

        "abstract": "Community-based longitudinal data on factors linked to bacterial vaginosis (BV) during and after pregnancy in Bangladesh are limited. Using data from a rural randomized trial of vitamin A and β-carotene supplementation, we examined factors associated with Nugent-score-assessed BV. Self-collected vaginal swabs from 1,812 participants were obtained in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and 3 months postpartum for Nugent scoring. We analyzed associations between participant factors and Nugent-BV (scores 7-10 vs. 0-6; 4-10 vs. 0-3) at each time point. Bivariate associations were tested using chi-square and t-tests, and multivariable log-binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals. In early pregnancy, consistent soap use during bathing (vs. never/sometimes) was associated with a decreased risk of Nugent-BV 7-10 (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.96). In late pregnancy, Hindu religion (vs. Muslim) (aPR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.72) and higher gestational age (aPR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.35) were associated with increased risk of Nugent-BV 7-10 and 4-10. Furthermore, maternal underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m² vs. ≥ 18.5) (aPR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.87) and having ≥1 antenatal care visit (vs. none) (aPR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.91) were associated with reduced risk of Nugent-BV 4-10. Among multiparous individuals, a longer pregnancy interval of ≥18 months (vs. < 18 months) was protective against Nugent-BV 7-10 (aPR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.81). At 3-months postpartum, vitamin A supplementation (vs. placebo) was associated with a decreased risk of Nugent-BV 7-10, consistent with prior trial findings. Our findings indicate that Nugent-BV during pregnancy and postpartum is linked to modifiable factors, including hygiene, nutrition, birth spacing, and healthcare access. Rigorous randomized trials are needed to evaluate their ability to reduce BV, promote long-term vaginal health, and lower the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) are effective in addressing undernutrition and improving child development. As momentum builds to scale up SQ-LNS for children aged 6-24 months in the Global South, a key concern is achieving equity in its distribution and outcomes. We performed equity analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials in nine countries (N=37,707 children) to assess SQ-LNS effects on child growth, development, and anemia across levels of an international wealth index. Benefits of SQ-LNS were consistent across the wealth spectrum, leading to similar improvements in child growth, development, and anemia regardless of wealth. However, such equal benefits of SQ-LNS did not erase large inequities in child growth and development between the poorest and wealthier households.",

        "title": "Is domestic violence a risk factor for women's emotional distress in the long run? Analysis of MINIMat longitudinal data from Matlab, Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Violence against women (VAW) contributes significantly to women's distress affecting physical and mental health of women and their families' well-being. Most analyses on distress and VAW use cross-sectional data, inhibiting any causal inference. Furthermore, different trajectories of women's distress are usually ignored while assessing the impact of VAW. This study addresses these gaps in the literature by examining the impact of different types of VAW on different stress trajectories of women. The data are from a cohort study in Bangladesh known as the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions in Matlab (MINIMat). This analysis includes a subsample of the MINIMat participants (n=1066) with data on domestic violence (DV) and distress at enrolment (2001-2020) and 10-year and 18-year follow-ups. Logistic regression analysis, latent class growth modelling and multinomial logistic regression modelling were used in the analyses. Physical violence, emotional violence and controlling behaviour were identified as risk factors for women's distress. Three distress trajectories identified within the sample are: (1) persistently low distress, (2) persistently increasing distress and (3) high midlife distress. Women who reported ever experiencing physical violence (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.44) and controlling behaviour (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.43 to 1.91) at enrolment were more likely to have persistently increasing distress compared with women in the persistently low distress trajectory. Women who reported ever experiencing emotional violence (OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.20 to 4.13) and controlling behaviour at enrolment (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.30 to 4.10) were more likely to be in the high midlife distress trajectory. Although all the studied types of DV caused distress in the long run, exposure to physical DV and controlling behaviour had the worst effect by ever-increasing distress over an 18-year period. Exposure to emotional DV and controlling behaviour also increased distress over a 10-year period. These findings are valuable for targeting the most vulnerable groups in resource-poor settings.",

        "abstract": "Under-5 mortality in Bangladesh remains a critical indicator of public health and socio-economic development. Traditional methods often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear relationships influencing under-5 mortality. This study leverages advanced machine learning models to more accurately predict under-5 mortality and its key determinants. By enhancing prediction accuracy, the study aims to provide actionable insights for improving child survival outcomes in Bangladesh. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to data from the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, LightGBM and Neural Networks. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm and model performance was evaluated by comparing accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, MCC, Cohen's Kappa and AUROC. The Random Forest (RF) model emerged as the most effective predictive model for under-5 mortality in Bangladesh, surpassing other models in various performance metrics. The RF model delivered impressive results, achieving 98.75% Accuracy, 98.61% Recall, 98.88% Precision, 98.74% F1 Score, 97.5% MCC, 97.5% Cohen's Kappa and an AUROC of 99.79%. These metrics highlight its exceptional predictive accuracy and robustness. Key factors influencing under-5 mortality identified by the model included the number of household members, wealth index, parents' education (both father's and mother's), the number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, birth order and the father's occupation. The Random Forest model excelled in predicting under-5 mortality in Bangladesh identifying key predictors such as household size, wealth, parental education, ANC visits, birth order and father's occupation. These findings underscore the efficacy of machine learning in predicting under-5 mortality and identifying critical determinants these also provide a data-driven foundation for policymakers to design targeted interventions, such as improving access to maternal healthcare, promoting parental education and addressing socio-economic inequalities, ultimately contributing to enhanced child survival outcomes in Bangladesh.",

We conducted a follow-up survey from September to November 2023 on the mother-child dyads who participated in the cluster RCT during 2017-2018 in Lohagora Upazila, Narail District, located in the southwestern region of Bangladesh. Of the 620 mother-child dyads recruited, 617 dyads from nine unions were analyzed in this study using structured questionnaires. We used the Parental Stress Scale (PSS) to measure the mothers' parental stress. The mothers' health-seeking behaviors and children's anthropometric measurements were also examined. Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the effectiveness of the MCH handbook. Based on the PSS, stress levels among the mothers in the MCH handbook intervention group were lower in the univariate (p = 0.053) and multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for confounding variables (p = 0.057). However, there were no significant differences between the groups in both primary outcome (PSS) and secondary outcomes (growth monitoring experience, number of sources of parenting information used by the mothers, and children's growth status). Although this study showed that the distribution of the MCH handbook generally reduced maternal parental stress, there were no significant differences between the groups. Further research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the MCH handbook on parental stress as a distal outcome.",

        "abstract": "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading global cause of maternal deaths, with over 70,000 annual deaths. Low- and middle-income countries disproportionately bear this burden, often due to compromised cold chains for oxytocin and insufficient staff training. This review synthesized thirty publications on heat stable carbetocin (HSC) published from January 2018-March 2025. Eligible studies include randomized trials, systematic and narrative reviews, cost or economic evaluations, and implementation studies. Study findings were categorized into clinical efficacy and safety of HSC, cost-effectiveness, and adoption barriers and facilitators from field implementation, and sustainability strategies. Several large-scale trials, especially the CHAMPION trial, demonstrated that HSC is clinically non-inferior to oxytocin. In a pilot study from Nigeria (n = 18,364 deliveries), 56% of women received HSC for PPH prevention and PPH incidence dropped to 0.8%. Cost models from India estimated that HSC could prevent about 5,500 additional PPH cases and save five maternal lives per 100,000 births when priced comparably to oxytocin. Programs in Kenya and conflict-affected South Sudan achieved >90% coverage of HSC by implementing WHO policy updates, pooled procurement, simulation drills for frontline health workers, and appointing \"PPH champions\". Awareness of uterotonics and PPH danger signs among postpartum women increased from 48% to 81% after community-based intervention in Kenya. The thermostability of HSC (up to three years without refrigeration at a temperature of ≤30°C) addresses gaps in cold chain associated with oxytocin and reduces wastage from degradation. Integrating HSC with tranexamic acid and other postpartum haemorrhage bundle elements further improved maternal outcomes. Heat-stable carbetocin offers a viable, cost-effective uterotonic strategy in LMIC settings. Consistent training, supportive supervision, regulatory oversight, and domestic funding, including private sector investment, are critical to achieving widespread adoption of HSC in LMIC. Expanding HSC across resource-limited settings could substantially reduce PPH-related deaths and accelerate maternal survival goals.",

This study aimed to explore the opportunities and difficulties of introducing 'Welcome Persons', a hospital navigation and support cadre for pregnant women, from the perspectives of recipients, patients' attendance, health care providers, and facility managers. This qualitative study was conducted from 15 March to 30 April 2023, in the District Hospital of Gaibandha, Bangladesh. Data were collected through purposive sampling from health care providers, facility managers, 'Welcome Persons', pregnant and delivered women, and their attendants, utilising observations, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, and analytical approaches to ensure scientific rigour. Thematic analysis was performed. The study revealed the positive influence of 'Welcome Person' in maternal health care provision by ensuring timely services, preventing outsiders' interference, as well as contributing to prompt emergency management, specifically for educationally disadvantaged patients. The triangulated perspectives of the participants highlighted the overall acceptance and usefulness of the 'Welcome Persons' but also discovered challenges such as a lack of human resources on the night shift, logistical constraints, and potential gender insensitivity by the recipients. The study findings provided an explicit understanding of the 'Welcome Persons' intervention for facilitating maternal health care services and navigation among pregnant women. While they were well-received, addressing identified barriers is crucial for a sustainable positive impact on maternal health care in secondary health facility settings in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the prevalence and predictors of inferior or less-optimal health (LOPTH) and the Physical Health Outcome Index (PHOIND) among Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian children from infancy to adolescence, focusing on the impact of maternal health factors. Data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) (Wave 1, 2004; Wave 8, 2018) were analyzed using binary logistic and linear regression models. Bootstrap resampling was employed to address the small Indigenous sample size, and multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors (VIF), generalized VIF, tolerance, and eigenvalues. Indigenous infants had a higher prevalence of LOPTH (21.5 %) compared to non-Indigenous infants (12.7 %), with disparities widening in adolescence (Indigenous: 27.0 %; non-Indigenous: 14.9 %). Maternal smoking during pregnancy significantly increased the odds of LOPTH among Indigenous infants (OR = 3.91, 95 % CI: 1.33, 11.49). Maternal physical activity was associated with reduced odds of LOPTH and higher PHOIND scores, indicating protective effects. Maternal psychological distress and stressful life events (SLEs) were linked to lower PHOIND scores in Indigenous infants but not in non-Indigenous infants. Maternal LOPTH significantly impacted non-Indigenous infants' and adolescents' health but was not significant for Indigenous groups, despite Indigenous infants had nearly twice the LOPTH rate, a trend that continued into adolescence. Persistent disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children are evident, highlighting the impact of maternal health. Culturally tailored interventions addressing maternal mental health, smoking, and physical activity are crucial to reduce inequities and improve health outcomes for Indigenous families in Australia.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, utilization of government health facility-based growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services is notably low, prompting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate with the government to enhance GMP service utilization through home-based delivery. Despite this, there is limited information available on home-based GMP service utilization. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of GMP services between home-based and facility-based programs and identifying key factors and barriers to caregiver engagement with GMP services in rural Bangladesh. A descriptive mixed-method study was conducted across six sub-districts from August to December 2019. Three sub-districts with home-based GMP services provided by NGOs were compared with three neighboring sub-districts offering government facility-based GMP services. A total of 3038 randomly selected mothers and children under one year old were included in the quantitative part of the study. Quantitative surveys include information on household socio-demographic information, GMP service components, knowledge, utilization, barriers, and qualitative approaches were used for data collection on caregivers and service providers perspectives on GMP services. Descriptive statistics were conducted for sociodemographic characteristics, caregivers' knowledge, perception and barriers to utilization of GMP services. Student's t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare quantitative and qualitative variables between both GMP arms. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare GMP knowledge. Simple logistic regression identified GMP service use levels and related barriers. Multiple logistic regression was employed to determine statistically significant associations between GMP utilization and independent variables such as caregivers who heard about GMP or GMP cards, were members of an NGO, and lacked interest in GMP services at p-value <0.05 and adjusted risk ratio (ARR) values. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was performed. Results were triangulated across sources. Children's average age was 9.8 months, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio in both groups (home-based vs. facility-based: 51.9% vs. 50.0%). Home-based GMP services exhibited higher utilization rates, with more children receiving weight and length measurements and caregivers receiving counseling than facility-based services (40% vs. 0% utilization, respectively). Caregivers' utilization of GMP services in home-based areas was positively influenced by their knowledge of GMP or GMP cards (Adjusted risk ratio, ARR: 37.4) and their involvement with an NGO, association, or health program (ARR: 1.3). Caregivers in home-based GMP areas relied on NGO staff for service delivery, while those in facility-based areas reported no outreach from government health workers and lacked access to GMP cards due to supply issues. Across both areas, low awareness of GMP services and the absence of incentives contributed to limited utilization. GMP service utilization remains low in rural Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Home-based GMP service utilization was 40% but none of the caregivers utilized facility-based GMP services. Higher utilization in home-based areas was linked to caregiver awareness, access to GMP cards, and NGO involvement, while key barriers included lack of government outreach, supply gaps, and absence of incentives. To improve GMP coverage, government programs should enhance community level outreach, ensure consistent supply of growth cards, and consider integrating small incentives to motivate caregivers.",

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired neonatal infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is unknown to what extent home-based births, which account for nearly a third of deliveries in Bangladesh, may also result in exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We enrolled mothers who delivered at home and their newborns from a rural community in Bangladesh during April-June, 2022. Within 2-7 days after delivery, we collected vaginal and rectal swabs from mothers and rectal swabs from the newborns. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic culture media selective for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL-PB) and carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB). Demographic and risk factor data were collected via surveys. Birth attendants who facilitated the deliveries were interviewed regarding infection prevention practices. We performed descriptive analyses to identify potential risk factors associated with colonization. Of the 50 mothers enrolled, the median age was 23 years (range 18 to 26). Thirty-eight (76%) mothers had at least one antenatal care visit. Only one mother reported hospitalization during pregnancy, and 4 reported antibiotic use during pregnancy. Following delivery, 47 (94%) mothers were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 37 (74%) were colonized with CRB. Of the newborns, 36 (72%) were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 27 (54%) were colonized with CRB. No associations were found with any perinatal exposures, though all households reported incomes below the international poverty level. Of the 9 birth attendants were able to be interviewed, 7 (78%) reported performing hand hygiene before delivery, and 8 (89%) reported glove use during the delivery. Attendants reported cleaning equipment shared across deliveries with soap and water and using boiled water for delivery (89%, n=8). Women and newborns in this rural population were frequently colonized with both ESBL-PB and CRB following home deliveries. This demonstrates the importance of community-based antibiotic-resistant bacterial transmission and need for further understanding community exposures driving antibiotic resistance.",

        "abstract": "Multi-pathogen molecular diagnostics enhance our understanding of the pathogen-specific burden of diarrhea. However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities. Conversely, the absence of a similar response pattern for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, and EAEC is consistent with large-scale studies showing a limited association between their quantities and diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "Inequality in maternal healthcare service (MHS) utilization is a significant global health challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recently, the literature on MHS inequality in LMICs has expanded. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize existing evidence and identify knowledge gaps. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Ultimate in June 2023 for literature published since January 1, 2015. We included empirical studies using nationally representative data to measure inequality in at least one of five MHS indicators: antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance (SBA), facility-based delivery (FBD), caesarean-section (C-section) delivery, and postnatal care (PNC). Our review encompassed 132 peer-reviewed articles on MHS inequality in LMICs. ANC, FBD, and SBA were more frequently analyzed indicators for inequality measurement compared to PNC and C-section delivery. None of the 132 studies assessed all five MHS indicators together. The concentration index was the most frequently used inequality measure across all MHS indicators. Included studies were predominantly focused on economic (wealth) and geographic (residence, region) inequalities, while sociocultural factors (e.g., religion, ethnicity) remain underexplored. Inequality was most pronounced in low-income (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LwMICs). The extant literature mainly concentrates on India and Ethiopia as research settings. Our review highlights significant gaps in health inequality research, particularly in LICs and upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), with a heavy reliance on cross-sectional data, limited assessment of PNC and C-section delivery and lack of comprehensive analysis across all five common MHS indicators. Future research in LMICs should address the gaps identified in this review.",

        "abstract": "We sought to assess the feasibility of mainstreaming balanced energy protein supplementation, a maternal nutrition intervention, into Bangladesh's routine antenatal care system in tandem with an ongoing effectiveness trial in northwestern Bangladesh. Feasibility is an implementation science outcome defined as the extent to which a new intervention can be implemented successfully in a given context. We found feasibility difficult to measure using existing Anglophone quantitative tools translated into Bangla and identified particular challenges with using Likert scales. We also found it challenging to measure feasibility early in implementation, as recommended in the implementation science literature, due to potential respondents' unfamiliarity with the intervention and what implementation would look like. To address these issues, we explored alternative assessment methods, such as focus groups and workshops. These formats presented additional difficulties, including identifying the correct participants and moderating participant power dynamics. In conclusion, we question whether existing feasibility assessment tools, developed in English, are suitable for use in non-Anglophone contexts as well as whether Likert scales are appropriate for use in low-income and middle-income countries more broadly. We also question current recommendations on the timing of feasibility assessments. We feel that-particularly with new, difficult-to-conceptualise interventions-feasibility must be assessed later in implementation or only after providing detailed explanations of the intervention to respondents.",

The study was a secondary analysis of the control arm of a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in the Sherpur district of Bangladesh. A maternal sleep position questionnaire was prospectively administered to participants between May 2021 and November 2021. Pregnancy outcomes were collected by the field staff within 10 days of birth for participants. Multivariate Poisson regression model was used to evaluate the association between stillbirth and supine falling-to-sleep position, reporting both the relative risk (RR), adjusted relative risk (aRR) with 95 % confidence intervals. We included 799 births of the participating and eligible control women. A lateral sleep position was reported by 95.1 % of women, 4.8 % reported a supine sleep position. There were 19 stillbirths, a rate of 24 per 1000 births. Sharing the bed with others, ease of sleeping and level of comfort were not found to be associated with sleep position. There was no association between supine falling-to-sleep position and stillbirth (aRR 2.07, 95 % CI 0.59-7.28). The study did not identify an association between supine sleep position and stillbirth, which may be due to both the low prevalence of stillbirth as an outcome of research, and the low frequency of supine sleep position. This is the largest study within a low-and-middle income country to assess sleep practices and sleep environment in pregnancy.",

As mothers are considered to be the primary caregivers, they bear the responsibility of administering medications to their children. We aimed to evaluate maternal perceptions along with the barriers and facilitators in play that are affecting ORS administration among children in Bangladesh. The study was conducted at Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh through a qualitative approach. In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted on thirty-one mothers of under-5 children reporting to the hospital from February to April 2024. Qualitative content analysis method was used to describe and analyse the transcribed data. The mothers held several misconceptions regarding the administration of ORS. Majority of the participants thought their child could receive ORS through their breastmilk, which was an interesting finding. Along with this, mothers also lacked proper understanding regarding ORS preparation, storage, and use. Some of the key barriers were the lack of proper knowledge, motivation, and compliance, along with misdirection from the elders and pharmacy drug sellers. Additional key facilitators to ORS use were trust towards doctors, positive attitude towards learning about ORS, community education, instructions written on the packet, and support from the healthcare providers. A focused approach should be implemented to educate mothers on the correct preparation and administration of ORS for children, while also addressing and dispelling any misconceptions.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the influence of cultural practices on maternal health is crucial in addressing the nutritional challenges faced by pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. Despite improvements in maternal and child health indicators, food taboos remain prevalent, impacting nutritional and health outcomes of vulnerable populations. This qualitative study explored food taboos and factors related to their adherence or breaking, among rural pregnant women in Bangladesh, where a total of 90 participants, including 21 pregnant women, 23 mothers-in-law, 20 husbands, and 26 healthcare workers, were interviewed through 29 in-depth interviews and 11 focus group discussions. Nearly half of the participants adhered to food taboos, citing beliefs about their negative consequences on pregnancy and baby health. Commonly restricted animal source foods included white carp, trout, duck meat, and mutton, due to fears of convulsions, speech disorders, or undesirable traits in the baby. Raw papayas and pineapples were avoided due to beliefs they could cause miscarriage. Adherence to these taboos was related to the pregnant mother's desire to avoid harm to her child, preference for vaginal delivery, avoid financial stress of caesarean section, profound respect for her elders, early age at marriage, and primiparity. Factors enabling the breaking of food taboos included nutritional counselling by healthcare workers, increased family understanding of maternal nutrition, reduced reinforcement of taboos, and the lack of negative consequences from consuming tabooed foods. The findings underscore the need to use scientific evidence to challenge food taboos by enhancing nutritional counselling programmes and engaging family members and community elders to foster dietary changes for pregnant women.",

        "abstract": "Multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) in pregnancy reduces risk of infant low birthweight (LBW) and improves other maternal and infant outcomes compared with iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements alone. However, the impact of timing of initiation and adherence on the MMS effectiveness in real-world programs remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a 2-stage individual participant data meta-analysis that included 15 randomized trials (61,204 pregnant women) and assessed whether the relative effect of MMS differed by the following: adherence alone; adherence in combination with gestational age at initiation; and the total number of tablets taken. We also evaluated the observational association of these factors with outcomes among participants who received MMS. Compared with IFA supplements, the relative effect of MMS on the primary outcome of continuous birthweight was greater with higher adherence (P-interaction < 0.05). Among women who took ≥90% of supplements, MMS increased birthweight by 56 g (95% CI: 45, 67 g), whereas among women who took <60% of supplements, there was no difference in birthweight between MMS and IFA supplements [mean difference (MD): 9 g; 95% CI: -17, 35 g). Higher adherence was also associated with greater effect of MMS on LBW and birthweight-for-gestational age centile and women who took more supplements experienced a greater relative impact of MMS on birthweight-for-gestational age centile and small-for-gestational age births (SGA) as compared with IFA supplements. Observational analyses among participants who received MMS showed that ≥90% adherence was associated with increased birthweight (MD: 44 g; 95% CI: 31, 56 g) and lower risk of LBW [relative risk (RR): 0.93 g; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 g] and small-for-gestational age (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), whereas <75% adherence was associated with greater risk of stillbirth (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.83) and maternal anemia (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43) than 75%-90% adherence. Programs should invest in strategies that promote early initiation and high adherence to MMS. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022319207.",

        "abstract": "Integrating family planning with nutrition could address unmet family planning needs and malnutrition in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Integrating family planning with sexual reproductive health (SRH) services may provide valuable insights as well. This scoping review synthesised evidence from published and grey literature on interventions integrating family planning with nutrition or SRH services in LMICs. We searched MEDLINE, EBSCO and Google Scholar for studies on integrated family planning, nutrition or SRH services, including codelivery or referral-based models. Evidence was analysed using narrative synthesis. We reviewed 109 articles; most family planning within broader health initiatives, particularly targeting maternal and child health and health system strengthening efforts. Integration strategies varied, generally involving codelivery of services or referral systems linking different service platforms and using diverse health providers. Outcomes were often reported by individual components, concentrating on specific services like family planning use and less so on nutrition or overall maternal and child health, thus limiting a complete understanding of the integrated intervention's impact. Qualitative and process evaluations primarily explored the acceptability and feasibility of integration, highlighting challenges in service delivery, stakeholder engagement and training and supervision gaps. Our findings suggest three evidence-based priorities for improving the integration of family planning, nutrition and SRH services: (1) standardising definitions and frameworks for integration typologies; (2) investing in workforce training and (3) strengthening supply chains. These align with implementation challenges recurrently observed across studies. The review also underscores the necessity for more rigorous research focused on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated approaches, providing critical insights for decision-makers aiming to optimise health service delivery in resource-limited settings.",

        "abstract": "To develop the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) for children aged 24-59 months and evaluate its performance in predicting outcomes related to nutrient adequacy and diet-related noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk. The GDQS is a food-based metric developed and validated for capturing diets' contributions to nutrient adequacy and NCD risk among adult men and nonpregnant and nonlactating women aged ≥15 years globally. Despite the importance of ensuring healthy diets in preschool children and the need for systematic monitoring, no food-based metrics exist that holistically measure diet quality among children aged 24-59 months in diverse populations. We developed candidate versions of the GDQS for children aged 24-59 months by adapting the gram cutoff values used for adults to account for children's lower energy requirements. Using dietary data sets from Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, China, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we evaluated candidate versions' performance in predicting energy-adjusted nutrient intakes and adequacy, nutritional biomarkers, and overweight using Spearman's correlation and multivariable-adjusted regression models, and we statistically compared performance of the strongest candidate with that of the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W) indicator and Global Dietary Recommendations (GDR) score. The GDQS exhibited significant (P < .05) positive correlations with energy-adjusted intakes of protein, fiber, and most micronutrients in most data sets; significant negative correlations with added sugar and saturated fat in 2 data sets; and inconsistent correlations with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. In multivariable-adjusted models, the GDQS, MDD-W, and GDR were positively associated with serum folate in Ethiopia (and the GDQS was in the United Kingdom), and the GDR was positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in China (P < .05). The GDQS was more strongly associated with the mean probability of adequacy of 8 nutrients than the GDR in 2 data sets, whereas the MDD-W outperformed the GDQS in 3 data sets (P < .05). The GDQS is a useful metric for measuring diet quality among children aged 24-59 months in diverse populations.",

        "abstract": "Reducing the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) to as low as 25/1000 live births globally by 2030 to reach the sustainable development goal (SDG) 3.2.1 appears to be a race against time. Amidst this situation, Bangladesh experienced stagnancy in U5MR at the beginning of the SDG era. While a comprehensive understanding of this stagnancy is crucial, research on stagnancy is scant and limited to investigating the direct effects of the key predictors. Therefore, building on the existing evidence, this research investigated the effect of one of the key predictors, parental education, on under-5 mortality (U5M) mediated through antenatal care (ANC) and the availability of hand washing stations. This study conducted weighted mediation analyses using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data from 2011, 2014 and 2017-18, with sample sizes 4,658, 4,367, and 4,826, respectively, and estimated a generalised structural equation model. The \"nlcom\" post-estimation command of STATA was used to obtain the direct effects (coefficients), which were then multiplied to estimate the indirect effects for the indirect parallel and sequential pathways. The indirect effects were added to obtain the total indirect effect, which was added to the direct effect of education to estimate the total effect of education. This study reveals inconsistent parallel and sequential mediation of parental education's effect across the three surveys. The direct effect of education on U5M reduced over time. The total (parallel and sequential combined) mediated effects of either parent's education on U5M were negative (reduced U5M risk). While the mediated effect of mother's education on U5M was not significant, the mediated effect of father's education was significant in 2011. The total effect of education (direct and indirect combined) on U5M was negative (reduced U5M risk) and significant in 2011. However, the effect reduced over time and changed direction in 2017-18. Since 2011, the effects decreased and changed direction to become positive (increased U5M risk) in 2017-18. Due to the weakening direct effect of education and the opposite nature of the indirect effect, the indirect effect of education appeared to be greater than the total effect in 2014 and 2017-18. In 2011, approximately 50% of the total effect of either parent's education was mediated. However, in 2014 and 2017-18, the proportions were greater than 100%, except for the proportion of the mediated effect of father's education in 2014. This study reports a weakening and inconsistent mediated effect of both parents' education on U5M. Using existing literature, it also justifies that improving the quality of education and ANC could more effectively reduce U5M to achieve SDG 3.2.1. To improve the quality of education, this study recommends updating the school curriculum with a greater emphasis on maternal and child health education. To improve the quality of ANC, it is recommended that the mandatory use of ANC cards be strictly monitored.",

        "abstract": "Achieving adequate nutrition for vulnerable populations is central to the second Sustainable Development Goal. Nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs combined with social and behavior change communication (SBCC) interventions can support this goal, particularly in developing countries. However, systematic evidence on the impact of integrating SBCC strategies into these programs is limited, especially concerning anthropometric outcomes, dietary diversity, food consumption, and food security. This systematic review aimed to assess the importance of integrating SBCC interventions into nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs for optimal nutritional outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched for original research articles before December 2024. A total of 15 publications, involving data from multiple households, mothers, and children, were identified. All extracted data were compiled, compared, and critically analyzed. The review included 7 randomized controlled trials, 5 cluster-randomized trials, and 3 descriptive studies. Most studies demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and child dietary diversity, household food consumption, and minimum meal frequencies. Knowledge and practices around exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding also improved substantially. Among children, stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence decreased significantly, with effect sizes indicating meaningful public health impacts. However, the sustainability of these outcomes depended on the follow-up duration. Notably, none of the included studies exhibited a high risk of bias, reinforcing the reliability of the findings. Integrating SBCC into nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs is effective in achieving clinically significant nutritional outcomes for vulnerable populations. While the findings suggest sustained benefits, further research is needed to determine optimal entry points, effective messaging, advocacy strategies, and communication channels. This is particularly critical for lower-and middle-income countries, where malnutrition remains a critical challenge. PROSPERO registration no. CRD42023452510.",

        "abstract": "Equitable access to institutional delivery care is crucial for reducing maternal mortality. Although Bangladesh has made progress in this regard, significant challenges persist in achieving equitable access to institutional delivery care, particularly for economically disadvantaged populations. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of public health financing benefits among women who delivered in public facilities in Bangladesh. This study was conducted based on the data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022, which includes a sample of 3360 women (age 15-49 years) who had a history of institutional delivery during two years preceding the survey. Descriptive and econometric analyses, including Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA), Concentration Curves (CC), and Concentration Indices (CIX), were employed to assess the distribution of public subsidies for delivery care among different socio-economic groups. Socioeconomic inequality in utilisation of delivery care services was evaluated using concentration curves, while BIA estimated the distribution of public healthcare benefits across wealth quintiles. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with distress financing-whether the household of the women had to sell their assets or had to resort of borrowing to avail services. Among the poorest quintile, 38% utilised public facilities, compared to 17% of the women with highest income. The concentration curve for public facility use indicated a pro-poor distribution (CIX -0.031). BIA revealed that the poorest quintile received 24.5% of public subsidies, whereas the wealthiest quintile received 13.7%. However, in tertiary care facilities and for caesarean delivery, the wealthiest group benefitted the most, receiving 23.5% and 26% of the subsidies, respectively. Odds of distress financing was significantly higher among women from poorer or poorest households compared to the richest group (aOR 4.35, 95% CI 3.16-6.03 for poorest and aOR 2.74, 95% CI 2.00-3.77 for poorer). Public health subsidies in Bangladesh equitably benefit women with lower income, though inequities remain, particularly in tertiary care facilities and for caesarean deliveries. Despite this, women with lower income are more vulnerable to distress financing for delivery care. None.",

We examined GWG patterns and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a consortium of pregnancy cohorts from LMICs. We analysed data from five observational pregnancy cohorts in Bangladesh (two cohorts), India, Pakistan and Zambia. The study population comprised 15 286 singleton pregnancies with two or more maternal antenatal weight measurements. We estimated reference values for GWG using longitudinal models and calculated weight gain for gestational age Z-scores. We then estimated the associated risks of preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age, stratified by maternal body mass index (BMI), using marginal generalised linear models and plotted non-linear trends in the associations. The median baseline maternal and gestational age were 24 years (IQR, 21-28) and 13 weeks (IQR 11-16), respectively, with 23% of participants having underweight BMI. The median GWG was 6.8 kg (4.2-9.4) and varied across cohorts from 6.1 kg (3.7-8.5; Bangladesh) to 7.0 kg (4.0-10.0; Zambia). The risk of preterm birth (13%) increased with lower GWG Z-scores among underweight (adjusted risk ratio (ARR), 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9 for lowest Z-score group) and normal BMI participants (ARR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.2). The risk of low birth weight (25%) increased with lower GWG Z-scores in all BMI strata except obese participants (ARR, 1.7; 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9 among underweight). The risk of small for gestational age (36%) increased with lower GWG Z-scores in all BMI strata (ARR, 1.3; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4 among underweight). In secondary analyses, alternative measures of GWG (adequacy ratio; INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup>) had associations that were consistent with those from our study-specific Z-scores, except for a less clear association between preterm birth and INTERGROWTH-21<sup>st</sup> Z-score. GWG was associated with preterm birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age. Early pregnancy BMI modified the association between GWG and outcomes in the study setting.",

        "abstract": "Early initiation of breastfeeding, defined as breastfeeding within one hour of birth, halves the risk of neonatal mortality, establishing it as a crucial outcome component in various interventions implemented across South Asian countries. However, the overall effect of these interventions remain unexamined. Therefore, this study seeks to address this knowledge gap by evaluating the overall effect of these interventions on maternal early initiation of breastfeeding practice. A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomised controlled trials conducted in South Asia focusing on early initiation of breastfeeding as an outcome variable. The interventions identified were categorized into behavioral, mobile health (mHealth), health system strengthening, and nutritional interventions. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effect of interventions and effectiveness by intervention categories. Heterogeneity was explored by sub-group and meta-regression analyses. The risk of bias and strength of evidence were assessed by Cochrane's RoB2 assessment tool and GRADE criteria, respectively. We included 22 articles published, representing 19 unique interventions, from a pool of 2,524 screened records for review and narrative synthesis. Among these, 19 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled relative risk (RR) of early initiation of breastfeeding among mothers in the intervention groups, as compared to their counterparts, was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.95; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.56; p < 0.001). Interventions targeted health system strengthening represented stronger effect than other types of interventions. The overall strength of evidence was moderate. The overall intervention effect appeared efficacious in improving maternal early initiation of breastfeeding practice in South Asia, providing valuable insights for policymakers to develop contextually feasible strategies.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh faces one of the highest global burdens of maternal and newborn deaths, primarily caused by hemorrhage and eclampsia/preeclampsia. Despite reducing maternal mortality by 40%, comprehensive medical interventions remain insufficient in health facilities. This study assessed the readiness of sub-district hospitals in Bangladesh to provide Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) and analyzed the association between facility readiness and delivery rates. Using Health Facility Assessment Survey data from 140 hospitals in 2014 and 141 in 2017, facility readiness was measured based on nine signal functions: administering antibiotics, oxytocin, and anticonvulsants; providing blood transfusions; performing cesarean and assisted vaginal deliveries; managing retained placentas and products of conception; and neonatal resuscitation. Donabedian's model guided the analysis. Multiple linear regression examined associations between facility readiness and delivery rates using 2017 data. Between 2014 and 2017, the availability of signal functions such as oxytocin (85% to 95%), anticonvulsants (58% to 63%), and blood transfusions (22% to 38%) improved. In 2014, 77% of facilities had at least 5 signal functions, 49% had 7, and 6% had all 9. By 2017, these increased to 83%, 56%, and 8%, respectively. Despite these improvements, the mean readiness index remained nearly unchanged (0.67 in 2014 vs. 0.69 in 2017). Only 8% of facilities performed fewer than 52 deliveries annually in 2017, while 26% conducted over 500. Regression analysis revealed a significant association between readiness scores and delivery rates (p =  0.009). While certain indicators improved, overall readiness stagnated due to shortages of anesthetists, gynecologists, and essential supplies. With 64% of surveyed sub-district hospitals classified as comprehensive care facilities, resource and staffing investments are crucial to enhance readiness and reduce maternal and newborn mortality.",

This paper reviews public policies and programmes delivering preconception nutrition interventions in eight South Asian countries, targeting married pre-pregnant women aged 15-49 years and identifies the systems bottlenecks in programme implementation. Most countries, except Sri Lanka, lack universal programmes for health and nutrition screening, provision of essential micronutrients, counselling on healthy eating and treatment for at-risk women. Even in countries, where supportive policies exist, implementation of comprehensive nutrition services for pre-pregnant women faces significant bottlenecks across six health system building blocks. Addressing these barriers is critical to improving intervention effectiveness, programme implementation, and informed decision-making.

A lack of data on the burden of RSV infections and the impact on health systems in resource-limited settings hinders evidence-based policy decisions. Here, we aimed to assess RSV's burden on the health system in Bangladesh. From January to December, 2019, we conducted a prospective study at Bangladesh's largest paediatric hospital among children aged 0-59 months admitted with a possible respiratory infection, as guided by the WHO RSV hospital-based surveillance case definition. Outcomes for RSV-positive children younger than 5 years were analysed. We also followed up outcomes of children denied hospitalisation due to bed shortages. Adjusted hazard ratios for children denied admission versus admitted were estimated using survival analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with a queueing model were used to estimate the effects of RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab on admission denials and mortality. Of 40 664 children admitted, 31 692 were younger than 5 years; 19 940 were in study wards. Among 7191 admitted with possible respiratory infections, 6149 (85·5%) had nasopharyngeal swabs taken, with 1261 (20·5%) testing RSV-positive. The median age of children who tested positive for RSV was 3·0 months (IQR 1·0-8·0), with a median hospital stay of 5 days (IQR 4-8); 24 (1·9%) of 1261 died in hospital. 8274 (5·5%) of 151 110 bed days were for children who were positive for RSV. Additionally, of 9169 children denied admission, outcomes were tracked for 3928 and compared with 2845 admitted. The hazard ratio for death was 1·56 (95% CI 1·34 to 1·81) for children denied versus admitted, being highest for neonates at 2·27 (1·87 to 2·75). RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab could have reduced denials by 677 (95% prediction interval 63 to 1347) and 1289 (684 to 1865), respectively, potentially preventing 130 (-60 to 322) and 258 (32 to 469) deaths.

        "abstract": "Proper menstrual management is crucial for well-being and reproductive health. Despite global efforts to improve menstrual health, more than 2.3 billion girls and women still lack access to adequate menstrual hygiene facilities. This issue is exacerbated in physically demanding sports, where menstrual health can impact performance. This study examines the menstrual experiences and challenges adolescent female athletes face in Bangladesh. It seeks to identify their current menstruation management practices, assess physical, psychological, and sociocultural challenges during menstruation, and evaluate the facility improvements and support systems needed to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance. A qualitative research design was employed, focusing on a phenomenological approach to understand the lived experiences of adolescent athletes. The study was conducted at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports Education (BKSP), which serves approximately 1,500 female athletes. A purposive sampling strategy selected 32 adolescent athletes for in-depth interviews (IDIs) and two focus group discussions (FGDs), which were segmented by age. Additionally, six key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with coaches and administrative staff. The data were collected through audio-recorded interviews, and thematic analysis was performed. This study revealed that sociocultural taboos and misconceptions significantly affect menstrual management practices among athletes. Physical challenges include discomfort, irregular cycles, and limited access to menstrual hygiene products, contributing to increased absenteeism from training. Psychological impacts, such as concerns about reproductive health and inadequate guidance on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), further complicate the situation. Both athletes and coaches expressed a need for better education and resources. Addressing menstrual management challenges for adolescent female athletes requires a comprehensive approach. Enhanced knowledge and awareness, improved access to menstrual hygiene products, and targeted education for athletes and coaches are essential to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance.",

However, ACS remains substantially underused in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where most preterm births occur globally. Providing ACS in inadequately equipped settings can be harmful. Health facilities must demonstrate readiness to ensure safe and effective ACS use. We aimed to assess ACS utilisation and facility readiness to administer ACS based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. We used data from Service Provision Assessments in nine LMICs. The primary outcome was ACS utilisation, which was defined as having ever provided ACS in a health facility. We assessed the availability of injectable corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) and facility readiness to administer ACS appropriately. To measure readiness, we developed an overall readiness index based on 35 indicators, grouped into four categories based on WHO recommendations. The results were stratified by facility level. Across eight countries with comparable sampling strategies, only a median of 10.7% (range = 6.7-35.2%) of facilities had provided ACS, one-fourth (median = 25.3%; range = 4.6-61.5%) had injectable corticosteroids available at the time of the survey. Significant gaps were observed between corticosteroid availability and ACS use. We found low overall readiness indices, ranging from 8.1% for Bangladesh to 32.9% for Senegal. Across four readiness categories, the readiness index was the lowest for criterion one (i.e. ability to assess gestational age accurately) (7.3%), followed by criterion two (i.e. ability to identify maternal infections) (24.8%), criterion four (i.e. ability to provide adequate preterm newborn care) (31.3%), and criterion three (i.e. ability to provide adequate childbirth care) (32.9%). We proposed a strategy for measuring facility readiness to implement one of the most effective interventions to improve neonatal survival. Countries should operationalise readiness measurement, improve facility readiness to provide ACS appropriately, and encourage ACS uptake in well-equipped facilities.",

Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%).

Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "abstract": "Consuming foods high in vitamin A and iron is crucial for children's growth and well-being. However, deficiencies remain a public health problem in Bangladesh. This study explores spatial variation and determinants of vitamin A and iron-rich food consumption among children aged 6-23 months. In this study, data from 2528 children from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 was used. BDHS 2022 employed a cross-sectional study design to collect data. The outcomes measured were vitamin A and iron-rich foods consumption within 24 h preceding the survey by including factors such as mother's age, education, occupation, child age, sex, Antenatal care (ANC) visits, medical illness (diarrhea, fever, cough), use of deworming drugs, wealth index, place of residence, division etc. Spatial patterns were analyzed with ArcGIS version 10.8 and associated factors were assessed using multilevel mixed effect logistic regression model. The prevalence of vitamin A and iron-rich foods consumption was 72% (95% CI 0.70-0.74) and 61.8% (95% CI 0.60-0.64) respectively. Clustering of vitamin A (Moran's I: 0.055, p < 0.001) and iron-rich food (I: 0.101, p < 0.001) consumption was observed, with hot spots in Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Khulna. From the mixed effects logistic regression analysis, maternal employment (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.0), maternal education (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.5), paternal education (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.4-3.0), ≥ 4 ANC visits (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.6), older children aged 18-23 months (aOR = 4.0; 95% CI 3.0-5.3), deworming drugs (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.2) and residing in Khulna (aOR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.5-3.5), Rajshahi (aOR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.2-2.9) have shown statistically significant association with increased consumption of vitamin A and iron-rich foods. Furthermore, a lower likelihood of iron-rich food consumption was observed among children having diarrhea (aOR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9), compared to children who didn't have diarrhea. Poor consumption of vitamin A-rich foods was found in Chittagong (aOR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.98) and Sylhet (aOR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.9). The findings revealed significant disparities both in regions and protective factors associated with vitamin A and iron-rich food intake among children in Bangladesh. Understanding these spatial variations and key determinants can guide targeted interventions, particularly in cold spot regions, to improve child nutrition in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The double burden of malnutrition (DBM), defined by the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition within households, poses significant public health challenges in South and Southeast Asia. While previous studies have examined the individual effects of maternal education and household wealth on DBM, findings remain inconsistent, and little is known about how these factors interact across different contexts. To address this gap, we used nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Bangladesh (2017-2018), Cambodia (2022), Nepal (2022) and Timor-Leste (2016) to analyse the interaction between maternal education and household wealth in shaping DBM risk. These countries were selected due to their ongoing nutritional transition, which has contributed to the increasing prevalence of DBM. For the analysis, we used DHS data, which employs a standardised multistage cluster sampling method and probabilistic methods to ensure representativeness. In this study, we selected mother-child pairs from the DHS survey, focusing on children aged 0-59 months and nonpregnant mothers at the time of the survey. We included those pairs for which both the mother and child had valid weight and height measurements. Maternal education and household wealth were identified as the primary exposures. To examine their interaction and the impact of other covariates on DBM, we employed multivariable logistic regression models. Our study found that DBM prevalence was higher in urban and wealthier households, with the highest rates observed in Timor-Leste and Cambodia. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lower maternal education increased DBM risk, especially in affluent households (OR 2.07-3.29). Conversely, higher maternal education was associated with lower DBM prevalence. Additionally, breastfeeding and antenatal care visits emerged as protective factors. These findings indicate the necessity for specific interventions aimed at enhancing maternal education and promoting healthy dietary practices, particularly in rich households. Additionally, reinforcing breastfeeding practices and increasing antenatal care visits are essential strategies to mitigate the risks associated with DBM.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood development (ECD) in low to middle-income nations has been a pressing concern for the last two to three decades. It is estimated that approximately 250 million children under the age of five are not reaching their full developmental potential due to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and insufficient home stimulation. It is estimated that in Bangladesh, 44% of the children under 5 years live in poverty and 31% are stunted, and both factors are risks for poor childhood development. We aim to develop a sustainable, scaled ECD programme using an evidence-based curriculum of psychosocial stimulation for disadvantaged Bangladeshi children. Approximately 10,000 malnourished children aged 6-24 months will be identified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 13.5 cm, assessed by government health staff in over 500 community clinics (CCs) in 21 sub-districts of Hobiganj, Brahmanbaria, Laxmipur and Narsingdi districts. The children and their mothers will participate in the psychosocial stimulation programme that will be delivered fortnightly for one year to small groups at the CCs by health workers. We will train approximately 1,500 health staff in rural CCs to deliver the ECD sessions. We will follow a cascade training model to train personnel at all levels of the primary health care system. A subsample will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 48 CCs (24 intervention and 24 control). From each CC, 10 children aged 6-24 months will be tested before and after the programme. The primary outcome is children's cognitive development and we will also measure language composite scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Secondary outcomes are children's growth, maternal knowledge and depressive symptoms, and stimulation in the home. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention effects. There are no existing ECD services for the children under three years delivered by the health care system in Bangladesh. This study will help policy makers to consider incorporating ECD activities into the treatment of malnourished children in rural CCs, under the government's primary health care system, thereby developing a sustainable structure for improving disadvantaged children's development. The findings will also provide information to facilitate scaling ECD in the primary health care systems in other low and middle-income countries.

        "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested the negative effects of exposure to high temperature during pregnancy on multiple adverse birth outcomes. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the exposure-response relationship and future risk projections for extreme low birth weight (ELBW) in South Asia. A total of 393,530 pregnant women from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan were included in this analysis. Annual mean temperature throughout each woman's entire gestational period was estimated from the fifth generation of the European Re-Analysis Land Dataset (ERA5-land). We employed the multivariable mixed effect regression model, incorporating random effects for survey strata, to assess the relationship between temperature and ELBW. Stepwise regression models show robust and monotonically varying exposure-response relationships. In the fully adjusted model, for every 1 °C increase in temperature, the risk of ELBW may increase by 1.41 % (95 % CI: 0.99 %, 1.85 %), while birth weight may decrease by -2.26 g (95 % CI: 3.47, -1.04). We found that 2.25 % (95 % CI: 1.26 %, 3.25 %) of ELBW risk can be attributed to annual mean temperature in South Asia, with India having the highest attributed risk (AF = 3.01 %, 95 % CI: 2.48 %, 3.53 %), followed by Bangladesh (AF = 2.81 %, 95 % CI: 2.32 %, 3.29 %). Several environmental, maternal, and household factors may modify the relationship between ambient temperature and ELBW. The risk of ELBW related to temperature rise would increase in the future, especially under the unrestricted emission scenario (e.g. SSP585). In South Asia, greater risks and burdens of ELBW were observed with increasing prenatal ambient temperature. A deeper understanding of covariant factors and intervention measures were needed to address maternal and child health issues under climate change.",

Despite the critical need for tailored mental health care in health facilities, studies on these symptoms in this demographic remain lacking. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the levels, distribution, and associated factors of depressive and anxiety symptoms and their co-occurrence among women seeking antenatal care at a public healthcare facility in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study between May 2024, and June 2024, among women seeking antenatal care (ANC) care in Durgapur Upazila Health Complex, a primary-level public health facility in Bangladesh. Among 640 women who received ANC care, 638 participated in the study. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to determine factors contributing to depressive and anxiety symptoms. About 39% of participants had depressive symptoms and 50% had anxiety symptoms, with 26% experiencing both simultaneously. No participants had severe overall depressive or anxiety symptoms. PHQ-9 data indicated half experienced daily fatigue, while GAD-7 data showed over half experienced daily nervousness and two-fifths had daily fears. Women in the second and third trimesters had 43% (aOR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.89) and 58% (aOR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.71) lower odds of depressive symptoms compared to those in the first trimester respectively. Women with 11 years or more education had 40% (aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94) lower odds of anxiety. Additionally, women in the second and third trimesters had 40% (aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37-0.97) and 49% (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.29-0.91) lower likelihood of co-occurrence compared to those in the first trimester and women with 6-10 years of education had 48% (aOR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.79) and those with 11 or more years had 52% (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.81) lower likelihood of co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to women with 5 years or less education. Our study found a high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among antenatal care seekers, with notable co-occurrence of these conditions. Given these findings, there is an urgent need for targeted mental health support for these women, especially those in their first trimester and those with limited education.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is indispensable for supervising and enhancing the health of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. It helps to reduce the risks of complications and ensures better pregnancy outcomes. This study investigates the aspects that influence antenatal care (ANC) visits in Bangladesh, focusing on sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. The study used nationally representative data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted for bivariate analysis. The Boruta algorithm was utilized for variable selection. After employing various regression models, including Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-inflated Poisson Regression, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB), we evaluated their performance and selected Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) for parameter estimation and interpretation. Our results reveal that less than 50% of women meet the WHO-recommended minimum of four ANC visits. Rural women were 12% less likely than urban women to receive antenatal care (ANC) visits, indicating an urban-rural discrepancy. Women with secondary and higher education levels were significantly more likely to have frequent visits, with incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.51), respectively. Similarly, women from households with rich wealth status (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) and those exposed to media coverage (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14-1.25) were more likely to attend frequent ANC visits. Conversely, women with higher birth order (IRR: 0.95 & 0.84, 95% CI: 0.90-1.00 & 0.76-0.92), unintentional pregnancy (IRR: 0.91 & 0.83, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96 & 0.77-0.91) were less likely to have ANC visits. This study underscores a critical gap in ANC access, particularly among rural women, which poses challenges to achieving national and global maternal health targets. Addressing these disparities and making relevant policy implications such as expanding community-based ANC programs, integrating services into primary healthcare, and increasing awareness through mass media are required to enhance ANC accessibility and utilization in underserved populations.",

        "title": "Enhancing emergency obstetric care navigation through a 'Welcome Person' model: insights from a health system strengthening initiative in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains critical in Bangladesh, driven by delays in accessing timely care at health care facilities. Globally, a woman dies every two minutes from pregnancy or childbirth, often due to systemic inefficiencies in health care. In Bangladesh, high maternal mortality rates are worsened by overcrowded facilities, limited resources, and complex procedures. The 'three delays' model identifies barriers to care, with the third delay - receiving timely treatment - being a major contributor to maternal deaths. This study aims to generate evidence on how the 'Welcome Person' can improve maternity care at the facility level in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study from April to December 2022 among pregnant women at three selected health care facilities in Gaibandha District, Bangladesh. We deployed 20 'Welcome Persons' to navigate and assist pregnant women, enhancing maternal health care. The Welcome Persons provided round-the-clock support, guiding mothers from the moment they entered the hospital through their admission, treatment, and any necessary referrals. The Welcome Persons maintained detailed time-stamped records, tracking patient movements and service timelines. In this study of 5260 mothers, 47% presented with complications, with 52% arriving after office hours. The median time from entry to treatment was 15 minutes, with those without complications taking 14 minutes and those with complications 15 minutes. Entry-to-admission took a median of nine minutes, varying by age, with younger patients completing faster. Admission-to-treatment had a median time of six minutes, with severely complicated patients experiencing shorter times. Only 1% completed within five minutes, while 63% finished within 15 minutes. Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) showed better performance in completing procedures within median times compared to the District Hospital (DH). Future study plans should include measuring maternal and neonatal outcomes as well. This study demonstrates that timely maternal care is achievable by deploying a support person. Using the 'Welcome Person' model to address admission bottlenecks, health care facilities can enhance patient experiences and outcomes. Despite a few limitations, evidence generated from this study can be utilised for scaling up decisions and can contribute to the health policy.",

        "abstract": "Children of female sex workers (FSWs) in Bangladesh grow up in a challenging socio-economic environment characterized by parental separation, substance abuse, alcoholism, and limited access to healthcare, including oral health services. This study aimed to assess the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and its associative factors among these children. A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2023 and February 2024 with a sample of 180 FSW mothers/institutional caregivers and their school-going children, aged 7 to 17. OHRQoL was assessed using the CPQ<sub>8 - 10</sub> (Child Perception Questionnaire) for children aged 7 to 11, and the OIDP (Oral Impacts on Daily Performances) for adolescents aged 12 to 17. The Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT/dmft) index was used to assess dental caries, while the gingival index evaluated gingival health. The plaque index and calculus index were employed to assess plaque and calculus levels, respectively. Among children aged 7 to 11, oral symptoms (Mean = 5.36, SD = 3.72) and functional limitations (Mean = 4.57, SD = 4.42) were the most affected parameters. For children aged 12 to 17, 78.2% reported oral impacts on their daily performances (Mean = 6.50, SD = 6.84). Caries status (β = 0.361, p = 0.001) and place of residence (β = 0.329, p = 0.032) were significantly associated with higher CPQ<sub>8 - 10</sub> scores. A higher OIDP score was associated with gingivitis (β = 0.265, p = 0.035). The study reveals that children aged 7 to 11 in Daulatdia with caries had significantly poorer OHRQoL, while gingivitis was associated with a higher OIDP score in children aged 12 to 17. OHRQoL evaluation is vital in determining the effectiveness of therapeutic and preventive measures aimed at improving the oral health of this vulnerable population. REGISTRY AND REGISTRATION NO.

        "abstract": "Women in urban slums are particularly susceptible due to a lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and abortion is frequently performed. Our study investigates the level and predictors of SRH knowledge among the reproductive-aged women who have had abortions and lived in urban slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We adopted a cross-sectional survey among the reproductive-aged women who experienced any kind of abortion from July 2020 to January 2022 living in the UHDSS sites, applying a predefined interviewer-assisted survey questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval (CI)) for continuous and percentage distribution for categorical variables. Bi-variate analysis was used to examine for associations. After checking the assumptions, multinomial regression analysis was used to confirm the determinants with 95% CIs. A total of 338 women participated (221 spontaneous abortions and 117 induced abortions) with an average age of 26.59 ± 0.355, age at first marriage of 16.69 ± 0.173, and marital length of 9.45 ± 0.386. Except for the use of emergency contraceptives (32%), many women correctly identified condom effectiveness for preventing pregnancy (89%), STDs and HIV/AIDS prevention (79-80%), and abortion (98%). About 34 to 64% of them experienced stigmas attached to sexually explicit items. Few of them knew about abortion complications (9 to 57%), with the exception of bleeding associated with abortion (91.7%). Overall, 3 out of 4 women lacked sufficient SRH knowledge, with a mean score of 58.28 (95% CI: 56.70, 59.87), which was slightly higher for women who had spontaneous abortions 58.90 (95% CI: 57.02, 60.78) and lower for women who had induced abortions 57.69 (95% CI: 54.94, 60.45). Women aged 20-29 and 30 + years had high level of SRH knowledge than those of under 20 years. Women with higher education, longer marriages, and who availed post abortion care had high level of SRH knowledge than respective counterparts. However, employed slum women other than garment workers had lower levels of SRH knowledge than housewives. Our findings can be used in the abortion policies and strategies for vulnerable women and we recommend an intervention to increase awareness and knowledge on SRH, which is essential for those women to achieve the maternal reproductive health parameters.",

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

        "abstract": "To describe the immunization status of children with CP in Vietnam and identify factors associated with vaccine non-uptake in this group. We conducted an active prospective case ascertainment of children with cerebral palsy (CP) attending the National Children's Hospital in Hanoi between June to November 2017, following the model proposed by the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance system in Australia. All children were assessed by trained paediatricians at the hospital and their immunization history was recorded. Data were collected from 765 children with CP (median age = 1.7 years, IQR = 2.7 years). Of these children, 82.7% were fully immunized for their age (compared to 96.4% of the general child population) according to the Vietnamese Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule. A BCG vaccination scar was present in 94.0% of children with CP, and 95.9% of eligible children had received the measles-rubella vaccine as part of the national campaign (compared with 96.0% and 98.2% of the general population respectively). Incomplete vaccination according to the EPI was associated with younger age, living in an earth/sand house, homebirth, low-level maternal education, being diagnosed with CP before the age of three, having bilateral CP, having associated impairments (i.e., epilepsy, intellectual, visual, speech), being at level IV-V on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, and being undernutrition. This is the first study to document the immunization status of children with CP in Vietnam. A large proportion had not received the measles-rubella vaccine and 17.3% were not fully immunized. To increase vaccination coverage, interventions and strategies are required to ensure that all children with CP have equitable access to early diagnosis, immunization, health education programs, outreach programs, and frequent follow-up. Early diagnosis and focused intervention in early life could further improve vaccination coverage in children with CP.",

        "abstract": "The food environment is a driver of the double burden of malnutrition, influencing dietary intake by increasing or restricting access to foods. The objective of this study was to assess the association between geospatial food environment indicators and the diet quality among postpartum women in rural Bangladesh. Participants were women of infants enrolled in a cluster-randomized controlled trial from 2018 to 2020. Food vendor availability was defined as the number of food vendors within a specific household radius, and proximity was defined as the distance to the nearest vendor. Dietary intake was measured using a 7-d food frequency questionnaire collected at 3 mo, 6 mo, and 12 mo postpartum. Our primary outcome was nonstarchy staple food variety scores (FVS). Secondary outcomes included dietary diversity scores and individual food group consumption. To assess the association between food environment indicators and diet quality indicators, we fit linear regression models for the FVS outcome, Poisson regression models for the dietary diversity outcome, and logistic regression models for individual food group outcomes. A total of 5064 women were included in this analysis. Women reported consuming an average of 9.7 (standard deviation: 3.7) nonstarchy staple foods in the previous week. Women who lived in households with the highest market availability (≥7 markets within 1600 m) had an average of 0.84-unit (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 1.16) higher FVS compared with those in households with the lowest market availability (≤ 2 markets) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Geospatial food environment indicators were not significantly associated with the odds of consuming less healthy food options. We found a positive relationship between market availability and diet quality for postpartum women in rural Bangladesh. However, more research is needed to understand which components of the food environment are associated with increased consumption of less healthy foods.",

There is a paucity of IYCF data from the ultra-poor children living in the slums of Bangladesh.AimTo explore IYCF practices in slums in Bangladesh and identify factors associated with EIBF.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study and interviewed 682 ultra-poor mothers with 0-23-months-old children living in the slums of Dhaka and Saidpur. The interview questionnaire (adapted from Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey and World Health Organization tools) included sociodemographic, dietary, and healthcare utilization variables. We conducted a descriptive analysis to report the prevalence of IYCF practices. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with EIBF.ResultsAbout 99.3% of children were ever breastfed; 89.4% of women breastfed their newborns within an hour; 63.5% of 0-5-months-old children were exclusively breastfed; 78.2% of mothers fed their 6-8-months-olds solid, semisolid, or soft foods; and 34.2% of 0-23-months-olds were bottle fed.

        "abstract": "Gynaecological health and its related service delivery have long been neglected in Bangladesh. In response to the high burden and improvements in the provision of gynaecological health care, the Essential Gynaecological Skills (EGS) implementation package was developed. It includes comprehensive in-service training for upskilling the non-specialised health care providers and introduces the first structured data recording system for gynaecology in the outdoor of public health facilities in Bangladesh. We outline how the stakeholder engagement process was integrated into the implementation research related to this pioneering initiative. Based on literature review, expert consultation and prior experience, we adopted the identification, sensitisation, involvement, and engagement (ISIE) framework of stakeholder engagement and process documentation. After identifying national and local level stakeholders via a power-interest mapping exercise, we sensitised them to the gaps in gynaecological health service delivery. High-power and high-interest stakeholders were involved and engaged in developing the EGS implementation package, which was then introduced in selected public health facilities and evaluated through implementation research. Acknowledging the urgent need for gynaecological health care services, the identified and sensitised stakeholders supported the development of the EGS implementation package. This resulted in the development and implementation of the EGS implementation package under the Government of Bangladesh's leadership, highlighting government ownership. These outcomes reflected the potential for scalability and sustainability of the package. However, stakeholder engagement remains a time and resource-intensive process that requires an innovative, research-backed approach with committed implementation. Our experience of using the ISIE framework showcased the potential of this framework in achieving sustainability and scalability at the national level. However, further initiatives from the government can ensure nationwide scale-up, setting an example for other lower and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting high-risk pregnancy among expectant mothers, aiming to construct an efficient predictive model to improve maternal health management. The study is based on the maternal health risk dataset (MHRD) from Bangladesh, covering multiple hospitals, community clinics, and maternal healthcare centers, and encompassing health data from 1014 pregnant women. Six machine learning algorithms-multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM)-are employed to construct predictive models. It is worth noting that MLP demonstrates superior performance compared with the other five algorithms. By applying the MLP method, the study successfully established an efficient pregnancy risk prediction model. The model evaluation results indicate that it has high accuracy in predicting pregnancy risks, with an overall accuracy rate of 82%, and particularly high accuracy in high-risk predictions, reaching 91%. With the computational support of an NVIDIA GPU RTX3050Ti, the model demonstrated excellent data processing capabilities, capable of predicting and processing 500 sets of data items per second. This study not only showcases the enormous potential of machine learning technology in the healthcare field, especially in the rapid and accurate identification of high-risk pregnancies, providing a powerful decision-support tool for medical professionals, but also offers significant reference value for future research in this area.",

        "abstract": "Timely initiation and adequate number of antenatal care (ANC) visits are crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of both pregnant women and their unborn children. Despite recent progress, Bangladesh continues to face challenges in achieving sustainable development goal (SDG-3) related to maternal and neonatal health. This study examines the factors contributing to delayed initiation and a low number of ANC visits, while also evaluating the association between the timing and overall number of ANC visits. Nationally representative data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS) conducted in 2007 (n = 3050) and 2017-18 (n = 4544) on women aged 15-49 years. We investigated two binary outcome variables: late ANC, defined as the initiation of ANC visits after 12 weeks of gestation, and low ANC, defined as having less than four ANC visits. Geospatial mapping was employed to visualize spatial patterns, followed by survey-weighted logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with late initiation of ANC and low ANC visit frequency. Additionally, classification tree analysis was utilized to explore interactions between predictors and outcomes. Logistic regression modeling revealed that late ANC was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the odds of having fewer than four ANC visits (AOR: 4.60 [95% CI: 3.69-5.73] in 2007 and AOR: 4.68 [95% CI: 4.00-5.48] in 2017-18). Classification tree analysis further confirmed that late ANC initiation was the most critical predictor of total number of ANC attendance, underscoring the necessity of early ANC initiation to ensure sufficient coverage. Early initiation of ANC is essential for achieving an adequate number of ANC visits. Notably, the same set of sociodemographic factors remained statistically significant predictors in both 2007 and 2017, highlighting the persistent nature of these disparities and underscoring the urgent need for targeted policies and health interventions.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mental health and other underlying factors might affect a child's nutritional status. This study assesses child undernutrition and its associated characteristics, including maternal mental health, in low-income settings in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 397 lactating mothers with children aged 6-23 months from low-income settings in Dhaka. Anthropometric measurements were taken following standard protocols, and Z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and BMI-for-age were calculated. Maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, respectively. The child feeding index was developed based on breastfeeding, dietary diversity, and meal frequency. Multivariate logistic regression models explored the relationship between child undernutrition and maternal mental health and other risk factors. In low-income regions of Dhaka, the prevalence was 31.9% for stunting, 14.0% for wasting, and 24.1% for underweight children. Approximately half of the mothers experienced depression (55%) and anxiety (50%). High maternal depression levels were associated with increased odds of stunted (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.10-2.94, p < 0.05) and wasted (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.38-5.28, p < 0.05) children. Similarly, anxiety was linked to a higher risk of underweight children (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.04-3.11, p < 0.05). Female children had approximately twice the risk of stunting than boys (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.32-3.44, p < 0.01). Younger maternal age also doubled the risk of stunting (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.20-3.22, p < 0.01). Low adherence to a feeding index increased the odds of stunting (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.99-5.16, p < 0.001) and underweight (AOR = 4.20, 95% CI = 2.50-7.07, p < 0.01). Children born to underweight mothers were almost twice as likely to become underweight (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.01-4.03, p < 0.05) compared to those born to normal/overweight mothers. Maternal depression and anxiety adversely affect the nutrition of their children. Sociodemographic factors such as the child's sex, maternal age, maternal health, and child feeding practices significantly contribute to child undernutrition. Policy initiatives should prioritize maternal mental health and address child undernutrition in these settings.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), in comparison to iron and folic acid supplementation (IFA), improves pregnancy outcomes, but less is known about their effect on infant growth. We conducted a systematic review of trials comparing maternal MMS to IFA and assessed the effect on infants' anthropometric outcomes at birth, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo of age. We included trials from a Cochrane review and new studies identified through systematic literature searches in 3 databases. We calculated the pooled effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a generic inverse variance method, with fixed (primary analysis) and random-effects, and assessed subgroup differences. The 19 included trials showed that MMS, compared to IFA, led to significantly greater length and weight from birth to 6 mo, head circumference (HC) from birth to 12 mo, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) through 3 mo. Infants born to pregnant women consuming MMS were longer at birth (mean difference: 0.05 cm; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.08 cm) and had higher length-for-age z-score at birth (0.09; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), 3 mo (0.09; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), and 6 mo (0.04; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07) of age but not thereafter. MMS resulted in significantly higher weight-for-age z-score and HC-for-age z-score until 6 mo and higher weight-for-length z-score and MUAC-for-age z-score until 3 mo. MMS reduced risk of stunting (risk ratio [RR]: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.91), underweight (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.90), small HC (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90), and low MUAC (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.99) at 3 mo and wasting (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96) at birth. For some outcomes, effects were greater when MMS was continued postpartum and in settings with higher prevalence of low birthweight. Prenatal MMS improves size at birth and subsequent infant growth through 6 mo of age but not thereafter. These results strengthen the evidence on MMS benefits beyond birth outcomes.

        "abstract": "Provision of quality antenatal care (QANC) services and delivery care by skilled health professionals can effectively reduce and manage complications throughout pregnancy and childbirth, leading to better maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The WHO recently updated its recommendation to at least eight antenatal care (ANC) visits. However, little is known about how QANC services and completion of eight or more ANC visits interact with skilled delivery care utilization. This study utilized data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, including 4,457 pregnant women aged 15-49 years who had given birth three years preceding the survey. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the study population's characteristics and the proportion of skilled birth attendance (SBA) and facility delivery (FD) in Bangladesh. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were used to determine the strength of association of QANC services and completion of eight or more ANC visits with skilled delivery care utilization. Only one in five women received good QANC services, and one in eight completed eight or more ANC visits. The overall proportions of SBA and FD were 56.74% [95% CI: 55.27-58.20] and 53.85% [52.37-55.32] respectively. Women with eight or more ANC visits had significantly higher odds of utilizing SBA (OR: 2.11 [1.60-2.77]) and FD (OR: 2.19 [1.68-2.85]) compared to those with only 1-3 ANC visits. Likewise, good QANC services were associated with higher odds of SBA (OR: 1.72 [1.38-2.15]) and FD (OR: 1.56 [1.26-1.93]). This study highlights the significant positive association of QANC services and adherence to the WHO-recommended eight or more ANC visits with increased skilled delivery care utilization in Bangladesh. Strengthening policies and programs to enhance the quality and frequency of ANC services can promote skilled delivery care, ensuring safe motherhood and childbirth.",

        "abstract": "Ensuring quality antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) is crucial for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality rates. However, there are gaps in assessing the quality of ANC, leading to the proposal of standards by the World Health Organization. The study aims to examine the impact of quality ANC on delivery services and PNC compliance in Bangladesh using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), providing insights for policymakers to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. This study used data from 2017 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) to investigate the impact of quality antenatal care (qANC) on delivery services and PNC in Bangladesh. The study population included ever-married women aged 15-49 years who had experienced a recent pregnancy. The analysis assessed the relationship between qANC and facility delivery, skilled birth attendant (SBA)-assisted delivery, and PNC services within 48 hours of delivery. The study employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design, and data analysis was conducted using generalized linear models and considered various demographic and socioeconomic factors. Key findings include a low rate of qANC services (18%), with pregnancy-related counseling being the lowest component. About 82% received at least one ANC visit, but only 18.3% received a quality visit. Higher compliance with facility delivery (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.27-1.41), SBA-conducted delivery (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.24-1.35), and PNC services for both mother (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.24-1.35) and child (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.23-1.35) within 48 hours were observed when quality ANC was received. Factors such as completing secondary education, engaging in skilled/unskilled manual labor and higher wealth quintile were associated with better delivery and post-delivery outcomes. Ensuring qANC and expanding PNC service use remain challenging in Bangladesh. Increasing the provision of qANC is crucial, as it is associated with higher adherence to PNC.",

        "title": "Association between adolescent pregnancy and infant mortality: a population-based study.",
        "abstract": "Bangladesh continues to grapple with a persistently high infant mortality rate, currently at 38 deaths per 1,000 live births. Adolescent pregnancy poses significant health risks for both mothers and infants globally, yet its specific impact on infant mortality in Bangladesh remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between adolescent pregnancy and infant mortality in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, focusing on 8,759 infants born to women aged 15-49 years. Adolescent pregnancies were categorized into four groups: <16 years, 16-17 years, 18-19 years, and >19 years. Potential covariates included sociodemographic factors (mothers' age, fathers' occupation, religion), contextual factors (place of delivery, access to media and technology), and healthcare utilization (antenatal and postnatal care). Bivariate logistic regression assessed associations between adolescent pregnancy and infant mortality, presenting adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) while controlling for these covariates. The mean age of mothers at first birth was 18.53 years. Among the 8,759 infants studied, 328 (3.74%) died before reaching 12 months of age. Infants born to mothers younger than 16 years initially showed higher odds of mortality (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05-2.01); this association persisted even after adjusting for sociodemographic and contextual factors (AOR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.01-1.96). However, after controlling for healthcare utilization, the relationship was no longer statistically significant (AOR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.56-1.99). Delaying childbirth from adolescence to adulthood may reduce infant mortality in Bangladesh. However, adolescent pregnancy alone does not increase infant mortality risk after accounting for healthcare utilization, such as antenatal and postnatal care. Improving access to quality healthcare is crucial for lowering infant mortality. Future cohort studies are needed to better understand the relationship between maternal age and infant health outcomes.",

        "title": "Dominant predictors of postnatal care utilization among ever-married mothers of reproductive age in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The majority of maternal mortality occurs during the postpartum period worldwide. Therefore, postnatal care (PNC) is crucial for both mother's and newborn's survival. Unfortunately, PNC is underutilized in Bangladesh and well below any admissible level. The purpose of this study is not only to identify the potential factors associated with PNC but also to explore the more intriguing aspect of finding the most important determinants of PNC receipt among mothers in Bangladesh. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the factors associated with PNC receipt using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18. The BDHS 2017-18 utilized a two-stage stratified sampling method, selecting 675 enumeration areas (EAs) in the first stage with probability proportional to size and then choosing a systematic sample of 30 households from each EA in the second stage. The analysis considered mothers with a most recent child under three years of age at the time of the survey, leading to a total of 4899 women. The response variable of interest is the receipt of PNC from a medically trained provider (MTP) within two days of delivery. It is observed that 52.8% of mothers received PNC from MTP within two days of childbirth. The variables mother's age at birth, birth order, mother's education level, place of residence, wealth index, media exposure, antenatal care (ANC) visits, working status, and region are all found to be significantly associated with PNC seeking behavior. General dominance (GD) analysis was employed to assess variable importance because complete, and conditional dominances rarely occur. GD is the simplest among the three dominances and can be computed without computing the other two by using a simpler subset model structure. Considering the two-stage stratified sampling design, the analysis reveals that ANC visits, family wealth status, and the mother's education level were the three most dominant predictors of PNC visits, explaining approximately 68% of the total variance. The results suggest that policymakers and stakeholders should intensify the existing facilities to increase awareness of taking ANC visits, which would eventually encourage women to take PNC. Additionally, efforts should be made to help economically disadvantaged women overcome the barriers that prevent them from accessing maternal health care. Finally, the government of Bangladesh should stimulate women to complete at least their secondary education.",
