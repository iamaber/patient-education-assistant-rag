        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is characterized by the unchecked proliferation of breast cells. Variations in the metabolism of steroid hormones can influence the risk of this disease by modifying the concentration and the potency of these hormones. The enzyme AKR1C4, primarily found in the liver, is crucial for regulating these hormone levels in the bloodstream. This research examined the relationship between a polymorphic variant (rs17134592) of the AKR1C4 gene and the susceptibility to breast cancer among the Bangladeshi population. A case-control study was conducted with 310 breast cancer patients and 310 healthy individuals from Bangladesh. DNA was extracted using an organic process, followed by genotyping through the PCR-RFLP technique. To validate the accuracy of genotyping results, a subset of PCR products was randomly selected and confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Statistical assessments were conducted to analyze the association of polymorphism, while molecular dynamics simulation and diverse computational methods were employed to predict the structural and functional impacts of the SNP. The results indicate that rs17134592 in the AKR1C4 gene is linked with a heightened risk for breast cancer (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.39, 95% CI = 1.80 to 6.50 for the GG genotype in additive model 2). The recessive model (GG vs. CC + CG) also showed an enhanced risk of susceptibility to breast malignancy (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.78 to 6.08). In the subgroup of post-menopausal women, the risk of developing breast cancer was significantly higher for carriers of the GG genotype, with relative risks of 4.02 and 3.92, in the additive model 2 and recessive model, respectively. However, no significant correlations were observed between these genotypes and tumor grade or size in breast cancer patients. Computational analysis suggested that the L311V mutation (rs17134592) could potentially reduce the stability of the protein. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the L311V mutation introduces notable conformational instability to the AKR1C4 enzyme, potentially impacting its biological functionality and catalytic efficiency. In conclusion, the genetic variant rs17134592 has been identified as significantly correlated with the prevalence of breast cancer in the Bangladeshi population. Computational studies suggest that the L311V mutation in the AKR1C4 gene, corresponding to rs17134592, results in marked conformational instability and changes in enzyme functionality.",

        "abstract": "The 2024 flash flood in Feni District, Bangladesh, caused substantial disruptions to livelihoods and posed serious mental health challenges for the affected population. This study aimed to assess the impact of the flood on both livelihood and psychological well-being using a cross-sectional design. Data were collected from 855 adult residents across three severely affected upazilas-Sonagazi, Chhagalnaiya, and Fulgazi. Livelihood impact was measured using a self-reported binary item, while psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify key sociodemographic and flood-related predictors. Findings revealed that 99.3% of respondents experienced livelihood disruption, and over 85% reported moderate to severe psychological distress. Regression results indicated that education level, occupation, income, location, and chronic illness significantly influenced livelihood outcomes. Similarly, factors such as age, marital status, education, geographic location, family structure, and lack of early warning were significantly associated with psychological distress. Notably, limited access to safe drinking water and food scarcity during the flood exacerbated both livelihood and mental health impacts. These findings underscore the urgent need for integrated post-disaster interventions that address both economic recovery and mental health support. Enhancing early warning systems, improving resource accessibility, and strengthening community-based mental health services are critical to building resilience in flood-prone areas.",

        "title": "Key Stakeholders' Perspectives on Acute Malnutrition Management Programs for Children Under Five in Bangladesh: Qualitative Insights.",
        "abstract": "Acute malnutrition (AM) in children under five is a significant global health concern. Community-based management of AM (CMAM) with provision of specially formulated foods (SFFs) is recommended for treating moderate (MAM) and uncomplicated severe (SAM) cases in outpatient settings. Integrating nutrition counseling and cooking demonstrations (NC&CD) into CMAM programs can improve caregiver knowledge and practices. In our parent trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of enhanced NC&CD without SFFs on MAM management. This study examines perceptions and understanding of CMAM among parents, healthcare providers (HCPs), and policymakers in both CMAM and no-CMAM areas. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants who were reflective and willing to share their experiences with the research team. Data collection involved 30 focus group discussions (FGDs), 34 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with parents, 28 key informant interviews (KIIs) with HCPs in Cox's Bazar, and 16 KIIs with policymakers in Dhaka. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo, guided by the concepts of the theoretical framework. Parents and HCPs generally valued CMAM for its SFFs, while parents in the MAM trial's intervention arm preferred NC&CD with incentives. Policymakers largely supported combining SFFs with NC&CD, though some advocated for NC&CD alone as a feasible approach. Challenges identified included workforce shortages, policy gaps, and insufficient prioritization. One-third of HCPs in CMAM areas and most HCPs and parents in no-CMAM areas favored NC&CD. The study highlights the need to continue NC&CD-based CMAM programs with incentives and recommends integrating NC&CD into CMAM guidelines to enhance caregiver awareness. Additionally, increased manpower, policy advocacy, strong government leadership, and preventive nutrition initiatives are warranted to ensure the sustainable effect of CMAM in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are effective medications for people with opioid use disorder; however, interruptions in daily dosing are common and diminish the benefits of these medications. While clinical guidelines in most North American jurisdictions, including British Columbia (BC), recommend dose adjustment after treatment interruptions to varying levels of specificity, the evidence to support these recommendations is limited. We aim to estimate the comparative effectiveness of alternative dose adjustment strategies on subsequent overdose-related acute care visits and discontinuation of opioid agonist treatment in BC, Canada. Using a linkage of nine health administrative databases, we propose a population-level retrospective cohort study of adults aged 18 years or older in BC who initiated methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022. We will specify parallel hypothetical trials, known as target trials, for methadone interruptions of 1-3 days, 4 days and 5-14 days, and buprenorphine/naloxone interruptions of 1-5 days and 6-14 days. Following the index interruption, the primary outcomes are the time to overdose-related acute care visits and treatment discontinuation (interruptions lasting >14 days), with time to all-cause acute care visits as a secondary outcome. The intention-to-treat effect will be estimated using both propensity score and instrumental variable approaches. A range of sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of our results, including cohort and timeline restriction, alternative definitions of exposure and outcome and alternative estimation strategies. The protocol, cohort creation and analysis plan have been classified and approved as a quality improvement initiative by Providence Health Care Research Institute and the Simon Fraser University Office of Research Ethics. All data are deidentified, securely stored and accessed in accordance with provincial privacy regulations. Results will be disseminated to local advocacy groups and decision-makers, national and international clinical guideline developers, presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals electronically and in print.",

        "abstract": "Residents of urban informal settlements are among the most at-risk of climate change-exacerbated hazards. Yet, traditional approaches to adaptation have failed to reduce risk sustainably and equitably. In contrast, transformative adaptation recognizes the inextricable nature of complex climate risk and social inequality, embedding principles of social justice in pathways to societal resilience. Its potential for impact may be greatest in informal settlements, but its application in this context introduces a new set of challenges and remains largely aspirational. To address this missed opportunity, in this focus article we provide clarity on how transformative adaptation can manifest in informal settlements. Although context-dependency precludes the formulation of specific guidelines, we identify four principles which are foundational to its deployment in these settings. Acknowledging constraints, we define levels of achievement of the principles and suggest how they might be reached in practice. Achieving transformative adaptation in informal settlements is complex, but we argue that it is already achievable and could represent a prime opportunity to accelerate the rate of adaptation to build a climate resilient society.",

We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs. 13%; p < 0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility. Our findings warrant that reducing unnecessary antibiotic consumption requires increasing public awareness and strengthening laws on the sale of over-the-counter antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Undiagnosed depressive and anxiety disorders may be widespread. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of undiagnosed depressive and/or anxiety disorders (DAD) among women in two low-resource countries, Bangladesh and Nepal. Data were analyzed from 19,987 women (aged 15-49 years) in the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and 7,442 women (aged 15-49 years) in the 2022 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey who completed the interview-administered nationally representative sub-survey component on mental health. DAD was categorized as either 'undiagnosed DAD' (meeting symptom criteria on the PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7 but without a prior diagnosis or treatment) or 'diagnosed DAD' (having a prior diagnosis and/or current treatment). Relative to diagnosed DAD, associations with undiagnosed DAD were estimated using logistic regression. The analytic sample included 2,388 women in Bangladesh and 960 women in Nepal with undiagnosed DAD and diagnosed with DAD. The prevalence of undiagnosed DAD was 44.8% in Bangladesh and 60.0% in Nepal. In Bangladesh, in adjusted logistic regression analysis, having a big problem with permission to go to a health facility (Adjusted Odds Ratio-AOR: 1.53, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.21-1.93, p < 0.001), being widowed (AOR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.40-2.99, p < 0.001) and being divorced or separated (AOR: 2.30, 95% CI:1.40-3.77, p < 0.001) were significantly positively associated with undiagnosed DAD. Having secondary or higher education (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.97, p = 0.028) was significantly negatively associated with undiagnosed DAD. In Nepal, compared to the rich or richest wealth status, poor or poorest wealth status (AOR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.21), compared to Bramin/Chhetri ethnicity, being Dalit (AOR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89) and being Janajati (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.17-2.54) were positively associated with undiagnosed DAD. Increasing age (AOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) was negatively associated and history of cervical cancer screening (AOR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.32-1.02) was marginally negatively associated with undiagnosed DAD. Nearly half of the women in Bangladesh and three in five women in Nepal had undiagnosed DAD.

        "abstract": "Groundwater is a vital source of drinking water in Bangladesh, with tubewells commonly used, particularly in schools. This study assessed the quality of tubewell water in the southwest region, focusing on iron (Fe), arsenic (As), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS). Using artificial neural network (ANN) modeling, daily safe water intake limits for children were estimated based on Fe and As levels. A total of 75 school-based water samples were collected. Fe and As were measured using a Hanna Iron Checker and Hach Arsenic Test Kit. Findings showed that 68% and 48% of samples exceeded WHO and USEPA limits for Fe and As, respectively. In contrast, only 32% and 26.7% of samples surpassed the Bangladesh Water Quality Standards (BDWS) for Fe and As, respectively. Spatial mapping identified Mahajanpur, Bagoan, and Dariapur as hotspots for contamination. TDS showed a strong positive correlation with conductivity (r = 0.92) and a moderate one with salinity (r = 0.7), indicating their interdependence. As and Fe had a weak positive correlation (r = 0.22). PC1 and PC2 explained 56.74% of variance, with Fe and As weakly correlated in PC1 but negatively loaded in PC2, suggesting distinct behaviours influenced by TDS, conductivity, and salinity. Further, Linear regression showed Fe (r = -0.34) and As (r = -0.71) decreased with depth. High health risks were identified for Fe in Mahajanpur and As in Baguan and Dariapur. ANN and Decision Tree Regression models showed 87% accuracy in estimating safe water intake, highlighting Monakhali Union as the most vulnerable area. To avoid health impacts in children, safe consumption levels in Baguan and Monakhali were notably low at 0.59 L/day and 0.39 L/day, respectively. These findings underscore the urgent need for regular monitoring and limiting tubewell water consumption by schoolchildren in the region.",

        "abstract": "Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a core component of the stigmoid body (STB) and a neuroprotective interactor with the causative agents of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The cholinergic system is often affected by NDs. Our previous studies suggest that cholinergic brainstem/spinal cord motoneurons are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration due to a lack of STB/HAP1 protectivity. The forebrain cholinergic nuclei are also major neurodegenerative/psychotic targets; however, the relationships of HAP1 with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) have yet to be determined there. This study used western blotting and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the comparative distribution of HAP1 with ChAT and their immunohistochemical relationships in the adult mouse forebrain cholinergic nuclei. The results showed that HAP1-immunoreactive (ir) neurons were highly distributed in the basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, including medial septal nucleus (MS), nucleus of vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (VDB), nucleus of horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB), and substantia innominata basal part (SIB). HAP1-ir neurons were sporadically scattered in the striatum. The significantly highest co-expression ratio of HAP1 with ChAT was observed in MS and VDB. In contrast, the ChAT-ir neurons never contained HAP1 in the caudate putamen of the striatum. These suggest that, due to having putative HAP1 protectivity, the cholinergic neurons in MS and VDB that are mainly projected to the hippocampal/parahippocampal regions might be protected to regulate social memory formation, emotion, and other psychological functions. Consequently, the lack of HAP1 protectivity might make cholinergic neurons in the striatum more prone to neurodegeneration in certain NDs.",

This study aimed to estimate the current prevalence of betel nut chewing, identify the sociodemographic correlates in urban and rural settings, and identify any vulnerable group for future policy-making to address this problem. This is a retrospective study of secondary data analysis based on the data of the Bangladesh Health and Injury Survey 2016. The outcome variable of interest was the self-reported practice of chewing betel nuts. Only ≥ 18 years old participants were considered. In the logistic regression model, the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to determine the correlates of each independent variable. The multivariable model's explanatory variables were all tested to ensure no multi-collinearity in the final model. The prevalence of betel nut chewing was 31.4% among the study population. Multivariate analysis showed that participants aged 65 years and above were 10 times more likely to be betel nut users (AOR 10.17; 95% CI 9.58-10.79), while rural populations were 1.24 times more likely to use betel nut (AOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.21-1.27). Given the significant public health burden, targeted interventions are warranted to mitigate its impact. The findings indicate that betel nut chewing is highly prevalent, particularly among older, illiterate, and rural populations, demonstrating stark social and geographic inequalities. However, as the data were collected in 2016, the current socio-political and economic changes in Bangladesh may have influenced this trend, limiting the direct applicability of the findings to the present context.",

        "abstract": "Hospital-based research plays a crucial role in advancing medical knowledge, but it also presents significant ethical challenges, particularly when involving hospitalized patients. Ethical concerns such as informed consent, patient autonomy, and the power dynamics between healthcare providers and patients are critical to maintaining the integrity of such research. The aim of this research was to explore and analyze the ethical considerations in conducting research involving hospitalized patients. A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to investigate the experiences and perceptions of healthcare professionals involved in clinical or public health research in hospital settings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 participants from both public and private hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring ethical themes. This study identified five key themes: (1) Ethical challenges in hospital-based research, (2) Informed consent and patient vulnerability, (3) Patient autonomy and decision-making in research, (4) Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and ethical oversight, and (5) Strategies to improve ethical research practices in hospitals. Participants reported concerns about coercion, difficulties in obtaining consent from critically ill patients, conflicts in surrogate decision-making, and delays in IRB approval. The findings also emphasized the importance of ethical training, continuous consent practices, and patient-centered approaches. Ethical research practices in hospital settings require a balance between scientific progress and patient protection. The study emphasizes the need for improved ethical guidelines, better informed consent processes, and ongoing training for healthcare professionals to ensure patient autonomy is respected. The findings also call for streamlined Institutional Review Board (IRB) processes to support timely and ethical research execution.",

        "title": "Socioeconomic inequalities and its spatial pattern in sanitary napkin use in Bangladesh: evidence from the 2019 multiple indicator cluster survey.",
        "abstract": "Utilization of unhygienic menstrual products has been associated with various adverse health consequences, particularly in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh. In this context, this study attempted to measure socioeconomic inequalities in sanitary napkin use among women aged 15-49 and assess its spatial pattern at the disaggregated level (district). We used the latest available nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019 data. The analytical sample size was 54,702 reproductive-aged (15-49 years) women. The Erreygers Index (EI) and the Wagstaff Index (WI) were employed to measure and decompose the socioeconomic inequalities in sanitary napkin use. Natural Break (Jenks) classification method, Global Moran's I and the Cluster and Outlier Analysis were used to analyze the spatial pattern of socioeconomic inequalities at the district level. The findings reveal that approximately 26.22% of women used sanitary napkins at the national level. Both the EI (0.41208; p-value < 0.001) and the WI (0.53251; p-value < 0.001) indicate a pro-rich inequality in sanitary napkin use. Decomposition results indicated that wealth status, educational attainment, household characteristics (particularly educational attainment of household head) and exposure to media were the most important factors accounting for socioeconomic inequalities. From the spatial analyses, we found significant district-level variations in both sanitary napkin use and its socioeconomic inequalities. Global Moran's I value indicated positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning that similar values tend to cluster together. Notably, a northwestern and southeastern divide was found between High-High and Low-Low clusters of socioeconomic inequalities. Our study provides evidence for informed policymaking targeting women from the lower socioeconomic stratum, especially those living in the northwestern and southeastern regions to increase sanitary napkin use.",

        "abstract": "Implementation fidelity is critical for the efficient delivery of health services including leprosy services. Healthcare providers are important in monitoring the disease's progression, managing complications, and cross-checking prescribed medications. This study explored implementation fidelity in leprosy care and support for disability prevention and management in Rupandehi district, Nepal. A qualitative case study design was adopted based on implementation research principles. From 25th February to 30th April 2024, data were collected through multiple sources and methods, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and observation. Semi-structured interview guidelines and qualitative checklists facilitated the data collection process. Participants were chosen using purposive and selective sampling methods. The data were inductively coded using qualitative analysis software. Thematic analysis was done with codes generated and aggregated to form sub-themes and develop themes. The study revealed that healthcare providers consistently adhered to national leprosy operational guidelines, ensuring sufficient fidelity by prompt multi-drug therapy, case diagnosis, complicated case referral, and regular follow-up. In contrast, poor adherence was demonstrated in the complication management of lepra reactions, ulcer cases, and self-care. The major barriers to leprosy services were financial hardship, complication management, pill burden, drug side effects, and institutional obstacles. In contrast, the facilitators to leprosy services included adequate human resources, treatment supporter's involvement, effective communications, external development partner's role, transportation incentives, and local government support. Healthcare providers demonstrated sufficient adherence to leprosy operational guidelines. While significant gaps were evident in complication management, addressing financial and systematic barriers and leveraging facilitators is essential to strengthening leprosy care and support for disability prevention and management.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this scoping review was to map the nature and extent of the existing literature on mental health interventions for humanitarian volunteers in disaster contexts. The study also explored how the interventions were evaluated. The methodology of this scoping review followed the extended guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews. Five academic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar), grey literature websites (Google Scholar, ProQuest, Policy Commons, etc.) and relevant organisational archives were systematically searched for eligible documents. Both peer-reviewed and grey literature studies on mental health interventions for humanitarian volunteers in the context of any type of disaster were eligible for inclusion. Research papers that evaluated any such intervention were also included. Documents that targeted professional humanitarian workers or explored physical health conditions or diseases in disaster contexts, letters to the editor, comments, correspondence and research protocols were excluded. There were no restrictions in terms of the date and language of the documents. A systematic search of the targeted databases was conducted from 12 May 2025 to 20 May 2025. Deduplication, screening and full-text evaluation for the selection of documents were done using the online version of Rayyan. Data were collected and recorded into a structured Microsoft Excel sheet. Two researchers individually conducted the selection of the articles and the extraction of data. A third researcher helped to resolve any discrepancies if required. A total of 2627 documents were retrieved by searching the targeted databases and websites. After matching them with the eligibility criteria, 20 documents were included in the final list. 14 of them were research papers; the rest was organisational literature. All the papers were from 2006 and later, except one that was from 1998. No documents were found from the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan regions. 10 broad categories of interventions were identified, which were either implemented in the field or suggested in the form of guidelines. Most of the interventions were postexposure and preventive in nature. Psychological first aid was the most widely used intervention in this context, being used by the national societies of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Nine of the documents were research papers evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions using different scales and customised questionnaires. Four of them did not observe any notable effect on the mental health of the participants. Over the past two decades, the evidence on mental health interventions for humanitarian volunteers has grown. The reviewed literature documented various interventions and guidelines that need further study and testing to both prove and improve their effectiveness. Organisational policies could incorporate and further evaluate these to ensure the psychosocial well-being of volunteers. A review of research papers on intervention effectiveness found heterogeneity in settings, designs, interventions and methods, precluding a systematic review. More research is needed on individual interventions, volunteer perceptions and comparing interventions to identify the most effective ones. Additionally, comparing pre-exposure and postexposure interventions with multimodal systems that support volunteers throughout deployment is recommended.",

Systematic search of PubMed was performed on November 18, 2024 using a search string \"pulmonary rehabilitation\" AND (\"global\" OR \"international\" OR \"consensus\" OR \"standards\" OR \"guidelines\" OR \"recommendations\" OR \"statement\" OR \"position\") followed by citation searching. All PR publications from January 1, 2010 onwards were included if they were globally oriented, reported original research data, and targeted people with chronic respiratory disease (with or without comorbidity). The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Of the initial 1302 records screened in PubMed, 17 were assessed for eligibility by reviewing their full-text articles, which excluded 7 articles. Citation searching and snowballing yielded 5 more eligible articles, resulting in a total of 15 eligible articles included for analysis. Of these, 6 (40%) were explicitly global while the remainder were implicitly global. Study participants (n = 823) originated from 40 different countries, based on reported data or provided by correspondence. Of these, high-income countries contributed 748 participants (91%), followed by upper-middle-income countries with 59 participants (7%), lower-middle-income countries with 15 participants (12%), and one low-income country with 1 participant (<1%).

        "abstract": "Farm environments serve as reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), spreading resistance genes. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a nosocomial opportunistic pathogen, often acquires resistance through MGEs. This study examined the prevalence, resistance patterns, and factors associated with MGEs in K. pneumoniae isolates, focusing on environmental and management practices. 48 pooled samples were collected from environmental niches in three major districts of Bangladesh including Dhaka, Barisal, and Sylhet and analyzed using standard microbiological techniques and PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed per CLSI (2020) guidelines, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were identified. Genotypic resistance patterns and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including class 1 integrons and plasmids, were detected via PCR. Fisher's exact test evaluated factors associated with MGEs. Overall, 66.66% tested positive for K. pneumoniae. Regarding resistance patterns, the highest resistance was observed to ertapenem (90.6%) and ampicillin (84%), while complete sensitivity was noted to several antibiotics, including amikacin and tigecycline. Among the tested isolates, 53.12% were identified as MDR. Genotypic analysis revealed that bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, bla<sub>NDM-5,</sub>bla<sub>Oxa-1</sub> and bla<sub>Oxa-48</sub> were the most prevalent. Additionally, the presence of MGEs including class 1 integron and IncQ type plasmid were significantly associated with factors such as poor sanitation, antibiotic misuse, and high cattle density, highlighting critical areas for intervention. This study revealed that MDR K. pneumoniae circulates in food animals' farm environments in Bangladesh, with environmental factors strongly linked to the presence of MGEs. Farm niches, particularly soil, act as key reservoirs of MGEs and resistance genes. Importantly, these also carry serious implications for human health, as resistance genes may transfer to clinical settings, exacerbating the burden of AMR. Strengthening environmental and agricultural policies through a One Health approach is essential to mitigate the public health threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-pocket (OOP) cost of cancer treatment has increased substantially globally. In low- and middle-income countries, many patients face financial distress due to cancer. For patients with cancers in Bangladesh, this study aimed to (1) estimate the annual OOP cost of cancers from households' perspective, (2) assess the coping strategies and financial distress, and (3) examine factors associated with OOP cost. We used data from a cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted in three randomly selected hospitals in Bangladesh. A bottom-up micro-costing approach was used to estimate the OOP cost components. We used the logistic regression model and the generalized linear model to examine the determinants of distress financing and OOP cost, respectively. The average annual OOP cost per cancer patient was US$ 6,504 (range, US$ 959 - 29,681), which was greater than 2 times the average annual household income. About 90% of households faced distress financing due to cancer. Having at least one comorbid condition, cancer stage 2 or higher, households having no elderly people, or having treatment abroad was significantly associated with a higher OOP cost compared to those without the condition. OOP cost of cancer treatment and the proportions of patients with distress financing and financial catastrophe are alarmingly high in Bangladesh. Earlier cancer diagnosis and implementation of Government financial health protection schemes are crucial and urgent to alleviate the enormous economic burden and ensure equitable access to care for the patients.",

Serial passaging of the Peste Des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) in nonnative hosts can lead to mutations that potentially reduce pathogenicity. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of serial passaging of a Bangladeshi strain of PPR virus in Vero cells on the Fusion protein and pathogenicity MATERIALS AND METHODS: PPR viruses were initially isolated from natural PPR outbreaks, confirmed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‒PCR), passaged to the 9th passage in Vero cells, sequenced, and preserved in a previous study. The 9th passage virus from the repository was utilized as the viral inoculant for further passaging in Vero cells, and the 60th passage was completed. The presence of PPR viral RNA was confirmed in tissue culture fluid (TCF) by RT‒PCR at different passage numbers. TCF at the 60th passage was sequenced and used for immunogenicity studies via live animal experiments, and subsequent immunity was measured via cELISA. Comparative analysis of the sequences from the 9th and 60th passages, along with other sequences, revealed substitutions of 14 nucleotides (nts) and 4 amino acids (aa) within the leucine zipper structure of the fusion protein. Notably, live animal experiments demonstrated the occurrence of protective immunity. This study suggests that amino acid substitution and genetic divergence may positively affect viral virulence, highlighting their importance in the development of a potent vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affect many reproductive-aged women and can significantly impact their quality of life, including academic performance, relationships, and mental health, perhaps even leading to suicidal behavior. However, there was no validated, robust, and psychometrically sound instrument to screen for symptoms in the Bangladeshi context. This study aimed to translate and adapt a widely used instrument, the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) in the Bangladeshi context, and to assess the prevalence of PMS and PMDD among adolescent girls in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 939 adolescent girls in Bangladesh aged 11-19 years using the \"Konnect\" platform of a2i between April to October 2022. Data were collected through a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire that included informed consent, socio-demographic information, menstrual history, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), and the PSST scale. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics and confirmatory factor analysis, was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0) and IBM SPSS Amos (version 26.0). Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the Bangla version of the PSST with depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the DASS-21. The prevalence estimates of moderate to severe PMS and PMDD were 33.16%, and 19.05%, respectively. Item-level analysis showed that the measurement items were normally distributed which suggested measurement of the same construct. The Bangla version of the PSST demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.96) and convergent validity. The total PSST score was positively and significantly correlated with depression (r = 0.54), anxiety (r = 0.50), and stress (r = 0.50), suggesting convergent validity. The scale-level psychometric properties were satisfactory, indicating an excellent fit to the data and supporting convergent validity. The Bangla version of the PSST was found to be a valid screening tool for assessing PMS in women in Bangladesh. It will help to identify and address their healthcare needs, promote well-being, and advance further research in the Bangladeshi context.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among adolescent offspring of female sex workers and compare that with adolescent offspring of slum-dwellers in Daulatdia and Dhaka city, Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 394 adolescent children (196 adolescent offspring of sex workers and 198 adolescent offspring of slum dwellers) from March 2024 to May 2024 using a structured questionnaire. The study was conducted through face-to-face interviews where sociodemographic details, along with information regarding emotional and behavioral health problems, were assessed through the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scale, and health-related quality of life was assessed through the Kidscreen-10 scale. Descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis, and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. The prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems was 13% for adolescent offspring of Daulatdia and 15% for Korail slum. Age and gender in brothel settings and HRQoL in both settings were found to be significantly associated with emotional and behavioral difficulties. Adolescent offspring of FSWs with low HRQoL (OR = 4.09, p-value < 0.05, CI 1.579-10.595) were 4.09 times more likely to suffer from abnormal mental disorders than those with average or high HRQoL. While in a slum setting, it is 2.825 times higher (OR = 2.825, p-value < 0.05, CI 1.142-6.987). The study concluded that the overall prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems for adolescent offspring of FSWs was significantly lower than for adolescent offspring of slum dwellers in the emotional problem subscale.

A total of 50 respiratory samples were prospectively collected from the patients with CF got admitted in the Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Bangladesh from February 2021 to October 2021. Sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were processed for culture and microbiological testing. Sample collection and evaluation were performed according to the Good Laboratory Practice guidelines (GLP). Informed written consent was ensured before participation. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v26.0. The median age of the children was 30 months (6-120) months, with a male predominance (66.0% vs. 34.0%). Single and two organisms were isolated in 72.0% (n=36) and 12.0% (n=6) of cases, respectively. During the study period, 36.0% of the patients harbored Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.0% harbored Klebsiella pneumoniae and both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were detected in 16.0% of cases. Levofloxacin was found to be the most active antibiotic agent with 100.0% susceptibility. In contrast, nearly all isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, erythromycin and rifampicin. Levofloxacin is the most effective agent to treat CF patients. Active surveillance of the resistance pattern should always continue to be promoted.",

        "abstract": "The WHO's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) in young infants <2 months of age includes the identification and management of signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI). However, equal importance is given to all the PSBI signs, which signal the need for referral and hospital management, except for fast breathing in infants aged 7-59 days, for which outpatient treatment by clinical staff working at a health facility is recommended. Moreover, studies to validate the importance of clinical signs of PSBI have mostly used the need for hospitalisation as the outcome. There is a need to further examine the association of signs of PSBI individually and in combination with risk of mortality and to analyse global data to inform global recommendations. We will create a dataset that integrates data from population-based studies globally with similar designs that have examined the presence of signs of PSBI identified by frontline health workers throughout the young infant period (days 0 to <60) and that have also recorded infant vital status. We will conduct pooled, individual-level analyses of the frequency of identification of signs individually and in combinations and will conduct three types of analyses of association of signs of PSBI with mortality: (1) case fatality, which has been used in a multisite study of mortality risk associated with signs of PSBI in young infants in Africa; (2) Cox regression, which will enable time-varying analysis of exposure in relation to mortality, as has been done in a multisite study in Asia and (3) machine learning analysis, which has not previously been applied to any of the available data. All prior studies incorporated into our pooled analysis were approved by the independent local ethics committee/institutional review board (IRB) at each study site in each country, and all study participants provided informed consent. This project was approved by the Stanford University School of Medicine IRB protocol 74456.

        "abstract": "Diabetes remains a silent epidemic in underrepresented high-risk groups like professional drivers, highlighting the urgent need for informed health policies and targeted interventions. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and related health awareness among professional drivers in northeastern Bangladesh using opportunistic random blood glucose (RBG) testing to address knowledge gaps and inform health policy. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,454 participants enrolled between February 5, 2024 and July 27, 2024, using a consent-based questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and RBG testing with a glucometer. Diabetes awareness was assessed using pre-tested questionnaires, while the prevalence of diabetes and associated factors were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U tests, Welch ANOVA, and Spearman correlation analysis. A total of 2.20% of the driver population were found to have undiagnosed diabetes. RBG levels differed significantly across regions. Middle age (7.63%) and overweight (3.77%) groups exhibited the highest prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Confounding variables such as BMI (r = 0.22, p < 0.0001), age (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001), and sleep duration (r = -0.05, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with glucose levels, indicating potential risk factors for diabetes. The obese group (AOR: 3.04, 95% CI: 0.81-11.46) and overweight group (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 0.83-3.99) were 3.04 and 1.81 times more likely, respectively, to develop diabetes compared to the healthy weight group. Participants with less than 7 hours of sleep (AOR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.46-2.75) were also at greater risk. Co-morbidities and a family history of diabetes were also significantly associated with elevated RBG levels. Overall, this study highlights the regional and behavioral disparities influencing the development of diabetes risk among professional drivers, a population often neglected in health policy. It underscores the need for health education and large-scale RBG testing to improve awareness and alert policymakers in formulating effective health guidelines.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically map available evidence on menopause-related knowledge, symptoms and management in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and identify critical gaps to inform research and policy. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies were those that reported on menopause-related knowledge, symptom prevalence or management in LMICs. Data were extracted and synthesised descriptively and thematically. From 10,758 records, 252 studies from 41 LMICs were included. Most were cross-sectional (85%) and relied on non-probability sampling (62%), with only 4% being nationally representative. Menopause classification methods were often inconsistent, with only 17.5% of studies using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) +10 or World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. National-level data on age at menopause are lacking across all LMICs. The prevalences of vasomotor symptoms, joint pain and sexual concerns were comparable with high-income countries. However, data on the severity and burden of symptoms were scarce. Knowledge about menopause and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was poor, especially in low-income and rural settings. Cultural stigma, misconceptions and healthcare provider knowledge gaps contributed to low uptake of evidence-based menopause care. MHT use was consistently low, with women predominantly using traditional remedies. Provider hesitancy, lack of training and structural health system barriers were key limitations in service delivery. Despite a growing population of postmenopausal women, menopause remains a neglected health issue across LMICs. There is an urgent need to integrate menopause into reproductive and non-communicable disease policies, invest in provider education and ensure equitable access to evidence-based menopause care, including MHT, for women in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable solid waste management is crucial for development, contributing to public health, environmental protection, and economic stability. Effective practices reduce pollution, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve resources through recycling and waste-to-energy innovations. In Bangladesh, medical waste management (MWM) is equally critical for healthcare delivery, playing a key role in safeguarding health, protecting the environment, and supporting economic growth. Despite its importance, MWM services in Bangladesh are underutilised, posing significant challenges. While literature highlights the importance of effective MWM in low-income countries and its impact on public health and the environment, it often lacks a socio-economic or institutional perspective on policy issues. This study explores Bangladesh's MWM capacity through a qualitative approach, analysing policy documents, interviewing Key Informants (KIs) from various organisations, and observing healthcare establishments (HCEs). Using Walt and Gilson's Policy Triangle Framework (1994), it identifies the strengths and weaknesses of current policies and practices and comes up with recommendations for sustainable practice interventions. Document analysis reveals that Bangladesh introduced a MWM policy in 2008, several decades after its independence. While the policy outlined the characteristics of medical waste, introduced the use of colour-coded bins for segregation, and defined the roles and responsibilities of government and non-government authorities, it failed to address the associated health and environmental risks comprehensively. Moreover, the policy has not been reviewed or updated in alignment with the WHO's 2018 guidelines. KIs reported poor collaboration and coordination among policy actors and unclear operation of MW committees at different government levels. Field observations indicated inadequate training, motivation, and ethics for waste handlers, a lack of public awareness, and no record-keeping of MW production and management. Urgent policy revisions, stakeholder collaboration, enhanced training, awareness programmes, and citizen empowerment and engagement are crucial for achieving sustainable MWM practices in wider community.",

Understanding their level of satisfaction can help identify areas for improvement and foster a supportive work environment, ultimately enhancing patient care outcomes. This study aims to investigate nurses' satisfaction with workplace facilities in a tertiary hospital. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 nurses working in a tertiary hospital. The study period was from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023. Convenient sampling techniques were used. Data was collected through pretested semi-structured questionnaires. The analysis of satisfaction level was categorized by 49 questions with a 5-point Likert scale and divided by percentile intervals. Cronbach's α shows the reliability of the data and the association between two categorical variables was done by the Chi-square test & Fisher exact test. <i>p</i>-value <.05 was considered as a level of significance. The study follows the STROBE guidelines to ensure the reliability and validity of its findings. Results showed that among 384 respondents 96.4% were female. Regarding overall satisfaction, 23.7% have extremely low satisfaction, 27.3% have low satisfaction, 23.2% were moderately satisfied and 25.8% were highly satisfied. There was an association between overall satisfaction with religion, work experience, monthly salary, and monthly family income (<i>p</i> < .05). About 72% were dissatisfied with the current salary and training facilities. Maximum respondents agreed that there are no facilities for recreation (97.4%) and day-care (98.7%). About two-thirds (77%) of the respondents recommended that the number of nurses and supporting staff should be increased and favoritism should be stopped. This study reveals significant dissatisfaction among nurses regarding salary, training, and the lack of recreational and daycare facilities. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving nurse satisfaction and patient care outcomes. Tailored approaches, including increased staff and reduced favoritism, are recommended to enhance the work environment.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses through effective pain management with opioids. Despite its global importance, opioid use in palliative care faces significant challenges, particularly in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, opioid use is notably low, with disparities between urban and rural areas. Cultural stigmas, strict regulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training further obstruct effective pain management. This study aims to explore the challenges healthcare providers face regarding opioid use in both hospital and home-based palliative care settings. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using face-to-face semistructured interviews with 135 licensed healthcare providers from August to September 2022. The respondents, predominantly young (57% aged 20-39) and female (68.9%), primarily manage late-stage cancer patients (98.5%), with pain (100%) being the primary symptom treated. Morphine syrup is commonly used (68.1%), whereas oxycodone and buprenorphine are unavailable. Side effects such as deep sedation (43.7%) and addiction (34.1%) highlight the need for careful monitoring. Limited awareness (10.4%) of national opioid policies results in inconsistent practices (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Prescribing restrictions (60.7%) and dispensing rights issues contribute to operational challenges, affecting patient access to pain management. Misconceptions about palliative care (32.6%) and inter-departmental non-cooperation (38.5%) hinder patient referrals (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and continuity of care. Inconsistent awareness of opioid policies causes varied practices and attitudes. Addressing referral challenges and prescribing restrictions requires interdisciplinary solutions, enhanced education, better policy dissemination, and standardized guidelines for effective palliative care opioid management.",

        "title": "Antibiotic dispensing practices in community pharmacies: Implications for antimicrobial stewardship in resource-constrained settings.",
        "abstract": "Over-the-counter antibiotic sales in community-pharmacies significantly drive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to inappropriate use and early treatment discontinuation. In Bangladesh, community pharmacies, which dispense 56.6 % of antibiotics without prescriptions, serve as the first health-seeking touchpoint, yet conventional stewardship strategies often overlook these informal providers, heightening AMR risks. This study examines drug-sellers' understanding and practices towards antibiotic dispensing and compares their symptomatic-treatment practices with Bangladesh's Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) to understand the extent of antibiotic misuse. A cross-sectional survey in two urban and two rural areas of Bangladesh involved 120 drug-sellers from 30 randomly selected pharmacies per site. Knowledge was compared between drug-sellers with pharmacy-dispensing training and those without training, and their suggested treatments for two simulated health-symptoms-upper respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal infections-were evaluated against STGs to determine the extent of misuse. Most drug-sellers were aged 41-50 years (35.0 %), with 39.2 % holding a bachelor's degree or higher, and 65.8 % having pharmacy-dispensing training. The overall knowledge score on antibiotic use and AMR was moderate at 60.2 % (5-7 out of 10), with 32.5 % scoring ≤4, indicating poor knowledge; trained drug-sellers scored significantly better (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Over half (57.5 %) were unaware of antibiotic dispensing policies, though most (75.8 %) acknowledged the link between AMR and antibiotic use. For simulated upper respiratory-tract infections, 54.2 % recommended single antibiotic-90.8 % Watch, 9.2 % Access (per WHO-AWaRe classification)-with 66.2 % of these prescriptions deviating from guidelines due to inappropriate selection or dosage. For gastrointestinal infections, 55.8 % recommended single antibiotic (40.3 % Watch, 59.7 % Access), with 82.1 % deviated from the guidelines. Additionally, 26.7 % recommended two antibiotics (51.6 % Watch, 48.4 % Access), all of which were inconsistent with guideline recommendations. For both simulated symptoms, no significant difference was observed in drug sellers' treatment practices based on their knowledge level. This study highlights the need for context-specific policies and regulatory measures in informal healthcare settings. While improving drug-sellers' knowledge is vital for antimicrobial stewardship in LMICs like Bangladesh, it alone is insufficient due to market competition, weak regulation, and patient-driven demand. Thus, curbing inappropriate antibiotic use at the community level requires stronger enforcement and multifaceted, context-tailored interventions-including public awareness, targeted training, and market-responsive strategies.",

        "abstract": "Since August 2017, approximately 960,000 Rohingya refugees have settled in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and programs were implemented across the camps to address the needs of the population and reduce the burden of linked infectious diseases. However, monitoring and maintenance of this infrastructure has been inconsistent. This study aimed to assess progress in WASH in the camps of Cox's Bazar since the early emergency phase in 2018, and to update the priorities for intervention. From January to March 2022, a lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) survey was conducted across 19 camps. Nineteen households were randomly selected per camp. Data on access to and quality of WASH services, household practices, and health outcomes including skin infections among children under five years of age were collected. Crude and weighted averages with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each indicator and compared with targets pre-defined based on Sphere guidelines and Médecins Sans Frontières WASH experts. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the results to a 2018 LQAS survey. More than half of the indicators (59%; 16/27) did not meet the pre-determined targets. Performance was adequate on three of five water quality and supply indicators, with less than half of households (44%, 95% CI: 39-49%) reporting that water was continuously available in the past week. Regarding water storage, performance on three indicators was considered adequate, as the proportion of households that keep water for less than one day was 27% (95% CI: 23-32%). Of six hygiene indicators, adequate performance was identified for only one. Performance on the sanitation indicators was inadequate, with 11% (95% CI: 8-15%) of households using an improved sanitation facility. In solid waste management, two of four indicators suggested adequate performance, and for health outcomes, the proportion of children who hadn't shown any skin infection was inadequate at 69% (95% CI: 64-73%). Improvements in the WASH situation in Cox's Bazar have been observed in 2022 compared to 2018. However, significant gaps remain in water supply, sanitation facilities, and hygiene services. LQAS can be an effective monitoring tool to support long-term multisectoral interventions in protracted emergencies.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 13, 2023, to May 24, 2024. Data collection included facility assessments, structured questionnaires, and direct observations using World Health Organization (WHO)-adapted tools. The study covered both private and public hospitals across 6 subdistricts in Bangladesh, representing a mix of urban and rural populations. Senior hospital staff and administrators were surveyed. Inclusion criteria were general inpatient and outpatient pediatric care delivered in hospitals. Diagnostic centers and specialized facilities were excluded. Availability of pediatric infrastructure, workforce, essential medications, and adherence to clinical guidelines assessed against WHO standards. The primary outcomes included the presence of pediatric-specific departments, neonatal care facilities, and trained personnel and adherence to WHO care standards. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests to highlight disparities. The study sample included 102 private and 7 public hospitals. A significantly higher proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals had pediatric inpatient departments (100% vs 39.2%), newborn wards (100% vs 12.8%), and trained nurses (100% vs 32.4%). Only private hospitals in the sample had neonatal intensive care units (6.9% vs 0%). Pediatricians were available for extended consultations at a greater proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals (71.4% vs 26.5%).

However, the real-world impact of contemporary guidelines and trials on practising physicians in the Asia-Pacific region remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices among cardiovascular physicians in the region regarding stable CAD management. An anonymised cross-sectional electronic survey was administered to cardiovascular practitioners from the Asia Pacific, assessing 3 domains: 1) baseline knowledge on recent trials and society guideline, 2) attitudes towards stable CAD, and 3) case scenarios reflecting management preferences. Correlations among knowledge, attitudes and practice scores were assessed between physicians from developed and developing countries using Pearson correlation. Overall, 713 respondents from 21 countries completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 2.90±1.18 (out of 4), with 37.3% of respondents answering all questions correctly, while 74.6% noted that guidelines have significant impact on their practice. Despite guidelines recommending optimal medical therapy, majority chose revascularisation (range 53.4- 90.6%) as the preferred strategy for the case scenarios. Practitioners from developed regions had higher knowledge scores and lower attitude scores compared to developing regions, while practice scores were similar in both groups. Weakly positive correlations were noted between knowledge, attitude and practice scores. Variations exist in knowledge and attitudes towards guideline recommendations and correspondingly actual clinical practice in the Asia Pacific, with most practitioners choosing an upfront invasive strategy for the treatment of stable CAD.

This paper emphasizes the importance of FPS and business collaboration to promote FRC and sheds new light on manufacturing stakeholders' involvement. That is why this research aims to investigate the relationship between PL and FRC, including the mediating effect of FPS. Additionally, CR functioned as a moderator in the connection between FPS and FRC. This study applies the social information processing (SIP) theory as the theoretical background by bringing the dynamics between leaders and followers to the current scholarly discourse. A quantitative survey was conducted through a structured questionnaire from the samples, including 82 leaders and 240 followers from 178 manufacturing companies from all parts of Bangladesh. The researchers in this study employed SPSS for the descriptive statistics and PLS-SEM to evaluate the anticipated connections. Moreover, the quantitative results showed that PL has a positive and substantial relationship with both FPS and FRC (β = 0.25, t-statistics = 5.67, P < 0.001). Additionally, FPS has a mediation effect on the link between PL and FRC (β=-0.12, t-statistics = 22.59, P < 0.001) On the other hand, it has been found that the collaborative relationship's moderating influence is insignificant (β = 0.29, T-values = 0.66, SE = 0.0000031). This study clarifies how PL and FPS develop the FRC in Bangladeshi industrial firms. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting how organizations can promote FRC among their followers, foster PS through CR, and motivate individuals to actively participate in FRC endeavors to boost organizational productivity and effectiveness.",

Understanding the distribution and prevalence of different Norovirus genotypes is crucial for public health surveillance and intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review of Norovirus genotypes in Asia from 2000 to 2023. The review adhered to PRISMA Guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42024572647). We extracted data on the prevalence of 22 genotypes and their genetic variations over time. The review highlighted Norovirus GII.4 as highly prevalent across Asia, particularly in India, Taiwan, Vietnam, and China. GII.2 dominated Indonesia, GII.3 prevailed in Malaysia, Russia, and Bangladesh, GII.7 in Bangladesh, and GII.17 in China, Taiwan, and Nepal, with notable epidemiological shifts between 2012 and 2016 and GII.4 resurgence from 2017. The study highlights the dynamic nature of Norovirus genotypic distribution in Asia, with both persistent dominance of certain genotypes and notable regional variations.

        "title": "Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy as a preventive measure for venous thromboembolism after total hip arthroplasty: A systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant and avoidable complication that may occur after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Various mechanical and chemical prophylactic measures may mitigate this elevated risk of death and functional impairment. Consequently, early prevention of VTE is essential via the identification of related risk factors. A search was performed using the databases of PubMed, ScienceDirect, PEDro, and Cochrane Library to get papers from 2004 to 2024 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English that included at least one group undergoing intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) treatment as a prophylactic intervention after total hip arthroplasty (THA) were included. This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO. The quality evaluation of the included studies was conducted using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk of bias instrument. We selected 12 studies from a total of 733 based on predetermined criteria. A total of 2,352 patients of both genders underwent total hip arthroplasty, comprising 1,294 patients in the experimental group and 1,058 patients in the control group across the included studies. The results indicate that the combination of IPC and pharmaceutical agents was the most effective treatment for reducing VTE risk in patients who underwent THA. IPC therapy is very effective in avoiding VTE, particularly when used in combination with pharmacological therapies after THA surgery. The best ways to lower the risk of VTE are to use both IPC and anticoagulants together. However, IPC alone may lower the risk of VTE compared to not using any prevention at all. In general, IPC is a crucial component of comprehensive VTE prevention strategies in THA.",

Non-specific symptoms and limitations of existing diagnostics involve challenges for informed policymaking and clinical practice. This paper reviews common practices in reporting the selection and definition of cost and effect parameters, and in reporting the translation of effect parameters into utility and disability weights, in health economic evaluations of TB diagnostic tests. A targeted literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified health economic evaluations of diagnosis and population screening strategies for TB. We found 28 studies comprising 11 cost-effectiveness and 17 cost-utility analyses. Observed patient data were used in 6 studies, 22 relied solely on model-based evaluations. Variations in prevalence, accuracy, and utility parameters were common, the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards terminology for costing was only used in 8 out of 28 studies. Future studies should state the exact type of TB studied, as it can manifest in multiple organs, remain inactive for long periods of time, and since different diagnostics can perform differently depending on the site involved it may influence test accuracies. Additionally, potential impacts of sequential diagnostics on test accuracy and the cost of inaction should receive more attention. Precise terminology and transparent definitions of parameters and methodology in health economics evaluations are necessary to generate evidence that guides policymakers and supports clinical decision-making in the context of TB.",

        "abstract": "Proper menstrual management is crucial for well-being and reproductive health. Despite global efforts to improve menstrual health, more than 2.3 billion girls and women still lack access to adequate menstrual hygiene facilities. This issue is exacerbated in physically demanding sports, where menstrual health can impact performance. This study examines the menstrual experiences and challenges adolescent female athletes face in Bangladesh. It seeks to identify their current menstruation management practices, assess physical, psychological, and sociocultural challenges during menstruation, and evaluate the facility improvements and support systems needed to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance. A qualitative research design was employed, focusing on a phenomenological approach to understand the lived experiences of adolescent athletes. The study was conducted at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports Education (BKSP), which serves approximately 1,500 female athletes. A purposive sampling strategy selected 32 adolescent athletes for in-depth interviews (IDIs) and two focus group discussions (FGDs), which were segmented by age. Additionally, six key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with coaches and administrative staff. The data were collected through audio-recorded interviews, and thematic analysis was performed. This study revealed that sociocultural taboos and misconceptions significantly affect menstrual management practices among athletes. Physical challenges include discomfort, irregular cycles, and limited access to menstrual hygiene products, contributing to increased absenteeism from training. Psychological impacts, such as concerns about reproductive health and inadequate guidance on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), further complicate the situation. Both athletes and coaches expressed a need for better education and resources. Addressing menstrual management challenges for adolescent female athletes requires a comprehensive approach. Enhanced knowledge and awareness, improved access to menstrual hygiene products, and targeted education for athletes and coaches are essential to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the prevalence of male adolescents' attitudes towards wife-beating and to explore the associations between sociodemographic factors and the acceptance of wife-beating in 20 low and lower-middle-income countries. This study utilized a secondary data analysis from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) across 20 lower-and lower-middle-income countries. To understand male adolescents' attitudes towards justifying wife beatings, we examined factors such as residence, wealth index, education level, and household size. Data analysis was conducted using Stata 17 software, applying weighting methods from the DHS Program to ensure the results accurately represented the target population. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between variables. Among the 26,794 individuals surveyed globally, 4.84% believed that wife beating could be justified. In Guinea, the prevalence stood at 13.42%, whereas Zimbabwe reported a figure of 1.56% in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, in Timor-Leste, located in South and Southeast Asia, 16.11% of people justified wife beating, while Myanmar had a mere 2.31% expressing such views. Adolescents residing in rural areas were more likely to endorse wife beating compared to their urban counterparts, who had significantly lower odds (AOR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.07-0.67). Likewise, higher levels of education played a crucial role in diminishing the likelihood of endorsing wife beating; in Guinea, adolescents with secondary education or higher were substantially less likely to support such attitudes (AOR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58). The research findings shed light on how young men view violence against women, revealing differences in attitudes across regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are diverse perspectives, with Guinea having a higher prevalence that requires immediate efforts. The concerning prevalence in Jordan highlights the importance of promoting gender equality in West Asia. These findings emphasize the need for interventions that shift beliefs and encourage tangible behavioral changes. Community workshops and skill-building programs can help translate awareness into action. It is crucial to address these attitudes to combat violence effectively.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) bring double burden of diseases for Bangladesh where public health system is facing challenges to tackle it. Previous studies investigating healthcare utilization by the patients with NCDs lack nationally representative data. The present study examined healthcare utilization and factors associated with utilizing different types of health facilities (public/private/medicine shop /others/multiple providers). This study further tried to find out the linkage between utilizing different types of health facilities and the receipt of at least one lifestyle behaviour or more, and patient-related medication non-adherence. We analysed nationally representative cross-sectional STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPS) Survey 2018 in Bangladesh. Following Andersen's conceptual framework and applying multinomial logistic regression, we examined multiple types of healthcare utilization to estimate and identify predictors associated with the types of healthcare facilities accessed. Further relationships with the receipt of at least one lifestyle behaviour or more, and patient-related medication non-adherence were investigated using binary logistic regression. The majority of the participants used private facilities (41.0%) for curative care. For accessing medicine for NCDs, participants mostly used medicine shop (81.2%). In the fully adjusted model comparing public facilities vs. medicine shop respondents with no formal education (vs. university education or higher) were more likely to use medicine shop (adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR):3.9; confidence interval (CI):1.1,13.5). While comparing public facilities vs. other healthcare options (village doctor, alternative medicine practitioner (Homeo, Ayurveda, Unani) and traditional healer), respondents from rural area (vs. urban) more likely to utilize other healthcare options (aRRR: 3.5; CI: 1.8,6.8). The study findings are crucial for Bangladesh's ongoing effort to strengthen NCDs care. Further elucidation of the factors influencing the decision between types of health facility use could be provided by future mixed-method studies.",

        "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education has the potential to revolutionize teaching and learning practices, especially in nursing education, which combines theoretical and practical knowledge. However, challenges such as infrastructural limitations, ethical considerations, and a lack of educator preparedness hinder its widespread adoption in settings with limited access to technology, insufficient funding, and inadequate training opportunities for educators. This study explores nursing educators' perspectives on integrating AI into academic settings. Using the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge framework, this qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach to understand nursing educators' lived experiences. Data were collected through 14 semistructured interviews and three focus group discussions with 16 participants from three nursing colleges in Bangladesh. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify key insights and trends. Nursing educators recognized the potential of AI tools, such as adaptive learning platforms, virtual simulations, and predictive analytics, to enhance teaching efficiency, personalize learning, and engage students. However, barriers such as insufficient training, infrastructural challenges, and ethical concerns related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and AI-driven decision making were highlighted. Thematic analysis revealed five major themes: (1) perceived benefits of AI, (2) barriers to AI integration, (3) ethical considerations in AI use, (4) educator readiness and adaptation, and (5) AI as a tool for personalized learning. Many educators expressed a need for professional development and institutional support to effectively integrate AI technologies. Strategies for overcoming these challenges included targeted training programs, ethical guidelines, and addressing disparities in resource distribution. AI holds transformative potential for nursing education, offering opportunities to enhance teaching and learning. However, its effective integration requires addressing educators' readiness, ethical challenges, and resource limitations. These findings underscore the importance of equipping nursing educators with the necessary competencies to prepare future nurses for AI-enhanced clinical environments, thereby bridging education with evolving healthcare practice.",

        "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitism remains a critical challenge in livestock health management, particularly in tropical regions where environmental conditions favor parasite proliferation. This study conducted an 8-year retrospective analysis (2017-2024) of GI parasites in dairy cattle across 11 districts in Bangladesh. Data were sourced from a private veterinary diagnostic laboratory, with a focus on the prevalence, types, and trends of GI parasites as well as associated risk factors. GI parasites were identified using different coproscopic methods including direct smear, flotation, and sedimentation. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive analysis, followed by Poisson regression. The most prevalent parasites identified were Schistosoma spp. (57.3%) and Paramphistomum spp. (22.6%), with notable peaks in prevalence during the years 2019 (65%) and 2021 (62%) for Schistosoma spp. and in 2017 (32%) for Paramphistomum spp. Other parasites, such as Balantidium (B.) coli, presented a lower but consistent prevalence (9.8%), whereas Fasciola spp. and Haemonchus spp. were identified less frequently. The analysis revealed that various factors significantly influenced parasite incidence, including seasonal variations, district-specific ecological conditions, and animal-related factors. Statistical analyses, particularly Poisson regression, demonstrated that male cattle (RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.230-0.401) had a lower risk of infection with Schistosoma spp. than females, whereas regions with abundant water bodies, such as Manikganj (RR: 11.9, 95% CI: 6.801-20.648, p < 0.001), Mymensingh (RR:7.9, 95% CI: 2.243-27.78, p < 0.01), and Narayanganj (RR: 6.6, 95% CI: 3.867-11.177, p < 0.001), presented higher prevalence rates. Seasonal trends revealed increased prevalence rates during the winter (Schistosoma spp.: RR: 1.5, CI: 1.090-1.919, p < 0.05; Paramphistomum spp.: RR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.322-3.299; B. coli: RR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.672-2.151; and Fasciola spp. RR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.322-4.555), which aligns with periods of more significant water usage and potential exposure to contaminated sources. This study underscores the need for targeted parasite control programs, particularly in high-risk areas, and advocates for improved livestock management practices and regular veterinary interventions to mitigate the economic and health impacts of GI parasites. These findings provide valuable insights for developing tailored parasite management strategies to increase the productivity and well-being of dairy cattle in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Most of the 2.3 million annual neonatal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis being the leading causes of neonatal mortality. Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Despite the development of advanced cancer therapies, achieving cancer eradication remains challenging. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is an innovative approach that combines radionuclides with monoclonal antibodies targeting tumour-associated antigens or those expressed by the tumour microenvironment. Over the past two decades, RIT has been extensively researched, along with two RIT products-<sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and <sup>131</sup>I-tositumomab. However, despite its demonstrated efficacy in non-solid tumours, RIT's clinical use remains limited, and its effectiveness in solid tumours is inconclusive. This study aimed to analyse randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of RIT across different cancer types and its impact on treatment outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar was conducted from January 2000 to October 2024 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and the PICOS framework. Studies were included if they were RCTs evaluating RIT for cancer treatment and reported treatment outcomes such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival, or time to progression (TTP). Data extraction was performed using a standardised Excel form, and study quality was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for RCTs. A narrative synthesis of the data was complemented by meta-analyses where feasible, particularly for progression- and survival-related endpoints. <b>Results:</b> Out of 2241 records identified, 20 RCTs encompassing approximately 3562 patients were included. The majority of trials focused on non-solid tumours, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), while a smaller subset evaluated solid tumours such as lung, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Most non-solid tumour studies employed <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or <sup>131</sup>I-tositumomab, targeting the CD20 antigen, whereas limited evidence exists for RIT efficacy in solid tumours. Meta-analysis of progression-related outcomes yielded a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.59), indicating a 52% reduction in the risk of progression. In contrast, overall survival outcomes were more variable, with a pooled OS HR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.60-1.07). Adverse events, predominantly haematological and nonhaematological toxicities, were common yet generally reversible. The findings suggest that RIT, especially when used as part of combination regimens, significantly improves treatment outcomes in non-solid tumours but has an inconsistent effect in solid tumour settings. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results underscore the clinical promise of RIT in treating non-solid tumours like NHL, where combination regimens yield superior outcomes compared to monotherapy. However, the inconclusive evidence in solid tumours highlights the need for further large-scale, well-designed RCTs to define the optimal use, dosing, and patient selection for RIT in these settings. Additionally, standardisation in outcome reporting and longer follow-up periods are essential for more accurate economic and clinical assessments. Overall, RIT represents a valuable therapeutic modality, yet its integration into cancer treatment regimens should be guided by further research aimed at mitigating toxicity and optimising combination strategies.",

        "abstract": "The evidence on associations between sedentary behaviour (SB) and motor skills in 3- to 4-year-olds is unclear and mostly from high-income countries. The objective of this study is to examine associations between (1) screen time (h/day) and total daily SB (h/day), and gross and fine motor skills, and (2) meeting the restraint, screen time and overall SB (restraint and screen time) guidelines and fine and gross motor skills. Cross-sectional study of 1394 3- to 4-year-olds from the pilot phase of the SUNRISE International study. Time spent in SB was measured using the activPAL accelerometer, whereas screen time and restraint were measured using a parent questionnaire. Fine and gross motor skills were measured using parent-reported Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Associations between SB and motor skills were determined using linear and logistic regression, adjusting for sex and socioeconomic status. Every additional 1 h of screen time was associated with 0.50-point reduction in gross motor skills scores (p = 0.008). More screen time was associated with decreased odds of being on track for fine and gross motor skill development (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). Meeting the screen time (p = 0.009) and overall SB guidelines (p = 0.006) were favourably associated with fine motor skills scores. Meeting the screen time, restraint and overall SB guidelines were favourably associated with gross motor skills scores (p = 0.007, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), higher odds of being on track for fine (p = 0.033, p = 0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively) and gross motor skills (p = 0.006, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) development. The present study adds to the evidence on the importance of sedentary behaviour for the motor development of 3- to 4-year-olds. It is important that policy makers and health educators develop strategies that will encourage and promote adherence to sedentary behaviour guidelines among 3- and 4-year-olds.",

        "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli (E. coli) in companion animals in Bangladesh, with a focus on the resistance profiles of isolates from non-food-producing animals. In 2023, the studied samples were from cats, dogs, and environmental sources linked with companion animal hospitals in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. E. coli was isolated using standard techniques and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was assessed against 23 antibiotics following the CLSI protocols. Metallo-beta-lactamase genes (bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> and bla<sub>NDM-5</sub>) and mobile genetic elements (class 1 integron) were detected by multiplex PCR. The overall prevalence of E. coli was 70%, 76% in cats, 65.71% in dogs, and 65.71% in the environmental samples. Cefuroxime exhibited the highest resistance at 25%, while imipenem and nitrofurantoin showed the highest sensitivity at 100%, followed by ceftazidime at 95%. MDR strains made up 38.10%, while 11.90% were extremely drug-resistant (XDR). Additionally, 29% of E. coli were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The prevalence and association among class 1 integron and the resistant genes including bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> and bla<sub>NDM-5</sub> were also notable. This highlights the complex AMR challenges in these settings, including the presence of class 1 integron-a key element involved in capturing and transferring antimicrobial resistance genes.",

        "abstract": "Women in urban slums are particularly susceptible due to a lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and abortion is frequently performed. Our study investigates the level and predictors of SRH knowledge among the reproductive-aged women who have had abortions and lived in urban slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We adopted a cross-sectional survey among the reproductive-aged women who experienced any kind of abortion from July 2020 to January 2022 living in the UHDSS sites, applying a predefined interviewer-assisted survey questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval (CI)) for continuous and percentage distribution for categorical variables. Bi-variate analysis was used to examine for associations. After checking the assumptions, multinomial regression analysis was used to confirm the determinants with 95% CIs. A total of 338 women participated (221 spontaneous abortions and 117 induced abortions) with an average age of 26.59 ± 0.355, age at first marriage of 16.69 ± 0.173, and marital length of 9.45 ± 0.386. Except for the use of emergency contraceptives (32%), many women correctly identified condom effectiveness for preventing pregnancy (89%), STDs and HIV/AIDS prevention (79-80%), and abortion (98%). About 34 to 64% of them experienced stigmas attached to sexually explicit items. Few of them knew about abortion complications (9 to 57%), with the exception of bleeding associated with abortion (91.7%). Overall, 3 out of 4 women lacked sufficient SRH knowledge, with a mean score of 58.28 (95% CI: 56.70, 59.87), which was slightly higher for women who had spontaneous abortions 58.90 (95% CI: 57.02, 60.78) and lower for women who had induced abortions 57.69 (95% CI: 54.94, 60.45). Women aged 20-29 and 30 + years had high level of SRH knowledge than those of under 20 years. Women with higher education, longer marriages, and who availed post abortion care had high level of SRH knowledge than respective counterparts. However, employed slum women other than garment workers had lower levels of SRH knowledge than housewives. Our findings can be used in the abortion policies and strategies for vulnerable women and we recommend an intervention to increase awareness and knowledge on SRH, which is essential for those women to achieve the maternal reproductive health parameters.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most prevalent cancer among women in Bangladesh, with 9,640 new cases and 5,826 deaths annually. Since 2018, the Electronic Data Tracking with Population-Based Cervical and Breast Cancer Screening Program (EPCBCSP) has been implemented nationwide across 601 health centers, utilizing Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) for CC screening. However, the system had not been evaluated until now. This study aims to assess the performance of EPCBCSP and identify its strengths and challenges. We evaluated EPCBCSP using the updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) in 2023. Data were collected from central level stakeholders and from stakeholders at one colposcopy and one VIA center in each of four selected divisions of Bangladesh. Interviews with 42 stakeholders assessed simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, stability and usefulness attributes. Data quality was assessed by surveillance data review. Percentage scores were calculated and ranked as follows: excellent (≥ 90%), Very good (≥ 80%- < 90%.), good (≥60%- < 80%), average (≥50%- < 60%) and poor (≤50%).The overall system performance was rated as good (score:77.20%). The system's simplicity (score: 91.61%) and usefulness (score:91.61%) were ranked as \"excellent\". The acceptability (score: 85.29%) was ranked as \"very good and flexibility (score:71.90%) was rated as \"good\". Stability (percentage score: 53.25%) was considered average. Furthermore, data quality was assessed as average based on missing values (13.11%.) Electronic data tracking system, instant test report availability and \"see and treat\" policies were identified as strengths by stakeholders, while dedicated staff shortages and motivating participants were main challenges. The evaluation EPCBCSP in Bangladesh indicates overall good performance, excelling in simplicity and usefulness. However, improvements are needed in stability and data quality. Strengthening surveillance efforts addressing shortages of dedicated staff and participant motivation will further enhance the effectiveness of the program, crucial for reducing CC burden.",

Beginning with an introduction outlining the anatomical and clinical aspects of achalasia, the review delves into its historical perspective, tracing the evolution of treatment options from early nonsurgical methods to advanced surgical techniques such as Heller's myotomy and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Technical perspectives on surgical interventions, including key steps, clinical practice guidelines, and modifications to POEM techniques, are extensively discussed. A comparative analysis between POEM and Heller's myotomy elucidates their indications, contraindications, efficacy, outcomes, and interventions for persistent symptoms or complications. Furthermore, the review explores the adverse events associated with both procedures, highlighting their safety profiles and management strategies. Finally, from a financial perspective, considerations such as operative time, hospital stay length, readmission rates, and quality-adjusted life years are examined, emphasizing the implications for patient decision-making. This review underscores the importance of a multidimensional approach to understanding and managing achalasia, advocating for further research to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects.",

        "abstract": "Inadequate dietary diversity is a significant challenge in public health for low-and middle-income countries, including rural communities in Bangladesh. These issues have intensified and become more tragic during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated the factors associated with household dietary diversity in rural Southwestern Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study used a structured questionnaire to collect data from 310 respondents using face-to-face interviews. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and sociodemographic characteristics were calculated from the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance III Project (FANTA) guidelines and related studies. A multinomial regression model was performed to identify factors associated with HDDS during the COVID-19 outbreak. The HDDS status of rural Southwestern households decreased (60.3%) during the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors including gender, level of education, occupation, household monthly income, and family size of the household head were significantly associated with dietary diversity. Additionally, income condition (RRR:5.46, 95% CI:2.73-7.47 and RRR:4.85, 95% CI:2.48-7.24), and dietary diversity knowledge of the household head (RRR:5.46, 95% CI:2.73-7.47, and RRR:4.85, 95% CI:2.48-7.24) were significantly associated with low and moderate HDDS during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study found that households become more vulnerable to inadequate dietary diversity due to poor socioeconomic status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the findings, public health workers should ensure adequate food access and proper food distribution among rural households and communities in this crisis to mitigate these negative consequences.",

We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p<0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs 13%; p<0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility. Our findings warrant that reducing unnecessary antibiotic consumption requires increasing public awareness and strengthening laws on the sale of over-the-counter antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "By 2030, it is anticipated that poor mental health will cost the global economy approximately $6 trillion per year, primarily due to productivity loss. It is crucial to understand how psychological distress contributes to productivity loss in the workplace. We aim to investigate the relationship between psychological distress and productivity loss in the Australian working population. We utilized eight waves of longitudinal data drawn from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey (waves 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21). We compiled an unbalanced panel data set comprising 70,973 person-year observations from 18,729 unique working adults. We used Fixed-effects Poisson regression and Fixed-effects logistic regression models to investigate the within-person differences in the relationship between psychological distress and productivity loss (measured through sickness absence, presenteeism, and underemployment). We found that moderate and high psychological distress is associated with a higher rate of sickness absence, presenteeism, and underemployment when a working adult shifted from low psychological distress after controlling socio-demographic, health, and employment-related characteristics. Our study demonstrated that moderate to high psychological distress adversely affected employees' job productivity through increased sickness absence, a higher likelihood of presenteeism, and greater levels of underemployment. Our findings also revealed that employees with moderate and high psychological distress incurred additional annual sickness absence costs of AUD 60.66 and AUD 99.26, respectively, compared to peers with low psychological distress. Additionally, our study found that employees with moderate and high levels of psychological distress experienced significantly higher levels of presenteeism, which resulted in additional annual costs of AUD 1,166.30 and AUD 3,656.05, respectively, compared to their counterparts with low psychological distress. Psychological distress imposed significant costs on Australian workplaces. Implementing workplace health promotion programs should be prioritized as a policy to address psychological distress among employees, enhance their well-being, and improve overall productivity.",

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of Coxiellosis in South Asia, focusing on distribution, host diversity, prevalence, and associated risk factors at the human-animal-environment interface. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and a registered protocol, online searches were conducted in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on August 6, 2023, to retrieve articles from the South Asian countries without restrictions on hosts or timeframe. Two authors independently reviewed, extracted data, and assessed quality based on predefined criteria, which were then evaluated and compiled into a single document and analyzed. The review identified 112 articles published between 1954 and 2023. Among humans, the estimated pooled seroprevalence (EPSP) was 9.2%, and the estimated pooled carrier prevalence (EPCP) was 6.2%. Ruminant herd-level EPSP and EPCP were 77.3% and 74.6%, and at the individual level, were 11.9% and 5.3%, respectively. Seroprevalence was significantly influenced by country, tick infestation, reproductive disorders, age, and body condition of ruminants. Nonruminant mammals, such as dogs (16.8%), horses (6.0%), pigs (3.9%), and rodents (14.8%), were also seropositive. Several avian and reptile species showed EPSP rates of 14.5% and 29.2%, respectively. Bacterial DNA was detected in ticks and soil samples, with EPCP of 1.0% and 3.3%, respectively. We recommend prioritizing One Health surveillance and intervention to prevent infections among humans, livestock, poultry, pets, and wildlife.

The study used Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18 data, which employed a two-stage cluster sampling design. This study extracted 6422 married women of reproductive age who desired no more children. Descriptive statistics were used to present the characteristics of the women. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were also used to identify the factors associated with LARC/PM use. A total of 20.2% of women use LARC/PM who desire no more children.

On the other hand, women with primary education (aOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.65-0.92), secondary education (aOR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.47-0.72) and higher education (aOR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43-0.95) belonging to richest wealth index (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.97), having at least two living children (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.44-0.85), partner with secondary education (aOR = 0.79 95% CI = 0.65-0.97) and women who were visited by family planning (FP) visitors (aOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.29-0.40) were less likely to use LARC/PM. The LARC/PM use rate among women in Bangladesh is low. It must be increased to meet the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To increase LARC/PM use in Bangladesh, attention should be given to factors like women's age, education, partner's education, religion, wealth index, division, number of living children, and desired number of children.",

In addition to investigating the nature of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics, this study will investigate the age and gender nature of patients having these resistances. Patients who were prescribed urine culture sensitivity tests as part of their treatment at a tertiary-level hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were included as a sample. Urine culture was done following the guidelines of CLSI, and a sensitivity test was done following the Kirby-Bauer sensitivity method. About 55% of both males and females have been found to be infected with <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and about 15% were infected with <i>Klebsiella</i>. Other pathogens detected are <i>Enterococcus</i> and <i>Candida</i>. Age and gender nature of <i>E. coli</i> indicates that females are more infected below the age of 60 years, while males are more infected above this age. <i>E. coli</i> has exhibited the least resistance to Azithromycin, Netilmicin, and Amikacin. The resistance to Ciprofloxacin shows that females are more resistant until the age of 60 years, and males after that. Multidrug resistance shows an alarming result that about 20% of infected patients are resistant to nine antibiotics. This study clearly indicates that UTI is a continuously evolving problem, and its investigation should remain a continuous process. Because of economic and social practices in Bangladesh, urinary tract infection is a continually evolving disease. The treatment requires relatively updated information about the behavior of the pathogens causing this infection. There is not sufficient information in Bangladesh about the age and gender nature of the infected patients, the infected pathogens, and their antibiotic resistance. Moreover, because of indiscriminate and uncontrolled use of antibiotics within the country, the nature of multidrug resistance of these pathogens is also important for the effective management of these patients. This research attempts to address these issues.",

Developing a reliable predictive model for heavy metal concentrations in this region has proven to be a significant challenge. This study employed machine learning (ML) techniques to model heavy metal pollution in soils within this critical ecosystem. A total of 91 standardized soil samples were analyzed to predict the accumulation of eight heavy metals using four distinct ML algorithms. Among them, random forest model outer performed in predicting As (0.79), Cd (0.89), Cr (0.63), Ni (0.56), Cu (0.60), and Zn (0.52), achieving notable R squared values. The feature attribute analysis identified As-K, Pb-K, Cd-S, Zn-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Cr- Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ni-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Cu-P, and Mn- Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> relationships resembled with correlation coefficients among them. The developed models revealed that the contamination factor for metals in soils indicated extremely high levels of Pb contamination (CF ≥ 6). In conclusion, this research offers a robust framework for predicting heavy metal pollution in coal mining soils, highlighting critical areas that require immediate conservation efforts. These findings emphasize the necessity for targeted environmental management and mitigation to reduce heavy metal pollution in mining sites.",

A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Seven high-quality trials met the inclusion criteria, with a combined focus on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), heart failure hospitalizations, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and renal function decline. SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing heart failure and renal outcomes, while GLP-1 receptor agonists were more effective in preventing MACE and improving glycemic control. Combination therapy showed potential additive benefits, particularly in improving myocardial and arterial function. The findings highlight the complementary roles of these drug classes, underscoring the importance of personalized therapy based on individual patient profiles. Further research, including long-term head-to-head trials, is warranted to validate these results and optimize treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Scant evidence exists for the relative efficacy of therapies for alopecia areata (AA)-including those approved by the Food and Drug Administration, namely, baricitinib, deuruxolitinib, and ritlecitinib. We determined the relative efficacy and safety of monotherapy with janus kinase inhibitors (JAKIs), apremilast, and dupilumab. Following a systematic review, we conducted Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMAs) that produced Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking (SUCRA) values and point estimates for pairwise relative effects; we also performed sensitivity analyses. In total, regimens with eight various JAKIs were compared, namely, ruxolitinib, ATI-501, baricitinib, brepocitinib, deuruxolitinib, ivarmacitinib, ritlecitinib, and tofacitinib. Our analyses ranked \"deuruxolitinib 12 mg twice daily for 24 weeks,\" the most efficacious insofar as \"proportion of participants achieving SALT ≤ 20 at 24 weeks\" (SALT<sub>20</sub>) (SUCRA = 92.6%), and \"proportion of participants achieving SALT ≤ 10 at 24 weeks\" (SALT<sub>10</sub>) (SUCRA = 97.7%). As per SALT<sub>20</sub>, the highest-ranked regimen was more efficacious than \"baricitinib 2 mg once daily for 24 weeks\" (odds ratio [OR] = 5.37, 95% credible interval [CI] = 1.59, 13.70, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the efficacy of the FDA-approved JAKIs exhibited a dose-dependent relationship; for instance, baricitinib 4 mg once daily for 24 weeks was more efficacious than \"baricitinib 2 mg once daily for 24 weeks\" in terms of SALT<sub>20</sub> (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.56, 3.21, p < 0.05). Results from our sensitivity analyses support that our base analyses were robust. We produced high-quality evidence on the comparative effectiveness of monotherapies for AA with various regimens of 8 JAKIs, including the FDA-approved ones. Our findings can improve clinicians' decision-making and update guidelines for medical practice.",

The study has collected 48 groundwater samples and analyzed 16 water quality parameters to assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes in a highly vulnerable coastal area of Bangladesh. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI), Metal Index (MI), and Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) were used to assess drinking water quality. In contrast, irrigation water suitability was evaluated using indices like Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Sodium Percentage (Na%), Magnesium Absorption Ratio (MAR), and Kelly Ratio (KR). The results show that 72.92 % of the samples were above WHO drinking water guidelines for EC, which indicated high salinity risks. The CCME WQI classified 25 % of the samples as marginal or poor, and MI and HPI both showed significant contamination, mainly due to high Fe and As concentrations. The MAR indicated that 25 % of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation, mainly because of high salinity and sodium. Spatial analysis proved that severe deterioration of groundwater quality has been taking place in the southern area of Pirojpur severely, which requires urgent intervention, and continuous monitoring for safeguarding water resources in this vulnerable area.",

Machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics claim to improve safety and automate tasks. However, a structured analysis of AI applications is necessary to ensure their effective implementation in nursing practice. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize existing systematic reviews on AI applications in nursing care, providing a comprehensive analysis of its benefits, challenges, and ethical implications. By consolidating findings from multiple sources, this review seeks to offer evidence-based insights to guide the effective and responsible integration of AI in nursing practice. A systematic umbrella review approach was employed following PRISMA guidelines. Multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, were searched for review articles published between 2015 and 2024. Findings were synthesized thematically to identify key trends, benefits, limitations, and research gaps. This review synthesized 13 studies, emphasizing AI's impact on clinical decision support, patient monitoring, nursing education, and workflow optimization. AI enhances early disease detection, minimizes diagnostic errors, and automates documentation, improving efficiency. However, data privacy risks, biases, ethical concerns, and limited AI literacy hinder integration. AI presents significant opportunities for improving nursing care, yet its successful implementation requires addressing ethical, legal, and practical challenges.

        "abstract": "While existing studies conducted in South Asian countries have provided valuable insights into the nutritional status of the marginalized third-gender population and highlighted suboptimal nutritional conditions, regrettably such data is lacking in Bangladesh. Addressing this data gap is crucial to understanding and improving the nutritional condition of the third-gender community. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate their nutritional status, dietary protein intake, lifestyle, social behavior, nutritional knowledge, and prevalence of diseases. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Fifty participants from the third-gender community were selected. Study subjects were individually interviewed through a structured questionnaire to gather specific data. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Logistic Regression, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Chi-square tests were carried out to measure the associations among the variables. The average age of the participants was 32.74 ± 9.30 years, with 26% lacking formal education and 72% engaged in money collection as a primary occupation. 36% earned less than BDT 5,000 monthly, with only 2% exceeding BDT 20,000. The mean height and mean body weights were 163 ± 5.21 cm and 60.64 ± 13.61 kg (mean ± SD) respectively. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.02 ± 5.04 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, among whom 14% were underweight, 56% were normal, 20% were overweight, and 10% were obese. 48% of the participants had poor nutritional knowledge, and 46% had average. 50% of the participants had smoking habits and 34% of the participants consumed alcohol. Nutritional intake was skewed towards plant proteins (72%), with inadequate access to healthcare reported by 56% of subjects. Two-thirds (66%) of the respondents had no illness, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affected 34% of participants, with diabetes (12%) and low pressure (8%) prevalent. Smoking significantly correlated with lower normal BMI (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07-0.84, p < 0.05). Unhealthy food intake was significantly associated with underweight risks (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.92, p < 0.05). When compared with male and female Bangladeshi populations, third-gender individuals had higher overweight prevalence, moderate normal BMI rates, and lower malnutrition than males. The research identified suboptimal nutritional status among the third-gender population in Bangladesh, highlighting higher rates of both obesity and underweight, as well as a prevalence of non-communicable diseases, particularly diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Acute Malnutrition affects 45 million children under five globally, with Bangladesh contributing more than 1.7 million cases. While community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines in Bangladesh exist, they primarily emphasise nutritional counselling and face challenges in coverage and implementations. It is important to understand barriers to CMAM uptake and implementation. This study aims to explore the perceptions of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences among parents, healthcare providers, and policymakers, alongside parents' care-seeking behaviours for under-five children with acute malnutrition. Conducted in areas with and without CMAM programs, the research follows a phenomenological design with thematic analysis of focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Thirty FGDs with parents, 28 KIIs with healthcare providers, and 16 KIIs with policymakers were conducted. Identified causes of acute malnutrition included infections, diseases, lack of awareness about nutritious foods, supernatural beliefs, poverty, and inadequate care and feeding practices. Consequences included stunted growth, impaired mental development, and increased illness risk. Although parents acknowledged the urgency of treating acute malnutrition, they sought care at healthcare facilities regardless of illness. Factors influencing care-seeking behaviour were inability in problem prioritisation, transportation cost and availability, healthcare access, wage loss, and out-of-pocket expenses. Despite awareness of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences, parental care-seeking remains limited. The study recommends integrating acute malnutrition guidelines with communicable disease programs, implementing targeted social and behavioural change programs, addressing superstitions, fostering collaboration with traditional healers strengthening social safety nets, and empowering women in healthcare decision-making.",

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 71 obstetricians and gynecologists in Bangladesh using online and offline modes. Demographic data, professionals' knowledge, attitudes, practices, and perceived barriers to antenatal yoga were collected. Descriptive statistics and correlation matrix analyses were performed. 83.1 % of respondents recognised the benefits of antenatal yoga; however, only 50 % routinely recommended it to pregnant women. Key barriers identified included a lack of standardised training, insufficient knowledge of antenatal yoga practices, and cultural resistance. Despite these challenges, all participants (100 %) expressed interest in attending antenatal yoga-related workshops and training. While obstetricians and gynecologists in Bangladesh were optimistic about the benefits of antenatal yoga (AY), a lack of standardised guidelines and training, insufficient family support, and cultural factors hinder its widespread recommendation.

        "abstract": "Alleviating suffering and preserving dignity are essential components of healthcare. Patients in need of palliative care often require opioid medication to relieve breathlessness and pain. However, a lack of access to essential opioids, particularly morphine, remains a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is notably critical in the humanitarian context. We conducted two case studies to identify the barriers and facilitators of access to opioids, particularly morphine, for palliative care patients in humanitarian settings while exploring humanitarian healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences with opioids. Two case studies were conducted based on two Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) projects which integrated palliative care: advanced HIV care in Patna, Bihar, India, and paediatric and neonatal care in the refugee context in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with key MSF healthcare professionals. Interviews were conducted in English, video- and/or audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed using the grounded theory approach. Several barriers impeding access to and use of essential opioids in palliative care were reported by the participants. These included limited availability, accessibility obstacles, sociocultural challenges such as low awareness and misconceptions, lack of healthcare providers' training on opioid use, and burdensome regulatory processes. Most participants reported that clinical guidelines, familiarity with the use of opioids and interdisciplinary teamwork were important facilitators of opioid prescribing. Participants expressed the urgency for further educational and advocacy initiatives to improve access to essential opioids for patients requiring palliative care. Humanitarian healthcare workers face multiple challenges, leading to inadequate access to essential opioid medication, which undermines effective palliative care delivery. Further training on the use of opioids and strong advocacy efforts led by humanitarian organizations and the medical community are critical to improving access to these essential medicines for the relief of pain and suffering.",

This study aimed to consider the activity of soil enzymes in CWs during the phytoremediation of As and to evaluate the interaction between the enzyme activity and As phytoremediation. The treatments (control, 39 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>As, 2% nine-rhizobacteria consortium + 39 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>As, 0.04% NPKS fertilizer + 39 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>As, and 2% nine-rhizobacteria consortium + 0.04% NPKS fertilizer + 39 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>As) were studied for assessing different enzymatic activity and plant-microbe interaction during phytoremediation of As in CWs. The activities of various enzymes were significantly higher at rhizosphere sand than at non-rhizosphere sand and leachate. However, enzyme activity was significantly higher in non-rhizosphere sand than in rhizosphere sand in the case of only alkaline phosphatase enzyme. A significant interaction was observed between the activity of enzymes and As phytoremediation which linear correlation coefficients at rhizosphere sand were 0.9812, 0.9484, 0.9271, 0.925, 0.9175, 0.8661, 0.9598, 0.9261, and 0.87 for urease, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, arylsulphatase, β-glucosidase, dehydrogenase, amylase, catalase, and total enzyme respectively. These enzymatic functions helped in waste breakdown; hence, higher enzymatic activity may boost As phytoremediation in CWs. So, these results of the current investigation will significantly provide knowledge of plant-microbe relationships for the phytoremediation of arsenic in CWs.",

Psychiatry faces challenges like overlapping symptoms, subjective diagnostic methods, and personalized treatment requirements. AI, with its advanced data-processing capabilities, offers innovative solutions to these complexities. This study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the existing literature to evaluate AI's diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy in psychiatric care, focusing on various psychiatric disorders and AI technologies. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, the study included a comprehensive literature search across multiple databases. Empirical studies investigating AI applications in psychiatry, such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid models, were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. The outcomes of interest were diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. Statistical analysis employed fixed- and random-effects models, with subgroup and sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of AI methodologies and study designs. A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, representing diverse AI applications in diagnosing and treating psychiatric disorders. The pooled diagnostic accuracy was 85% (95% CI: 80%-87%), with ML models achieving the highest accuracy, followed by hybrid and DL models. For therapeutic efficacy, the pooled effect size was 84% (95% CI: 82%-86%), with ML excelling in personalized treatment plans and symptom tracking. Moderate heterogeneity was observed, reflecting variability in study designs and populations. The risk of bias assessment indicated high methodological rigor in most studies, though challenges like algorithmic biases and data quality remain. AI demonstrates robust diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in psychiatry, offering a data-driven approach to personalized mental healthcare. Future research should address ethical concerns, standardize methodologies, and explore underrepresented populations to maximize AI's transformative potential in mental health.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various fields, including scientific writing, which traditionally relies on human intellectual effort. This review article explores the evolving role of AI in scientific writing, highlighting its applications, challenges and ethical implications. The adoption of AI in scientific writing offers several key advantages that make it attractive to researchers. AI-powered tools are employed to scan large volumes of academic literature quickly and efficiently. AI writing assistants have become increasingly sophisticated in generating human-like text. AI-driven language models can help authors who are not native English speakers to produce high-quality, well-written manuscripts. Another significant benefit is the ability to handle large amounts of data efficiently. Moreover, AI tools reduce the risk of plagiarism by detecting unintentional similarities between newly drafted manuscripts and previously published work. AI systems are also being developed to assist with the peer-review process. Automated tools use AI to analyze manuscripts, checking for completeness, adherence to journal guidelines and even suggesting potential reviewers. Furthermore, AI aids in citation management by helping researchers organize and insert references correctly. Despite the benefits of AI in scientific writing, several ethical considerations and challenges accompany its adoption. A significant concern relates to the potential over-reliance on AI for generating text and performing critical analyses. Additionally, the question of authorship becomes increasingly complex with the involvement of AI in writing. Another significant issue concerns the potential for bias in AI-generated content. AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, which often reflect existing biases in published literature. This is particularly concerning in fields such as healthcare, where biased research could have serious consequences for patient care and treatment outcomes. Finally, the use of AI raises concerns about data privacy and security. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential for the scientific community to establish guidelines that ensure the responsible use of these tools, maximizing their benefits while mitigating potential risks.",

        "title": "Current status of elevated blood pressure and hypertension among adolescents in Asia: a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Hypertension among adolescents in Asia is an emerging public health concern that is directly associated with early onset cardiovascular risks. As such, it can also lead to further health issues and challenges for health care in the future. As existing studies have predominantly focussed on adult populations, we sought to provide targeted insights into adolescent hypertension across Asia, elucidating the impact of rapid lifestyle and environmental changes on this younger population. Therefore, in this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and trends of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension among adolescents aged 10-19 years across Asia, address gaps in region-specific data, and determine any demographic risk factors. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus for cross-sectional studies on adolescent hypertension/elevated BP in Asia published from January 2019 to June 2024, after which we narratively synthesised their findings. Of the 2634 retrieved studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, covering over 200 000 adolescents in Asia. The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 0.7% in urban Bangladesh to 24.5% in urban Malaysia, with urban areas generally showing higher rates than rural areas (e.g. India: 8.4% urban vs. 5.7% rural). By region, East Asia has the highest overall prevalence (14.25%), followed by West Asia (14.14%), South Asia (13.77%), Southeast Asia (13.16%), and Central Asia (12.37%). Males had higher prevalence rates (for example, 22.3% in Chinese males vs. 20% in females). The increasing prevalence of adolescent hypertension in urban Asia is a significant public health concern. Although extensive research has been conducted in East and South Asia, there is a dearth of studies in Western, Southeast, and Central Asia, emphasising a need for future research. Standardised diagnostic criteria and targeted interventions are crucial for addressing regional disparities and reducing long-term cardiovascular risks.",

        "title": "Coastal residency and its association with diagnosed hypertension based on findings from a cross-sectional study in rural Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The high prevalence of hypertension in coastal regions poses a significant public health challenge due to factors such as high salt intake, air pollution, poor diets, limited healthcare access, and increased stress levels. However, disparities in diagnosed hypertension between coastal and non-coastal areas in Bangladesh remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate and address the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension among adults in both regions. In 2020-2021, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to assess hypertension prevalence in coastal and non-coastal regions. The study included 3917 adults from six districts, including non-coastal and coastal regions. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were determined using a modified Poisson regression model, to quantify the relationship between hypertension prevalence in the two regions. The study finds that 438 (11.2%) of the 3917 respondents [446 females [11.7%]; mean age 44.73 years] had been diagnosed with hypertension. Notably, adults residing in coastal areas had a higher prevalence of hypertension (13.4%, 95% confidence interval: 11.8%-15.0%) than their non-coastal counterparts (9.5%, 95% CI: 8.3%-10.7%). In coastal areas, the prevalence ranged from 7.8% in the 18-24 age group to 16.4% in the 55 + age group. In non-coastal areas, the prevalence ranged from 2.9% in the 18-24 age group to 15.8% in the 55 + age group. The results of the multivariable analysis revealed that adults from coastal areas were 29% more likely to have hypertension than those in non-coastal areas (aPR:1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.56). Moreover, age, physical activity, occupation, and body mass index (BMI) were identified as factors associated with the development of hypertension within these regions. Hypertension is a major health issue across Bangladesh, with coastal regions facing added challenges from high salinity in drinking water. While both coastal and non-coastal areas experience high rates of undiagnosed hypertension, environmental factors unique to coastal areas may intensify the issue. Targeted interventions that account for environmental and socioeconomic factors are essential to addressing this growing health concern in both regions.",

        "abstract": "Suicidal behaviours are common among medical students, and the prevalence might vary across various regions. Even though various systematic reviews have been conducted to assess the suicidal behaviours among medical students in general, no review has ever explored or carried out a sub-analysis to show the burden of suicidal behaviours among Bangladeshi medical students. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence studies among Bangladeshi medical students. The review applied truncated and phrase-searched keywords and relevant subject headings for study identification using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. PubMed (Medline), Scopus, PsycINFO and Google Scholar databases were searched between January 2000 and May 2024. The designed study included cross-sectional, case series, case reports and cohort studies of Bangladeshi medical students reporting suicidal behaviours (suicidal ideation, suicidal planning or suicidal attempts). Only freely accessible, full-text articles in English were included for analysis. Study screening, data extraction and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. A random-effects meta-analysis model was conducted to pool prevalence rates, complemented by narrative synthesis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic. Data were obtained from 6 eligible studies, including 1625 medical students (691 male) of Bangladesh. The pooled prevalence of lifetime suicidal behaviours was 25%, for suicidal ideation (95% CI: 14% - 37%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=91%; p<0.01), 6% for suicidal plan (95% CI: 2% - 12%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=91%; p<0.01), and 8% for suicidal attempt (95% CI: 1% - 17%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=96%; p<0.01). The factors associated with suicidal ideation were female gender, depression, familial suicidal history and drug addiction. Only depression and drug addiction were significantly associated with suicidal attempts, while hanging was the most attempted method. Suicidal behaviours particularly, suicidal ideation, are high among Bangladeshi medical students. However, very few studies were done in this country to quantify the burden and its associated factors. CDR 42023493595.",

        "abstract": "Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases, is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. However, reports on the prevalence of glaucoma in the South Asian region have not been up-to-date. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of glaucoma in South Asia and analyze its trends by age and sex. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, a comprehensive search was undertaken on several electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, to retrieve relevant studies published until June 2023. A total of 17 population-based studies, including 77,790 subjects (37,950 male and 39,709 female), were included in the meta-analysis based on set inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of glaucoma in South Asia was 2.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-2.6). Among the subtypes, the prevalence of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.2-2.1), primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.4-1.0), and secondary glaucoma was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1-0.5). The prevalence trend of glaucoma increased with age and was higher in males. POAG prevalence was found to be higher in all age groups than the prevalence of PACG and highest in people > 80 years old (7.25% vs. 2.12%). The prevalence of POAG was also higher in males (2.26%) than in females (1.61%), whereas PACG prevalence was similar for both males and females. This study highlights a significant burden of glaucoma in South Asia, particularly among older adults and males, with POAG being the most common subtype. These findings may assist public health leaders in understanding the scenario of glaucoma in South Asia and implementing public health strategies to combat glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer disproportionately affects vulnerable populations including refugee women. Understanding the barriers to cervical cancer screening uptake in this group is crucial to inform targeted interventions and improve health outcomes. This review aimed to identify barriers hindering their access to cervical cancer screening. Five databases - Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and SCOPUS - were searched in December 2024. The inclusion criteria included studies - a) targeting healthy refugee women, b) conducted in community or hospital/clinic settings, c) reporting barriers to cervical cancer screening from the women's perspective, and d) published in English. Thematic analysis was performed to identify the barriers. The review followed the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eleven studies, seven from the USA, one from each of the UK, Australia, South Korea and Jordan, were included in this review. Of these, six were qualitative, three were quantitative and two were mixed methods studies. There was a consistent pattern of lack of knowledge about cervical cancer and cancer screening in refugee women. A unique barrier was women's negative experiences in refugee camps. Four interconnected themes emerged including 1) individual level barriers, 2) cultural and religious barriers, 3) social and structural barriers, and 4) healthcare system barriers. Ninety percent of included studies were assessed as medium or high quality. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to address the diverse challenges faced by refugee women globally which hinder their access to cervical cancer screening. Strategies should include culturally sensitive awareness campaigns, active engagement of healthcare professionals, and structural reforms within healthcare systems to enhance cervical cancer screening uptake among refugee women.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), which emulates human intelligence through knowledge-based heuristics, has transformative impacts across various industries. In the global healthcare sector, there is a pressing need for advanced risk assessment tools due to the shortage of healthcare workers to manage the health needs of the growing population effectively. AI-based tools such as triage systems, symptom checkers, and risk prediction models are poised to democratize healthcare. This systematic review aims to comprehensively assess the current landscape of AI tools in healthcare and identify areas for future research, focusing particularly on sexual reproductive and mental health. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, this review utilized data from seven databases: Science Direct, PubMed, SAGE, ACM Digital Library, Springer, IEEE Xplore, and Wiley. The selection process involved a rigorous screening of titles, abstracts, and full-text examinations of peer-reviewed articles published in English from 2018 to 2023. To ensure the quality of the studies, two independent reviewers applied the PROBAST and QUADAS-2 tools to evaluate the risk of bias in prognostic and diagnostic studies, respectively. Data extraction was also independently conducted. Out of 1743 peer-reviewed articles screened, 63 articles (3.61%) met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. These articles predominantly utilized clinical vignettes, demographic data, and medical data from online sources. Of the studies analyzed, 61.9% focused on sexual and reproductive health, while 38.1% addressed mental health assessment tools. The analysis revealed an increasing trend in research output over the review period and a notable disparity between developed and developing countries. The review highlighted that AI-based systems could outperform traditional clinical methods when implemented correctly. The findings indicate that integrating AI-based models into existing clinical systems can lead to substantial improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes. However, future research should prioritize obtaining larger and more diverse datasets, including those from underrepresented populations, to reduce biases and disparities. Additionally, for AI-based healthcare interventions to be widely adopted, transparency and ethical considerations must be addressed, ensuring these technologies are used responsibly and effectively in practical scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale randomized trials have established the efficacy and safety of statin therapy in preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among individuals at increased risk (i.e., primary prevention) or those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (i.e., secondary prevention). Consequently, recent international guidelines, including those from the WHO and ACC/AHA, have expanded the eligibility criteria for statin therapy. To assess the current burden of statin-eligible populations in Bangladesh, evaluate the current state of statin use, and identify factors associated with non-use of statins. We analysed data from 3,140 adults aged 40 to 69 years from the nationally representative WHO-STEPS Bangladesh 2018 survey. Statin therapy eligibility for primary prevention was assessed using the WHO-2019 and the ACC/AHA-2018 guidelines separately. Individuals with a previous history of CVD were eligible for secondary prevention under both guidelines. Modified Poisson regression models identified factors associated with statin use. All analyses were conducted using appropriate survey weights. Among the participants, 443 (14.1%) reported a previous history of CVD. Of those without CVD, 11.2% (95% CI: 9.7-12.9) and 32.3% (95% CI: 30.0-34.6) were eligible for statin use for primary prevention according to the WHO-2019 and the ACC/AHA-2018 guidelines, respectively. Among adults eligible according to WHO-2019 guideline, 6.9% (95% CI: 4.1-11.5) were using statins, while among those eligible according to ACC/AHA-2018 guideline, 3.3% (95% CI: 2.1-5.1) were using statins. For secondary prevention, 23.5% (95% CI: 16.9-31.6) of adults with prior CVD were using statins. Non-use was higher among younger adults, those without regular health visits or cholesterol measurements, and those from the Mymensingh or Rajshahi divisions. In Bangladesh, approximately one in twenty eligible individuals uses statins for primary prevention of CVD, and one in five individuals for secondary prevention. Appropriate population health interventions are needed to scale up statin use to mitigate the burden of CVD.",

This violence includes physical, verbal, or sexual abuse and has a significant impact despite initiatives like Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines. We conducted a study in Kenya to address this issue. We did a cross-sectional survey that collected responses during June 6th to August 9th, 2022, focused on healthcare professionals in Kenya within the global ViSHWaS study. Violence against healthcare professionals in multiple Kenyan counties was analysed, The study reached participants through social media, emails, and other channels using a snowball sampling technique. The survey included 1,458 HCWs, primarily females (66.5%), aged 36-45 (42.4%), and of African race, representing 40 counties, with the majority from Nairobi (28.9%) and working in government academic (35.5%) and private academic institutions (20.6%). Most had over 11 years of healthcare experience (64.4%), and registered nurses were the most common cadre (27.8%). Approximately half of enrolled participants (49.9%) reported experiencing violence, with verbal violence (80.6%) and emotional abuse (78.6%) being common. Online harassment was reported by only 3.5%, mainly on Facebook (63.2%), involving hate speech (92.1%). Patients or their relatives were the most common aggressors (44.7%), while supervisors accounted for 12.5%. The frequency of violence varied, and 80.2% noted an increase after the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 41.2% of incidents were reported. Most were familiar with safety guidelines (93.6%). Self-violence was associated with familiarity with guidelines, concern about violence, preparedness, and night shifts, while colleague violence was associated with age, gender, race, work experience, training, preparedness, and night shifts. Our Kenya-based cross-sectional sub-analysis highlights that a significant number of HCWs experienced violence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected job satisfaction. Although most HCWs were familiar with OSHA guidelines, there were difficulties in their practical implementation.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves. We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves. Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99). Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, present major global public health challenges. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, antibiotic resistance patterns, biofilm production, and the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and biofilm-forming genes in E. coli isolated from fish in open-body water (wild) sources and land-based aquaculture (cultured) systems in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. We collected 130 fish (Koi: Anabas testudineus and Shing: Heteropneustes fossilis) among which 70 were from wild sources and 60 from cultured systems. We screened 116 probable E. coli isolates through selective culture, Gram-staining, and biochemical tests. Using malB gene-specific PCR, we confirmed 87 isolates (67.0%) as E. coli. Cultured fish had a higher prevalence (70.0%) compared to wild fish (64.0%). Biofilm formation was detected in 20.0% E. coli by Congo red agar tests. However, crystal violet assays revealed that 70.0% of E. coli from cultured fish produced biofilm, compared to 20.0% from wild fish, with 7.0% of cultured fish isolates showing strong biofilm production. Antibiotic resistance profiling showed that 100.0% E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and ceftazidime, beta-lactamase-producing antibiotics. Resistance patterns varied by source, with nearly 97.0% of E. coli from cultured fish being multidrug-resistant (MDR), compared to 60.0% in wild fish. E. coli from cultured fish were identified as potential reservoirs of ARGs such as blaTEM (83.0%), blaSHV (81.0%), blaCTX (78.57%), and the biofilm forming gene fimC (100.0%). Significant associations were observed for blaTEM (p = 0.033), blaSHV (p = 0.038), and fimC (p = 0.005). These findings highlight the need for monitoring β-lactamase-resistant and biofilm-forming E. coli in both wild and cultured fish in Bangladesh due to their potential threat to public health and animal populations.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "abstract": "Data from clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) compared to lifestyle modifications (LSM) in children and adolescents with obesity are scarce. This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) sought to fill this knowledge gap. Randomised or non-randomised trials spanning at least one-year involving children and adolescents with severe obesity receiving any form of MBS in the intervention group and LSM for weight loss in the control group were systematically searched through electronic databases. This SRM adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the PRISMA checklists. The primary outcome of interest was the change in body weight from the baseline. Five trials (three randomised, open-label and two non-randomised) with 1-2 years follow-up durations were analysed, including 367 participants aged 10-19 years. MBS resulted in greater reductions in body weight (mean difference [MD] -25.83 kg, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-36.91, -14.75], p < .00001) and per cent body weight (MD -24.54%, 95% CI [-33.19, -15.89], p < .00001) compared to LSM. Furthermore, MBS outperformed LSM in reducing body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and an overall improvement of physical functioning and quality of life. The safety profile was comparable between the two groups; however, data was scarce. Larger, longer-term trials that include multinational and multiethnic representation are essential for making solid clinical practice recommendations regarding MBS for children with obesity.",

        "abstract": "Informal waste workers play vital yet largely unrecognized role in waste management in developing countries by recovering recyclable materials from disposal sites. This study investigates the occupational health and safety risks faced by informal waste workers engaged in waste sorting and collection activities at Rajbandh open dump, the sole disposal site in Khulna, Bangladesh. The vulnerabilities of the informal waste workers stem from inadequate protective equipment, poor sanitation, limited healthcare access, and a lack of training. Through structured questionnaires and observational checklists, data were collected from informal waste workers between May and June 2023, achieving a 100% response rate. Descriptive analysis using SPSS 23.0 revealed that all respondents reported health issues, while none owned safety gear-exacerbating exposure to hazardous waste, airborne pollutants, and unsafe working conditions. Alarmingly, all informal waste collectors reported health symptoms, with 0% ownership of safety gear, significantly contributing to these hazards and underscoring the urgent need for intervention. Rajbandh has a high frequency of occupational injuries as no specific rules and regulations have been established for informal waste workers by the Khulna City Corporation (KCC). Despite the high incidence of occupational injuries, KCC has yet to establish regulations to protect these workers. This study addresses a critical research gap by providing empirical evidence on the vulnerabilities of informal waste workers. The findings emphasize the urgent need for policy interventions, including occupational health programs, provision of safety equipment, and regulatory frameworks to safeguard their well-being.",

An explorative qualitative study based on 11 semistructured interviews with HCPs from 2 hospitals in Dhaka was conducted. Nurses, medical officers and paediatric consultants were representing the HCPs. Inductive, qualitative content analysis was used. Supporting KMC needs to be a continuous process that requires a high level of commitment from healthcare staff. Optimal implementation is, however, challenged by structural conditions such as shortage of staff, separation of mother and child, and incomplete follow-up, which need to be addressed to support KMC. Findings from this formative research can help in designing interventions for scaling up KMC in Bangladesh by paying attention to the crucial role of HCPs and giving them training on the importance of continuous and repeated counselling to both mother and family. To enhance motivation, involving nurses in follow-up care is essential, alongside strengthening the health system for families living far away and tracking those not attending follow-up. Furthermore, after this study was conducted, the WHO updated its recommendations regarding KMC. This means that the current study, in combination with the WHO's new recommendations, can be used for the development of new guidelines for KMC in clinical practice in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the impact of HIV/AIDS on urban slum dwellers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, addressing unique socio-economic challenges and limited health resources. Despite low overall prevalence, gender inequalities, economic disparities, and awareness gaps persist. The aim is to assess HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices among this population, informing targeted interventions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using face-to-face interviews in Dhaka's slum areas between October and November 2023. The sample size was calculated as 453 participants through non-probability (convenient sampling) sampling. A structured questionnaire in Bengali assessed socio-demographic factors, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and prevention practices. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, bivariate, and multivariable linear regression by SPSS (version 26) and STATA (version 14). Urban slum dwellers exhibited limited average HIV/AIDS knowledge of 33.00%, favouring males. Positive association was found between daily physical exercise and knowledge, while insufficient sleep and lack of social media access were negative predictors. Average attitudes were generally positive (81.06%), influenced by factors such as gender, employment status, family history of STDs, and daily physical exercise. The average score of prevention practices was 60.6%, with positive predictors including male gender, cooperative family members, STD history, family history of STDs, acquaintance with HIV patients, and social media usage over 2 h. Younger age was negatively associated with prevention practices. This study pinpoints factors influencing HIV/AIDS knowledge and behaviours in Bangladeshi urban slum dwellers. Tailored interventions focusing on gender, and social media can enhance preventive measures. Acknowledging limitations, the study urges cautious interpretation due to potential biases in convenience sampling and self-reporting.",

Oral azithromycin and intravenous ceftriaxone are the recommended first-line and second-line therapies for shigellosis in Bangladesh, respectively, but growing antibiotic resistance will require new antibiotic options. Tebipenem pivoxil, an orally administered carbapenem antibiotic with activity against many strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, may be a viable option. A phase IIb randomised controlled trial was planned to determine the efficacy and safety of oral tebipenem pivoxil, compared with intravenous ceftriaxone, for children with <i>Shigella</i> diarrhoea unresponsive to the first-line antibiotic therapy. We will enrol 132 children in the trial (66 in each arm). Children from Bangladesh aged 24-59 months suspected of having <i>Shigella</i> diarrhoea, with no clinical improvement within 48 hours of starting first-line therapy, will be randomised to a 3-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, once a day) or a 3-day course of oral tebipenem pivoxil (4 mg/kg, three times a day). The children will be evaluated for key clinical, microbiological and safety outcomes during the subsequent 30-day period. Clinically, failure at day 3 will be defined as the presence of fever (axillary temperature ≥38°C), diarrhoea (three or more abnormally loose or watery stools in the last 24 hours), blood in stool, or abdominal pain/tenderness at day 3 of follow-up or death or hospitalisation prior to day 3. It is hypothesised that children treated with tebipenem pivoxil will have no worse clinical and microbiological failure rates compared with ceftriaxone. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, which comprises a research review committee and an ethics review committee.

The study population includes adult patients, newly diagnosed (within 4 weeks) with pulmonary TB disease, daily smokers, willing to quit and have access to mobile phones. The primary outcome includes biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence assessed at 6 months per Russell Standard. A generalised linear mixed-effects model will be used to assess the impact of mTB-Tobacco intervention on continuous outcomes, incorporating fixed effects for the intervention, random effects for clusters and relevant covariates. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be done to estimate the cost per quitter and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to establish the value for money for mTB-Tobacco. This trial will be conducted in compliance with International Council on Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study has been approved by the ethics committees of the University of Edinburgh Medical School Research Ethics Committee (EMREC) of UK, the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC) and the National Bioethics Committee (PMRC) of Pakistan. The results of this trial will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented in academic conferences.

        "title": "Knowledge and practice among caregivers having children with autism in Bangladesh: findings from a cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a term used to describe a group of conditions characterized by difficulties with social skills, speech, repetitive behaviors, and nonverbal communication. There is no cure for autism, however, early diagnosis and intervention can increase the chance of treatment success. If parents or caregivers do not have sound knowledge about autism, problems can become more complicated. The study aimed to assess the knowledge and practice among caregivers having children with ASD in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 68 caregivers of children with ASD in the selected area of Mymensingh city, Bangladesh. The data were collected from May to June 2021 through face-to-face interviews by a semi-structured questionnaire including informed consent, socio-demographics, as well as questions regarding knowledge (12-item) and practice (6-item) towards children with ASD using a purposive sampling technique. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 25.0). The mean score of knowledge among caregivers having children with ASD was 7.16 (SD = 2.09) out of 12 (59.67%). The mean score of practice among caregivers having children with ASD was 3.16 (SD = 1.10) out of 6 (52.67%). There were no significant mean differences in the mean knowledge and practice scores among participants' different socio-demographic categories. 95.6% of caregivers have not received any formal training to care for children with ASD, and more than half (57.4%) believed that mixing with good friends would make the necessary change in children with ASD. 97.1% of the children with ASD did not have any health insurance with 72.1% receiving government allowance for ASD. The findings indicated inadequate knowledge and practice among caregivers of children with ASD. The study suggests an immediate health education program is needed, as well as appropriate practice for children with ASD in Bangladesh.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 12 months. A total of 148 Bangla-speaking individuals aged 12-65 years were participated in this study. The original ESS was translated into a Bangla ESS version through several stages including translation, backtranslation, expert review and pretesting. All participants were tested with this questionnaire and retested after two weeks of test. Psychometric properties of ESS-B including internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity, were assessed along with exploratory factor analysis. The ESS-B demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.73. The test-retest reliability of all items including the overall total scores were also satisfactory (τb ranged from 0.496 to 0.662). Convergent validity was supported by a moderately positive correlation with 'daytime dysfunction' of PSQI-B tool (τb = 0.309, p < 0.05), while divergent validity was indicated by a weak positive correlation with 'trouble to relax' component of GAD 7-B tool (τb = 0.175, p < 0.05). Exploratory factor analysis revealed two distinct factor structures corresponding to sedentary activity and active engagement. The ESS-B exhibited satisfactory reliability and validity among the Bangla-speaking population of Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) poses significant risks to both maternal and child health, yet it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh. Factors such as hormonal changes, lack of communal support and socioeconomic stressors primarily contribute to its prevalence. Despite advancements in research, technological solutions for PPD support are lacking in regions where mental health is deemed negligible. Thus, the objectives of this research are to reveal the underlying factors contributing to PPD among mothers in developing countries and to propose a novel application based on these factors for PPD detection. A Design Science Research (DSR) approach is adopted to achieve these objectives. In this research, firstly 17 factors that could serve as effective indicators for detecting PPD were identified through interviews with 12 key informants, including doctors and patients. Next, for each identified factor, visual and scenario-based questionnaires were designed to facilitate effective screening through user feedback. Then, an Android application, 'PPD Screening App', was developed, which provides users with visual, auditory, and multilingual (in English and Bengali) scenario-based questionnaires for each identified factor, as well as the questionnaires proposed in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) for PPD detection. Finally, the developed application was evaluated with 45 new mothers in the postpartum period and demonstrated high accuracy (96%) compared to the traditional screening method (84%). The effectiveness of the application was also explored in relation to participants' demographic profiles (age and IT literacy), and participants provided very positive feedback on the usability of the application. This research thus contributes in improving early detection and intervention for PPD, ultimately enhancing maternal and child well-being.",

This study compared the clinical outcomes in CAD patients inheriting CYP2C19 LoF alleles undergoing PCI and treated with clopidogrel against alternative antagonists of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor. A thorough literature search was performed across multiple scientific databases following the PRISMA guidelines and PICO model. Setting the statistical significance at p < 0.05 and RevMan software was used to calculate the risk ratios (RRs). Estimation of the pooled analysis revealed a significant 62% increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in CAD patients inheriting CYP2C19 LoF alleles and treated with clopidogrel against those treated with alternative P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonists such as prasugrel or ticagrelor (RR 1.62; 95% CI 1.42-1.86; p < 0.00001). In addition, Asian CAD patients were found at a significantly higher risk of MACE (RR 1.93; 95% CI: 1.49-2.49; p < 0.00001) juxtaposed to CAD patients of other ethnicities (RR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.29-1.78; p < 0.00001). Conversely, between these two treatment groups, taking clopidogrel against prasugrel/ticagrelor, who possess CYP2C19 LoF alleles, no significant differences in bleeding events were observed (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79-1.11; p = 0.47).

        "title": "Feasibility and acceptability of implementing the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) package for children 0-3 years across three countries.",
        "abstract": "To assess the neurodevelopment of children under three years, a multinational team of subject matter experts (SMEs) led by the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED). The measures include (1) a caregiver-reported short form (SF), (2) a directly administered long form (LF), and (3) a caregiver-reported psychosocial form (PF). The feasibility objectives of this study in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the United Republic of Tanzania were to assess (1) the study implementation processes, including translation, training, reliability testing, and scheduling of visits and (2) the comprehensibility, cultural relevance, and acceptability of the GSED measures and the related GSED tablet-based application (app) for data collection for caregivers, children, and assessors. In preparation for a large-scale validation study, we implemented several procedures to ensure that study processes were feasible during the main data collection and that the GSED was culturally appropriate, including translation and back translation of the GSED measures and country-specific training packages on study measures and procedures. Data were collected from at least 32 child-caregiver dyads, stratified by age and sex, in each country. Two methods of collecting inter-rater reliability data were tested: live in-person versus video-based assessment. Each country planned two participant visits: the first to gain consent, assess eligibility, and begin administration of the caregiver-reported GSED SF, PF, and other study measures and the second to administer the GSED LF directly to the child. Feedback on the implementation processes was evaluated by in-country assessors through focus group discussions (FGDs). Feedback on the comprehensibility, relevance, and acceptability of the GSED measures from caregivers was obtained through exit interviews in addition to the FGD of assessors. Additional cognitive interviews were conducted during administration to ensure comprehension and cultural relevance for several GSED PF items. The translation-back translation process identified items with words and phrases that were either mistranslated or did not have a literal matching translation in the local languages, requiring rewording or rephrasing. Implementation challenges reiterated the need to develop a more comprehensive training module covering GSED administration and other topics, including the consent process, rapport building, techniques for maintaining privacy and preventing distraction, and using didactic and interactive learning modes. Additionally, it suggested some modifications in the order of administration of measures. Assessor/supervisor concurrent scoring of assessments proved to be the most cost-effective and straightforward method for evaluating inter-rater reliability. Administration of measures using the app was considered culturally acceptable and easy to understand by most caregivers and assessors. Some mothers felt anxious about a few GSED LF items assessing motor skills. Additionally, some objects from the GSED LF kit (a set of props to test specific skills and behaviors) were unfamiliar to the children, and hence, it took extra time for them to familiarize themselves with the materials and understand the task. This study generated invaluable information regarding the implementation of the GSED, including where improvements should be made and where the administered measures' comprehensibility, relevance, and acceptability needed revisions. These results have implications both for the main GSED validation study and the broader assessment of children's development in global settings, providing insights into the opportunities and challenges of assessing young children in diverse cultural settings.",

Bangladesh has adopted the Pocket Book guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO) for hospital management of childhood pneumonia. These guidelines recommend the proper use of injectable antibiotic administration. <b>Objectives:</b> We assessed and compared the prescription drugs for treating childhood pneumonia following WHO guidelines in a secondary and tertiary hospital in Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a cross-sectional comparative study among children under five years who were admitted to a tertiary hospital, Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), and a secondary-level hospital, Kushtia District Hospital (KDH), with pneumonia between May 2021 and May 2022. A structured questionnaire was administered to the eligible participants. Additionally, we reviewed the hospital records related to the patient's treatment. SPSS (Version 28) was used to conduct statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> 316 children were enrolled during the study period, of whom 66.4% were collected from DMCH. There were 65.8% and 24.6% of patients who were classified with severe pneumonia and very severe pneumonia, respectively. In DMCH, the severity of pneumonia percentage was 57.6%, while in KDH, the percentage was 82%. A significant difference was found between the two facilities in diagnosing complicated pneumonia, prescribing the appropriate antibiotics, and ensuring oxygen availability. Amoxicillin was prescribed to 83.5% of the participants, and ceftriaxone was used at a high rate (64.5-70.9%). Combining injections of ceftriaxone with oral amoxicillin or other combinations of antibiotics, both facilities used high frequencies of non-antibiotic corticosteroids. <b>Conclusions:</b> Antibiotics were overprescribed, and injections were prescribed at higher levels than WHO recommended. This could pose a threat to antibiotic resistance. There is a need to enforce standard prescribing policies and treatment guidelines to reduce morbidity and mortality among hospitalized children with pneumonia.",

        "abstract": "In the World Health Organization (WHO) geographical region of South-East Asia, the mental health burden of adolescents appears high. Addressing this burden requires development of mental health policies consistent with international standards to assist governance, resource allocation and delivery of mental healthcare effectively. The aim was to identify current national mental health policies/plans/programs/legislation in South-East Asia, assess compliance with international standards and review inclusion of adolescents in these documents. Searches were conducted on WHO MiNDbank, official government websites, Google and Google Scholar. Documents were compiled and screened, data were extracted and evaluated following WHO Guidelines on Monitoring and Evaluation of Mental Health Policies and Plans. Frequencies of checklist and subsection scores were calculated. Data were narratively synthesised. Fourteen mental health policies/plans/programs/legislation from 8 countries met inclusion criteria. Maldivian and Bangladeshi documents complied the greatest with WHO guidelines. All 8 countries considered adolescents to some extent in their documents. Only Indian documents consulted child health groups during policy development. Intra/Inter sectoral collaboration with child health divisions was highlighted in documents from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India and Maldives. Most South-East Asian nations had developed separate national mental health governance documents. However, their incorporation of adolescent mental health is rare and compliance with international standards were inconsistent. Binding mental health legislation separate from health legislation; inclusion of adolescents; addressing resource constraints; and guidelines for mental health policy development catered to low-and-middle-income countries are all essential to address the complex mental health needs of South-East Asian adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Cancer treatment using systemic therapy and radiotherapy may cause post-therapy complications, resulting in increased unplanned hospitalisation. The evidence on such complications, their impact on unplanned hospitalisations, and associated costs is scant in Australia. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of post-therapy complications, evaluate their impact on unplanned hospitalisation, length of stay (LOS) and investigate the associated medical costs. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 8,633 cancer patients (1.03 million emergency hospital admissions) in Victoria, Australia from July 2006 to June 2020, from the Australian healthcare system perspective. Multivariate generalised linear regression models were employed to estimate the adjusted association between post-therapy complications and clinical characteristics with hospital LOS and associated hospitalisation medical costs. Approximately 52% of patients were male with an average patient age of 59.9 years. Annually, post-therapy complications leading to unplanned hospitalisations increased by 7.25%, outpacing the growth in overall hospitalisation admissions, which was 5.66% for overall hospitalisation admissions. A significant proportion of patients (71%) experienced multiple complications, with the most common being anemia (26%), sepsis (15%), nausea and vomiting (14%), and neutropenia (11%). Patients undergoing combined systemic and radiotherapy exhibited higher odds of post-therapy complications (OR = 8.24, 95%CI: 7.48 to 9.08) compared with those who only received systemic therapy. Mean hospital stay among patients who experienced post-therapy complications was 2.23 days per admission (360 days per patient), an extra 1.72 days per admission [95%CI: 1.68 to 1.76; 354 days per patient, 95%CI: 336 to 371 days] longer than patients without complications (0.51 days per admission and 6.48 days per patients). Overall, per-admission medical hospitalisation costs among patients with post-therapy complications were $8,791 higher than for patients who did not experience complications ($11,418 vs. $2,627 per admission, 95%CI: $8,685 to $8,897). Per-patient costs for unplanned hospitalisation due to post-therapy complications were significantly $1.82 million higher among patients than those without complications ($1.86 million vs. $33,599 per patient, 95%CI: $1.71 million to $1.94 million). The cost and hospitalisation stay (in days) varied by the type of therapy and cancer type. The study results indicate that post-therapy complications in cancer patients varied by the type of cancer and increased over the study period, leading to longer unplanned hospital stays and higher hospitalisation medical costs. The results highlight the need for better-customized treatment delivery strategies to address this burden and optimise resources in cancer care.",

This study examines the prevalence of DD among foreign-born individuals of South Asian descent in New York City (NYC) and its association with sociodemographic and clinical factors. Baseline data was collected from the Diabetes Research, Education, and Action for Minorities (DREAM) Initiative, an intervention designed to reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among South Asian individuals with uncontrolled T2D at primary care practices in NYC. The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) measured DD, and Core Healthy Days Measures assessed physical and mental healthy days. Sociodemographic variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests assessed categorical variables, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests evaluated continuous variables (Type I error rate = 0.05). Logistic regression models examined associations between HbA1c, mental health, and other covariates with dichotomized DD subscales. Overall, 414 participants completed the DDS at baseline (median age = 55.2 years; SD = 9.8). All were born outside of the US; the majority were born in Bangladesh (69.8%) followed by India, Pakistan, and Nepal (24.7%) and Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago (5.5%). High emotional burden, regimen-related distress and physician-related distress were reported by 25.9%, 21.9%, and 6.2% of participants, respectively. In adjusted analyses, individuals with ≥ 1 day of poor mental health had higher odds of overall distress (OR:3.8, p = 0.013), emotional burden (OR:4.5, p < 0.001), and physician-related distress (OR:4.6, p = 0.007) compared to individuals with no days of poor mental health. Higher HbA1c (OR:1.45, p = < 0.001) was associated with regimen-related distress; and lower emotional support was associated with overall distress (OR:0.92, p < 0.001) and regimen-related distress (OR:0.95, p = 0.012). Individuals born in Bangladesh had significantly lower odds of overall distress, emotional burden, and regimen-related distress compared to individuals born in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Findings highlight the rate and risk factors of DD among individuals of South Asian descent living in NYC. Screening for DD in patients with prediabetes or diabetes should be integrated to address mental and physical health needs. Future research can benefit from a longitudinal analysis of the impact of DD on diabetes self-management and health outcomes.

        "title": "The prevalence of hypoxaemia in paediatric and adult patients in health-care facilities in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Hypoxaemia (low oxygen saturation in blood) is a key predictor of in-hospital mortality, affecting people of all ages with many different conditions. Early detection and treatment of hypoxaemia are critical, but there are few data to quantify hypoxaemia burden outside the child pneumonia population. We aimed to estimate hypoxaemia prevalence for adults and children with acute illness attending health facilities in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cumulated Index in Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Index Medicus, and Google Scholar for studies reporting hypoxaemia prevalence among patients attending health facilities. We included articles with original data on peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), from an LMIC, published between Jan 1, 1998, and Jan 10, 2023. We included studies in acutely unwell people of any age and with any condition, but excluded those admitted to intensive care units, receiving perioperative care, or attending hospital for preventive or chronic care. We assessed study quality using Joanna Briggs Institute's Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Two reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment, requesting summary data from authors. We reported pooled prevalence of hypoxaemia (typically defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> <90%) overall and by condition, using a random-effects meta-analysis model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136622. We identified 9173 unique records from searches and included 213 in meta-analyses involving 601 757 participants. The majority of studies were from the World Bank regions of sub-Saharan Africa (108 [51%] of 213) or south Asia (58 [27%]). The pooled prevalence of hypoxaemia among admitted patients was 24·5% (95% CI 19·9-29·4) for neonates (aged 0-28 days), 12·1% (10·0-14·4) for children (aged 1 month-17 years), and 10·8% (4·9-18·7) for adults (aged ≥18 years). Hypoxaemia prevalence was highest in neonatal and primary respiratory conditions but still common in many other conditions. Hypoxaemia was associated with 4·84 (95% CI 4·11-5·69) times higher odds of death than no hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia is common across all age groups and a range of primary respiratory and other critical illnesses and is strongly associated with death. These estimates will inform oxygen-related strategies and programmes, and integration of pulse oximetry and oxygen into clinical guidelines, service structures, and strategies for maternal, neonatal, child, adolescent, and adult health.

        "title": "Prediction of inpatient mortality in hospitalised children in low- and middle-income countries: An external validation of paediatric mortality risk scores.",
        "abstract": "Risk prediction tools for acutely ill children have been developed in high- and low-income settings, but few are validated or incorporated into clinical guidelines. We aimed to assess the performance of existing paediatric early warning scores for use in low- and middle-income countries using clinical data from a recent large multi-country study in Africa and South-Asia. We used data (children across three nutritional strata) from the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network cohort study (n = 3101). We assessed 10 scores where similar predictor variables were available in the CHAIN cohort. We evaluated performance using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) (primary outcome), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (secondary outcomes). Most scores showed poor discrimination, and all scores had low sensitivity. The paediatric early death index for Africa (AUC = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77-0.83), respiratory index of severity in children (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.74-0.81), and respiratory index of severity in children in Malawi (AUC = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.75-0.82) showed acceptable/good overall discrimination. Among children without wasting, most scores had acceptable/good performance, some even excellent. Poor discrimination was found for most scores among children with moderate and severe wasting or kwashiorkor. All scores demonstrated lower validation performance than originally reported. Among children without wasting, most risk prediction scores performed acceptably whilst in malnourished children they performed poorly. There is a need for a malnutrition specific score. Further research is needed on specific actions in responding to scores. Integration into future guidelines will require acknowledging staffing, resources and workflows.",
