        "abstract": "Safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are crucial for health and development, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where WASH-related diseases are prevalent. Bangladesh, with high poverty rates and a large population, faces significant WASH challenges. This study examines the association between hygiene-related factors and communicable diseases in two Bangladeshi municipalities. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to July 30, 2021, in Savar and Satkhira municipalities, chosen for their diverse socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. A stratified random sampling method targeted poor, marginalised, and socially excluded populations. A total of 607 interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire, collecting data on socio-demographics, hygiene practices, and disease history. Participants were included if they were adults (aged 18 or older), had resided in the municipality for at least one year, and provided informed consent to participate. Data were analysed using SPSS, employing chi-square tests and logistic regression to assess associations between variables. The study revealed that 24.1% of participants had a communicable disease, with diarrhoea being the most common. Significant predictors of communicable diseases included gender, with females being more likely affected (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.19 to 8.66, p = 0.003), and the source of drinking water, with tube well users at higher risk (OR: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.13 to 7.02, p = 0.015). Poor hand hygiene significantly increased disease risk (OR: 12.31, 95% CI: 2.86 to 53.03, p < 0.001). Communicable diseases are prevalent in Bangladeshi municipalities, primarily driven by poor WASH conditions. Enhancing access to safe drinking water and implementing community-based WASH interventions, such as hygiene education campaigns, improved sanitation infrastructure, and school-based awareness programs, are vital for reducing the disease burden. Further research should explore the effectiveness and scalability of these targeted strategies.",

A consequence of this growth is the increase in discipline-specific terminologies emerging in the OH lexicon to become lingua franca. However, some of these terms are used ambiguously, and interpreted broadly, thereby hampering systematic OH coordination. This article elucidates the semantics of eight fundamental terminologies, including 'One Health', 'One Health Systems', 'One Health Framework', 'One Health Core Competency', 'One Health Education/Curriculum', 'One Health Professional/Workforce', 'One Health Study/Research', and 'One Health Governance/Legislation'. The major findings of this study are that while there is a consensus on OH definition and OH framework usage, OH systems remain ambiguous despite frequent mentions. Core competencies and educational models are disparate, thus requiring harmonization, and a putative global OH governance structure is being defined through international organizations.",

Country-specific evaluations are needed to inform policymakers on implementation of hrHPV-based screening for their setting. Following initial implementation in Uganda, Bangladesh and Slovakia focused on underscreened women in the PRESCRIP-TEC project, we investigated the potential cost-effectiveness and affordability of hrHPV-based screening strategies. Country-specific model-based cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted for the three countries, comparing the PRESCRIP-TEC strategy with the existing screening strategy in each setting. Data from initial project implementation informed the relevant model parameters. The PRESCRIP-TEC strategy resulted in disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gains in all three countries. The cervical cancer incidence rate was reduced by a third for Uganda, 15% for Bangladesh and 11% for Slovakia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were UGX 0.56 million per DALY for Uganda (I$ 475), BDT 76 thousand per DALY for Bangladesh (I$ 1698) and EUR 1782 (I$ 3637) per DALY for Slovakia. Substantial additional funding will be required to enable implementation, particularly in relation to the initial start-up costs. The provided estimates can serve to inform policymakers and researchers in the context of implementing hrHPV-based screening in diverse settings.",

        "abstract": "Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan. UPF consumption varied across South Asia by sociodemographic factors including age, gender, and education. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial when designing interventions aimed at reducing UPF consumption. Our findings of regional variations in the types of UPFs consumed provide valuable insights for targeted interventions. The South Asia Biobank is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",

In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate dipole moments and molecular orbital characteristics and analyze the thermodynamic stability of putative antimicrobial and anticancer derivatives. This finding reveals a well-defined, possibly therapeutic relationship, supported by theoretical and future in vitro and in vivo studies.

        "abstract": "The study aimed to determine the factors associated with the common disease prevalence of Sonali chicken farms in different regions of Bangladesh. A total of 243 farms were randomly selected from four Bangladesh districts to collect retrospective data. The study found that the most prevalent diseases were Newcastle Disease (76.54%), Infectious Bursal Disease (51.44%), Avian Influenza (29.63%), Colibacillosis (22.63%), Coccidiosis (69.55%), Brooder Pneumonia (34.98%), and Ascariasis (20.16%). The secondary group of the education level of these farmers (84.9%), visitors allowance farm (81.9%), and farms in which dead birds are buried (91.3%) have significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of ND. The potential flock-level protective factors of ND prevalence were the visitors not allowed on the farm (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.92; P = 0.024) and dead chicken disposal by buried (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08-0.56; P = 0.000). Farmers who used deep wells (56.9%) and clean feeders and drinkers every 3 days (72.2%) have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of IBD. The risk factor for IBD: the Sonali chicken farmers had no idea about vaccine transportation to maintain the temperature (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-3.13; P = 0.048). Rangpur district (44.8%), farms that used cefalexin (51.1%) on their farm during the brooding period, and the farms in which farmers have no idea of chick grade have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of AI. The farm whose farmer bought the chicks from the hatchery (36.7%) had a noticeably (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of colibacillosis. Mymensingh district (80.0%), male farmers' farms (74.7%), large-scale farms (87.5%), and farms in which wood shavings were used as litter (77.8%) have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of coccidiosis. Rangpur district (49.2%), in farms where farmers were not practicing handwashing (41.5%), didn't maintain routine cleaning of feeders and drinkers (43.6%), and didn't use antibiotics during the brooding period (68.1%) had a higher prevalence of brooder pneumonia. Kishoreganj district (30.0%), male farmers (22.1%), farmers with primary education levels (30.7%), and Large-scale farms (2501-5200 birds) (25.1%), farms using wood shavings as litter material (35.6%), farms sourcing chicks from hatcheries (23.0%,) and farms that used florfenicol (30.8%) as an antibiotic during the brooding period had a significant (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of Ascariasis. Poor biosecurity, improper waste management, inexperience with chick quality & antibiotics used, and missing regular vaccinations make farms more likely to experience disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of global child mortality continues to be diarrhoea where rotavirus contributed to about 24% of deaths among all diarrhoeal deaths, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Rotavirus vaccination programmes have contributed to the reduction of mortality from 24% to 19% in rotavirus infections among hospitalised children, but the burden of rotaviral diarrhoea remains high, especially in settings with undernutrition. We aimed to determine the association of rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology with prior vaccination, socioeconomic status and clinical factors in children to see their utility in clinical settings. We analysed secondary data from a multicentre clinical trial on antibiotic impact in children with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We used stored stool samples of 6697 children aged 2-23 months old, presenting to a health facility with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We determined rotavirus aetiology prevalence using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and looked at its association with the patient's rotaviral vaccination status, clinical symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models; if they did not converge, log-Poisson models were used. Rotavirus prevalence of 21.1% was observed. There was a weak and statistically non-significant inverse association between rotavirus vaccination and rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology (adjusted PR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03). Of the five tested clinical symptoms, shorter diarrhoea duration was associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.45). Of the seven tested socioeconomic characteristics, only maternal and paternal secondary education compared with no formal education were associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, PR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00 respectively). Rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology cannot accurately be determined with prior receipt of rotavirus vaccination among children presenting to facilities with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. Short diarrhoea duration and parental secondary education were associated with increased prevalence of rotaviral aetiology; however, their utility in clinical care remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "The international demand for shrimp from Bangladesh exhibits a Telecoupled system. Semi-intensive to intensive shrimp farming has changed vast coastal areas into saline zones by altering land use and land cover. While shrimp cultivation significantly contributes to foreign exchange earnings, it also leads to various social and environmental impacts that affect planetary health. This study sees shrimp farming as a result of these Telecoupled dynamics. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining both primary and secondary data to examine its effects on planetary health in Bangladesh's southwestern coastal areas. The findings reveal several important health and social issues associated with shrimp farming. These include (i) scarcity of drinking and household water, (ii) infectious diseases, (iii) non-infectious diseases, (iv) food and nutritional insecurity, (v) antimicrobial resistance and chemical contamination, (vi) mental pressure, (vii) disaster-related health vulnerability, (viii) social conflict, (ix) healthcare inequality, and (x) rural-urban migration. This analysis enhances our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and nature in shrimp farming systems and their evolving impacts on planetary health in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. The study stresses the urgent need for integrated, ecosystem-based agricultural practices to find a balance between economic benefits and sustainable health and environmental outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. It remains a major public health challenge worldwide, and particularly in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak. Defining the pool of diversity over finer time-scales is important because the selective pressures that impact <i>V. cholerae</i>, namely antibiotics and phages, are dynamic on these scales. To study the nationwide diversity of <i>V. cholerae</i>, we long-read sequenced 273 <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> genomes from seven hospitals over 1 year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major <i>V. cholerae</i> lineages were identified: three known lineages, BD-1, BD-2a and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, at which point it had replaced BD-2 as the most common lineage in Bangladesh. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already predominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from northern India. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, yet persisted throughout the sampling period. Genes previously associated with antibiotic resistance in <i>V. cholerae</i> isolated from Bangladesh in the prior decade were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-2019, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Our results highlight the diverse nature of the <i>V. cholerae</i> pangenome and geographic structure within a single outbreak season. This diversity provides the raw material for adaptation to antibiotics, phages and other selective pressures.",

NiV sG induced the strongest neutralising antibody response, NiV mcsF induced antibodies best able to neutralise cell-cell fusion, whereas ChAdOx1 NiV G elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Despite differences in immunogenicity, prime-boost immunisation with all candidates conferred a high degree of protection against NiV infection.

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), due to their chronic nature, lead to long-term and significant health burdens that result in catastrophic expenses for individuals and communities. This study explores the socioeconomic effects of catastrophic health costs on households with family members experiencing NCDs and their coping mechanisms in rural areas of Bangladesh. Qualitative study. Case studies were conducted with ten NCD patients who had experienced catastrophic events and their close contacts. Purposive sampling strategies were used to recruit participants from two sub-districts in areas with a high prevalence of NCDs. In-depth interviews and observations were conducted, and documents (e.g. hospital and diagnosis bills, medicine purchase receipts) were reviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Data revealed that the treatment costs of NCDs are multifaceted and long-term. This catastrophic health expenditure has many economic effects, such as compromising food, housing, living standards and quality of life. It also has non-economic effects, including social stigmatisation, adjusting wishes and dreams, hampering children's education, disrupting family relationships and undermining social dignity. Households' adaptive strategies include loaning and borrowing, selling assets, using savings, seeking assistance from friends and relatives, reconciling living standards and even adopting alternative medicines. Thisstudy highlights the socioeconomic impact of catastrophic health costs associated with NCDs and how households adapt and cope with these expenses. The results increase understanding of the impact of NCDs and the importance of managing the economic burden. Results highlight the necessity for a strategic plan to aid families affected by chronic NCDs.",

        "title": "Interplay between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever: insights from endemic countries and a controlled human infection model.",
        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited. To investigate the association between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n = 92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop the disease, n = 97) and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n = 69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition and function were compared. We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against the development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had a higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22). This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections. Video Abstract.",

        "abstract": "Intestinal protozoan infections, including Giardia lamblia (G. lamblia), Cryptosporidium spp., and Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica), are major contributors to global gastrointestinal morbidity and mortality, particularly among children in resource-limited settings. With this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of protozoan infections among forcibly displaced Myanmar national children aged 6-16 years by using a multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Among 419 participants, the overall prevalence of protozoan infections was 49.4%, with G. lamblia being the most prevalent species (47.0%), followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (4.3%) and E. histolytica (1.2%). The most frequent coinfection involved G. lamblia and Cryptosporidium (2.1%). Male children were marginally more likely to be infected with any protozoan (odds ratio [OR] = 0.086; P = 0.047); however, sex was not a significant predictor when exclusively analyzing Giardia-, Cryptosporidium-, or E. histolytica-positive children. Nutrition status was a significant predictor of being infected with any protozoan (OR = 1.67; P = 0.012), and increased nutrition was additionally associated with lower levels of fecal myeloperoxidase (estimate = -0.31; P = 0.030) and alpha-1-antitrypsin (estimate = -63.41; P = 0.026). Age was significantly predictive of infection status, with younger children exhibiting increased odds of positivity for protozoan parasites (OR = 0.87; P ≤0.001). Increasing age was associated with reduced myeloperoxidase (estimate = -0.17; P = 0.015) but was not associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin. This study underscores the substantial prevalence of intestinal protozoan infections among displaced children and highlights the need for targeted public health interventions.",

        "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae has long posed a significant challenge in clinical settings worldwide, particularly due to its carbapenemase production and multidrug-resistant (MDR) characteristics. While extensive genomic studies of K. pneumoniae have been conducted globally, research in Asia, particularly South Asia, remains limited. This study aims to address and compare the genomic characteristics of K. pneumoniae isolates from South Asia and Southeast Asia, including virulence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), plasmids, and mobile genetic elements (MGE) profiles, as well as potential transmission dynamics. A total of 463 K. pneumoniae genomes were included from collected samples and public databases. All genomes underwent comprehensive analysis, including pan-genome profiling, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), annotation of virulence factors, AMR genes, plasmids, and MGEs, as well as SNP distance-based analysis to infer transmission dynamics, using established bioinformatic tools. K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited diverse virulence determinants. Hypervirulent isolates were primarily associated with ST23 and ST86, and commonly harbour aerobactin, salmochelin, and rmpA. The majority of isolates were predicted to be MDR, with those from Southeast Asia showing a higher relative abundance of AMR genes associated with the antibiotic classes examined in this study. Among all isolates, the predominant carbapenemase-associated gene was bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>. Col440I_1 was the most prevalent plasmid replicon, although it did not co-occur with any AMR genes. Association between the IncFII_1_pKP9 plasmid replicon and resistance genes sul-5, bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, and bla<sub>TEM</sub> was found. ISSen9 was the dominant MGE, frequently co-occurring with the plasmid replicons IncFIB(K)_1_Kpn3 and IncFII_1_pKP91. Transmission analysis indicated that the highest isolate similarity occurred within MLST and country. However, clustering based on plasmid replicon profiles revealed that some clusters comprised isolates from multiple countries. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the genomic characteristics and transmission patterns of K. pneumoniae in South and Southeast Asia, contributing to our understanding of its virulence and resistance mechanisms. These findings further suggest that plasmid replicons may play a critical role in shaping transmission dynamics and provide valuable insights to inform future AMR surveillance and control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Backyard poultry-rearing contributes to income and food security for rural households in low- and middle-income countries. However, poultry are often kept inside the household dwelling at night, posing health risks to the people raising them. Housing poultry separately from the dwelling overnight is a potential intervention to limit exposure to poultry. The aim of this study was to describe practices and determinants of overnight poultry housing in rural Bangladesh as formative research for an intervention to separate young children from poultry and poultry feces. We conducted 19 transect walks in villages across Bangladesh to document overnight housing practices among backyard poultry raisers. We then conducted 27 semi-structured interviews to explore poultry-raising practices, including housing types and materials identified during transect walks. We found overnight poultry housing both inside and separate from the dwelling and found that most poultry raisers who kept their birds separate from the dwelling overnight did so in courtyard sheds. There was a preference and willingness to house birds outside, provided a shed was available, although overnight housing practices fluctuated. Having a shed was a function of household resources, including availability and access to materials and skilled labor, available physical space, area- and village-wide trends, and the preferences and concerns of poultry raisers. We recommend that future studies measuring human exposure to poultry and poultry feces assess exposure prospectively and at regular intervals to capture variations in housing practice, and include assessments of poultry housing hygiene practices. The promotion of sheds for overnight poultry housing may be an acceptable intervention approach in this setting, though programs will need to make recommendations for housing that address the risk of zoonotic disease transmission and accommodate the preferences and constraints of poultry raisers over a one-size-fits-all approach.",

        "abstract": "There are many unknown consequences of viral infections. In this piece, we looked at one of these effects that influence the venous system of the body, vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels. The study illustrates that viral infections attack host cells through viral proteins and surface receptors, activate NF-kappaβ via various receptors and signaling pathways, and subsequently induce a cytokine storm through the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL2, likely due to endothelial dysfunction caused by reactive oxygen species generation. Generally, overproduction of these mediators has been identified as a contributor to vascular inflammation and the subsequent development of atherosclerotic plaque, which may facilitate the initiation of vascular inflammation. This article also discusses potentially effective inhibitors for particular cytokines that contribute to vascular inflammation. Inhibiting the expression of these cytokines can diminish atherosclerotic lesions. This article addresses the need for further investigation into the link between post-viral infection effects and vascular inflammation by discussing the potential mechanism by which the immune system acts upon pathogen entry, the factors responsible for influencing the immune system, and the prevention of infectious disease transmission.",

The anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity of ethanol-extracted Propolis was assessed against <i>P. falciparum</i> NF54 using the SYBR Green I fluorescence assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified major phytochemicals in the most active extract.

Propolis collected from Kermanshah city exhibited the highest anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.69 ± 1.44 μg/mL). GC-MS analysis identified tectochrysin and galangin as major constituents. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities of tectochrysin (-7.8 kcal/mol) and galangin (-7.5 kcal/mol) to PfLDH, surpassing the binding energies of standard antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and quinine). MD simulations confirmed the stability of tectochrysin and galangin within the PfLDH active sites, with favorable root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, molecular surface area, and polar surface area profiles, indicating persistent and stable protein-ligand interactions throughout the simulation. The findings support the promising anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> potential of Propolis-derived compounds, particularly tectochrysin and galangin, as novel PfLDH inhibitors.

It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment.

Depression is considered a risk factor for dementia, but the temporal dynamics across the life course remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess the relationship between the timing of depression assessment and risk of all-cause late-life dementia. We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis to assess incident dementia in individuals with non-current history of depression. PubMed and Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched from inception up to February 17, 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between depression and incident late-life dementia were included. From eligible reviews, we also extracted data from studies reporting dementia risk as hazard ratios (HRs), analysing the timing of depression measurement using random-effects models for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021249706. Of the 7763 records identified, nine reviews were eligible for inclusion of the umbrella review. One review was judged to be of moderate quality, while the others were either low (<i>n</i> = 3) or critically low (<i>n</i> = 5). For our meta-analyses, 18 studies reporting depression onset in later life (<i>n</i> = 901,762 participants, <i>n</i> = 7595 incident dementia cases) and seven studies on depression assessed during midlife (<i>n</i> ≥ 2,501,269 participants, <i>n</i> ≥ 276,929 incident dementia cases) were included. All studies in the meta-analyses were deemed to be of good quality, with no strong evidence of publication bias. Pooled HRs indicated depression present in late-life (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68-2.26; <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 77.5%) and midlife (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12-2.18; <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 97.5%) significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia. The findings suggest that depression across the life course may increase dementia risk; however, substantial heterogeneity and review quality should be considered when interpreting the strength of this evidence. A life course approach to the treatment and prevention of depression may help reduce the burden of dementia, but this will require scaling up access to effective mental health care for vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to clarify if the stronger late-life association reflects depression as an immediate risk factor or an early manifestation of neurodegenerative processes.

The National Anti-Retroviral Therapy Program still relies on a 'Test and Treat' strategy and faces challenges in treating drug-resistant HIV. This study aims to assess the HIV viral load and drug resistance mutations among key populations (KPs) under anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in Bangladesh. A total of 110 KPs from 20 drop-in-centers across 11 districts in Bangladesh were enrolled from March 2019 to November 2020 for viral load (VL) testing using Xpert® HIV-1 Viral Load kits. Samples with high VL (≥1000 copies/mL) underwent pol gene sequencing to identify drug resistance mutations. Most of the participants were men who have sex with men (MSM, 49.1%) followed by men sex workers (MSW, 34.5%), and transgender women (TGW, 13.6%). The median age of the participants was 28 years (IQR: 24-35) and 80% of them were from the capital city, Dhaka. The median time for ART was 11.5 months (IQR: 4.5-29.1), where 15 participants were naïve to ART. Overall, high VL was observed in 23.8%, and virologic failure was in 17.9% among PLWH who were treated for >30 days. HIV-1 subtype C was predominant (43.8%), followed by A1 (25%), CRF01_AE (25%), and CRF02_AG (6.2%). Seven participants showed resistance against Efavirenz, the common drug received from ART centres, and three of them were additionally resistant against Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate. Other drugs supplied by ART centres were also found resistant for participants; i.e. 6 against Emtricitabine, 6 against Lamivudine, and 1 against Etravirine. The spatial distribution indicated HIV transmission occurred within and between KPs and drop-in-centers. Additionally, samples that received different ART also clustered together. Evidence suggests that KPs are at a higher risk of virologic failure in Bangladesh, emphasizing the need for routine VL and drug resistance mutation tests as part of the national ART program. This study also advocates for exploring barriers to ART adherence and implementing personalized ART strategies in national ART programs. The Global Fund.",

Our objective is to estimate dietary salt and potassium intake among Bangladesh rural and urban adults from urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. We conducted a cross-sectional study between December 2017 and June 2018, including participants aged 30-59 years from three urban and three rural sites in Bangladesh. Data included urinary excretion of sodium and potassium estimated from one 24-hr urine collection and blood pressure measurements. Among 840 enrolled participants, complete data was available in 509 individuals. Mean age was 43.0 (SD ±7.9) years; 20.9% had hypertension, 50.9% were women, and 50.9% resided in urban areas. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 118.6 (SD ± 16.6) mmHg and 76.3 (SD ± 11.3) mmHg, respectively. Overall, the mean urinary sodium excretion was 3.9 g/day (95% CI = 3.8 to 4.0), corresponding to a mean salt intake of 9.7 g/day (95% CI = 9.4-10.1). Mean urinary potassium excretion was 1.4 g/day (95% CI = 1.3-1.4), corresponding to an estimated mean dietary potassium intake of 2.0 g/day. Men and urban residents had slightly but non-significantly higher sodium and potassium excretion than women and rural residents. In Bangladesh, salt intake exceeded WHO's recommended <5g/day limit, while potassium intake was substantially lower than the recommended intake of ≥ 3.5g/day for adults. Promoting low-sodium and potassium-rich diets through nationwide campaigns and policies, including advocating for accessible low-sodium and potassium-enriched salt substitutes, is recommended to mitigate cardiovascular disease risks.",

We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs. 13%; p < 0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility.

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

To further assess the mechanism of NiV polymerase activity, we establish a highly sensitive radioactive-labeled RNA synthesis assay and identify a back-priming activity in the NiV polymerase as well as a fluorescence and luminescent-based non-radioactive polymerase assay to enable high-throughput screening for L protein inhibitors. The combination of structural analysis and the development of both high-sensitive and high-throughput biochemical assays will enable the identification of new direct-acting antiviral candidates for treating highly pathogenic henipaviruses.",

        "abstract": "Leprosy is a debilitating, chronic infectious disease, ranking second after tuberculosis in the order of severe human mycobacterial diseases. If timely treatment is not initiated, infection with its causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae, can result in severe nerve damage leading to life-long disabilities. Host immunity largely dictates the spectral disease presentation, ranging from multi- to paucibacillary. Studying the host response to M. leprae is, however, complicated by the inability to culture this mycobacterium in vitro. Immune correlates of protection in persons at risk of leprosy are, therefore, essentially unknown. To identify host factors related to mycobacterial control, functional mycobacterial growth inhibition assays combined with extensive immunophenotyping by spectral flow cytometry were performed for patients with leprosy and their contacts. This integrative approach merged sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in low resource areas with immune-analysis using cutting edge technology. In contrast to the current dogma, no intrinsic differences in mycobacterial control in vitro between patients with high and low bacillary loads were observed. Immunophenotyping at consecutive levels revealed a significant link between the induction of chemokines to mycobacterial antigens and expression of CXCR3 and CCR4 on adaptive immune cells in contacts controlling M. leprae infection. These results offer more detailed insights into protective immunity against M. leprae and define host factors associated with bacterial control, fuelling improved diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are typically used directly on stool but are not considered sufficient for cholera confirmation. However, they may provide a practical alternative to the slide agglutination step of culture<i>,</i> as they are easy to use, store, and require minimal training. This study evaluates the concordance of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1/O139 detection from presumptive colonies by slide agglutination with RDTs. Patients (≥1 year) with acute watery diarrhea at the icddr,b Dhaka hospital were enrolled. Stool samples were cultured on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose medium, and presumptive colonies were subcultured on Gelatin Agar medium. Isolates were then tested by slide agglutination and four commercial cholera RDTs. From 4 February 2024 through 24 May 2025, 1,638 patients with acute watery diarrhea were enrolled, 1,140 (70%) had presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies, and 482 (29%) were culture-confirmed as <i>V. cholerae</i> O1. We tested suspected <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies using Cholkit (n=1,140), SD Bioline (n=693), Crystal VC O1/O139 (n=693), and Crystal VC O1 (n=655) RDT kits. RDTs showed near-perfect concordance with slide agglutination. Using slide agglutination as the reference, the sensitivity of the RDT kits ranged from 99.3% to 99.6% and the specificity from 99.3% to 99.7%. RDTs offer a practical and potentially easier alternative to slide agglutination of presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies within typical cholera culture protocols. This may help to provide a pathway to quick confirmation of outbreaks in settings where lab facilities and reagents may be limited.IMPORTANCEThis study demonstrated that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can effectively replace traditional slide agglutination methods to confirm suspected <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonies belonging to the O1 serogroup, which are responsible for the current seventh cholera pandemic. Comparing four RDTs to slide agglutination, we found almost perfect agreement, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 99%. Since RDTs are cheaper, easier to use and store, and require less technical training, adopting them could significantly speed up cholera outbreak confirmation, especially in areas with limited laboratory resources. This practical shift could lead to faster responses to cholera outbreaks, ultimately improving public health surveillance and disease control globally.",

A barrier to the use of JEV vaccines has been a limited understanding of the underlying burden. We conducted a nationally representative serological community study in 70 communities in individuals of all ages (N=2,938, October 2015-January 2016). Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies against JEV. We developed spatially explicit serocatalytic models to estimate the underlying force of infection across the country. We then used mathematical models to estimate the annual JE disease burden currently and under different vaccination strategies. The overall JEV seroprevalence in Bangladesh was 3.4% (95%CI: 2.8-4.1, range 0-28% across communities). The annual probability of infection was 0.005 (95%CI: 0.003-0.009), with risk greatest near border regions. We estimated that annually there are 157 clinical cases (95%CI: 89-253) and 31 deaths (95%CI: 18-52). A vaccination strategy in the 10 most affected districts in 60% of 1-15 year olds would require 5 million doses and avert 1 case per 100,000 doses over five years compared to 35 million doses and 0.5 cases averted for a nationwide campaign. No vaccination scenario was cost-effective under a willingness-to-pay of three-times gross domestic product.

        "abstract": "Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common infectious diseases and remain a heavy burden, especially in some low-income countries. Although the global burden has decreased over the past three decades, an analysis of the burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever will help inform public health strategies. This study is aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of typhoid and paratyphoid, and the temporal trends while exploring potential associations with socio-demographic development over three decades (1990-2021). Data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2021. For this analysis, we calculated to demonstrate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021. From 1990 to 2021, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever showed declining trends globally and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, including incidence, mortality, and DALYs. For typhoid fever worldwide, new cases decreased by 62.12%, with an EAPC of -3.92 (-4.14, -3.71); deaths decreased by 50.65%, EAPC - 2.83 (-2.99, -2.66), and DALYs decreased by 52.30%, EAPC - 2.82 (-3.00, -2.64). For paratyphoid fever, new cases decreased by 73.15%, with an EAPC of -4.77 (-5.29, -4.26); deaths decreased by 65.44%, EAPC - 3.74 (-4.24, -3.24), and DALYs decreased by 68.42%, EAPC - 3.87 (-4.42, -3.31). For both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, children had the highest morbidity and mortality rates; males had higher rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs than females. However, among older patients, the absolute number of new cases and DALYs was higher in women. The burden is concentrated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, with only South Asia suffering severely from paratyphoid fever. Regarding typhoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of incidence are Burkina Faso (328.48) (SDI: 0.285), Bangladesh (303.14) (SDI: 0.492), and Papua New Guinea (299.45) (SDI: 418) which are in Western Sub-Saharan, South Asia, and Oceania. The top three countries in terms of mortality and DALYs are Bhutan (5.61; 434.23) (SDI: 0.473), Bangladesh (5.06; 382.38), and Burkina Faso (4.64; 352.57). Regarding paratyphoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of mortality and DALYs are the same, including Pakistan (1.05; 72.66), India (0.75; 53.42), and Nepal (0.72; 50.65) (SDI: 0.433), all of which are located in South Asia.",

To inform the design of infection prevention RCTs for infants in low-resource settings, we estimated the incidence of severe infection and death among Bangladeshi infants aged 0-60 days using variations in case definitions. Among 1939 infants born generally healthy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, severe infection was identified through up to 12 scheduled community health worker home visits from 0 to 60 days of age or through caregiver self-referral. The primary severe infection case definition combined physician documentation of standardised clinical signs and/or diagnosis of sepsis/SBI, plus either a positive blood culture or parenteral antibiotic treatment for ≥5 days. Incidence rates were estimated for the primary severe infection definition, the WHO definition of possible SBI, blood culture-confirmed infection and five alternative definitions including non-injury death. Severe infection incidence per 1000 infant-days was 1.2 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.4) using the primary definition, 0.84 (0.69 to 1.0) using the WHO definition of possible SBI, 0.026 (0.0085 to 0.081) using blood culture-confirmed infection and 0.061 (0.029 to 0.13) for death. One-third of cases met criteria for the primary severe infection definition through physician diagnosis of sepsis/SBI rather than the standardised clinical signs, and 85% of cases were identified following caregiver self-referral despite frequent scheduled visits. Severe infection incidence in infants varied considerably by case definition. Using a clinical sign-based definition may miss a substantial proportion of cases identified by physician diagnosis of sepsis/SBI. A consensus definition of severe infection in infants that balances permissiveness and stringency and can be operationalised in low-resource countries would improve the comparability of RCTs. If health facilities are accessible and caregivers readily seek care for infant illness, frequently scheduled home assessments may not be necessary.",

        "abstract": "Globally, about 74% of deaths are attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Tobacco use is one of the key risk factors of NCDs. Tobacco taxes can discourage the use of tobacco. However, how increasing tobacco taxation may reduce the burden of NCDs is not well studied. This study examines whether higher cigarette taxes are associated with reduced premature deaths-death before the age of 70-from NCDs using multicountry panel data. The study analysed country-level panel data of 152 countries from 2008 to 2020 collected from various sources. The annual burden of NCDs was measured by the proportion of deaths due to NCDs before age 70 in each country. The tax rate on cigarettes-both specific and total-was used as a key explanatory variable. Other covariates include MPOWER score net of taxes, tobacco prevalence and other country-level characteristics. Panel data regressions with various combinations of country and year fixed effects were used to estimate the association between tobacco taxation and the burden of NCDs. Cigarette tax was significantly (p<0.05) associated with the burden of NCDs, with an increase in tobacco tax as a per cent of retail price from the current average 47%-75% being associated with a 2-percentage point decrease in the proportion of deaths due to NCDs before age 70 years. A Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations confirmed the robustness of this effect, estimating an average reduction of 1.09 percentage points (95% uncertainty interval: -1.76 to -0.42, i.e. reduction by 0.42 to 1.76 percentage points) in premature NCD mortality. Access to healthcare, obesity, and clean fuel and cooking technology were also found to be associated with the burden of NCDs. The results are robust to various model specifications. The study provides important evidence that increasing tobacco taxation could be an effective tool in reducing the burden of NCDs. Countries aiming to curb the burden of NCDs could consider raising tobacco taxes.",

        "title": "Pulmonary function and comparative SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibody response among the COVID-19 recovered group.",
        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experience a plethora of long-COVID symptoms that may persist for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID, even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group, which had previously exhibited varying symptom severity (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered group, with significantly elevated titers in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. After vaccination, the recovered group showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in the severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups, compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p < 0.005). Notably, antibody titers were negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p < 0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days after receiving two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, antibody titers returned to baseline levels, highlighting the importance of vaccination and additional booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history. To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health concern, primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which spreads through unsafe sexual contact. Natural immunity often fails to provide full protection, permitting exogenous reinfection, which plays a key role in the persistence and transmission of HPV. This paper presents and analyzes a deterministic mathematical model of HPV transmission, incorporating exogenous re-infection. We utilized VIA test result data from 2019 to 2023 in Bangladesh to estimate key parameter values. The findings were validated through numerical simulations using MATLAB, and the analytical results demonstrated strong consistency with the numerical outputs. A critical insight is the presence of reinfection-induced backward bifurcation, indicating that targeting primary infections alone is insufficient for eradication, highlighting the need to address exogenous reinfection for effective control. We propose optimal control strategies tailored to resource-limited settings like Bangladesh, where limited vaccine access presents significant challenges, and community-driven education on safe sexual practices is crucial and continuously evolving. The results emphasize that the most effective approach combines targeted prevention with widespread community education, while precision in intervention implementation is essential to prevent reinfection surges that could prolong disease persistence and undermine control efforts. These insights provide a strong foundation for refining intervention strategies and offer valuable guidance for controlling HPV transmission through non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly in resource-constrained settings.",

Approximately one in 1,000 <i>C</i>. <i>jejuni</i> infections leads to GBS, with LOS variations influencing immune response and disease induction. We aimed to investigate the sequence type and genomic variation of the LOS region of <i>C. jejuni</i> strains isolated from patients with GBS and enteritis. We isolated 38 GBS- and 24 enteritis-associated <i>C. jejuni</i> strains from Bangladesh, sequenced them on the Illumina platform, and compared their LOS regions using various bioinformatic approaches. Comparative genomic analysis between GBS-associated and enteritis-associated strains revealed that LOS classes A, B, and C were prevalent (<i>P</i> = 0.0001) in GBS-associated <i>C. jejuni</i> strains. Sequence types ST-43 and ST-2042 and clonal complexes ST-403 cc and ST-21 cc were overrepresented in GBS compared to enteritis-associated strains. All GBS-associated strains carrying LOS class C belonged to clonal complex ST-21 cc. Nucleotide variation within the LOS region differs significantly (<i>P</i> = 0.005) among GBS-associated and enteritis-associated strains. In GBS strains, phase variation (PV) within the LOS region was significantly higher (<i>P</i> = 0.004). In conclusion, the predominance of GBS-associated LOS classes, characterized by class-specific nucleotide changes and elevated phase variation, may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GBS. However, further research on integrating DNA epigenetic analysis and metabolic profiling is needed to establish the <i>C. jejuni-</i>specific risk factors of GBS.IMPORTANCEThe lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis region is the most variable and virulent genomic region of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>. This study addressed the critical gap in understanding the genomic features contributing to GBS by analyzing the LOS region of <i>C. jejuni</i> strains from GBS and enteritis patients. Our analysis of <i>C. jejuni</i> isolates from GBS and enteritis cases revealed genomic variations in the sequence type and LOS region, including distinct LOS classes (A, B, and C), higher prevalence of the <i>cst-II</i> gene, and significant presence of phase variability among GBS-associated <i>C. jejuni</i> strains. The findings highlight the association of <i>C. jejuni</i> LOS region in the pathogenesis of GBS. In addition, the results of this study will facilitate future comparisons by identifying genomic differences in lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis and sequence types between <i>C. jejuni</i> strains linked to GBS.

        "abstract": "Studies focussing on measuring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rely on phenotyping or low throughput PCR detection of limited AMR genes (ARGs); high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) may be a scalable approach for measuring AMR. We applied Fluidigm HT-qPCR to measure the impact of flock-level antimicrobial use (AMU) on genotypic AMR in the Mekong Delta area of Vietnam. AMU-related data and pooled faecal samples were collected longitudinally from 20 meat chicken flocks, divided into flocks treated with antimicrobials and untreated controls. Samples were analysed for 94 ARGs using Fluidigm HT-qPCR. Normalized ARG abundance was measured in reference to 16S rRNA. A regression model was constructed to weigh the effect of AMU factors on AMR. The frequency of ARGs per sample was significantly higher in antimicrobial treatment group chicken samples (56.4; 95% CI 55.3-57.6) compared with the controls (52.1, 95% CI 50.9-53.4). Similarly, the normalized ARG abundance was significantly greater in treatment flock samples (3.2; 95% CI 2.9-3.4) than in control samples (2.0; 95% CI 1.7-2.3), except for tetracycline ARGs. Overall, ARG frequency negatively correlated with the average ARG abundance (<i>R</i> = -0.27 and <i>P</i> < 0.05). The time series analysis of ARG abundance revealed three distinct and equally prevalent patterns of ARG persistence. Among all the AMU factors, the number of antimicrobial classes and the total AMU duration showed the highest impact on flock ARG abundance. The findings of this study highlight the utility of molecular AMR profiling in areas with heavy AMU for poultry production.",

        "title": "From Bat to Worse: The Pivotal Role of Bats for Viral Zoonosis.",
        "abstract": "Zoonotic infections are increasingly observed and bats (Chiroptera) are playing a pivotal role here. The causal chain of events has been elucidated for Henipavirus (family: paramyxoviruses) infections. Deforestation combined with climate change has reduced the food sources of Pteropus fruit bats and attracted them to fruit trees planted around piggeries in Malaysia, transmitting Nipah virus to pigs as amplifying hosts and then to pig farmers and abattoir workers. Similar scenarios were seen in Australia where Pteropus bats transmitted Hendra virus to horses as intermediate hosts for human infections. Pteropus bats contaminated palm sap collected in Bangladesh with Nipah virus where fatal human-to-human transmissions occurred annually. Less direct evidence links coronaviruses carried by Rhinolophus bats with SARS and COVID-19 pandemics and a piglet epidemic in China. Rousettus bats living in caves transmitted the Marburg virus (family: filovirus) to miners in Africa. Most cases of human rabies in North America were caused by bat lyssaviruses (family: Rhabdoviruses). Bats are viral reservoir species for various virus families (reovirus, Hepacivirus of Flavivirus family, influenza A viruses). Bats are the only flying mammals which opened enormous evolutionary possibilities resulting in a worldwide radiation with 1400 species. Some bat species are represented by huge populations that come together in extremely crowded resting places that are conducive to viral transmission. Bats have evolved mechanisms that tolerate virus replication but suppress the associated pathology, making them healthy carriers for many viruses. It is speculated that with that strategy bats avoid an arms race with viruses for resistance and anti-resistance mechanisms. The excretion of viruses that are highly pathogenic for other mammalian orders could be used as biological weapons to defend their habitat against intrusion by mammalian competitors, including humans. This hypothesis might explain the increasing involvement of bat viruses in emerging infectious diseases observed in recent decades and expected in the future.",

        "abstract": "Maternity care satisfaction for pregnant women and recently delivered mothers is linked to both short- and long-term complications. For health care providers, dissatisfaction can lead to high turnover, reduced efficiency, and decreased service quality. Increased midwifery care coverage enhances satisfaction; however, the Government of Bangladesh-sanctioned midwife positions are limited to the primary health care level only, not extending to secondary or tertiary health tiers. We aimed to evaluate the impact of introducing midwifery care at secondary-level health care facilities in Bangladesh by comparing the satisfaction levels of both providers and patients with those receiving regular care. We conducted a quasi-experimental study from September 2021 to December 2023 at two secondary-level health facilities - Sunamganj District Hospital (DH) (intervention) and Khagrachari DH (control). The primary outcome was the mean (x̄) percentage score of maternal satisfaction with antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) services, along with providers' satisfaction regarding their working environment, training, logistical support, and overall patient and service satisfaction at both facilities. We screened for eligibility a total of 200 pregnant women or recently delivered mothers who visited the facility for ANC, delivery, or PNC services. The satisfaction scores were significantly higher among women who received midwifery care compared to those who received regular care. The scores were for ANC x̄ = 97.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 96.6-99.0) vs. x̄ = 71.0 (95% CI = 68.7-73.4), for delivery x̄ = 97.9 (95% CI = 97.4-98.3) vs. x̄ = 83.3 (95% CI = 80.2-86.3), and for PNC x̄ = 97.5 (95% CI = 96.5-98.4) vs. x̄ = 77.7 (95% CI = 73.8-81.6). Similarly, the satisfaction score among midwives was significantly higher than among providers in regular care facilities (x̄ = 88.7; 95% CI = 82.9-94.5 vs. x̄ = 77.7; 95% CI = 73.0-82.3).

This diagnostic evaluation study aimed to detect and characterize arboviral infections at the molecular level, focusing on the re-emergence of chikungunya and implications for future outbreaks. Febrile individuals aged 5-65 years old presenting with fever onset within 2-5 days along with other corresponding febrile symptoms were prospectively recruited from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh diagnostic facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 569 of 1,280 screened individuals were enrolled, providing informed written consent/assent. Serum samples from 474 participants underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, revealing 213 positive cases for at least one arbovirus. Chikungunya cases totaled 55, including seven coinfections (six with DENV and the first documented chikungunya virus-Zika virus coinfection in Bangladesh). No infections were reported from January to August, with a peak in October and November. Most chikungunya virus infections (72.7%) had moderate to high viral loads, with symptoms of joint pain, myalgia, and headaches.

        "abstract": "This study seeks to investigate willingness to receive vaccination against NTDs using mRNA-based vaccines in various Asian countries, including China. Between June and December 2023, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was carried out in five countries. The survey assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding mRNA vaccines and their potential impact on vaccination acceptance. The majority indicated being somewhat willing (44.9%), 19.3% expressed extreme willingness. High knowledge scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-2.96] were associated with higher willingness to receive mRNA-based NTD vaccines. Participants from Bangladesh recorded the highest proportion expressed willingness (51.4%), followed by China (15.9%). Vietnam (15.4%) and Malaysia (14.8%). Pakistan (11.0%) and India (11.3%) recorded lowest proportions of willingness. Understanding the mechanism of mRNA vaccines and awareness of the difference between mRNA vaccines and conventional ones are knowledge items that significantly predict acceptance. Concerns regarding potential unknown side effects associated with mRNA-based approaches, and the perception that traditional vaccine development methods are safer, negatively correlate with willingness. Conversely, the belief in the advantages of mRNA-based approaches, such as rapid development, heightened potency, and reduced cost, positively correlates with willingness. High overall knowledge and attitudes scores were associated with a higher willingness to receive vaccines. The younger age group and females demonstrated a greater vaccination acceptance. Overall, the study highlights both opportunities and challenges in promoting the uptake of mRNA-based vaccines against NTDs in Asia countries. The study provides insights into enhancing knowledge and fostering positive attitudes toward mRNA-based vaccines.",

Using data from a randomized trial of azithromycin for watery diarrhea (NCT03130114), we develop personalized treatment rules given sets of diagnostic, child, and clinical characteristics, employing a robust ensemble machine learning-based procedure. This procedure estimates the child-level expected benefit for a given set of covariates by combining predictions from a library of statistical models. For each rule, we estimate the proportion treated under the rule and the average benefits of treatment. Among 6692 children, treatment under the most comprehensive rule is recommended on average for one third of children. The risk of diarrhea on day 3 is 10.1% lower (95% CI: 5.4, 14.9) with azithromycin compared to placebo among children recommended for treatment (NNT: 10). For day 90 re-hospitalization and death, risk is 2.4% lower (95% CI: 0.6, 4.1; NNT: 42). While pathogen diagnostics are strong determinants of azithromycin effects on diarrhea duration, host characteristics may better predict benefits for re-hospitalization or death.

In this circumstance we suggested a Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) sensor for detection of this lethal virus. Our intended sensor exhibits Max Relative Sensitivity (RS) 95.2% & 95% for x & y axis correspondingly when f = 3.0 THz. It also impresses us with minimal Confinement Loss (CL) of 1.06 × 10-7 & 2.04 × 10-7dB/m plus Effective Material Loss (EML) of 0.0078 & 0.0110 cm-1 in that order for x & y axis. Initial detection alongside prompt cures for HIV are made feasible by the remarkable efficacy of PCF biosensor observations in this regard. PCF gadgets offer rapid, non-invasive medical diagnosis, which simplifies the need for further evaluation & allows for an assessment of a condition's progression as it progresses. Precise assessment may be beneficial when investigating advancements that improve worldwide identification and therapeutic choices. It is possible that the rapid identification of these harmful microbes was made possible by the remarkable identifying ability provided by the new PCF. In conclusion, healthcare offers a plethora of opportunity.",

        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) causes severe diseases in humans with a high case fatality rate. The primary risk factors for NiV infection in Bangladesh are drinking raw date palm sap (DPS) contaminated with Pteropus fruit bat secretions/excretions or close contact with or exposure to the body fluid of an individual with NiV infection. During the 2023 NiV outbreak investigation in Bangladesh, the breast milk of a NiV-infected nursing mother was tested by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of NiV-RNA. The newborn was also tested as a suspected NiV-infected subject. NiV, specifically NiV RNA, was detected in the breast milk sample. Through the investigation, it was determined that the mother consumed raw DPS 9 days before the delivery. The newborn was also confirmed as NiV positive and had exposure to maternal bodily fluid while breastfeeding, and was in prolonged maternal contact during caregiving. Although the detection of NiV RNA in breast milk does not equate to viability and transmissibility of the virus, this finding provides preliminary evidence that warrants further investigation into the potential role of breast milk in postnatal transmission of NiV. Our findings advocate incorporating breast milk testing into NiV diagnostic protocols for symptomatic mothers. This advancement will broaden our understanding of postnatal transmission of NiV and pave the way for more effective containment strategies.",

Plasma concentrations of anti-HlyE and LPS IgA were measured in blood culture-confirmed enteric fever cases and in febrile controls with laboratory-confirmed alternative etiology. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that combining anti-LPS and HlyE IgA distinguished enteric fever cases from other febrile illnesses with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. Anti-LPS IgA alone performed nearly as well (AUC 0.92). In children under 5, the combination outperformed individual biomarkers (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94 (HlyE), 0.93 (LPS)) and was most accurate in Bangladesh and Pakistan compared to Nepal.

        "abstract": "Understanding who benefits most from investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) interventions can elucidate causal pathways, uncover complex interactions between population characteristics and interventions, and inform targeted implementation. We applied machine learning to identify and describe households of children that benefited most from WaSH and nutrition interventions. We used causal forests and baseline characteristics of pregnant women enroled in a trial in Bangladesh (2013-2015) to test for heterogenous treatment effects of the primary trial outcomes at two years (length-for-age Z-score [LAZ-score] and diarrhoea prevalence) and one secondary outcome (child development [EASQ Z-score]) for each treatment-outcome combination. We split households into three groups based on predicted treatment effect magnitude and compared characteristics of those that benefitted the most (Tercile 3) versus the least (Tercile 1). Heterogeneity was detected in the effect of Sanitation on EASQ Z-score, compared to Control; children in Tercile 3 were estimated to gain 0.51 SD (95% CI: 0.35, 0.67) whereas children in Tercile 1 were estimated to have no benefit. At baseline, households of children in Tercile 3 were more likely to report that chickens always entered the house (85% vs. 4%) and had animal feces observed in the child's play area (84% vs. 18%) when compared with Tercile 1. Tercile 3 households also owned less land and assets and lived further from Dhaka, any population center, or a market. We did not detect heterogeneity for any other treatment-outcome comparison. We did not detect heterogeneity in any treatment arms for the outcomes of diarrhoea or LAZ-score, showing that children from all backgrounds benefit from effective interventions equally based on household characteristics. We found heterogeneity in the effect of receiving sanitation improvements on child development, where poorer households located in more remote areas and potentially with higher levels of animal fecal contamination had the highest expected benefit.",

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between high-risk HPV (hrHPV) genotype and clinicopathological parameters among the diagnosed patients with both precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Pathology of Dhaka Medical College and in the collaboration with 'DNA Solution LTD, Dhaka', Bangladesh. The study was conducted over a period of 24 months from July 2018 to June 2020. Following informed written consent, a total of 51 women (18 patients with clinically suspected malignant lesions and 33 with a positive VIA test) were included in this study, and all were subjected to colposcopic examination performed by a gynecologist. Ethical issues were ensured in accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. SPSS version 24.0 was used during data analysis. The average age ±SD of the patients with cervical lesions was 41.86±9.84 years with a range from 25 to 60 years. Approximately half of the participants (n=25, 49.0%) were married for less than 16 years and almost one-tenth were multiparous. Among all cytological and histological findings, hrHPV-16 (n=21, 41.18%) was commonest, followed by hrHPV-18 (n=3, 5.88%) and hrHPV-68 (n=1, 1.96%). Two patients had co-infection with hrHPV (16, 18) and hrHPV (16, 51) in particular. However, the rest 24 cases remained undetected. Among the hrHPV-positive cases (n=27), hrHPV-16 was detected in 5 cases while those were negative for intraepithelial lesions. In cervical swabs, 6 cases of hrHPV-16, 2 cases of hrHPV-18 and one case of co-infection hrHPV (16, 18) were histologically diagnosed as invasive SCC G-II.

        "abstract": "We previously identified genetic polymorphisms associated with <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>-positive diarrhea at the locus containing the transcription factor, cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>). Genetic association testing in birth cohorts of Bangladeshi children showed the previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the <i>CREM</i> locus associated with <i>E. histolytica-</i>positive diarrhea were independently associated with undernutrition at 1 year of age. The reference allele for both tested SNPs was associated with lower weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) at 1 year of age (rs2148483: 0.161 reduction in WAZ per allele, <i>P</i> = 0.007; rs58000832: 0.203 reduction in WAZ, <i>P</i> = 0.001). Small intestinal transcriptome data from Bangladeshi and American children revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for cAMP response element-binding sites. DEGs related to mitochondrial function were upregulated in the small intestine of children with the rs2148483 reference allele, while adaptive immune response processes were enriched among downregulated genes. Upregulation of mitochondrial function was mirrored by plasma metabolomics profiles concordant with a shift toward mitochondrial respiration. In mice, global conditional deletion of <i>Crem</i> resulted in reduced body weight, downregulation of genes related to innate immune function, and upregulation of metabolic gene expression in the intestine. Tissue-specific deletion of <i>Crem</i> in intestinal epithelial cells was sufficient to reduce overall body weight and alter intestinal expression of mitochondrial-related metabolic genes but not immune gene transcription. These data indicate that intestinal epithelial expression of <i>Crem</i> is linked to body weight, plausibly by regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, while <i>Crem</i> expression in other cell types influences the immune response to <i>E. histolytica</i>.IMPORTANCEUndernutrition and diarrheal disease are leading causes of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Undernutrition can present as a cause or consequence of diarrheal diseases, leading us to hypothesize these phenotypes share a common genetic basis. Our identification of cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>) as a transcriptional regulator that influences susceptibility to both undernutrition and diarrheal disease in children growing up in an impoverished Bangladeshi community advances our understanding of the interaction of two major causes of childhood illness and offers the potential of therapy targeted to the cAMP-regulated transcription factor, <i>CREM</i>.",

        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV), a highly lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus, displays strain-specific pathogenicity, yet the molecular basis for this divergence remains elusive. Here, we identify N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification as a pivotal regulator of NiV replication. Higher m6A methylation levels on viral genomic RNA and mRNAs are associated with the increased virulence observed in the NiV-Malaysia (NiV-M) strain compared to NiV-Bangladesh (NiV-B). Underlying this phenomenon, NiV infection orchestrates a reprogramming of the host m6A machinery by downregulating the methyltransferase METTL3 and the demethylase ALKBH5, while concurrently upregulating m6A reader proteins YTHDF1-3. Both METTL3 and ALKBH5 bind directly to NiV RNA, with METTL3 installing m6A to promote viral replication and ALKBH5 removing them to inhibit it. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition of m6A modification markedly attenuates NiV replication in vitro and in vivo, underscoring the therapeutic potential of targeting the m6A pathway. Our study establishes m6A as a key determinant of NiV pathogenicity and provides a paradigm for host-directed antiviral strategies against high-risk RNA viruses.",

        "abstract": "Infectious diseases pose significant challenges to livestock production, compromising animal health and reducing economic productivity. To address these challenges, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs) have emerged as promising immunomodulators that stimulate the innate immune system through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), offering a potential strategy for enhancing disease resistance in livestock. This study examined MsST, a class B CpG-ODN derived from Streptococcus thermophilus, a representative lactic acid bacterium widely used in yogurt production, and its role in modulating CXCL5 expression in macrophages. At a low concentration, MsST significantly enhanced CXCL5 secretion in mouse splenocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages, outperforming other CpG-ODNs and TLR4 ligands. These effects were mediated by TLR9 and CD11b<sup>+</sup> macrophages and highlighted the potential of MsST to bolster immune responses against infections. MsST strongly suppressed Abca1 in splenocytes, while the other tested CpG-ODNs increased the Abca1 levels. Although MsST may help enhance disease resistance in livestock due to potent induction of CXCL5, suppressing Abca1 raises concerns regarding lipid metabolism. The dual effects of MsST underscore the need for further research to evaluate broader implications of the utility of MsST and optimize safety and efficacy. MsST is a promising yet complex candidate for improving animal health through immunomodulation.",

Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) generates data on child deaths through minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical record review, and verbal autopsies. Multidisciplinary panels assign cause(s) of death using WHO International Classification of Diseases. This analysis included deaths among children aged 1-59 months enrolled from 18 December 2016-31 December 2023 across six African sites (Ethiopia, Mali, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Africa) and Bangladesh. Of 1517 deaths assessed, diarrhea was in the causal pathway in 240 (15.8%). The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%).

Antifungal susceptibility profiles were fluconazole (13/135, 9.6%), caspofungin (121/133, 91%), micafungin (125/126, 99.2%), anidulafungin (74/76, 97.4%), and amphotericin-B (50/134, 37.3%). Inadequate access to appropriate antifungals (odds ratio [OR] = 11.258; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 1.302-97.310; <i>P</i> = 0.065), the presence of central venous catheters (OR = 3.581; 90% CI: 1.037-12.368; <i>P</i> = 0.090), intensive care unit (ICU) stay (OR = 6.148; 90% CI: 1.977-19.123; <i>P</i> = 0.008), abdominal surgery (OR = 5.077; 90% CI: 1.651-15.610; <i>P</i> = 0.017), deep-seated candidal complications (OR = 4.546; 90% CI: 1.103-18.741; <i>P</i> = 0.079), and decreased platelet counts (OR = 1.004; 90% CI: 1.002-1.006; <i>P</i> = 0.006) were associated with increased mortality. Optimizing therapy for <i>C. auris</i> fungemia involves early strain identification, prompt echinocandin use, surveillance, proper catheter management, effective source control particularly in abdominal surgery, monitoring deep-seated candidal complications, and recognizing thrombocytopenia as a critical warning sign.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a pivotal role in preventing healthcare-associated infections by adhering to infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. This study assessed IPC knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among HCWs at tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. From September 2020 to January 2021, semistructured questionnaires were administered to physicians, nurses, and cleaning staff at 11 tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. KAP components were classified into \"good,\" \"fair,\" and \"poor\" based on the frequency of favorable responses (>75%, 50%-75%, <50%). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices. We enrolled 1728 HCWs, including 526 physicians (30.4%), 934 nurses (54.1%), and 268 cleaning staff (15.5%). Physicians and nurses demonstrated \"good\" IPC knowledge (median 94.8% and 96.6% favorable responses, respectively) and self-reported IPC practices (median 76.2% and 80.4% favorable responses). However, most cleaning staff exhibited \"poor\" IPC knowledge (median 47.3% favorable responses) and practices (21.3% favorable responses). Across all categories of HCWs, the median attitude score was \"fair\" (range 60.0%-71.2% favorable responses). Having a positive attitude toward IPC was associated with increased IPC knowledge (adjusted odds ratio 3.0, P < .001) and good IPC practices (adjusted odds ratio 16.3, P < .001). HCW's KAP toward IPC was found to be suboptimal, especially among cleaning staff. However, the strong association noted between favorable attitudes toward IPC and adherence to safe IPC practices demonstrates the need for hospital leadership to promote a positive IPC culture, in addition to training and resources, to improve IPC practices and enhance healthcare resiliency beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the primary treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), yet its immunological mechanisms underlying variable clinical outcomes remain unclear. This study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of IVIg on regulatory T cells (Tregs), cytokines, and their association with treatment response and clinical outcomes. In this prospective case-controlled study, 57 GBS patients and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were investigated. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg percentages, cytokine production (IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12), and serum C3 levels were measured using flow cytometry, Luminex assay, and turbidimetric methods, respectively. Treatment response was defined as ≥ 1-point GBS-disability score improvement during evaluation. GBS patients exhibited lower CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs frequencies compared to HCs (p = 0.006), which were inversely associated with serum C3 levels (p = 0.003) during the acute phase. At 4 weeks post-onset, patients with normal C3 levels (90-180 mg/dL) exhibited higher Treg frequencies (p = 0.005) compared to acute GBS, whereas patients with persistently elevated C3 levels showed reduced Treg percentage (p = 0.009). Among I VIg-treated patients, Tregs significantly increased at 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment, alongside significantly higher IL-10 and lower TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 levels at 4 weeks. However, patients with supportive care showed no such changes in Tregs and cytokine levels. Furthermore, Tregs elevated significantly in patients responsive to IVIg at 2 and 4 weeks (p < 0.05), but not in non-responsive or supportive care patients. IVIg treatment modulates immune dysregulation in GBS by expanding CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and altering cytokines and serum C3 levels, which are associated with clinical improvement. These findings indicate Tregs as potential biomarkers for monitoring initial clinical response to IVIg in GBS.",

        "abstract": "Candida auris, a medically multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen, has recently emerged as the primary one that poses a global public health threat. Although C. auris was first described in Japan, numerous cases of C. auris infections have been reported globally and clustered in four major clades (I, II, III, and IV). In 2019 and 2024, a potential V clade in Iran and VI clade in Bangladesh were described. Nevertheless, limited pathogenicity data of the fifth clade are available compared to the other clades. This study evaluated the pathogenicity of fluconazole-resistant C. auris clade V and the therapeutic efficacy of amphotericin B in an immunocompromised mouse model, with C. albicans serving as a standard pathogen. The infection's advancement was tracked by evaluating mortality rates, fungal burden, and histopathological alterations. The C. auris clade V strain exhibited the highest fungal load in heart and kidney tissues on days 3, 5, 7, and 10, with the lowest load observed in brain tissue. In contrast, mice infected with the C. albicans strain showed the highest fungal load in the spleen on days 3, 5, and 10 and in the heart on the 7th day post-infection. Conversely, the average survival time for mice infected with C. auris was 14 days with drug treatment, demonstrating that AMB treatment significantly improved the survival rate of mice infected with C. auris clade V. This study highlights the differing pathogenic behaviors of C. auris clade V and C. albicans. Although C. albicans exhibits greater virulence in untreated infections, C. auris clade V remains a serious threat, even at lower colony levels. The improved survival rates in infected mice treated with amphotericin B underscore the importance of effective therapeutic interventions. Further research is essential to enhance our understanding of these pathogens and optimize treatment protocols.",

This review explores how pathogenic microorganisms and microbial communities impact neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, and neuroinflammatory processes, highlighting the gut-brain axis' crucial communication network in influencing behavior and brain function. Infectious agents like bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause disease by causing neurotoxic reactions, disrupting the blood-brain barrier, and activating neuroinflammatory cascades. Gut dysbiosis impacts immunological homeostasis and neural transmission by altering the synthesis of metabolites from microorganisms, such as short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitter precursors. Neurodegeneration and psychiatric diseases are influenced by molecular mechanisms such as toll-like receptor signaling, microglial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review highlights the potential of microbiota-targeted treatments such as probiotics, prebiotics, and microbiome transplantation as novel treatments for chronic diseases. Understanding the intricate interactions between infectious microorganisms, microbiota, and the central nervous system enables the formation of precision medicine strategies to challenge the rising incidence of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Future research should explore causal relationships and identify specific microbial biomarkers to enhance early diagnosis, prevention, and personalized treatment plans.",

        "abstract": "Dengue represents a significant public health threat in Bangladesh, characterized by its complex ecological transmission dynamics. To improve dengue prevention and control efforts, firstly, we employ state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods to identify the roles of eco-climatic factors in predicting dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. We utilize high-performance machine learning (ML) models, XGBoost and LightGBM, combined with explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to evaluate the predictive performance and impact of various dengue determinants in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2023. The LightGBM and XGBoost models were also utilized to predict dengue cases and early warning trends from 2024 to 2030. Climatic, socio-demographic, and landscape features were used to train these models; SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) were used to interpret the results. Between 2000 and 2023, Bangladesh experienced the highest number of dengue cases in August, while November saw the most fatalities. The XGBoost model excelled in predicting dengue outbreaks, achieving an AUC score of 0.89, a Log Loss of 0.64. Key predictors identified by the model include population density, precipitation, temperature, and land-use patterns. Additionally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) provided insights into the model's predictions, highlighting the significance of population density, relative humidity, and minimum temperature in dengue outbreaks. This study showcases the potential of XAI in uncovering the complexities of dengue outbreaks, providing a robust tool for public health interventions. Our AI-driven framework can be utilized to generate prompt and timely alerts to prevent imminent dengue and other infectious disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, hypertension is more prevalent among men aged 30 and older, but a national survey from Bangladesh shows a different trend. This paper explores the differences in hypertension by sex and age among the Bangladeshi adult population throughout their life span. We conducted the secondary analysis using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. This nationally representative survey involved a two-stage stratified sample of 675 households in urban (250) and rural (425) enumeration areas (EAs). The analytical sample comprised 12 476 individuals aged 18 or older (6955 women and 5521 men). We performed univariate and bivariate tests to investigate variations in hypertension across sex, age, and other factors. We applied multivariable logistic regression models and logit-based marginal probabilities to explore age and sex differences as well as their interactions in hypertension while estimating the marginal effects of sex for each age group to assess the significance of sex differentials in hypertension throughout the life course. Our study revealed a noteworthy trend: Women have a hypertension prevalence that is five percentage points lower than that of men in their early twenties. However, this trend reverses in their early thirties, with women exhibiting a five-percentage point higher prevalence than men. After adjusting for confounders and age-sex interactions in women, the odds of hypertension were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.6) in the 35-39-year-old age group, which may contribute to a combined burden of chronic and reproductive morbidity. With rising hypertension and stagnant maternal health in Bangladesh, women of reproductive age face higher risks of chronic and reproductive complications. The complex health system in Bangladesh, which starts at the community level, primarily focuses on maternal and child health; however, some recent initiatives show a shift in focus to address significant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through public health facilities. Considering that more women seek health care from public facilities, recognising common factors contributing to early hypertension in Bangladeshi women enables targeted interventions, model testing, and strategic adjustments to the primary health care-focused national non-communicable disease management pathway.",

        "abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are amongst the most common infectious diseases worldwide, with an estimated 24% of the world's population currently infected. Mass drug administration (MDA) is the periodic medicinal treatment, without prior individual diagnosis, of at-risk people living in endemic areas. The World Health Organization currently recommends MDA for STHs. MDA programmes are complex health interventions; achieving adherence is important to their success. Adherence is influenced by the target population's perceptions of the drug, the programme, and those delivering it. To synthesize qualitative research evidence about community experiences and perceptions of mass drug administration programmes for soil-transmitted helminths. To assess whether our findings confirm, extend, enrich, or conflict with those of a 2022 Cochrane qualitative evidence review of mass drug administration programmes for lymphatic filariasis. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and four other databases up to 11 November 2024, together with reference checking, and citation searching. We synthesized qualitative and mixed-methods studies. We included studies exploring community experiences and perceptions of MDA programmes for STHs in any country, conducted between 2001 and 2024. We included all participants of MDA programmes, regardless of disease status, individual participation, or other demographic information. We also included lay healthcare workers and formally qualified healthcare workers, if their perspectives were clearly separated from those of the general population. We collected data on study characteristics and programme delivery, including country, endemicity, drug regimen, how the drugs were delivered, use of health education and sensitization, and adherence monitoring. We conducted thematic analysis using a 'best-fit' framework synthesis based on a framework developed in a 2022 Cochrane review exploring community views on mass drug administration for filariasis (a parasitic infection caused by filarial worms). We conducted a deductive phase, accommodating our data within the existing model, followed by an inductive phase, during which we explored data not accommodated by the framework. We used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess our confidence in the findings, and updated the filariasis review's conceptual model to display our findings. We included 17 studies, conducted in Bangladesh, Benin, India, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Turkey. Four themes emerged, three of which were identified in the review of MDA for lymphatic filariasis. People weigh up the benefits and harms in their decision to participate in MDA, though some may not have a choice. Outcomes of individual participation in MDA may be positive, negative, or both. The decision to partake is a careful balance of risk, benefit, and feasibility (high confidence). Unpleasant associations become part of the narrative and spread rapidly through the community (moderate confidence). Physical and social barriers prevent some people from being able to access MDA even if they want to participate (moderate confidence). Many people are suspicious of MDA programmes, although trust may be built over time. Factors such as historical legacies, rumours, and mistrust of people involved in the programme affect overall trust in drug distribution and influence whether people choose to participate. Past experiences can have a profound effect on people, and negative experiences are likely to deter people from future participation (high confidence). Careful management of the relationships between people implementing the programme and people receiving the programme is important to building trust over time (moderate confidence). The drug distributor's status in the community is often low, and they are not well-equipped to answer the communities' questions. People employed to distribute the drugs during STH treatment campaigns often lack a healthcare background and in-depth training around the drug or the disease itself (moderate confidence). Some community members prefer distribution from people they know or trust (high confidence). However, others place value on the knowledge or status of the drug distributors, and may not participate if the community drug distributors (CDDs) cannot answer their programme-related questions (moderate confidence). Many community members have ideas to improve delivery and want more involvement in the programme. Although some programmes conduct education and sensitization activities prior to drug distribution, many community members still lack awareness of the timing and purpose of the distribution (high confidence). People value distribution strategies that make it easy for everyone to participate, and express a desire for adults in the community to be included in the programme (moderate confidence). Many community members believe a more comprehensive health campaign, which includes improved sanitation, is necessary to tackle STH burden (moderate confidence). One theme that the filariasis review identified was not substantiated by the findings in this review (Programmes expect compliance: this can result in coercion and blame). Despite the prevalence and undoubted impact of MDA programmes over the past 10 years, endemic hotspots and continued transmission are common, due in part to poor community adherence. The 2022 Cochrane review outlined several key community concerns and doubts that hinder the effective implementation of MDA for lymphatic filariasis. This review shows that most of these concerns and doubts are shared by communities targeted for MDA for STHs, indicating that there are fundamental challenges in the overall conceptualization and design of MDA programmes that need to be addressed.

Despite whole blood being the gold standard for DENV detection, emerging evidence suggests that non-blood specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), may offer a less invasive alternative for diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of NPSs for detecting DENV RNA in pediatric patients in Bangladesh. We collected 130 paired NPS and blood specimens from children with suspected dengue (aged 1 month to 15 years) at Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute. Viral RNA was extracted from both sample types and subsequently detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 130 paired specimens, DENV RNA was detected in 115 blood samples and 104 NPSs. Compared with blood, NPS exhibited a sensitivity of 90.43%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 91.54%. An analysis of demographic and clinical factors revealed no significant differences between NPS-positive and -negative cases. This study underscores the potential of NPSs as a viable alternative diagnostic specimen for DENV detection, particularly, in settings where blood collection is difficult. Integrating NPS into existing diagnostic and surveillance systems could enhance early detection and outbreak management, ultimately improving patient care and public health response.",

This study investigated the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women and cord blood Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity of their newborns in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, and South Africa. Randomly selected paired maternal and cord blood samples (n = 101 each site) taken at delivery were tested for HBsAg and Hepatitis B extractable antigen (HBeAg) in the women using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Similarly, cord blood sample of newborn was assessed for HBsAg reactivity. HBV DNA was quantified using the Xpert® HBV viral load assay, followed by genotyping. The overall prevalence of maternal HBsAg positivity was 5.5 % (95 %CI: 0.4 %-7.1 %; n = 50/909).

        "title": "Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities in urban Dhaka: A cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Most vaccinations in the immunization schedule need two or more doses to elicit a protective immune response. Therefore, completion of all doses is crucial for achieving the best possible immunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing missed opportunities of polio vaccination in children between the ages of 1-3 years in urban Dhaka. In 2018, according to the immunization card records or histories from parents/guardians, we sorted1-3-year-old children from areas of Dhaka South City Corporation who were not fully immunized. Immunization records were obtained from the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) card or maternal recall. Reasons for non-vaccination were documented. A total of 501 children were tracked down to determine the causes of their incomplete polio doses. Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities were assessed by using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model. The households with a child who had not received all the recommended vaccines had a considerably lower monthly income (18,000 BDT; p < 0.001). In both the complete and partial vaccination groups, the average family size was five people, and the average child age was 28 months. Education level of the household head after adjustment (AOR), the odds of the event occurring decrease by 25% with primary education (95% CI: 0.66, 0.85), p-value: < 0.001). Occupation of the household head for rickshaw/van/cart puller, AOR, the odds increase even more, with the event being 3.15 times more likely for this occupation (95% CI: 1.95, 5.08) and statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Again, for daily wager AOR, 2.16 times higher for daily wagers (95% CI: 1.35, 3.45) and statistical significance (p-value: 0.001). This study identifies sociodemographic factors that influence incomplete childhood immunization in this urban area of Dhaka. In order to improve the coverage, the identified factors need to be mitigated and policymakers should focus on enhancing community engagement, combating misinformation and increasing the accessibility of vaccination services.",

        "abstract": "Climate change is exacerbating heatwaves, significantly increasing public health risks, including heightened vulnerability to Vibrio vulnificus infections, especially among older adults. While heat stress alone impairs immune regulation and compromises gut integrity, the combined effects of aging and climate-induced heat stress on infectious severity remain insufficiently explored. Using young (12-week-old) and aged (24-month-old) mouse models, we examined how aging and periodic heat stress synergistically influence susceptibility to Vibrio vulnificus by assessing gut microbiome alterations, immune responses, and antibiotic resistance gene dynamics. Heat stress markedly impaired intestinal barrier function, induced significant microbiome shifts, elevated systemic inflammation, and promoted enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes particularly those conferring tetracycline resistance with effects significantly amplified in aged mice. Upon Vibrio vulnificus infection, aged heat-stressed mice demonstrated elevated inflammatory responses, severe intestinal damage, and pronounced immune dysregulation compared to younger counterparts. Gut depletion and probiotic recolonization models further validated microbiota involvement, showing that Roseburia intestinalis significantly reduced heat stress-exacerbated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunosenescence in aged mice. Collectively, this study provides robust experimental evidence highlighting the critical interplay between aging and climate-driven heat stress in intensifying infectious disease severity via microbiome-immune axis disruptions, underscoring the need for microbiota-targeted strategies in climate-vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Emerging evidence suggests a potential link between heavy metals and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). This study compiled epidemiological evidence from research published over the past 11 years on the impact of metals on AD/ADRD in women. Women have unique risk factors for late onset of AD/ADRD, in addition to genetic factors, apolipoprotein E allele (APOE4), and longer life expectancy. Furthermore, women are twice likely as men to experience depression, which increases their risk of developing AD/ADRD. Our narrative review underscored the necessity of a sex-specific approach to address women's vulnerability to AD/ADRD. <b>Methods:</b> Electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, NIOSH Toxline, and Scopus, were thoroughly searched to identify primary epidemiological studies on older women exposed to metals and published between 2014 to 2024. <b>Results:</b> We identified 34 epidemiological studies that met the inclusion criteria. The findings revealed a complex interplay between environmental metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca) and the risk of AD/ADRD in women. Significant adverse effects were reported for Cu, Cd, As, Pb, and Mn while significant protective effects were found between Se, Fe, and Zn in blood and AD/ADRD among older women. However, some studies also reported no correlations. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, our review identified contrasting results regarding the effects of metals on AD/ADRD in women. Future studies should collect additional evidence to understanding the effects of heavy metals on AD/ADRD in women for developing preventive measures.",

        "abstract": "Replacing oral polio vaccines with inactivated polio vaccines (IPVs) is necessary to stop the potential transmission of vaccine-derived polio viruses. We aimed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a dose-sparing IPV (ds-IPV) with a full-dose IPV in infants in Bangladesh. This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study was done at two field sites in Bangladesh (Kamlapur and Matlab). Eligible participants were healthy infants aged 6-8 weeks, with parents who intended to reside in the area during the study period. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive either ds-IPV from one of the three lots (lot A, B, or C; Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) or an IPV (Serum Institute of India). Three intramuscular doses (0·5 mL) were administered at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks in addition to other standard vaccines. The study staff involved in safety evaluation, study procedures, parents of the participants, and the laboratory personnel were masked to the treatment allocations. The primary endpoint was seroconversion for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 at 28 days after the third dose, assessed in the per-protocol and full analysis populations. Solicited adverse events were collected up to 4 days after each vaccine dose and unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events were collected up to 28 days after the third dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05163561, and is complete. Between Jan 9, 2022, and April 29, 2023, 1072 eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive ds-IPV (n=801) or IPV (n=267), of whom 1052 completed the study. 755 (96% [95% CI 94 to 97]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 256 (97% [94 to 98]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 1 (difference -0·55% [95% CI -3·05 to 1·95]). 744 (95% [93 to 96]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 261 (98% [96 to 100]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 2 (difference -3·83% [-6·48 to -1·19]). 765 (97% [96 to 98]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 260 (98% [96 to 99]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 3 (difference -0·78% [-2·73 to 1·16]). Solicited events were observed in 446 (56%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and 143 (54%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. Unsolicited events were observed in 746 (93%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and 250 (94%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. Serious adverse events were observed in 23 (3%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and five (2%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. The common serious adverse events were pneumonia (n=10 in the ds-IPV group; n=3 in the IPV group), bronchiolitis (n=3 in the ds-IPV group; n=1 in the IPV group), and diarrhoea (n=3 in the ds-IPV group; n=1 in the IPV group). None of the unsolicited events and serious adverse events were causally related to the study vaccines. Delivery of three intramuscular doses of the novel ds-IPV vaccine is safe and immunologically non-inferior to the delivery of three intramuscular doses of IPV, and the dose sparing formulation might therefore become an attractive option for some national immunisation programmes due to lower expected vaccine costs.

        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

As momentum builds to scale up SQ-LNS for children aged 6-24 months in the Global South, a key concern is achieving equity in its distribution and outcomes. We performed equity analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials in nine countries (N=37,707 children) to assess SQ-LNS effects on child growth, development, and anemia across levels of an international wealth index. Benefits of SQ-LNS were consistent across the wealth spectrum, leading to similar improvements in child growth, development, and anemia regardless of wealth.

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium is a cause of diarrhea morbidity and mortality in infants in low- and middle-income countries. A cohort of children was followed longitudinally in a high-transmission-intensity community in Bangladesh. Diarrhea attributed to Cryptosporidium (cryptosporidiosis) decreased from a peak of 0.19 episodes per child at 1-2 years to 0.05 episodes per child at 3-4 years of age (P = .0064). Notably, the decrease in cryptosporidiosis was not accompanied by a decline in subclinical infections. Using an episode-based analysis confirmed that the parasite burden declined with repeated infections (P < .0001 from the mixed-effects model included data from all infection frequencies; Cq value of the first and fourth infections (last reinfection with >10 cases): Cq 28.65 ± 5.533 versus 32.42 ± 4.046). There was also a decrease in the time required to clear a parasitic infection: longer infections (>1 month) occurred in 43% of the first infections compared to 24% in the fourth infections (P = .00017 from the mixed-effects model). The avidity of anti-Cp23 and anti-Cp17 plasma IgG increased in older children who had fewer diarrheal infections (ratio of the avidity index after the first infection versus that in the older repeatedly infected children: 1.81 ± 1.02 for anti-Cp23 IgG P > .0001 and 1.14 ± 0.35 anti-Cp17 IgG P = .0056). Our results are consistent with the development of an anti-Cryptosporidium adaptive immune response over repeated infections (average number of previous infections at 4 years, 2.42 ± 1.24) characterized by an increase in anti-Cryptosporidium antibody avidity that is associated with a decrease in cryptosporidiosis but not in subclinical Cryptosporidium infections.

        "abstract": "Since August 2017, approximately 960,000 Rohingya refugees have settled in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and programs were implemented across the camps to address the needs of the population and reduce the burden of linked infectious diseases. However, monitoring and maintenance of this infrastructure has been inconsistent. This study aimed to assess progress in WASH in the camps of Cox's Bazar since the early emergency phase in 2018, and to update the priorities for intervention. From January to March 2022, a lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) survey was conducted across 19 camps. Nineteen households were randomly selected per camp. Data on access to and quality of WASH services, household practices, and health outcomes including skin infections among children under five years of age were collected. Crude and weighted averages with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each indicator and compared with targets pre-defined based on Sphere guidelines and Médecins Sans Frontières WASH experts. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the results to a 2018 LQAS survey. More than half of the indicators (59%; 16/27) did not meet the pre-determined targets. Performance was adequate on three of five water quality and supply indicators, with less than half of households (44%, 95% CI: 39-49%) reporting that water was continuously available in the past week. Regarding water storage, performance on three indicators was considered adequate, as the proportion of households that keep water for less than one day was 27% (95% CI: 23-32%). Of six hygiene indicators, adequate performance was identified for only one. Performance on the sanitation indicators was inadequate, with 11% (95% CI: 8-15%) of households using an improved sanitation facility. In solid waste management, two of four indicators suggested adequate performance, and for health outcomes, the proportion of children who hadn't shown any skin infection was inadequate at 69% (95% CI: 64-73%). Improvements in the WASH situation in Cox's Bazar have been observed in 2022 compared to 2018. However, significant gaps remain in water supply, sanitation facilities, and hygiene services. LQAS can be an effective monitoring tool to support long-term multisectoral interventions in protracted emergencies.",

High ambient temperatures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality by infectious diseases, but the effect of these high temperatures indoors remains to be studied. This study investigated the effect of high indoor temperatures on the feelings of illness and heat coping mechanisms in vulnerable populations without heat mitigation. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 490 houses in rural villages in the coastal area of Chakaria, Bangladesh chosen through stratified cluster sampling. It assessed the feelings of illness and their adaptative behaviour to high temperatures. There were 49 temperature and humidity monitors placed indoors to obtain accurate measurements of these parameters in different areas and with different house materials. This information was used to determine the effect of high indoor temperatures on the symptoms that vulnerable populations reported. People living in hotter houses reported overall more symptoms, notably, diarrhoea, local site infections and sore throat. Temperatures were higher in houses made of bamboo compared to cement and having shade significantly decreased indoor temperature. Most women in the study reported performing adequate heat coping mechanisms. However, these did not show a protective effect against illness. This paper showed that high indoor temperatures could be associated with an increase in symptoms. Housing characteristics (material and environment) decreased indoor temperature. Having shading and a house made from cement was protective to reporting symptoms. Further studies into the compliance of coping behaviours are needed to assess their potential protective effect.",

This study aimed to assess associations between EED biomarkers and subsequent child development. In a prospective cohort of 2646 children nested within 2 randomized trials in rural Bangladesh (n = 1374) and Kenya (n = 1272), EED was measured by markers of intestinal permeability (fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin; urinary lactulose and mannitol assessed through the dual sugar absorption test), inflammation (fecal myeloperoxidase and neopterin), and repair (fecal regenerating gene 1β). In Bangladesh, EED biomarkers were measured at ages 3 and 14 mo, whereas in Kenya, they were measured at 6 and 17 mo. Child development was measured by Communicative Development Inventories and World Health Organization (WHO) motor milestones at 1 y of age and by the Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 2 y of age. We used generalized additive models to estimate associations between EED biomarkers and child development, adjusting for potential confounders and controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR). In Bangladesh, higher concentrations of lactulose, mannitol, and alpha-1 antitrypsin were associated with worse subsequent child motor development outcomes. Elevated mannitol at 3 mo was associated with a lower WHO motor milestones sum score {-0.22 adjusted mean difference between the 25th and 75th percentile of mannitol distribution [(95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36, -0.08); FDR-corrected P value = 0.03]} and lower attainment of hands-and-knees crawling at year 1 [hazard ratio 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.86); FDR-corrected P value < 0.001]. In Kenya, we observed weak positive associations that were neither consistent nor significant after FDR correction.

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired neonatal infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is unknown to what extent home-based births, which account for nearly a third of deliveries in Bangladesh, may also result in exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We enrolled mothers who delivered at home and their newborns from a rural community in Bangladesh during April-June, 2022. Within 2-7 days after delivery, we collected vaginal and rectal swabs from mothers and rectal swabs from the newborns. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic culture media selective for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL-PB) and carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB). Demographic and risk factor data were collected via surveys. Birth attendants who facilitated the deliveries were interviewed regarding infection prevention practices. We performed descriptive analyses to identify potential risk factors associated with colonization. Of the 50 mothers enrolled, the median age was 23 years (range 18 to 26). Thirty-eight (76%) mothers had at least one antenatal care visit. Only one mother reported hospitalization during pregnancy, and 4 reported antibiotic use during pregnancy. Following delivery, 47 (94%) mothers were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 37 (74%) were colonized with CRB. Of the newborns, 36 (72%) were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 27 (54%) were colonized with CRB. No associations were found with any perinatal exposures, though all households reported incomes below the international poverty level. Of the 9 birth attendants were able to be interviewed, 7 (78%) reported performing hand hygiene before delivery, and 8 (89%) reported glove use during the delivery. Attendants reported cleaning equipment shared across deliveries with soap and water and using boiled water for delivery (89%, n=8). Women and newborns in this rural population were frequently colonized with both ESBL-PB and CRB following home deliveries. This demonstrates the importance of community-based antibiotic-resistant bacterial transmission and need for further understanding community exposures driving antibiotic resistance.",

        "abstract": "Effective cholera outbreak response requires accurate bedside rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) because access to laboratories is often limited. Formative studies suggest cholera diagnostics have multiple vulnerabilities, including antibiotics and predation by bacteriophage ('phage') specific to <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (<i>Vc</i>). We conducted a prospective nationwide study in Bangladesh among over 2000 patients with diarrhoeal disease to characterize how these vulnerabilities impact RDT performance. Assays included culture, qPCR and mass spectrometry. With the current gold standard of culture or qPCR <i>Vc</i> positivity, we found no effect of phage on RDT performance. When the diagnostic criteria were expanded to include phage, there was a small decrease in RDT sensitivity. In contrast, large increases in sensitivity and specificity were observed among patients with moderate and severe dehydration. Using the expanded definition, the odds of RDT positivity decreased among cholera patients with phage exposure. The effect was most robust among patients with severe dehydration. Antibiotic were detected in over 80% of samples by LC-MS/MS which limited testing for effects on RDTs. Applying these findings, we estimated that restricting RDT use to severe patients with no reported antibiotic exposure increases sensitivity by 50% compared to unrestricted use. If phage were a diagnostic proxy for <i>Vc</i>, we estimate RDT would miss an additional 17% of cholera cases. Cholera RDTs have critical limitations that require consideration in global deployments. Inclusion of phage detection in diagnostic criteria may improve case detection which requires further study. The impact of these findings likely extends to other diseases where diagnostics share similar vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Multi-pathogen molecular diagnostics enhance our understanding of the pathogen-specific burden of diarrhea. However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities. Conversely, the absence of a similar response pattern for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, and EAEC is consistent with large-scale studies showing a limited association between their quantities and diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "Currently, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection is one of the leading complications in public health and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), especially in the African region. No specific vaccine is available to combat this, with multi-strain variability being one of the hurdles. In this investigation, we employed variability in the epitope of the HIV subtype C targets to introduce mutations and construct an epitope-based vaccine. Four targets were examined to predict the B and T cells (major histocompatibility complex class I and II). Among the predicted epitopes, immunodominant epitopes were selected and were mapped with the identified variable amino acid to incorporate mutation. These selected and mutated epitopes were used for the non-mutated and mutated vaccine construction, considering linker for fusion and adjuvant to improve the activity. The vaccine's structure was modeled and examined to validate its structural quality, and a high population coverage was also found. The docking investigation of the non-mutated and mutated vaccine with Toll-like receptor 3 shows remarkable activity followed by strong binding affinity, and the simulation of over 100 ns revealed the constancy of the complex system. The immune response revealed its strong effectiveness by generating multiple immunoglobulins followed by the time step of infection, and further, <i>in silico</i> cloning demonstrated a high expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> based on their favorable Codon Adaptation Index and GC value. The integrated approach in this investigation will help to plan a potent immunodominant vaccine that can work for multiple strains of HIV infection.",

        "abstract": "Endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are common causes of mild or asymptomatic respiratory infections in children but are considered rare causes of death. We evaluated pediatric deaths from January 2017 through December 2022. A panel of experts determined the cause of death (CoD) by reviewing available data, including pathological and molecular findings from minimally invasive tissue sampling (lung tissues, blood, CSF, and nasopharyngeal swabs), clinical records, and verbal autopsies. Endemic HCoV were detected in the respiratory samples of 3 % (n = 86/3357) of enrolled decedents: 1 % (n = 12/2043) of neonates, 5 % (n = 35/681) of infants and 6 % (n = 39/633) of children deaths. However, HCoVs were attributed as the CoD in only two cases - both involving young infants with underlying birth defects and severe wasting, who succumbed to polymicrobial hospital-acquired infections involving HCoV-OC43, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Amongst the remaining 84 decedents in whom an HCoV was detected, 82 % (n = 69/84; median Ct of 25.34; range: 15.28-36.17) were deaths attributed to other infections, including 54 % (n = 32/69; median Ct of 23.86; range: 15.28-35.2) with lower respiratory infections determined to be the CoD. The bulk of these deaths (96 %, n = 66/69) were attributed to other pathogens - Plasmodium falciparum (27 %, n = 19/69), K. pneumoniae (23 %, n = 16/69), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 %, n = 14/69), Escherichia coli (16 %, n = 11/69) and Cytomegalovirus (10 %, n = 7/69). Although endemic HCoV was identified in children who died of respiratory infections, it was rarely attributed to being in the CoD. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explore the potential role of HCoVs in LRTI pathogenesis and their impact on facilitating more pathogenic infections.",

However, no validated stigma scales exist for use across outbreaks, and outbreak-specific scales are developed too slowly to guide timely interventions. To enable more real-time monitoring and mitigation of stigma across outbreak contexts, we developed and validated the (Re)-emerging and ePidemic Infectious Diseases (RAPID) Stigma Scales. Field testing and psychometric validation were conducted in communities affected by Ebola disease in Uganda, mpox in the UK, and Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh. Content validity was established through cognitive interviews and expert Delphi scoring. 1008 respondents were included across the three countries. The final RAPID Community Stigma Scale (12 items) captures initial social stigma, provider or authority-related stigma, structural stigma, and enduring social stigma. The RAPID Self Stigma Scale (4 items) is unidimensional. Both scales were found to have robust psychometric properties, including content validity, structural validity (factor loadings ≥0·6), and reliability (ordinal alphas 0·79-0·92). High scores on both scales predicted an increased hesitancy to report symptoms and seek care. The RAPID Stigma Scales are validated tools for real-time assessment of stigma across outbreak settings, enabling responders to design targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and promote equitable care.",

We then performed a generalised linear regression model to understand country-level determinants of dengue-related mortality. In 2024, 14.1 million dengue cases were reported globally, surpassing the historic milestone of 7 million observed in 2023. This figure represents a twofold increase compared to 2023 and a 12-fold rise compared to 2014 (n=1,206,644).

        "abstract": "Early and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is central to ensuring the proper treatment and curbing the transmission of the disease. Despite the significant burden, the diagnosis of peripheral lymph node(LN)TB, the most prevalent form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), has been challenging in low resource settings. To meet the existing needs, the Mobile-TB-Lab study set out to evaluate two innovative approaches, including thermal imaging and recombinase-aided amplification assay (RAA) in Minoo for point-of-need diagnosis of LNTB. The synergy of these index tests is expected to pave the way for rapid detection of EPTB in resource-constrained settings. Mobile-TB-Lab is a multicountry diagnostic evaluation study to be performed in Bangladesh and Uganda. Under this protocol, a total of 200 suspected EPTB patients with cervical lymphadenitis will be enrolled from tertiary healthcare facilities in Bangladesh and Uganda. Each participant will be subjected to laboratory investigations including microscopy, real-time PCR, cytology, culture and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra with the tissue sample following fine-needle aspiration (FNA). As the index tests, thermal imaging will be performed before performing the FNA, and the leftover aspirate will be used to perform RAA in the Minoo device. The diagnostic efficiency of the index tests will be determined against a composite reference standard based on the laboratory methods. Besides, latent class analysis will be performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests. Finally, health economic evaluation will be performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the investigative methods. The study protocol (PR-23031) has been approved by the research review committee (RRC) and the ethical review committee (ERC) under the institutional review board (IRB) of icddr,b in Bangladesh. In Uganda, the study protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University under reference number IDI-REC-2023-62 and approval from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) under reference number HS3494ES. All the study materials and procedures to be used for the enrolment of the participants have been approved by the ethical review committee. The study will be performed according to the declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice to ensure the participants' rights, safety and well-being. The findings from this study will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international meetings.",

A cross-sectional, consumer-based survey was conducted in Bangladesh from September to November 2023, targeting 1100 participants aged 18 years and older across seven coastal districts. Convenience sampling and in-person interviews were used for the data collection. The average knowledge and attitude scores toward seafood safety and consumption were 48.2% and 63.5%, respectively. Several factors influenced seafood safety and consumption knowledge, including age, education level, family size, religion, and residence in coastal areas (all P < 0.05). In contrast, attitudes toward seafood safety and consumption were shaped by education level, family size, employment status, seafood allergies, and history of seafood poisoning (all P < 0.05). The most commonly consumed seafood was rupchanda, followed by shrimp. Most participants consumed seafood for its health benefits, with no significant seasonal impact on seafood consumption. Overfishing and climate change were recognised as the most alarming environmental dangers identified by the participants. Coastal communities in Bangladesh have demonstrated moderate attitudes, but relatively low knowledge of seafood safety and consumption. Targeted educational programmes, including community workshops on safe handling and storage, school-based programmes on marine conservation, and digital campaigns via SMS/social media, are needed to improve seafood safety knowledge, while promoting sustainable consumption practices is crucial for addressing environmental concerns like overfishing. Additionally, improving market accessibility and highlighting the health advantages of seafood can drive more informed and healthier consumption choices.",

Zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol sales are expected to restrict availability and access by young people. This study aimed to examine (non) compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations around schools in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a representative sample of geographic locations in Bangladesh, India North (Delhi) and India South (Chennai), Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the built environment was mapped by systematically walking all streets within the site boundary to collect data on different types of tobacco and alcohol retailers and schools. Data was collected on KoboToolBox, and the maps indicating zoning compliance were created using ArcGIS. Descriptive analysis of outlet compliance to the zoning laws was conducted at the national and school levels, with heterogeneity analyses done by school type, income level and outlet type for tobacco and alcohol. The zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol differed among the settings ranging from 50 to 100 m for tobacco and absolute bans to 500 m for on-premise alcohol. Among the five different settings within the four countries, 441 areas were studied, including 3615 schools. Non-compliance with the zoning laws is evident in all jurisdictions for both tobacco and alcohol. Within restricted zones around schools (location non-compliant with zoning laws), 12-38% of outlets selling tobacco and 16% to 100% of outlets selling alcohol were identified. For supply non-compliance, 3-70% of shops within the school buffer zones were selling tobacco, while only 0.2-1% of shops were selling alcohol. Non-compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations has been observed around schools in Bangladesh, India (North and South), Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Within each country, there was a higher percentage of alcohol outlets that were location non-compliant than for tobacco, except for South India. In India and Sri Lanka, there was a higher percentage of supply non-compliance for tobacco than alcohol. This study calls for governments to strictly enforce existing zoning regulations that are expected to restrict access to tobacco and alcohol for young people.",

Among them, the concept of \"disease X\" has emerged owing to the uncertainty about the identity of the pathogen that may cause the next pandemic. Disease X has gained significant attention due to its potential to cause a public health emergency in the future. This study aimed to investigate disease X, identify the key risk factors leading to its emergence and spread, and propose strategies to prevent future global pandemics. We performed a comprehensive literature review and identified relevant information for this study. Pandemic, public health emergency, and infectious disease were used as keywords for the literature search. Our study indicates that disease X could be a life-threatening or global pandemic. Among the various risk factors, climate change, increased animal-human contact, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance are some risk factors that may lead to a pandemic because they help in the transmission of zoonotic infections. Here, we have discussed some potential pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that are capable of causing disease X. Finally, we have indicated some necessary measures required for the prevention and management of any future global pandemic. Disease X has already posed a substantial threat to the global health system, warranting urgent attention and action. Comprehensive preparedness measures, including robust surveillance systems, early detection, and vaccine development, are essential for mitigating the risk posed by disease X.

        "abstract": "The Dinga Dinga Virus (DDV) has emerged as a mysterious disease gripping women in Uganda, raising alarm due to its unusual and distressing \"dancing\" like symptoms. These symptoms, characterized by involuntary movements resembling dance, suggest possible neurological involvement, though the exact pathogen remains unidentified. The causative agent for DDV is still unknown. We hypothesized that the possible microorganism could be a virus, bacteria, or vector-borne origin. Therefore, comprehensive research is urgently needed to confirm its cause. We performed a comprehensive literature search in Scopus and Web of Science related to the different outbreaks of viruses. We collected relevant information from appropriate articles for this review. The unique representation of the disease is spreading rapidly in localized areas that have the potential to escalate into a broader public health crisis. Preventive measures focused on symptom monitoring, public awareness, and isolation of suspected cases to limit transmission. Authorities emphasize hygiene practices, using personal protective equipment (PPE), and early reporting to manage the outbreak effectively. Simultaneously, global health organizations are being called to collaborate on diagnostic development, therapeutic interventions, and vaccine research. The disproportionate impact on women has brought social and cultural dynamics into the spotlight, as stigma and misinformation exacerbate the outbreak's challenges. Immediate and long-term strategies must address these aspects by strengthening healthcare infrastructure and enhancing disease surveillance systems. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the DDV is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases. Proactive, science-driven efforts are critical to understanding and mitigating this enigmatic disease, ensuring it does not escalate into another global health crisis.",
