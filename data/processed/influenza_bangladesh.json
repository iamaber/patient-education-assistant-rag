        "abstract": "The ongoing global threat posed by the influenza A virus, exacerbated by antigenic drift and the emergence of antiviral resistance, accentuates the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Through molecular docking, this study revealed that mangiferin has a strong binding affinity for the active site of the neuraminidase (NA) protein of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09, with a binding energy of -8.1 kcal/mol. In vitro assays confirmed a dose-dependent inhibition of NA, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 88.65 μM, and minimal cytotoxicity, as indicated by a CC<sub>50</sub> of 328.1 μM in MDCK cells. In murine models, the administration of mangiferin at a dosage of 25 mg/kg significantly mitigated weight loss, decreased viral loads in nasal turbinates and lungs by over 1 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>, and enhanced survival rates from 0% in control groups to 20% in mangiferin-treated group at 14 days post-infection. In addition, mangiferin was found to modulate host immune responses by simultaneously inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, and upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and antiviral IFN-γ, thus mitigating infection-induced inflammation. Our findings elucidate the dual mechanism of mangiferin involving the direct inhibition of NA and immunomodulation, thereby providing experimental evidence for exploring dual-mechanism-based anti-influenza strategies against resistant strains of influenza.",

        "title": "Factors associated with common prevalent diseases in the Sonali chicken farms of the different regions of Bangladesh: a retrospective study.",
        "abstract": "The study aimed to determine the factors associated with the common disease prevalence of Sonali chicken farms in different regions of Bangladesh. A total of 243 farms were randomly selected from four Bangladesh districts to collect retrospective data. The study found that the most prevalent diseases were Newcastle Disease (76.54%), Infectious Bursal Disease (51.44%), Avian Influenza (29.63%), Colibacillosis (22.63%), Coccidiosis (69.55%), Brooder Pneumonia (34.98%), and Ascariasis (20.16%). The secondary group of the education level of these farmers (84.9%), visitors allowance farm (81.9%), and farms in which dead birds are buried (91.3%) have significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of ND. The potential flock-level protective factors of ND prevalence were the visitors not allowed on the farm (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.92; P = 0.024) and dead chicken disposal by buried (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08-0.56; P = 0.000). Farmers who used deep wells (56.9%) and clean feeders and drinkers every 3 days (72.2%) have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of IBD. The risk factor for IBD: the Sonali chicken farmers had no idea about vaccine transportation to maintain the temperature (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-3.13; P = 0.048). Rangpur district (44.8%), farms that used cefalexin (51.1%) on their farm during the brooding period, and the farms in which farmers have no idea of chick grade have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of AI. The farm whose farmer bought the chicks from the hatchery (36.7%) had a noticeably (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of colibacillosis. Mymensingh district (80.0%), male farmers' farms (74.7%), large-scale farms (87.5%), and farms in which wood shavings were used as litter (77.8%) have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of coccidiosis. Rangpur district (49.2%), in farms where farmers were not practicing handwashing (41.5%), didn't maintain routine cleaning of feeders and drinkers (43.6%), and didn't use antibiotics during the brooding period (68.1%) had a higher prevalence of brooder pneumonia. Kishoreganj district (30.0%), male farmers (22.1%), farmers with primary education levels (30.7%), and Large-scale farms (2501-5200 birds) (25.1%), farms using wood shavings as litter material (35.6%), farms sourcing chicks from hatcheries (23.0%,) and farms that used florfenicol (30.8%) as an antibiotic during the brooding period had a significant (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of Ascariasis. Poor biosecurity, improper waste management, inexperience with chick quality & antibiotics used, and missing regular vaccinations make farms more likely to experience disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Between 8 March and 6 June 2025, 365 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) virus detections were reported in domestic (167) and wild (198) birds across 24 countries in Europe. HPAI A(H5N1) virus detections were predominant and mainly located in western, central and south-eastern Europe. Most detections in wild birds concerned waterfowl, particularly swans and geese, but also gulls were involved. Poultry establishments, particularly domestic ducks and chickens, continued to be affected in large numbers in Hungary and Poland. In mammals, HPAI A(H5N1) and A(H5N5) virus detections were reported in a domestic cat, red foxes, Eurasian otters and grey seals. For the first time ever, HPAI A(H5N1) viral infection was detected in a sheep in the United Kingdom. Outside Europe, the United States of America (USA) continued to report A(H5N1) virus detections in dairy cattle, while the virus was found for the first time in a gray fox (USA), a leopard cat (South Korea) and a long-tailed weasel (USA). Between 8 March and 6 June 2025, 20 cases of avian influenza virus infection in humans, including four deaths, were reported in six countries: Bangladesh (two A(H5N1) cases), Cambodia (two A(H5N1) cases), China (one A(H10N3), one A(H5N1), and 11 A(H9N2) cases), India (one A(H5N1) case), Mexico (one A(H5N1) case), and Viet Nam (one A(H5N1) case). Most of the A(H5N1) human cases (<i>n</i> = 5/8) reported exposure to poultry prior to detection or onset of illness. Given the widespread circulation of avian influenza viruses in animal populations, human infections remain rare. No human-to-human transmission has been documented during the reporting period. The risk of infection with the avian A(H5) clade 2.3.4.4b influenza viruses currently circulating in Europe remains low for the general public in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and low-to-moderate for those occupationally or otherwise exposed to infected animals or contaminated environments.",

        "title": "From Bat to Worse: The Pivotal Role of Bats for Viral Zoonosis.",
        "abstract": "Zoonotic infections are increasingly observed and bats (Chiroptera) are playing a pivotal role here. The causal chain of events has been elucidated for Henipavirus (family: paramyxoviruses) infections. Deforestation combined with climate change has reduced the food sources of Pteropus fruit bats and attracted them to fruit trees planted around piggeries in Malaysia, transmitting Nipah virus to pigs as amplifying hosts and then to pig farmers and abattoir workers. Similar scenarios were seen in Australia where Pteropus bats transmitted Hendra virus to horses as intermediate hosts for human infections. Pteropus bats contaminated palm sap collected in Bangladesh with Nipah virus where fatal human-to-human transmissions occurred annually. Less direct evidence links coronaviruses carried by Rhinolophus bats with SARS and COVID-19 pandemics and a piglet epidemic in China. Rousettus bats living in caves transmitted the Marburg virus (family: filovirus) to miners in Africa. Most cases of human rabies in North America were caused by bat lyssaviruses (family: Rhabdoviruses). Bats are viral reservoir species for various virus families (reovirus, Hepacivirus of Flavivirus family, influenza A viruses). Bats are the only flying mammals which opened enormous evolutionary possibilities resulting in a worldwide radiation with 1400 species. Some bat species are represented by huge populations that come together in extremely crowded resting places that are conducive to viral transmission. Bats have evolved mechanisms that tolerate virus replication but suppress the associated pathology, making them healthy carriers for many viruses. It is speculated that with that strategy bats avoid an arms race with viruses for resistance and anti-resistance mechanisms. The excretion of viruses that are highly pathogenic for other mammalian orders could be used as biological weapons to defend their habitat against intrusion by mammalian competitors, including humans. This hypothesis might explain the increasing involvement of bat viruses in emerging infectious diseases observed in recent decades and expected in the future.",

        "abstract": "The influenza A virus (IAV) is an extremely contagious virus responsible for both seasonal flu and global pandemics. Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L., family Apiaceae) is a spice widely used in numerous Asian nations. The cumin fruit, commonly termed 'cumin seed', has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments; however, its effect on IAV is not completely understood. This study investigated the effect of cumin fruit hot-water extract (CWE) on IAV infection. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with IAV (H1N1) and used for in vitro experiments. Pre-infection treatment of the target cells with CWE suppressed M1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas post-infection treatment had no such effect. CWE at concentrations of 12.5 µg/mL or higher also inhibited IAV-induced haemagglutination and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Even, a plaque formation assay was also conducted to confirm the efficacy of CWE on virus replication. The assay results showed that CWE significantly reduced IAV replication. However, the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated antiviral protein genes was not affected by CWE in the virus-infected cells. Furthermore, the presence of cuminaldehyde in CWE was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Cuminaldehyde was not detected in the CWE used in this study. Moreover, cells that were pre-treated with a cuminaldehyde standard did not show any inhibition of IAV infection. The current in vitro study showed that CWE inhibited IAV infection without harming host cells. Thus, CWE may be used to prevent IAV infections by limiting viral attachment and absorption.",

However, this collaboration has not been translated into actionable control policies, which coupled with low vaccination coverage, impose a substantial health and economic burden in Bangladesh. Critical gaps remain in understanding the influenza burden among high-risk populations and the barriers influencing their vaccine uptake. These gaps hinder the development of evidence-based strategies for prevention and control, consequently leaving the country vulnerable to a potentially catastrophic influenza epidemic. These challenges require a multifaceted approach, including continuous local data collection on disease burden and vaccine barriers, vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses, and the design of context-specific interventions. Leveraging existing infrastructures offers opportunities to develop tailored strategies for high-risk populations. A robust national influenza policy is imperative to mitigate the burden and reduce future pandemic threats.",

        "abstract": "The global health impact of viruses highlights the urgent need for innovative antiviral strategies. This study investigated the synergistic potential of two anthranilamide-based peptide mimics (RK610 and RK758) in combination, and one peptide mimic (RK610) in combination with the cationic peptides Mel4 and melimine, against murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus; MHV-1), influenza virus (H1N1), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Checkerboard assays demonstrated RK610+RK758 had synergy against MHV-1 and H1N1 (∑FICI values of 0.14 and 0.5, respectively), while RK610+Mel4 showed potent synergy against HSV-1 (∑FICI = 0.18). Co-treatment outperformed sequential application. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed structural damage to virions, while cytotoxicity assays indicated that all tested combinations were non-toxic in MDCK, A9, and Vero cells, except for melimine and RK610+melimine with A9 cells. Biophysical analyses using DOPC (100 %) and DOPC: POPS (70:30) lipids provided mechanistic ideas into peptide-mimic interactions with lipid envelopes. Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) in conjunction with electrical impedance spectroscopy revealed that both peptide mimics and their combinations reduced membrane conductance, regardless of lipid composition. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) revealed that RK610 and RK758 induced mass addition at the outer layer, significantly increasing with POPS. In DOPC, RK610 increased the surface pressure in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough while RK758 reduced it. The 610 + 758 and 610+Mel4 combinations raised maximum pressures. In DOPC + POPS, RK758 destabilized the monolayer (35 mN/m, no plateau), whereas combinations restored stability. These findings highlight peptide mimics as broad-spectrum antiviral agents that show synergy to target viral envelopes, paving the way for safer and low-resistance therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Although Schinus terebinthifolia (commonly known as Brazilian peppertree) has been documented to possess various biological activities, such as anticancer, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties, its anti-influenza activity has not yet been documented. Here, an aqueous-ethanolic extract (30% v/v ethanol solution), prepared from its aerial parts (leaves and stalks), was established to determine whether it is a rich source of antiviral agents. The hydroethanolic plant extract, with a TPC value of 264.11 mg (GAE)/g DE, exhibits a promising IC50 value of 16.33 μg/mL, similar to that of authentic quercetin (IC50 = 12.72 μg/mL), and approximately 5.34 times higher than that of gallic acid (IC50 = 3.06 μg/mL) as determined by the DPPH assay. This extract contains 1.71 mg of gallic acid (representative marker) per gram of dried plant material, according to HPLC analysis. Using untargeted metabolomics analysis coupled with a series of cheminformatics tools (MetFrag, SIRIUS, CSI:FingerID, and CANOPUS), we ultimately proved that the S. terebinthifolia hydroethanolic extract contains simple phenolics (e.g., methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, and chlorogenic acid), flavonoids (afzelin and myricitrin), dicarboxylic acids, and germacrone. As anticipated, the plant extract exhibited anti-influenza activity with an IC50 of 2.21 μg/mL (CC50 > 50 μg/mL) and did not exert hemolytic activity at the concentration of 2000 μg/mL, underscoring its efficacy as a safe antiviral solution. In silico molecular docking and dynamic simulations suggest that neuraminidase and the cap-binding domain of influenza RNA polymerase (PB2) are preferentially targeted for inhibition by the detected metabolites. Owing to the diverse therapeutic effects of secondary metabolites, the anti-H5N1 activity of the newly developed plant extract is currently under investigation.",

        "abstract": "Influenza viruses are a major global health burden with up to 650,000 associated deaths annually. Beyond seasonal illness, influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a constant pandemic threat due to novel emergent viruses that have evolved the ability to jump from their natural avian hosts to humans. Because of this threat, active surveillance of circulating IAV strains in wild and domestic bird populations is vital to our pandemic preparedness and response strategies. Here, we report on IAV surveillance data collected from 2017 to 2022 from wild and domestic birds in Bangladesh. We note evidence to suggest that male birds show a higher risk of IAV, including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) virus, positivity than female birds. The data was stratified to control for selection bias and confounding variables to test the hypothesis that male birds are at a higher risk of IAV positivity relative to female birds. The association of IAV and A(H5) largely held in each stratum, and double stratification suggested that the phenomena was largely specific to ducks. Finally, we show that chickens, male birds, and juvenile birds generally have higher viral loads compared to their counterparts. These observations warrant further validation through active surveillance across various populations. Such efforts could significantly contribute to the enhancement of pandemic prediction and risk assessment models.",

        "abstract": "Wars have devastating effects on all the components of the One Health approach: humans, animals, and ecosystems. Wars and the resulting migratory waves massively disrupt normal animal health services and surveillance. Among other consequences, they adversely impact the early detection, prevention, and control of animal diseases. Uncontrolled movement of animals or their undisposed carcasses, the destruction of wildlife habitats, and the increased interface between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals contribute to uncontrolled transmission and spread of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. In the last millennium, zoonotic diseases such as the \"Black Death\" were triggered by devastating wars and led to the deaths of a large fraction of the human population. However, also recent and ongoing wars carry the risk of an uncontrollable increase in zoonotic diseases. The most significant zoonotic diseases reported during the recent wars are African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, rabies, leptospirosis, and brucellosis, as well as foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases. Indeed, alarming rates of infections by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> go along with wars, as seen in the current Ukraine-Russia conflict. Considering human migration, foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases are key health threats for refugees due to the consumption of unsafe food, lack of safe water, and disruption of the water supply and sanitation system. This review summarizes the potential factors and some data associated with the increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence and transmission during recent and ongoing conflicts.",

The role of avian hosts in the persistence, evolution, and dispersion of H9N2 is poorly understood in Bangladesh. Hence, this study unveils the intricate role of major host species in virus maintenance and evolution and the temporal and seasonal patterns of H9N2 in Bangladesh from 2006 to 2023. Multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that the circulation of H9N2 in different species and interfaces is significantly influenced by the seasons. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of H9N2 sequences in Bangladesh revealed two distinct lineages: G1 and Eurasian. The G1 lineage split into two clusters, coexisting until 2019, at which point only one cluster persisted. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis of G1 lineage unveiled frequent bidirectional viral transitions among ducks, chickens, and quails. Chickens might be a pivotal source of H9N2 in Bangladesh, with a higher number of viral transitions from chickens to ducks and quails. Quails appear to acquire most of their viral transitions from chickens rather than ducks, suggesting that quail epizootics are primarily triggered by spillover events from chickens. Our results suggest viral circulation in commercial chickens despite vaccination. The vaccination approach should be revised, assess vaccine efficacy, and extension of vaccination to backyard chickens and quails.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, dengue fever and influenza pose serious public health risks due to their high rates of morbidity and fatality. Frequent outbreaks have been caused by dengue, a virus spread by mosquitoes that causes flu-like symptoms, particularly during the monsoon season. Another infectious respiratory illness that varies every year is influenza. Both illnesses frequently co-circulate in tropical areas like Bangladesh, raising the possibility of co-infection and putting vulnerable groups at higher risk. The purpose of the article is to explore the effects of dengue and influenza co-infection in Bangladesh, looking at present issues and possible solutions to this dual health burden. This perspective piece gathers data from authoritative sources, including PubMed, the World Health Organization, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Relevant literature on dengue and influenza incidence, control measures, and co-infection dynamics was reviewed. In Bangladesh, dengue incidence are still on the rise, while influenza infections have climbed, especially during the winter. The country's healthcare system may be overburdened by the simultaneous spread of both diseases, particularly if dengue rates keep rising and influenza cases rise. To lessen the effects of these illnesses, effective community awareness campaigns, vector control initiatives, and early diagnosis techniques are crucial. Bangladesh must emphasize increased preventative and preparation measures, such as better monitoring, public health communication, and vaccine development research, given the twin danger posed by dengue and influenza. To lower the likelihood of co-infection and avert future public health emergencies, coordinated actions are essential.",

Household ashes from various plant sources were collected, and AF was prepared through a handmade filtration system after adding water. The pH of stock AF was measured, and 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% AF solutions were prepared by adding distilled water in appropriate proportions to obtain a wide range of pH values. The antimicrobial efficacy of AF against <i>Salmonella</i> spp. <i>in vitro</i>, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H<sub>9</sub>N<sub>2</sub> <i>in ovo</i> were analyzed. Contaminated eggs were individually sprayed or dipped with AF to detect the bacterial load on the eggshell surface. Further experimental use of AF as an egg sanitizer in routine biosecurity operations in broiler sheds was also evaluated. The prepared AF showed high alkalinity; pH varied from 10.7 to 8.20 and contained a higher amount of K, Na, and Cl. The alkaline AF and its dilution gradually inhibited Salmonella growth and showed gradual pH-dependent antibacterial efficacy. Similarly, AF and its dilution showed a gradual decrease in viral titer against the LPAIV (H9N2); however, antiviral activity against the velogenic strain of NDV was quite steady. Applying AF as an egg sanitizer also reduced the bacterial loads significantly on the eggshell surface compared to untreated eggs. Moreover, AF having pH 10.5 experimentally used in routine sanitization practices of a boiler shed resulted in low bird mortality (10/210), higher body weight gain, and a low feed conversion ratio compared to the untreated control flock. The higher alkalinity of the AF is responsible for the antimicrobial activity of commercial disinfectants. Consequently, we can use AF as a low-cost, effective, natural antimicrobial agent to replace chemical disinfectants.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> To aid in the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), we analyzed the patterns and trends in antibiotic prescriptions for patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), utilizing the WHO's AWaRe classification. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed data from hospital-based influenza surveillance from January 2011 to December 2020 across nine Bangladeshi tertiary-level hospitals. Surveillance physicians collected WHO-defined SARI patient data, including demographics, clinical characteristics, and antibiotic prescriptions. Descriptive statistics and parametric and non-parametric tests were used for the analysis. <b>Results:</b> Of 21,566 SARI patients [median age 20 years (IQR: 1.33-45), 66% male], 91% were prescribed at least one antibiotic. A total of 25,133 antibiotics were prescribed, of which 47.0% were third-generation cephalosporins, 16.5% were macrolides, and 11.1% were beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors. According to the AWaRe classification, 28.7% were in the Access group, while 71.3% were in the Watch group, and none were from the Reserve group. A downward trend in Access group (30.4% to 25.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.010) and an upward trend in Watch group antibiotic prescription (69.6% to 74.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.010) were observed. We identified that patients aged < 5 years (aOR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.44-2.25), who were treated in government hospitals (aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.35-1.57), patients with the presence of lung diseases (aOR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.35-1.80) had an increased likelihood of being prescribed Watch group antibiotics. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study reveals a concerning pattern of antibiotic overuse among SARI patients in Bangladesh, with a growing trend over the past decade towards increased Watch group antibiotic prescriptions. Only one-third of the prescribed antibiotics were from the Access group, falling short of the two-thirds threshold recommended by the WHO. Effective ASPs are crucial to optimize antibiotic prescriptions and mitigate the risk of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "The WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR), with its high population density, is recognised by epidemiologists as a critical reservoir for the emergence and global dissemination of novel influenza strains, making it a potential epicentre for future influenza pandemics. Despite this significant risk, most SEAR countries lack comprehensive seasonal influenza vaccination policies, resulting in low vaccine uptake across the region. This review analysed the latest WHO National Influenza Programme factsheets from the 11 SEAR member states and supplemented this with extensive manual literature searches using electronic databases and government websites. As of October 2022, only three countries-India, Bhutan and Thailand-had established seasonal influenza vaccination policies. Among them, Bhutan and Thailand have policies that cover all five WHO-recommended high-risk groups. While national influenza surveillance systems are in place across SEAR, only India and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea claim full population coverage. Influenza vaccine production capacity is limited to Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. The region's varied climatic conditions and insufficient local data have further obscured the true burden of influenza. Thailand offers a successful model for other countries in the region, beginning with the most vulnerable groups and gradually expanding coverage. To effectively develop and implement national influenza vaccination policies, SEAR countries must close the evidence gap by strengthening surveillance systems to provide accurate, timely data and prioritise context-specific research, leverage existing vaccine infrastructure, enhance public education and finally engage with local and international stakeholders to establish strong international cooperation to support these efforts and improve pandemic preparedness.",

        "abstract": "In a recent study, we used chemical analysis to show that the Caesalpinia mimosoides aqueous extract, which contains a high concentration of simple phenolics, has strong anti-influenza activity. We determined through molecular docking methods that its potential target inhibitor is the neuraminidase. Therefore, our study objectives were to evaluate whether the aqueous-ethanol extract (30% v/v) of this plant species exhibits greater antiviral activity than the aqueous plant extract. The C. mimosoides hydroethanolic extract exhibited potent antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 15.01 µg/mL, comparable to authentic quercetin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.72 µg/mL) and approximately 4.91 times greater than standard gallic acid (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3.06 µg/mL). Through untargeted metabolomic analyses (UPLC-ESI(±)-QTOF-MS/MS) and subsequent stepwise computational metabolomics analyses, we identified the extract as primarily containing simple phenolics (e.g., gallic acid, ellagic acid, shikimic acid, and chlorogenic acid), flavonoid derivatives (e.g., quercetin, taxifolin, myricitrin, and afzelin), and other bioactive components, including dicarboxylic acids and germacrone. The polyphenol-rich extract showed strong anti-influenza activity, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2.33 µg/mL against the influenza A/PR/8/34 virus and no cytotoxic effects, as indicated by a CC<sub>50</sub> greater than 50 µg/mL. This represents an approximately 3.35-fold increase in effectiveness compared to its corresponding aqueous extract (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.81 µg/mL). Furthermore, the extract demonstrated no hemolytic activity, even at a maximum concentration of 2,000 µg/mL, suggesting its potential as a safe antiviral agent. Molecular docking analyses revealed that the identified phytochemicals can simultaneously interact with the \"drug-target binding sites\" of neuraminidase (NA) and PB2 subunit of influenza RNA polymerase, indicating their potential polypharmacological effects. The antiviral activity of the ethanolic-aqueous extract against other strains is being explored due to the versatile biological effects of phenolic substances.",

Type I interferon (IFN-I) is a hallmark response to acute viral infections, and alveolar macrophages (AMs) constitute the first line of airway defense against opportunistic bacteria. Our study reveals that virus-induced IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) signaling directly impairs AM-dependent antibacterial protection. Using <i>Ifnar1</i> conditional knockout mouse models, in vivo antibodies, bone marrow chimeric mice, and AM reconstitution, we demonstrate that IFN-I intrinsically targets AMs to drive hypersusceptibility to <i>SPn</i> following IAV infection. Importantly, we show that RSV and hMPV infection induces robust IFN-I signaling in AMs, coinciding with lethal susceptibility to secondary <i>SPn</i> pneumonia. In contrast, seasonal human coronavirus neither induces significant IFN-I signaling in AMs nor immune predisposition to <i>SPn</i>. Therefore, we conclude that IFN-I inhibition of AMs represents a crucial mechanism underlying antibacterial complications following otherwise asymptomatic or mild respiratory viral infections.",

Physicians play a vital role in promoting vaccination, yet their intentions and influencing factors are not well understood. We conducted a cross-sectional study from June to October 2022 across four tertiary-level hospitals in Bangladesh using a questionnaire grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Hierarchical logistic regression was employed to identify factors associated with vaccine recommendation intentions. Among 972 physicians with an average age of 32.1 years, 40.1% intended to recommend and administer the influenza vaccine. Most (85.3%) agreed vaccination reduces risk, 65.5% desired vaccination for self-protection, 63.5% would vaccinate if available at work, and 85.3% anticipated Ministry of Health support. Male (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5-2.3) and married (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9) physicians were more likely to recommend vaccination. Each unit increase in attitude score doubled the likelihood of recommending the vaccine (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-3.0).

The widespread presence of these viruses in wild birds and poultry and their ability to be transmitted interspecies make them an undeniable hazard to the poultry farming industry. In the present study, we collected fecal and swab samples from wild birds and poultry in Guangdong Province from January 2019 to March 2024, and various subtypes of AIVs were isolated, including 19 strains of H4 subtype AIVs. Further analysis was conducted on the internal genes of the 19 strains. These strains clustered together with high homology to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), suggesting that H4Nx AIV may be reassorted from HPAIV. Two H4N8 strains are phylogenetically related to the porcine H4N8 AIV. Molecular characterization revealed that all viruses in this study were less pathogenic but had potential mammalian-adapted mutations. The transmission dynamics of H4Nx AIVs revealed that Europe and Asia, especially the Netherlands and Bangladesh, may be the centers of transmission. This may be linked to the migration of wild birds. The high migration rates from Russia to the Netherlands and from Russia to Bangladesh may also play a role. Therefore, continuous and systematic monitoring of wild birds to clarify the spatial and temporal distribution and prevalence of influenza viruses in wild birds is significant for early warning of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry and for risk assessment for public health and safety.",

        "abstract": "We continue to struggle with the prevention and treatment of the influenza virus. The 2009 swine flu pandemic, caused by the H1N1 strain of influenza A, resulted in numerous fatalities. The threat of influenza remains a significant concern for global health, and the development of novel drugs targeting these viruses is highly desirable. The objective of this study is to explore the inhibitory potential of terpenoid compounds against the Nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A virus, which is a highly effective drug target due to its ability to facilitate the transcription and replication of viral RNA. In silico research was performed to identify potential inhibitors of NP. Molecular docking studies were conducted to assess the binding of terpenoid compounds to the active site residues of the target protein. The most promising hits were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to examine the stability of the protein-ligand complexes. Additionally, ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) studies and Lipinski's rule of five were employed to evaluate the drug safety and druglikeness of the compounds. Docking studies revealed that the terpenoid compounds bind strongly to the active site residues of the NP protein. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of the proteinligand complexes for the best-hit compounds. ADMET studies and Lipinski's filter indicated that the compounds exhibit desirable drug safety and drug-likeness profiles. This work may contribute significantly to drug discovery and the development of therapeutic agents against the influenza A virus. The identification of terpenoid compounds that bind strongly to the NP protein and exhibit favorable drug-like properties through in silico studies provides a promising foundation for further research and the development of potential inhibitors targeting this critical viral protein.",

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the major pathogens involved in respiratory diseases of poultry, the co-infection rate, and their epidemiological distribution in commercial chicken farms in Bangladesh. From June 2022 to December 2023, 300 pooled samples (swabs from live birds, and respiratory tissues from dead birds) were collected from the selected poultry farms where respiratory outbreaks were noticed. Samples were screened for five important respiratory pathogens circulating in Bangladesh including H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). One-step qPCR was performed using either TaqMan probe-based or SYBR Green chemistry. A total of 140 flocks (46.67 %) were found infected with these respiratory pathogens including 18.57 % H5N1(n = 26), 20 % H9N2 (n = 28), 50 % IBV (n = 70), 37.15 % NDV (n = 52), 0.71 % ILTV (n = 1) and 26.40 % (n = 37) mixed infections were present. The present study also revealed that co-infection of several respiratory pathogens (26.40 %) caused more serious synergistic pathogenic effects and complicating factors in poultry infections. In Bangladesh, for this study, the most common season for infections in layer, broiler, broiler breeder, and Sonali is spring where these infections exhibited a consistent pattern. Nevertheless, the investigation revealed the continuous co-circulations of various respiratory viruses, resulting in a complex environment in the poultry industry. This information also helps raise farmer-level disease awareness to prevent and control the spread of viruses.",

        "abstract": "On January 30, 2024, China announced the first human case of H10N5 influenza infection. Prior to this, human cases of H10N7 and H10N8 had been reported. It is now appropriate to re-examine the evolution and future epidemiological trends of the H10 and N5 subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In this study, we analyzed the reassortment characteristics of the first human-derived H10N5 AIV (A/Zhejiang/ZJU01/2023), as well as the evolutionary dynamics of the wild bird-derived H10 and N5 subtypes of AIVs over the past decade. Our findings indicate that the human-derived H10N5 AIV exhibited low pathogenicity. A/bean_goose/Korea/KNU-10/2022(H10N7) and A/mallard/Novosibirsk_region/962k/2018(H12N5) were identified as the potential reassortment parents. The virus has existed since 2022 and several isolations have been reported in Bangladesh. Phylogenetic analysis showed that H10Ny and HxN5 AIVs in China are clustered differently based on the East Asian-Australian (eastern) and Central Asian-Indian (western) migratory flyways. The H10Ny and HxN5 AIV reassortant strains may cause human infections through accidental spillover. It is possible that another center of AIV evolution, mutation, and reassortment may be developing along the migratory flyways in northeastern Asia, distinct from Europe, the Americas, and China's Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, which should be closely monitored to ensure the safety of the public.",

Little is known about the epidemiology and etiology of viral ALRI in rural Bangladesh. We enrolled 3- to 23-month-old children with ALRIs attending a subdistrict hospital outpatient clinic in Sylhet district in Bangladesh. Trained study physicians ascertained the cases and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs to detect 19 respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR using the Luminex Integrated System NxTAG Respiratory pathogen panel. Between August 2016 and September 2017, we enrolled 1477 children. Median age was 10 months; 58.1% were male. Forty-seven percent presented during autumn (mid-June to mid-October). About a third had temperature ≥ 101°F, 95.4% had cough in the previous 3 days, 72.0% had fast breathing, and 80.0% had chest indrawing. Alveolar consolidation occurred in 23.9%, and 4.4% were hypoxemic (saturation < 90% on room air). Nineteen percent required hospitalization; 79.1% of them were discharged within 48 h. A respiratory virus was identified in 81.8%, majority (75.8%) with single virus isolation. Rhinoenterovirus was most commonly identified (HRV/HEV, 37.9%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 20.2%) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 11.7%). Rhinoenterovirus was detected year-round; RSV was detected during August-November and hMPV during December-March. Respiratory viruses were identified in a majority (82%) of children under 2 years of age presenting with ALRI in rural hospitals of Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "There is a shortage of rapid, accurate, and low-cost assays for diagnosing enteric fever. The dual-path platform for typhoid (DPPT) assay had high accuracy in retrospective studies with banked plasma samples. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DPPT assay in a prospective study using fingerstick capillary blood. For this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled children younger than 18 years, who presented at the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with at least 3 days of fever. We collected blood and nasal swabs, and did the following assays to assess the accuracy of DPPT: blood culture, serological assays for typhoid fever (DPPT assay, Widal, and Test-it), and molecular assays to identify alternative aetiologies (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza, dengue virus, and Rickettsia spp). The primary outcomes of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay for diagnosis of enteric fever. We evaluated the accuracy of combined anti-haemolysin E and anti-lipopolysaccharide IgA readings using the DPPT assay in distinguishing culture-confirmed enteric fever from alternative aetiologies using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). Given the imperfect reference standard diagnostics for enteric fever, we used Bayesian latent class models, incorporating results from the typhoid and alternative aetiology diagnostics, to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay. We also did subgroup analyses for the assay across multiple biological variables. Between Aug 17, 2021, and July 16, 2022, we enrolled 501 participants who presented with at least 3 days of fever. 223 (45%) of 501 participants were female and 278 (55%) were male. 77 participants had culture-confirmed enteric fever (62 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A) and 70 were culture-negative with PCR-confirmed alternative aetiology (34 influenza A or B, 22 dengue virus, seven Rickettsia spp, six RSV, and one participant co-infected with RSV and dengue virus). The AUC for DPPT on fingerstick capillary blood in distinguishing typhoid from alternative aetiologies was 0·969 (95% CI 0·943-0·994). In latent class analysis, the sensitivity of DPPT was 93% (95% credible interval [CrI] 87-97) and specificity was 89% (85-93). The balanced accuracy was higher for DPPT (91%, 95% CrI 87-94) than blood culture (81%, 78-85), Test-it (77%, 74-79), or Widal (70%, 67-73). Assay performance did not vary by sex, age, duration of fever at presentation, antibiotic use before presentation, Salmonella serotype, or sample type. The point-of-care DPPT assay achieved high diagnostic accuracy for enteric fever in a highly endemic community. This assay has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for enteric fever, allowing rapid diagnosis and treatment, and could facilitate more appropriate antimicrobial use.

        "abstract": "Historically, pandemics constitute a major nuisance to public health. They have a debilitating impact on global health with previous occurrences causing major mortalities worldwide. The adverse outcomes are not limited to health outcomes but ravage the social, economic, and political landscapes. The World Health Organization (WHO) stands at the front of the pandemic response, strategizing to contain and mitigate the impacts on humans and the environment. It also intervenes in regional disease outbreaks that pose a threat to global health through strategic technical guidance, resource allocations, and expert support. With emerging pathogens, and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions are currently underway on global preparedness for a potential future pandemic. The effects of previous pandemics underscore the need to improve global health preparedness for upcoming pandemics. The WHO's July 2024 updated list of emerging pathogens serves as a potential tool to foster global health readiness for a future pandemic. It represents a change in the world's approach to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, shifting focus from specific pathogens to adopting a broader family-focused approach. This new list recognizes the shortcomings of previous lists and adopts a more forward-thinking, proactive, and flexible approach to dealing with familiar and unfamiliar pandemic risks, now incorporating 'Prototype Pathogens' and 'Pathogen X' into its risk classification. The WHO has set the pace, developing tools and guidelines for practice. This updated list of high-priority pathogens seeks to gear research and development toward combating and neutralizing the virulence of these pathogens. Recent outbreaks of Cholera, Mpox, and Dengue fever in Africa, Avian influenza (H5N2) in Mexico, Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh, and Oropouche virus in the Americas necessitate intensifying regional disease surveillance Research organizations and institutions must prioritize incorporating these tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies in the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative as outlined by WHO.",

        "abstract": "According to sparse information from various countries, the seasonal influenza virus circulation has drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against influenza viruses. Plasma samples were collected from 311 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The samples were tested for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA and seasonal influenza virus strains (influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria) using a Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HAI). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive but Influenza antibody-negative samples (n = 16) were investigated to determine the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-neutralizing potential against influenza viruses by microneutralization (MN) assay. The SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced using Illumina next-generation sequencing, and an in-silico protein structural analysis was performed to identify epitope and antibody binding similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Among 16 samples that didn't contain antibodies against Influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2), five showed high (MN titer≥20), and six showed moderate (MN titer≥10) capability to neutralize Influenza A. Subsequent in-silico analysis revealed that most efficient binding (>8 kcal/mol) was found between the antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (ΔG) with influenza A/H1N1 HA (Hemagglutinin), A/H3N2 HA, A/H1N1 NA (Neuraminidase), and A/H3N2 NA glycoproteins with -12.4, -9.3, -10.1, and -11.7 kcal/mol, respectively. This investigation revealed that neutralizing antibodies of the delta variant cross-reacted with the Influenza A virus, which might protect against influenza viruses and reduce and shift the seasonal influenza circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings warrant further study to explain the probable mechanisms of this cross-reactivity.",

        "abstract": "The CD225/Dispanin superfamily contains membrane proteins that regulate vesicular transport and membrane fusion events required for neurotransmission, glucose transport, and antiviral immunity. However, how the CD225 domain controls membrane trafficking has remained unknown. Here we show that the CD225 domain contains a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with cellular SNARE fusogens. Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) encodes a SNARE-like motif that enables interaction with neuronal SNARE proteins; mutations in this region disrupt SNARE binding and are linked to neurological disease. Another CD225 member, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), protects cells against influenza A virus infection. IFITM3 interacts with SNARE proteins that mediate late endosome-late endosome (homotypic) fusion and late endosome-lysosome (heterotypic) fusion. IFITM3 binds to syntaxin 7 (STX7) in cells and in vitro, and mutations that abrogate STX7 binding cause loss of antiviral activity against influenza A virus. Mechanistically, IFITM3 disrupts assembly of the SNARE complex controlling homotypic fusion and accelerates the trafficking of endosomal cargo to lysosomes. Our results suggest that SNARE modulation plays a previously unrecognized role in the diverse functions performed by CD225 proteins.",

        "abstract": "Clade 2.3.2.1 of the H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) evolved into several subclades. However, the effect of glycosylation on the biological characteristics of hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) from H5N1 AIVs remains unclear. Here, we determined that the global prevalence of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 AIVs with deglycosylated residue 158 on HA (HA158-) and glycosylated residue 88 on NA (NA88+) were predominant via multiple sequence analysis. The deglycosylation of residue on NA 88 (NA88-) was observed in clade 2.3.2.1a (new) and clade 2.3.2.1e H5N1 AIVs. Interestingly, NA88- was coupled with the acquisition of 158 glycosylation sites on HA (HA158+) in clade 2.3.2.1e H5N1 AIVs from China, and clade 2.3.2.1a (new) H5N1 AIVs exhibiting the HA158-NA88- pattern were predominant in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the temporal distribution of strain HA158+ NA88- was highly consistent with the implementation of Re-6 vaccine in China. The recombinant H5N1 AIVs constructed using a reverse genetic system showed that the acquisition of the HA158 glycosylation site facilitated viral evasion from Re-6 antisera, and the virus lacking glycosylation sites at HA158 and NA88 resulted in reduced NA activity, replication in mammalian cells, and pathogenicity in both chickens and mice compared to that of the viruses with alternative glycosylation patterns. Therefore, the acquisition of HA158+ in clade 2.3.2.1e H5N1 AIVs enables evasion of Re-6 vaccination pressure, and the virulence of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 AIVs is modulated by the absence of glycosylation sites at HA158 and NA88. Our finding highlighted the importance of epidemiological surveillance and timely updating vaccines of H5 AIVs.",

        "title": "Burden of disease scenarios by state in the USA, 2022-50: a forecasting analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78·3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78·1-78·5) in 2022 to 79·9 years (79·5-80·2) in 2035, and to 80·4 years (79·8-81·0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19·5% [6·9-34·1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3·8 additional years (3·6-4·0) of life expectancy and 4·1 additional years (3·9-4·3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0·4 additional years (0·3-0·6) of life expectancy and 0·6 additional years (0·5-0·8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0·4-0·5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12·4 million (11·3-13·5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1·4 million (0·7-2·2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2·1 million (1·3-2·9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1·2 million (0·9-1·5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

        "abstract": "Influenza A virus is a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infections, posing a significant global health threat. Current treatment options are limited and increasingly ineffective due to viral mutations. This study aimed to identify potential drug candidates targeting the nucleoprotein of the H3N2 subtype of Influenza A virus. We focused on epicatechin derivatives and employed a series of computational approaches, including ADMET profiling, drug-likeness evaluation, PASS predictions, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) analyses, and free energy landscape assessments. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed strong and stable binding interactions between the derivatives and the target protein, with complexes 01 and 81 exhibiting the highest binding affinities. Additionally, ADMET profiling indicated favorable pharmacokinetic properties for these compounds, supporting their potential as effective antiviral agents. Compound 81 demonstrated exceptional quantum chemical descriptors, including a small HOMO-LUMO energy gap, high electronegativity, and significant softness, suggesting high chemical reactivity and strong electron-accepting capabilities. These properties enhance Compound 81's potential to interact effectively with the H3N2 nucleoprotein. Experimental validation is strongly recommended to advance these compounds toward the development of novel antiviral therapies to address the global threat of influenza.",

        "abstract": "Reverse zoonosis or zooanthroponosis is the transfer of pathogens from humans to animals. Although less studied than zoonotic diseases, this phenomenon poses significant risks to both animal and public health. The increasing human-animal interactions driven by urbanization, globalization, and environmental changes have exacerbated the occurrence of reverse zoonosis. This review evaluated the global impact and transmission patterns of reverse zoonosis, highlighting the anthropogenic and intrinsic factors contributing to its emergence. The study performed a systematic review and included 91 scientific articles published from 2000 to 2022, covering viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and protozoal reverse zoonoses. This study indicated that viral infections, particularly respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and influenza, have the highest incidence of reverse zoonosis, followed by bacterial infections like tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The United States, India, and Hong Kong are among the most reported regions for reverse zoonotic events. Major risk factors identified include environmental degradation, climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and global wildlife trade. The review underscores the need for enhanced surveillance systems, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stringent regulations on wildlife trade and animal husbandry practices to mitigate the risks associated with reverse zoonosis. Understanding the dynamics of human-animal pathogen transmission is crucial for developing not only effective but also sustainable strategies to protect animal populations as well as public health from emerging infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "<b>ABSTRACT</b>Avian influenza active surveillance was conducted in Bangladesh from January 2022 to November 2023 in live-poultry markets (LPMs) and Tanguar Haor wetlands. The predominant viruses circulating in LPMs were low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H9N2) and clade 2.3.2.1a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses. Non-H9N2 LPAIs were found at Tanguar Haor and at a lower prevalence in LPMs. Starting from June 2023, we detected novel genotypes of clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses from ducks in LPMs. The HA, NA, and M genes of these viruses are related to those of 2020 European clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses such as A/Eurasian Wigeon/Netherlands/1/2020 (Netherlands/1). However, analyses of the other five gene segments' sequences identified three distinct genotypes (BD-G2, BD-G3, and BD-G4). BD-G2 viruses were closely related to the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses that have been detected in Japan and nearby regions since November 2022. BD-G3 viruses were reassortants, with gene segments from other Eurasian LPAI viruses. BD-G4 viruses were similar to BD-G2 viruses, but their NS gene was accrued from contemporary Bangladeshi clade 2.3.2.1a A(H5N1) viruses. The ability of any of the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses to displace the long-entrenched 2.3.2.1a A(H5N1) viruses in Bangladesh is unknown.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has reported > 560 H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and eight human cases since 2007. Commercial chicken farms were mostly affected. Commercial chicken farms across the country use imported vaccines against H5N1 virus; however, these vaccines did not use local circulatory isolates of H5N1virus. Vaccination may have limited effectiveness in chicken because of the mismatch in terms of subtypes and clades. To test this, we conducted a mixed-method study to assess the impact of ongoing vaccination against H5N1 virus on H5N1 viral shedding through freshly dropped feces of chickens raised in commercial farms that exclusively vaccinated or did not vaccinate their chickens. Initially, we collected vaccination coverage data from all active farms in a subdistrict of each of eight division. In each district, 25 vaccinated and 25 non-vaccinated chicken farms were selected randomly for sample collection. All samples were tested to detect avian influenza viruses using rRT-PCR. A total of 5092 poultry farms were surveyed; among them 1284 (25%) chicken farms administered vaccine against H5N1 virus. In total 21 of 400 tested farms (5%) had chicken feces samples that tested positive for AIVs; of these three were positive for H5N1 subtype of clade 2.3.2.1. Out of three H5N1 positive farms, 1 (33%) was vaccinated and 2 (67%) were unvaccinated. The chicken farms that administered vaccine against H5N1 was found protective for the detection of H5N1 viral RNA (aOR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.32-0.48). The H5N1 isolates of clade 2.3.2.1 sequenced in this study formed a cluster with the vaccine strain A/duck/Guangdong/S1322/2010 (H5N1) [Re-6]. The overall low vaccination coverage with low detection of H5N1 virus in commercial chickens makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing H5N1 viral shedding.",

        "abstract": "H9N2 avian influenza viruses have been circulating in Bangladesh since 2006, affecting multiple avian species and resulting in economic losses. The recent emergence of tribasic strains, along with co-infections, has increased the risk to poultry health. Therefore, the study aimed to compare the immune responses of Sonali (crossbred) and commercial broiler chickens infected with tribasic H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus. Following H9N2 infection, proinflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α) and antiviral (IFN-β and IFN-γ) cytokine expressions were observed in the trachea, lungs, intestine, and lymphoid tissues in Sonali and broiler chickens from 1 day post infection (dpi) to 10 dpi by qPCR. Sonali chickens exhibited significantly higher proinflammatory and antiviral cytokine expressions in the trachea at 3-7 days post infection (dpi), while broiler chickens showed lower immune responses. Broiler chickens displayed prolonged IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β expression in lungs at 3-10 dpi compared to Sonali chickens. In the intestine, broiler chickens showed higher IL-6 and IL-8 expression that peaks at 1-3 dpi, while in Sonali chickens only IL-1β elevated at 10 dpi. In response to the H9N2 viruses, broiler chickens exhibited a stronger early IFN-β responses and a delayed IFN-γ responses in their lymphoid organs compared to Sonali chickens. This suggests distinct immune profiles between the chicken types in response to the H9N2 infection. The information sheds light on the function of innate immunity in the pathophysiology of currently circulating tribasic H9N2 virus and could assist in effective controlling of avian influenza virus spread in poultry and designing vaccines.",

        "abstract": "The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has underlined the significance of strict genomic surveillance to track virus evolution and the possible emergence of new variants, particularly in densely populated countries like Bangladesh. This study outlines a strategic framework of genomic surveillance to track the evolution of the virus in Bangladesh between June 2021 and December 2022 through the National SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance (NSVS) program involving collaboration across 4 major institutes and 13 hospitals nationwide. We aimed to capture the variants of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the country utilizing standardized procedures, modern sequencing technology, and stringent quality control, promoting data accuracy and the timely detection of new variants of concern. We sequenced over 2200 genomes, documenting the prevalence of the Delta variant initially, followed by the emergence of Omicron variants BA.1, BA.2, BA.5, and XBB, each affecting transmission rates and vaccine efficacy differently. The clinical manifestations of the variants differed, with some symptoms occurring more frequently in Delta cases and vice versa. Vaccinated individuals were more affected by Omicron cases compared to Delta cases. These variants were responsible for two major COVID-19 waves in the country, each with significant clinical effects. Phylogenetic analyses placed the local SARS-CoV-2 variants within a global context, indicating the Delta variant likely entered from India and Omicron from Europe. This research highlights the significance of collaborative surveillance strategies for guiding public health choices and the critical role of genomic analysis in monitoring virus evolution, shaping targeted pandemic responses. Bangladesh's contributions significantly enhance global insight into COVID-19's genomic evolution.",

        "abstract": "Migratory birds are a natural reservoir for major respiratory viruses such as the avian influenza virus (AIV) and the avian coronavirus (AvCoV). Transmission of these viruses from migratory birds to domestic birds increases the prevalence of those diseases that cause severe economic and public health concerns in Bangladesh. The study focused on active surveillance of major respiratory viral pathogens in migratory birds, molecular identification of the viruses, and their phylogenetic origin. To conduct this study, 850 environmental samples (830 fecal samples, 10 soil samples, and 10 water samples) were collected during three consecutive winter seasons from three divisions (Dhaka, Sylhet, and Mymensingh) and pooled according to the year of collection and locations, resulting in a total of 184 tested samples. Using gene-specific primers and probes in TaqMan-and SYBR Green-based RT-qPCR assays, the samples were screened for AIV and AvCoV, respectively. Out of the 184 pooled samples, 37 were found to be positive for these respiratory pathogens. Furthermore, out of the 37 (20.11%) positive respiratory pathogens, 11.96% were AIV (<i>n</i> = 22) and 8.15% were AvCoV (<i>n</i> = 15). For the first time in Bangladesh, AIV H4N2, H4N6, and AvCoVs have been found in fecal samples from migratory birds through surveillance. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA and NA genes of AIV and the polymerase gene (Orf 1) of AvCoV revealed that these strains share a close phylogenetic relationship with the isolates from wild birds in Europe and Asia. The Bangladeshi strains with Eurasian ancestry might pose a significant threat to migratory birds flying through the Asian flyways. They might also be a potential source of virus introduction and spread to poultry raised on land. These findings emphasize the significance of ongoing AIV and AvCoV surveillance in migratory birds in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "We characterized 15 H5N1 HPAI viruses from different small- and medium-scale poultry flocks across Bangladesh during 2018-2021 based on their complete genome sequences. The antigenic relatedness of H5N1 HPAI viruses from different timepoints was analysed. During 2020-2021, 42.11% of the flocks tested positive for at least one of the respiratory infections, with 15.79% showing influenza A virus, of which 8.77% tested positive for HPAIV H5N1. Co-infections with two to four pathogens were detected in 15.8% of flocks. Phylogeny and gene constellation analyses based on complete genome sequences of 15 HPAI viruses revealed the continuing circulation of H5 clade 2.3.2.1a genotype G2 viruses. In the HA protein of the study isolates, functionally meaningful mutations caused the loss of an N-linked glycosylation site (T156A), a modified antigenic site A (S141P), and a mutation in the receptor binding pocket (E193R/K). Consequently, antigenic analysis revealed a significant loss of cross-reactivity between viruses from different host species and periods. Most viruses displayed oseltamivir resistance markers at positions V96, I97, S227, and N275 (N1 numbering) of the NA protein. In addition, for the PB2, M1, and NS1 proteins, significant mutations were noticed that have been associated with polymerase activity and increased virulence for mammals in all study isolates. These results highlight the need for intensified genomic surveillance of HPAI circulating in poultry in Bangladesh and for establishing appropriate control measures to decrease the circulation of these viruses in poultry in the country.",

        "title": "Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

Among 48 states and the District of Columbia that performed influenza A testing of wastewater during May 12-July 13, 2024, a weekly average of 309 sites in 38 states had sufficient data for analysis, and 11 sites in four states reported high levels of influenza A virus. H5 subtype testing was conducted at 203 sites in 41 states, with H5 detections at 24 sites in nine states. For each detection or high level, CDC and state and local health departments evaluated data from other influenza surveillance systems and partnered with wastewater utilities and agriculture departments to investigate potential sources. Among the four states with high influenza A virus levels detected in wastewater, three states had corresponding evidence of human influenza activity from other influenza surveillance systems. Among the 24 sites with H5 detections, 15 identified animal sources within the sewershed or adjacent county, including eight milk-processing inputs. Data from these early investigations can help health officials optimize the use of wastewater surveillance during the upcoming respiratory illness season.",

        "abstract": "High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 first emerged in Bangladesh in 2007. Despite the use of vaccines in chickens since 2012 to control HPAI, HPAI H5Nx viruses have continued to infect poultry, and wild birds, resulting in notable mass mortalities in house crows (<i>Corvus splendens</i>). The first HPAI H5Nx viruses in Bangladesh belonged to clade 2.2.2, followed by clade 2.3.4.2 and 2.3.2.1 viruses in 2011. After the implementation of chicken vaccination in 2012, these viruses were mostly replaced by clade 2.3.2.1a viruses and more recently clade 2.3.4.4b and h viruses. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogenetic history of HPAI H5Nx viruses in Bangladesh to evaluate the role of major host species in the maintenance and evolution of HPAI H5Nx virus in Bangladesh and reveal the role of heavily impacted crows in virus epidemiology. Epizootic waves caused by HPAI H5N1 and H5N6 viruses amongst house crows occurred annually in winter. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis of clade 2.3.2.1a revealed frequent bidirectional viral transitions between domestic ducks, chickens, and house crows that was markedly skewed towards ducks; domestic ducks might be the source, or reservoir, of HPAI H5Nx in Bangladesh, as the number of viral transitions from ducks to chickens and house crows was by far more numerous than the other transitions. Our results suggest viral circulation in domestic birds despite vaccination, with crow epizootics acting as a sentinel. The vaccination strategy needs to be updated to use more effective vaccinations, assess vaccine efficacy, and extension of vaccination to domestic ducks, the key reservoir.",

Due to lack of sufficient information regarding such carriage, this study was conducted to explore the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility, and genomic profiles of <i>S. aureus</i> isolated from nasopharyngeal samples of 163 randomly selected asymptomatic Bangladeshi children aged from 5-<15 years. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern and genomic analysis of the samples were conducted using standard microbiological methods and genomic tools.

        "abstract": "The prevalence of avian influenza viruses is commonly found to increase dramatically as birds are transported from farms to live bird markets. Viral transmission dynamics along marketing chains are, however, poorly understood. To address this gap, we implemented a controlled field experiment altering chicken supply to a live bird market in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Broilers and backyard chickens traded along altered (intervention) and conventional (control) marketing chains were tested for avian influenza viruses at different time points. Upon arrival at the live bird market, the odds of detecting avian influenza viruses did not differ between control and intervention groups. However, 12 h later, intervention group odds were lower, particularly for broilers, indicating that viral shedding in live bird markets resulted partly from infections occurring during transport and trade. Curtailing avian influenza virus prevalence in live bird markets requires mitigating risk in marketing chain nodes preceding chickens' delivery at live bird markets.",

Having originated in farmed poultry, H5N1 viruses are now spread globally by wild birds, with transmission to many mammal and avian species, resulting in 2024 in transmission among dairy cattle with associated human cases. These ecological changes pose challenges to mitigating the impacts of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza on wildlife, ecosystems, domestic animals, food security, and humans. H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza highlights the need for One Health approaches to pandemic prevention and preparedness, emphasising multisectoral collaborations among animal, environmental, and public health sectors. Action is needed to reduce future pandemic risks by preventing transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza among domestic and wild animals and people, focusing on upstream drivers of outbreaks, and ensuring rapid responses and risk assessments for zoonotic outbreaks.

        "abstract": "Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is responsible for causing infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), which is a rapidly spreading and extremely transmissible disease in chickens. The current research aims to isolate and characterize ILTV from layer chickens in Bangladesh. A total of 345 samples (trachea, larynx, and lungs) were collected from ILT-suspected dead and sick layer chickens of 32 ILT-suspected farms in three different outbreak districts (Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh) of Bangladesh during the outbreak year 2021-2022. Rapid detection kits examined the samples for avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). ILTV-specific primers were used to screen 72 NDV- and AIV-negative samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), the study isolated the ILT virus from 9 to 10-day-old seronegative embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) using selected PCR-positive samples. The virus was confirmed using nucleotide sequencing, agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGIDT), viral neutralization test (VNT), and pathogenicity evaluations using mortality index for chicken embryos (MICEs) and intra-tracheal pathogenicity index (ITPI). The results indicated that among the PCR-positive 10 samples, only two (Alim_ILT_1001 and Alim_ILT_1,000) were found positive using ECEs. There were two field isolates of ILTVs, as shown by the amplicon size of the ICP4 gene-based PCR. A phylogenetic study of the ICP4 gene revealed that the recent isolates have a close similarity with the ILTV isolates of Turkey, Bangladesh, and Australia. AGIDT revealed strong precipitation lines due to ILTV-specific antibodies reacting with field viruses, while VNT neutralized both isolates with conventional ILTV antibodies. The pathogenicity testing indicated that Alim_ILT_1001 had MICE and ITPI values of 0.77 and 0.63, whereas Alim_ILT_1,000 had 0.71 and 0.57. Both the ILTV isolates have similarities with the isolates of Turkey, Bangladesh, and Australia, and they are highly virulent for chickens.",

We implemented a modelling study to determine the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in each of five high-risk groups (pregnant women, children under five years of age, adults with underlying health conditions, older adults (≥60 years), and healthcare personnel) to inform policy decisions on risk group prioritisation for influenza vaccination in Bangladesh. We implemented a Markov decision-analytic model to estimate the impact of influenza vaccination for each target risk group. We obtained model inputs from hospital-based influenza surveillance data, unpublished surveys, and published literature (preferentially from studies in Bangladesh, followed by regional and global ones). We used quality-adjusted life years (QALY) as the health outcome of interest. We also estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each risk group by comparing the costs and QALY of vaccinating compared to not vaccinating each group, where the ICER represents the additional cost needed to achieve one year of additional QALY from a given intervention. We considered a willingness-to-pay threshold (ICER) of less than one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as highly cost-effective and of one to three times GDP per capita as cost-effective (per WHO standard). For Bangladesh, this threshold ranges between USD 2462 and USD 7386. The estimated ICERs were USD -99, USD -87, USD -4, USD 792, and USD 229 per QALY gained for healthcare personnel, older adults (≥60), children aged less than five years, adults with comorbid conditions, and pregnant women, respectively. For all risk groups, ICERs were below the WHO willingness-to-pay threshold for Bangladesh. Vaccinating pregnant women and adults with comorbid conditions was highly cost-effective per additional life year gained, while vaccinating healthcare personnel, older adults (≥60), and children under five years were cost-saving per additional life year gained. Influenza vaccination to all target risk groups in Bangladesh would be either cost-saving or cost-effective, per WHO guidelines of GDP-based thresholds.",

This study aimed to estimate post-discharge mortality rates among patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Bangladesh, identify associated factors, and document reported causes of death. From January 2012 to December 2019, we conducted follow-up calls to patients or their families 30 days after discharge to assess the status of patients with SARI. Proportions of deaths within 30 days of discharge were estimated, and a comparative analysis of demographics, clinical characteristics, and influenza illness between decedents and survivors was performed using multivariable Cox regression models. Among 23,360 patients with SARI (median age: 20 years, IQR: 1.5-48, 65% male), 351 (1.5%) died during hospitalisation. Of 23,009 patients alive at discharge, 20,044 (87%) were followed, with 633 (3.2%) deaths within 30 days of discharge. In children (<18 years), difficulty breathing (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.0), longer hospital stay (aHR 1.1; 95% CI 1.1-1.1), and heart diseases (aHR 8.5; 95% CI 3.2-23.1) were associated with higher post-discharge death risk. Among adults (≥18 years), difficulty breathing (aHR 2.3; 95% CI 1.7-3.0), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.2), and intensive care unit admission (aHR 5.2; 95% CI 1.9-14.0) were linked to elevated post-discharge death risk. Influenza virus was detected in 13% (46/351) of in-hospital SARI deaths and 10% (65/633) of post-discharge SARI deaths. Nearly one in twenty patients with SARI died during hospitalisation or within 1 month of discharge, with two-thirds of deaths occurring post-discharge. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended to mitigate influenza-associated mortality. To enhance post-discharge outcomes, hospitals should consider developing safe-discharge algorithms, reinforcing post-discharge care plans, and establishing outpatient monitoring for recently discharged patients.

We assess whether COVID-19 had transitioned from pandemic to endemic at the point the World Health Organization (WHO) ended the public health emergency status for COVID-19 on May 5, 2023. First, we aim to measure whether there was an expansion or contraction in the pandemic in South Asia around the WHO declaration. Second, we use dynamic and genomic surveillance methods to describe the history of the pandemic in the region and situate the window of the WHO declaration within the broader history. Third, we aim to provide historical context for the course of the pandemic in South Asia. In addition to updating the traditional surveillance data and dynamic panel estimates from our original study, this study used data on sequenced SARS-CoV-2 variants from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) to identify the appearance and duration of variants of concern. We used Nextclade nomenclature to collect clade designations from sequences and Pangolin nomenclature for lineage designations of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we conducted a 1-sided t test to determine whether regional weekly speed or transmission rate per 100,000 population was greater than an outbreak threshold of 10. We ran the test iteratively with 6 months of data across the sample period. Speed for the region had remained below the outbreak threshold for over a year by the time of the WHO declaration. Acceleration and jerk were also low and stable. While the 1-day persistence coefficients remained statistically significant and positive (1.168), the 7-day persistence coefficient was negative (-0.185), suggesting limited cluster effects in which cases on a given day predict cases 7 days forward. Furthermore, the shift parameters for either of the 2 most recent weeks around May 5, 2023, did not indicate any overall change in the persistence measure around the time of the WHO declaration. From December of 2021 onward, Omicron was the predominant variant of concern in sequenced viral samples. The rolling t test of speed equal to 10 was statistically insignificant across the entire pandemic. While COVID-19 continued to circulate in South Asia, the rate of transmission had remained below the outbreak threshold for well over a year ahead of the WHO declaration. COVID-19 is endemic in the region and no longer reaches the threshold of the pandemic definition. Both standard and enhanced surveillance metrics confirm that the pandemic had ended by the time of the WHO declaration. Prevention policies should be a focus ahead of future pandemics. On that point, policy should emphasize an epidemiological task force with widespread testing and a contact-tracing system.",

        "abstract": "Avian influenza virus (AIV) is of major concern to livestock, wildlife, and human health. In many countries in the world, including Bangladesh, AIV is endemic in poultry, requiring improving biosecurity. In Bangladesh, we investigated how variation in biosecurity practices in commercial chicken farms affected their AIV infection status to help guide AIV mitigation strategies. We collected pooled fecal swabs from 225 farms and tested the samples for the AIV matrix gene followed by H5, H7, and H9 subtyping using rRT-PCR. We found that 39.6% of chicken farms were AIV positive, with 13% and 14% being positive for subtypes H5 and H9, respectively. Using a generalized linear mixed effects model, we identified as many as 12 significant AIV risk factors. Two major factors promoting AIV risk that cannot be easily addressed in the short term were farm size and the proximity of the farm to a live bird market. However, the other ten significant determinants of AIV risk can be more readily addressed, of which the most important ones were limiting access by visitors (reducing predicted AIV risk from 42 to 6%), isolation and treatment of sick birds (42 to 7%), prohibiting access of vehicles to poultry sheds (38 to 8%), improving hand hygiene (from 42 to 9%), not sharing farm workers across farms (37 to 8%), and limiting access by wild birds to poultry sheds (37 to 8%). Our findings can be applied to developing practical and cost-effective measures that significantly decrease the prevalence of AIV in chicken farms. Notably, in settings with limited resources, such as Bangladesh, these measures can help governments strengthen biosecurity practices in their poultry industry to limit and possibly prevent the spread of AIV.",

        "abstract": "Global influenza-associated acute respiratory infections contribute to 3-5 million severe illnesses requiring hospitalization annually, with 90% of hospitalizations occurring among children < 5 years in developing countries. In Bangladesh, the inadequate availability of nationally representative, robust estimates of influenza-associated hospitalizations limits allocation of resources for prevention and control measures. This study used data from the hospital-based influenza surveillance (HBIS) system in Bangladesh from 2010 to 2019 and healthcare utilization surveys to determine hospital utilization patterns in the catchment area. We estimated annual influenza-associated hospitalization numbers and rates for all age groups in Bangladesh using WHO methods, adjusted for a 6-day-a-week enrollment schedule, selective testing of specimens from children under five, and healthcare-seeking behavior, based on the proportion of symptomatic community participants seeking healthcare within the past week. We then estimated national hospitalization rates by multiplying age-specific hospitalization rates with the corresponding annual national census population. Annual influenza-associated hospitalization rates per 100,000 population for all ages ranged from 31 (95% CI: 27-36) in 2011 to 139 (95% CI: 130-149) in 2019. Children < 5 years old had the highest rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, ranging from 114 (95% CI: 90-138) in 2011 to 529 (95% CI: 481-578) in 2019, followed by adults aged ≥ 65 years with rates ranging from 46 (95% CI: 34-57) in 2012 to 252 (95% CI: 213-292) in 2019. The national hospitalization estimates for all ages during 2010-2019 ranged from 47,891 to 236,380 per year. The impact of influenza-associated hospitalizations in Bangladesh may be considerable, particularly for young children and older adults. Targeted interventions, such as influenza vaccination for these age groups, should be prioritized and evaluated.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing battle against viral pandemics continues, with the possibility of future outbreaks. The search for effective antiviral compounds that can combat a diverse range of viruses continues to be a focal point of research. This study investigated the efficacy of two natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (lactoferricin and LL-37), two synthetic AMPs (melimine and Mel4), and nine AMP mimics (758, 1091, 1096, 1083, 610, NAPL, 3-BIPL, 4-BIPL, and Sau-22) against influenza A virus strains H1N1 and H3N2, human adenovirus 5 (HAdV-5), and murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1). These compounds were tested using virus pre-treatment, cell pre-treatment, or post-cell entry treatment assays, electron microscopy, and circular dichroism (CD), alongside evaluations of cytotoxicity against the host cells. After virus pre-treatment, the AMP mimics 610 and Sau-22 had relatively low IC<sub>50</sub> values for influenza strains H1N1 (2.35 and 6.93 µM, respectively) and H3N2 (3.7 and 5.34 µM, respectively). Conversely, natural and synthetic AMPs were not active against these strains. For the non-enveloped viruses, the AMP Mel4 and mimic 1083 had moderate activity against HAdV-5 (Mel4 IC<sub>50</sub> = 47.4 µM; 1083 IC<sub>50</sub> = 47.2 µM), whereas all AMPs, but none of the mimics, were active against norovirus (LL-37 IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.2 µM; lactoferricin IC<sub>50</sub> = 23.18 µM; melimine IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.8 µM; Mel4 IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.6 µM). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the mimics targeted the outer envelope of influenza viruses, while the AMPs targeted the capsid of non-enveloped viruses. CD showed that Mel4 adopted an α-helical structure in a membrane mimetic environment, but mimic 758 remained unstructured. The diverse activity against different virus groups is probably influenced by charge, hydrophobicity, size, and, in the case of natural and synthetic AMPs, their secondary structure. These findings underscore the potential of peptides and mimics as promising candidates for antiviral therapeutics against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.",

        "abstract": "Several studies imply that influenza and other respiratory illnesses could lead to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but data from low-income countries are scarce. We investigated the prevalence of recent respiratory illnesses and confirmed influenza in AMI patients, while also exploring their relationship with infarction severity as defined by ST-elevation MI (STEMI) or high troponin levels. This cross-sectional study, held at a Dhaka tertiary hospital from May 2017 to October 2018, involved AMI inpatients. The study examined self-reported clinical respiratory illnesses (CRI) in the week before AMI onset and confirmed influenza using baseline real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Of 744 patients, 11.3% reported a recent CRI, most prominently during the 2017 influenza season (35.7%). qRT-PCR testing found evidence of influenza in 1.5% of 546 patients, with all positives among STEMI cases. Frequencies of CRI were higher in patients with STEMI and in those with high troponin levels, although these relationships were not statistically significant after adjusting for other variables. The risk of STEMI was significantly greater during influenza seasons in the unadjusted analysis (relative risk: 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.18), however, this relationship was not significant in the adjusted analysis (adjusted relative risk: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.91-1.16). In Bangladesh, many AMI patients had a recent respiratory illness history, with some showing evidence of influenza. However, these illnesses showed no significant relationship to AMI severity. Further research is needed to understand these relationships better and to investigate the potential benefits of infection control measures and influenza vaccinations in reducing AMI incidence.",

A systematic review with meta-analysis was designed to appraise all the available evidence on RSV infections among individuals in refugee camps. Three medical databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) as well as the preprint repository medRxiv.org were searched for eligible observational studies, and the collected cases were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Funnel plots and a regression analysis were calculated for analyzing reporting bias. Eventually, six studies were retrieved from three areas (Bangladesh, Thailand, and Kenya), with pooled estimates of 129.704 cases per 1000 samples (95% CI 66.393 to 237.986) for RSV compared to 110.287 per 1000 people for influenza A (95% CI 73.186 to 162.889), 136.398 cases per 1000 people (95% CI 84.510 to 212.741) for human adenovirus (HAdV), 69.553 per 1000 people (95% CI 49.802 to 96.343) for parainfluenzavirus (PIFV), and 60.338 per 1000 people (95% CI 31.933 to 111.109) for human metapneumovirus (hMPV).

        "abstract": "Airborne diseases due to climate change pose significant public health challenges in Bangladesh. Little was known about the spatio-temporal pattern of airborne diseases at the district level in the country. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern and associated meteorological factors of airborne diseases in Bangladesh using exploratory analysis and spatial regression models. This study used district-level reported cases of airborne diseases (meningococcal, measles, mumps, influenza, tuberculosis, and encephalitis) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) from 2017 to 2020. Geospatial mapping and spatial error regression models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 to 2020, a total of 315 meningococcal, 5159 measles, 1341 mumps, 346 influenza, 4664 tuberculosis, and 229 encephalitis cases were reported in Bangladesh. Among airborne diseases, measles demonstrated the highest prevalence, featuring a higher incidence rate in the coastal Bangladeshi districts of Lakshmipur, Patuakhali, and Cox's Bazar, as well as in Maulvibazar and Bandarban districts from 2017 to 2020. In contrast, tuberculosis (TB) emerged as the second most prevalent disease, with a higher incidence rate observed in districts such as Khagrachhari, Rajshahi, Tangail, Bogra, and Sherpur. The spatial error regression model revealed that among climate variables, mean (<i>β</i> = 9.56, standard error [SE]: 3.48) and maximum temperature (<i>β</i> = 1.19, SE: 0.40) were significant risk factors for airborne diseases in Bangladesh. Maximum temperature positively influenced measles (<i>β</i> = 2.74, SE: 1.39), whereas mean temperature positively influenced both meningococcal (<i>β</i> = 5.57, SE: 2.50) and mumps (<i>β</i> = 11.99, SE: 3.13) diseases. The findings from the study provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat airborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries.

A tightly controlled host immune response is critical to avoid any detrimental effects of IAV infection. It is critical to investigate the association between the response of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and influenza virus. Because TLRs may act as a double-edged sword, a balanced TLR response is critical for the overall benefit of the host. Consequently, a thorough understanding of the TLR response is essential for targeting TLRs as a novel therapeutic and prophylactic intervention. To date, a limited number of studies have assessed TLR and IAV interactions. Therefore, further research on TLR interactions in IAV infection should be conducted to determine their role in host-virus interactions in disease causation or clearance of the virus. Although influenza virus vaccines are available, they have limited efficacy, which should be enhanced to improve their efficacy. In this study, we discuss the current status of our understanding of the TLR response in IAV infection and the strategies adopted by IAVs to avoid TLR-mediated immune surveillance, which may help in devising new therapeutic or preventive strategies. Furthermore, recent advances in the use of TLR agonists as vaccine adjuvants to enhance influenza vaccine efficacy are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Although the drivers of influenza have been well studied in high-income settings in temperate regions, many open questions remain about the burden, seasonality, and drivers of influenza dynamics in the tropics. In temperate climates, the inverse relationship between specific humidity and transmission can explain much of the observed temporal and spatial patterns of influenza outbreaks. Yet, this relationship fails to explain seasonality, or lack there-of, in tropical and subtropical countries. Here, we analyzed eight years of influenza surveillance data from 12 locations in Bangladesh to quantify the role of climate in driving disease dynamics in a tropical setting with a distinct rainy season. We find strong evidence for a nonlinear bimodal relationship between specific humidity and influenza transmission in Bangladesh, with highest transmission occurring for relatively low and high specific humidity values. We simulated influenza burden under current and future climate in Bangladesh using a mathematical model with a bimodal relationship between humidity and transmission, and decreased transmission at very high temperatures, while accounting for changes in population immunity. The climate-driven mechanistic model can accurately capture both the temporal and spatial variation in influenza activity observed across Bangladesh, highlighting the usefulness of mechanistic models for low-income countries with inadequate surveillance. By using climate model projections, we also highlight the potential impact of climate change on influenza dynamics in the tropics and the public health consequences.",

We analyzed the data from a randomized vaccine trial in Bangladesh to identify and assess the effect of risk factors on infant morbidity. Pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and the infants were randomly assigned to receive 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Hib conjugate vaccine at week 6, 10 and 14. The data were collected from August 2004 through December 2005. Each pair of infant and mother were followed for 24 weeks after birth with weekly visits. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measurements and Poisson regression models were used to identify the risk factors and evaluate their effect on the longitudinal incidence and total number of episodes of respiratory illness with fever (RIF), diarrhea disease, ear problem and pneumonia. A total of 340 pregnant women were randomized with mean age of 25 years. The baseline mother and infant characteristics were similar between two treatment groups. Exclusive breastfeeding and higher paternal education level were common factors associated with lower infant morbidity of RIF (adjusted OR = 0.40 and 0.94 with p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively), diarrhea disease (adjusted OR = 0.39 and 0.95 with p < 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively), and ear problem (adjusted OR = 0.20 and 0.76 with p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively).

        "abstract": "H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are a major concern for the poultry sector and human health in countries where this subtype is endemic. By fitting a model simulating H9N2 AIV transmission to data from a field experiment, we characterise the epidemiology of the virus in a live bird market in Bangladesh. Many supplied birds arrive already exposed to H9N2 AIVs, resulting in many broiler chickens entering the market as infected, and many indigenous backyard chickens entering with pre-existing immunity. Most susceptible chickens become infected within one day spent at the market, owing to high levels of viral transmission within market and short latent periods, as brief as 5.3 hours. Although H9N2 AIV transmission can be substantially reduced under moderate levels of cleaning and disinfection, effective risk mitigation also requires a range of additional interventions targeting markets and other nodes along the poultry production and distribution network.",

Molecular clock and phylogeography analysis of the HA and NA genes; and phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes of H5N1 viruses from India were carried out. Sequences reported from 2006 to 2015; and sequences from 2021 that were available in online databases were used in the analysis. Five separate introductions of H5N1 viruses into India were observed, via Indonesia or Korea (2002), Bangladesh (2009), Bhutan (2010), and China (2013, 2018) (clades 2.2, 2.2.2, 2.2.2.1, 2.3.2.1a, 2.3.2.1c, and 2.3.4.4b). Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight reassortant genotypes. The H5N1 virus isolated from the human case showed a unique reassortant genotype. Amino acid markers associated with adaptation to mammals were also present. This is the first report of the spatio-temporal origins and gene pool analysis of H5N1 viruses from India, highlighting the need for increased molecular surveillance.",

We used child mortality and vaccine coverage data from the Global Burden of Disease Study. We used a modified child survival framework and applied a mixed-effects regression model to estimate the reduction in deaths in children younger than 5 years associated with eight vaccines. Between 1990 and 2019, the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), measles, rotavirus and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b vaccines were significantly associated with an estimated 86.9 (95% confidence interval, CI: 57.2 to 132.4) million fewer deaths in children younger than 5 years worldwide. This decrease represented a 24.2% (95% CI: 19.8 to 28.9) reduction in deaths relative to a scenario without vaccines. The DTP and measles vaccines averted 46.7 (95% CI: 30.0 to 72.7) million and 37.9 (95% CI: 25.4 to 56.8) million deaths, respectively. Of the total reduction in child mortality associated with vaccines, 84.2% (95% CI: 83.0 to 85.1) occurred in 73 countries supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, with an estimated 45.4 (95% CI: 29.8 to 69.2) million fewer deaths from 2000 to 2019. The largest reductions in deaths associated with these four vaccines were in India, China, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Bangladesh (in order of the size of reduction). Vaccines continue to reduce childhood mortality significantly, especially in Gavi-supported countries, emphasizing the need for increased investment in routine immunization programmes.",

        "abstract": "High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks pose a significant threat to the health of livestock, wildlife, and humans. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are enzootic in poultry in many countries, including Bangladesh, necessitating improved farm biosecurity measures. However, the comprehension of biosecurity and hygiene practices, as well as the infection of AIV in turkey farms, are poorly understood in Bangladesh. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine the prevalence of AIV subtypes and their association with biosecurity and hygiene practices in turkey farms. We collected oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from individual turkeys from 197 farms across 9 districts in Bangladesh from March to August 2019. We tested the swab samples for the AIV matrix gene (M gene) followed by H5, H7, and H9 subtypes using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). We found 24.68% (95% CI:21.54-28.04) of turkey samples were AIV positive, followed by 5.95% (95% CI: 4.33-7.97) for H5, 6.81% (95% CI: 5.06-8.93) for H9 subtype and no A/H7 was found. Using a generalized linear mixed model, we determined 10 significant risk factors associated with AIV circulation in turkey farms. We found that the absence of sick turkeys, the presence of footbaths, the absence of nearby poultry farms, concrete flooring, and the avoidance of mixing newly purchased turkeys with existing stock can substantially reduce the risk of AIV circulation in turkey farms (odds ratio ranging from 0.02 to 0.08). Furthermore, the absence of nearby live bird markets, limiting wild bird access, no visitor access, improved floor cleaning frequency, and equipment disinfection practices also had a substantial impact on lowering the AIV risk in the farms (odds ratio ranging from 0.10 to 0.13). The results of our study underscore the importance of implementing feasible and cost-effective biosecurity measures aimed at reducing AIV transmission in turkey farms. Particularly in resource-constrained environments such as Bangladesh, such findings might assist governmental entities in enhancing biosecurity protocols within their poultry sector, hence mitigating and potentially averting the transmission of AIV and spillover to humans.",

        "abstract": "Avian influenza (AI) is a global problem impacting birds and mammals, causing economic losses in commercial poultry farms and backyard settings. In 2022, over 8,500 AI cases were reported worldwide, with the H5 subtype being responsible for many outbreaks in wild and domestic birds. In the territory of the Russian Federation, outbreaks of AI have been massively reported since 2020, both among domestic bird species and wild bird species. Wild migratory birds often serve as natural reservoirs for AI viruses, and interactions between bird species can lead to the emergence of new, highly pathogenic variants through genetic recombination between strains. In order to combat the widespread outbreaks of the disease and potential risks of further spread in 2021, monitoring studies were conducted in the Samara Oblast, the southeastern region of European Russian Federation. These studies aimed to diagnose and characterize circulating AI virus variants among wild migratory birds during waterfowl hunting in areas of mass nesting. Among the 98 shot birds, a highly pathogenic A/H5N1 AI virus was detected in a Eurasian Teal from the Bolshechernigovsky district. It was classified into clade 2.3.4.4 based on the cleavage site structure of HA. Phylogenetic analysis showed a high relatedness of the identified strain in the Samara Oblast with field isolates from Russia, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and Benin. The article emphasizes the importance of monitoring AI virus spread in both wild and poultry, highlighting the need for timely information exchange to assess risks. Further comprehensive studies are necessary to understand virus dissemination pathways.",

EPINEST was developed in the context of an interdisciplinary multi-centre study conducted in Bangladesh, India, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, and will facilitate the investigation of the spreading patterns of various health hazards such as avian influenza, Campylobacter, Salmonella and antimicrobial resistance in these countries. Furthermore, this modelling framework holds potential for broader application in veterinary epidemiology and One Health research, extending its relevance beyond poultry to encompass other livestock species and disease systems.",

We searched electronic databases and grey literature sources for studies published between 2012 and 2022. The studies written in English were included, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. Among these 25 studies documented M&E and four studies documented OR practices. The majority of the studies were from India and Bangladesh, with no evidence found from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. M&E of surveillance programs were identified among which PHE due to COVID-19 was most prevalent. M&E was conducted in response to COVID-19, cholera, Nipah, Ebola, <i>Candida auris</i>, and hepatitis A. OR practice was minimal and reported from India and Indonesia. India conducted OR on COVID-19 and malaria, whereas Indonesia focused on COVID-19 and influenza. While most SEAR countries have mechanisms for conducting M&E, there is a noticeable limitation in OR practices. There is a compelling need to develop a standard framework for M&E. Additionally, enhancing private sector engagement is crucial for strengthening preparedness against PHE. Furthermore, there is a necessity to increase awareness about the importance of conducting M&E and OR during PHE.",

Influenza vaccination has been routinely offered to all children aged 2-10 years and adults aged 65 years + in England. In 2021/22, the offer was extended to children to age 15 years, and adults aged 50-64 years. Influenza activity rose during the latter half of the 2021/22 season, while remaining comparatively low due to COVID-19 pandemic control measures. Influenza A(H3N2) strains predominated. A test negative design was used to estimate aVE by vaccine type. Cases and controls were identified within a sentinel laboratory surveillance system. Vaccine histories were obtained from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS), an influenza and COVID-19 vaccine registry. These were linked to emergency department presentations (excluding accidents) with respiratory swabbing ≤ 14 days before or ≤ 7 days after presentation. Amongst adults, 423 positive and 32,917 negative samples were eligible for inclusion, and 145 positive and 6,438 negative samples among children. Those admitted to hospital were further identified. In serology against the circulating A(H3N2) A/Bangladesh/4005/2020-like strain, 61 % of current season adult vaccinees had titres ≥ 1:40 compared to 17 % of those unvaccinated in 2020/21 or 2021/22 (p < 0.001). We found good protection from influenza vaccination against influenza requiring emergency care in children (72.7 % [95 % CI 52.7, 84.3 %]) and modest effectiveness in adults (26.1 % [95 % CI 4.5, 42.8 %]). Adult VE was higher for A(H1N1) (81 % [95 % CI 50, 93 %]) than A(H3N2) (33 % [95 % CI 6, 53 %]). Consistent protection was observable across preschool, primary and secondary school aged children. Imperfect test specificity combined with very low prevalence may have biased estimates towards null. With limited influenza circulation, the study could not determine differences by vaccine types.",

We aimed to identify risk factors for poor outcomes in children <5 years old hospitalized with ALRI caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We searched Embase, Medline and Global Health databases and included observational studies reporting risk factors for poor outcomes (defined as use of supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospital stay and mortality) published between January 2011 and January 2023. Two authors independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes and risk factors. Due to limited data, meta-analyses were only conducted for RSV-ALRI poor outcome risk factors using random effects model when there were at least 3 studies. We included 30 studies. For RSV-related ALRI, significant risk factors based on meta-analysis were: neurological disease [odds ratio (OR): 6.14; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 2.39-15.77], Down's syndrome (5.43; 3.02-9.76), chronic lung disease (3.64; 1.31-10.09), immunocompromised status (3.41; 1.85-6.29), prematurity (2.98; 1.93-4.59), congenital heart disease (2.80; 1.84-4.24), underlying disease (2.45; 1.94-3.09), age <2 months (2.29; 1.78-2.94), age <6 months (2.08; 1.81-2.39), viral coinfection (2.01; 1.27-3.19), low birth weight (1.88; 1.19-2.95) and being underweight (1.80; 1.38-2.35). For influenza-related ALRI, chronic conditions and age 6-24 months were identified as risk factors for poor outcomes. Cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and high blood pressure were reported as risk factors for mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 associated ALRI. These findings might contribute to the development of guidelines for prophylaxis and management of ALRI caused by RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2.",

        "abstract": "The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network programme undertakes post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), together with collection of ante-mortem clinical information, to investigate causes of childhood deaths across multiple countries. We aimed to evaluate the overall contribution of pneumonia in the causal pathway to death and the causative pathogens of fatal pneumonia in children aged 1-59 months enrolled in the CHAMPS Network. In this observational study we analysed deaths occurring between Dec 16, 2016, and Dec 31, 2022, in the CHAMPS Network across six countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and one in South Asia (Bangladesh). A standardised approach of MITS was undertaken on decedents within 24-72 h of death. Diagnostic tests included blood culture, multi-organism targeted nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAATs) of blood and lung tissue, and histopathology examination of various organ tissue samples. An interdisciplinary expert panel at each site reviewed case data to attribute the cause of death and pathogenesis thereof on the basis of WHO-recommended reporting standards. Pneumonia was attributed in the causal pathway of death in 455 (40·6%) of 1120 decedents, with a median age at death of 9 (IQR 4-19) months. Causative pathogens were identified in 377 (82·9%) of 455 pneumonia deaths, and multiple pathogens were implicated in 218 (57·8%) of 377 deaths. 306 (67·3%) of 455 deaths occurred in the community or within 72 h of hospital admission (presumed to be community-acquired pneumonia), with the leading bacterial pathogens being Streptococcus pneumoniae (108 [35·3%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (78 [25·5%]), and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (37 [12·1%]). 149 (32·7%) deaths occurred 72 h or more after hospital admission (presumed to be hospital-acquired pneumonia), with the most common pathogens being K pneumoniae (64 [43·0%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (19 [12·8%]), S pneumoniae (15 [10·1%]), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 [10·1%]). Overall, viruses were implicated in 145 (31·9%) of 455 pneumonia-related deaths, including 54 (11·9%) of 455 attributed to cytomegalovirus and 29 (6·4%) of 455 attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Pneumonia contributed to 40·6% of all childhood deaths in this analysis. The use of post-mortem MITS enabled biological ascertainment of the cause of death in the majority (82·9%) of childhood deaths attributed to pneumonia, with more than one pathogen being commonly implicated in the same case. The prominent role of K pneumoniae, non-typable H influenzae, and S pneumoniae highlight the need to review empirical management guidelines for management of very severe pneumonia in low-income and middle-income settings, and the need for research into new or improved vaccines against these pathogens.

In the current study, we demonstrate that exposure to arsenic compounds alters B cell function in an in vitro influenza model. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood and cultured with arsenic trioxide (As<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and subsequently challenged with Influenza A virus. B cells showed decreased expression of CD267, surface IgG and CD80 when treated with As<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Taken together, the data suggest that As<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> affects the activation and surface antibody expression of human peripheral B cells. Overall, this suggests that As<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure could cause impaired humoral immunity.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, seasonal influenza imposes considerable disease and economic burden, especially for those at high-risk of severe disease. The most successful approach for influenza prevention is the administration of a vaccine. Many poor and middle-income nations, including Bangladesh, do not have a national strategy or program in place for seasonal influenza vaccines, despite the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice to prioritize high-risk populations. Additionally, there is a scarcity of substantial data on the cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in these countries. The aim of our study is to determine acceptability, health beliefs, barriers, and intention of receiving influenza vaccine among high-risk populations, assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a facility-based seasonal influenza vaccination programme, and investigate the required capacity for a potential seasonal influenza vaccination programme. We will undertake this study following STROBE guidelines. We will conduct the study in inpatient and outpatient departments of three selected tertiary-level hospitals leveraging the ongoing hospital-based influenza surveillance (HBIS) platform. The study population will include the WHO-defined four high-risk groups excluding healthcare workers: children six months to eight years, pregnant women, elderly ≥ 60 years, and adults with chronic diseases. We will collect quantitative data on participants' acceptability, health beliefs, barriers, and vaccination intentions using the health belief model (HBM) from patients meeting the criteria for high-risk populations attending two public tertiary-level hospitals. In one of the two public tertiary-level hospitals, we will arrange an influenza vaccination campaign before the influenza season, where the vaccine will be offered free of cost to high-risk patients, and in the second hospital, vaccination will not be offered. Both the vaccinated and unvaccinated participants will then be followed-up once a month for one year to record any influenza-like illness, hospitalization, and death. Additional data for objective two will be collected from patients with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at one public and one private hospital to determine both direct and indirect costs associated with influenza illness. We will estimate the required number of influenza vaccines, safe injections, and total storage volume utilizing secondary data. We will use a deterministic Markov decision-analytic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of facility-based influenza vaccination in Bangladesh. The results of this study will enable the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of Bangladesh to decide what steps to take to develop and implement an influenza vaccination strategy targeting high-risk populations. The Clinicaltrials.gov registration number is NCT05996549. The registration for the protocol version 2.0 took place in August 2023, with the initial participant being enrolled in March 2022.",

        "abstract": "Pneumonia remains the leading cause of mortality in under-five children outside the neonatal period. Progress has slowed down in the last decade, necessitating increased efforts to scale up effective pneumonia interventions. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), a modelling software for child mortality in low- and middle-income settings, to prospectively analyse the potential impact of upscaling pneumonia interventions in Bangladesh, Chad, and Ethiopia from 2023 to 2030. We included Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccination, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), oral antibiotics, pulse oximetry, and oxygen as pneumonia interventions in our analysis. Outcomes of interest were the number of pneumonia deaths averted, the proportion of deaths averted by intervention, and changes in the under-five mortality rate. We found that 19 775 lives of children under-five could be saved in Bangladesh, 76 470 in Chad, and 97 343 in Ethiopia by scaling intervention coverages to ≥90% by 2030. Our estimated reductions in pneumonia deaths among children under five range from 44.61% to 57.91% in the respective countries. Increased coverage of oral antibiotics, pulse oximetry, and oxygen show similar effects in all three countries, averting between 18.80% and 23.65% of expected pneumonia deaths. Scaling-up PCV has a prominent effect, especially in Chad, where it could avert 14.04% of expected pneumonia deaths. Under-five mortality could be reduced by 1.42 per 1000 live births in Bangladesh, 22.52 per 1000 live births in Chad, and 5.48 per 1000 live births in Ethiopia. This analysis shows the high impact of upscaling pneumonia interventions. The lack of data regarding coverage indicators is a barrier for further research, policy, and implementation, all requiring increased attention.",

        "abstract": "Our group previously demonstrated that <i>Caesalpinia mimosoides</i> Lamk exhibits many profound biological properties, including anticancer, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities. However, its antiviral activity has not yet been investigated. Here, the aqueous extract of <i>C. mimosoides</i> was prepared from the aerial parts (leaves, stalks, and trunks) to see whether it exerts anti-influenza (H1N1) effects and to reduce the organic solvents consumed during extraction, making it a desirable approach for the large-scale production for medical uses. Our plant extract was quantified to contain 7 g of gallic acid (GA) per 100 g of a dry sample, as determined using HPLC analysis. It also exerts potent antioxidant activities comparable to those of authentic GA. According to untargeted metabolomics (UPLC-ESI(-)-QTOF-MS/MS) with the aid of cheminformatics tools (MetFrag (version 2.1), SIRIUS (version 5.8.3), CSI:FingerID (version 4.8), and CANOPUS), the major metabolite was best annotated as \"gallic acid\", phenolics (e.g., quinic acid, shikimic acid, and protocatechuic acid), sugar derivatives, and dicarboxylic acids were deduced from this plant species for the first time. The aqueous plant extract efficiently inhibited an influenza A (H1N1) virus infection of MDCK cells with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.14 µg/mL. Of equal importance, hemolytic activity was absent for this plant extract, signifying its applicability as a safe antiviral agent. Molecular docking suggested that GA interacts with conserved residues (e.g., Arg152 and Asp151) located in the catalytic inner shell of the viral neuraminidase (NA), sharing the same pocket as those of anti-neuraminidase drugs, such as laninamivir and oseltamivir. Additionally, other metabolites were also found to potentially interact with the active site and the hydrophobic 430-cavity of the viral surface protein, suggesting a possibly synergistic effect of various phytochemicals. Therefore, the <i>C. mimosoides</i> aqueous extract may be a good candidate for coping with increasing influenza virus resistance to existing antivirals.",

Initially, it may develop via a primary infection and then later segue into a superinfection. Although some research suggests that coinfections do not affect the effect of disease outcomes, alternate evidence says otherwise. While the disease outcomes are frequently influenced by the interactions between many viruses, how these viruses interact during coinfections is poorly understood. This article aims to shed light on the interaction between viruses at a cellular and subcellular level, and the clinical implications for the same. The articles were sought by conducting a thorough literature search on Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, PubMed Central, Dimensions, and EBSCO Host, using keywords such as coinfections, virus, viral hybrids, and superinfection. The articles pertinent to the concept were then included. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests the formation of hybrid viral particles (HVPs) which conjugate at the cellular and subcellular level. While the formation of HVPs is bizarre, it may potentially have a profound effect on the clinical manifestations. While there has been evidence of the formation of HVPs between a couple of viruses, researchers fear the existence of several other combinations, including zoonotic viruses. While this could be detrimental to the human race both at an individual-as well as a community-level, an in-depth understanding of the same may help in better management of the clinical manifestations of the disease.",

She had variable presentation and was initially established as a case of mixed connective tissue disease which consists of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Systemic Sclerosis and Dermatomyositis. She complained of xerostomia, xerophthalmia, difficulty in opening mouth, progressive dysphagia with solid foods and raynaud's phenomenon. In addition to this she noticed photosensitive rash, oral ulcers and difficulty in raising arms above head especially while combing hair. Examination revealed bi basal fine end inspiratory crepitations unaltered while coughing, bed side 6 minutes walking test showed exertional desaturation of SpO2 from 92.0% to 84.0%. Grade 2 tenderness was noted in wrists, knees, elbows and small joints of hands and feet except DIP. However, no oral lesions or dental carries were found. Unstimulated salivary flow rate was 1.0 ml in 15 minutes and sublingual salivary pool was significantly reduced. Schirmer's test was positive. HRCT lung revealed reticulonodular shadowing, honey combing and traction bronchiectasis in basal segments of both lobes, suggestive of usual interstitial pneumonia in both lungs. Auto antibody tests revealed ANA, RA, anti CCP and anti ds DNA negative, CPK was 63U/L. ENA (Extractable Nuclear Antigen) profile demonstrated positive Anti SS- A antibody while it remained insignificant for anti SS-B, anti RNP, anti Sm antibody, anti Scl-7o, anti Jo-1. According to the American-European Consensus Criteria for SjoGren's Syndrome, it meets all the criteria to be diagnosed as Primary Sjogren's Syndrome. We finally diagnosed a case of Primary SjoGren's syndrome with IPF and the patient was treated with pirfenidone, prednisolone, artificial tears and vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcal pneumoniae. The 10 year survival rate for such patients is nearly 80.0%.",

        "abstract": "The pursuit of innovative combinations for the development of novel antimicrobial and antiviral medications has garnered worldwide interest among scientists in recent times. Monosaccharides and their glycosides, such as methyl α-d-mannopyranoside derivatives, play a significant role in the potential treatment of viral respiratory pathologies. This study was undertaken to investigate and assess the synthesis and spectral characterization of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside derivatives <b>2</b>-<b>6</b>, incorporating various aliphatic and aromatic groups. The investigation encompassed comprehensive in vitro antimicrobial screening, examination of physicochemical properties, molecular docking analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and pharmacokinetic predictions. A unimolar one-step cinnamoylation reaction was employed under controlled conditions to produce methyl 6-<i>O</i>-cinnamoyl-α-d-mannopyranoside <b>2</b>, demonstrating selectivity at the C-6 position. This represented a pivotal step in the development of potential antimicrobial derivatives based on methyl α-d-mannopyranoside. Subsequently, four additional methyl 6-<i>O</i>-cinnamoyl-α-d-mannopyranoside derivatives were synthesized with reasonably high yields. The chemical structures of these novel analogs were confirmed through a thorough analysis of their physicochemical properties, elemental composition, and spectroscopic data. In vitro antimicrobial assays were conducted against six bacterial strains and two fungal strains, revealing promising antifungal properties of these methyl α-d-mannopyranoside derivatives in comparison to their antibacterial activity. Moreover, cytotoxicity testing revealed that the compounds are less toxic. Further supporting these findings, molecular docking studies were performed against the H5N1 influenza A virus, indicating significant binding affinities and nonbonding interactions with the target protein 6VMZ. Notably, compounds <b>4</b> (-7.2) and <b>6</b> (-7.0) exhibited the highest binding affinities. Additionally, a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the complex formed between the receptor 6VMZ and methyl α-d-mannopyranoside derivatives under in silico physiological conditions. The results revealed a stable conformation and binding pattern within the stimulating environment. In silico pharmacokinetic and toxicity assessments of the synthesized molecules were performed using Osiris software (version 2.9.1). Compounds <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> demonstrated favorable computational and pharmacological activities, albeit with a low drug score, possibly attributed to their higher molecular weight and irritancy. In conclusion, this study showcases the synthesis and evaluation of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside derivatives as promising candidates for antimicrobial and antifungal agents. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations, along with pharmacological predictions, contribute to our understanding of their potential therapeutic utility, although further research may be warranted to address certain pharmacological aspects.",

        "abstract": "High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks continue to wreak havoc on the global poultry industry and threaten the health of wild bird populations, with sporadic spillover in humans and other mammals, resulting in widespread calls to vaccinate poultry. Bangladesh has been vaccinating poultry since 2012, presenting a prime opportunity to study the effects of vaccination on HPAI H5N1circulation in both poultry and wild birds. We investigated the efficacy of vaccinating commercial poultry against HPAI H5N1 along with climatic and socio-economic factors considered potential drivers of HPAI H5N1 outbreak risk in Bangladesh. Using a multivariate modeling approach, we estimated that the rate of outbreaks was 18 times higher before compared to after vaccination, with winter months having a three times higher chance of outbreaks than summer months. Variables resulting in small but significant increases in outbreak rate were relatively low ambient temperatures for the time of year, literacy rate, chicken and duck density, crop density, and presence of highways; this may be attributable to low temperatures supporting viral survival outside the host, higher literacy driving reporting rate, density of the host reservoir, and spread of the virus through increased connectivity. Despite the substantial impact of vaccination on outbreaks, we note that HPAI H5N1 is still enzootic in Bangladesh; vaccinated poultry flocks have high rates of H5N1 prevalence, and spillover to wild birds has increased. Vaccination in Bangladesh thus bears the risk of supporting \"silent spread,\" where the vaccine only provides protection against disease and not also infection. Our findings underscore that poultry vaccination can be part of holistic HPAI mitigation strategies when accompanied by monitoring to avoid silent spread.",

We analyzed SARI-associated deaths during the pre-and-pandemic periods in Bangladesh to identify the contributing factors. We analyzed data from hospital-based influenza surveillance at nine tertiary-level hospitals in Bangladesh. We considered March 2018-February 2020 as the pre-pandemic period and March 2020-February 2022 as the pandemic period and included adult (≥ 18 years) participants in our study. Surveillance physicians identified WHO-SARI case definition meeting inpatients and collected demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes at hospital discharge and 30 days post-discharge. We performed rRT-PCR for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses on collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. We used multivariable Cox's regression models to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for factors associated with SARI deaths in these adult patients. We enrolled 4392 SARI patients during the pre-pandemic and 3824 SARI patients during the pandemic period. Case fatality ratio was higher during the pandemic: 13.62% (521) [in-hospital: 6.45% (247); post-discharge: 7.17% (274)] compared to pre-pandemic, 6.01% (264) [in-hospital: 2.01% (89), post-discharge: 4% (175)] (p < 0.001). Pre-pandemic, influenza was detected in 14% (37/264) of SARI deaths. Influenza was detected during the pandemic in 2.3% (12/521), SARS-CoV-2 in 41.8% (218/521), and both viruses in only one SARI death. History of smoking and the presence of 1 or more co-morbid conditions independently attributed to SARI deaths in adults in the pre-pandemic period. SARI deaths in such patients were also associated with respiratory difficulties on admission in both pre-pandemic (aHR 2.36; 95% CI:1.65-3.36) and pandemic period (aHR 2.30; 95% CI: 1.57-3.35) after accounting for age, sex, smoking status, presence of 1 or more co-morbid conditions, and detection of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. During the pandemic, SARI mortality increased; influenza-associated mortality declined, and SARS-CoV-2 caused over a third of SARI deaths. Post-discharge mortality was higher than in-hospital mortality during both periods. Limiting premature discharge and strengthening post-discharge monitoring and nursing services could reduce unexpected deaths. Formative research to better understand post-discharge mortality is essential to reduce SARI deaths.",

        "abstract": "Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are significant transboundary zoonotic pathogens that concern both animal and human. Since the first report of H5N1 AIV in Bangladesh in early 2007, it resulted in numerous outbreaks across the country, hindering the sustainable growth of the poultry industry through economic losses in different production systems (commercial and backyard). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus are currently cocirculating and causing infection in poultry sectors in an endemic manner in Bangladesh as well as in wild bird species. The introduction of multiple clades of H5N1 in different poultry species and the reassortment of AIVs with different patterns of infections have complicated the epidemiological situation for control and created conditions to increase the virulence of the virus, host range, and potential zoonotic transmission. The risk of viral transmission at the human-poultry interface is increasing over time due to inadequate surveillance and early detection strategies and practices, ineffective biosecurity practices among poultry raisers, and the complex supply chains of backyard and commercial poultry and live bird market (LBM) systems. Improving AIV surveillance in poultry flocks and LBMs, vaccination, biosecurity, and awareness among poultry professionals is beneficial to controlling the disease burden in the poultry sector. However, human cases of AIV related to poultry production and marketing chain in Bangladesh suggest a One Health approach engaging various stakeholders from the public and private would be a better option for successfully controlling avian influenza outbreaks in Bangladesh. This review of literature presents the comprehensive overview of AIV infection status in Bangladesh, including a description of pathways for zoonotic transmission at different epidemiological interfaces, the genetic evolution of the virus, and the need for improvement of disease control strategies incorporated with early detection, application of effective vaccines, increases the proper biosecurity practices and improvement of awareness among the poultry raisers, traders and consumers using a One Health approach.",

Conducted during the 2018 influenza season at a Dhaka tertiary-level cardiovascular (CV) hospital, it included 150 AMI cases and two control groups: 44 hospitalized cardiac patients without AMI and 90 healthy individuals. Participants were matched by gender and age groups. The study focused on self-reported CRI and laboratory-confirmed influenza ascertained via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) within the preceding week, analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results showed that cases reported CRI, significantly more frequently than healthy controls (27.3% vs. 13.3%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-4.06), although this was not significantly different from all controls (27.3% vs. 22.4%; aOR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.65-2.18). Influenza rates were insignificantly higher among cases than controls. The study suggests that recent respiratory illnesses may precede AMI onset among Bangladeshi patients. Infection prevention and control practices, as well as the uptake of the influenza vaccine, may be advocated for patients at high risk of acute CV events.",

        "title": "Potential risk zones and climatic factors influencing the occurrence and persistence of avian influenza viruses in the environment of live bird markets in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Live bird markets (LBMs) are critical for poultry trade in many developing countries that are regarded as hotspots for the prevalence and contamination of avian influenza viruses (AIV). Therefore, we conducted weekly longitudinal environmental surveillance in LBMs to determine annual cyclic patterns of AIV subtypes, environmental risk zones, and the role of climatic factors on the AIV presence and persistence in the environment of LBM in Bangladesh. From January 2018 to March 2020, we collected weekly fecal and offal swab samples from each LBM and tested using rRT-PCR for the M gene and subtyped for H5, H7, and H9. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approaches to account for repeated observations over time to correlate the AIV prevalence and potential risk factors and the negative binomial and Poisson model to investigate the role of climatic factors on environmental contamination of AIV at the LBM. Over the study period, 37.8% of samples tested AIV positive, 18.8% for A/H5, and A/H9 was, for 15.4%. We found the circulation of H5, H9, and co-circulation of H5 and H9 in the environmental surfaces year-round. The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model reveals a distinct seasonal pattern in transmitting AIV and H5. Specifically, certain summer months exhibited a substantial reduction of risk up to 70-90% and 93-94% for AIV and H5 contamination, respectively. The slaughtering zone showed a significantly higher risk of contamination with H5, with a three-fold increase in risk compared to bird-holding zones. From the negative binomial model, we found that climatic factors like temperature and relative humidity were also significantly associated with weekly AIV circulation. An increase in temperature and relative humidity decreases the risk of AIV circulation. Our study underscores the significance of longitudinal environmental surveillance for identifying potential risk zones to detect H5 and H9 virus co-circulation and seasonal transmission, as well as the imperative for immediate interventions to reduce AIV at LBMs in Bangladesh. We recommend adopting a One Health approach to integrated AIV surveillance across animal, human, and environmental interfaces in order to prevent the epidemic and pandemic of AIV.",

        "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 endangers poultry, wildlife, and human health and is enzootic in large parts of Asia, with live bird markets (LBMs) as putative hotspots for their maintenance, amplification, and spread. To mitigate the extent of these and other avian influenza viruses (AIV) of concern, we aimed to increase our quantitative understanding of the factors determining the presence of avian influenza virus in LBM stalls. Between 2016 and 2017, we collected fecal or offal samples from 1008 stalls in 113 LBMs across the Dhaka and Rajshahi districts in Bangladesh. For each stall, samples were pooled and tested for the AIV matrix gene, followed by H5 and H9 subtyping using rRT-PCR. We detected Influenza A viral RNA in 49% of the stalls. Of the AIV positive samples, 52% and 24% were determined to be H5 and H9 viruses, respectively, which are both subtypes of considerable health concern. We used generalized linear mixed effect modelling to study AIV presence in individual stalls within LBMs as a function of 13 out of the 20 risk factors identified by FAO. We found that small and feasible improvements in cleaning and disinfection frequency, installing running water in stalls, and not mixing different breeds of chicken in the same cages had large impacts on the presence of AIV in stalls (Odds ratios 0.03-0.05). Next, cleaning vehicles used in poultry transport, not selling waterfowl with chickens in the same stall, buying stock directly from commercial farms, separating sick birds from healthy ones, and avoiding access by wild birds like house crows, also had major effects on lowering the risk of stalls having AIV (Odds ratios 0.16-0.33). These findings can be directly used in developing practical and affordable measures to reduce the prevalence of AIV in LBMs. Also, in settings with limited resources like Bangladesh, such mitigation may significantly contribute to reducing AIV circulation amongst poultry and spillover to wildlife and humans.",

        "title": "Optimal timing of influenza vaccination among patients with acute myocardial infarction - Findings from the IAMI trial.",
        "abstract": "Influenza vaccination reduces the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.The IAMI trial randomly assigned 2571 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to receive influenza vaccine or saline placebo during their index hospital admission. It was conducted at 30 centers in 8 countries from October 1, 2016 to March 1, 2020. In this post-hoc exploratory sub-study, we compare the trial outcomes in patients receiving early season vaccination (n = 1188) and late season vaccination (n = 1344).The primary endpoint wasthe composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stent thrombosis at 12 months. Thecumulative incidence of the primary and key secondary endpoints by randomized treatment and early or late vaccination was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In the early vaccinated group, the primary composite endpoint occurred in 36 participants (6.0%) assigned to influenza vaccine and 49 (8.4%) assigned to placebo (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.07), compared to 31 participants (4.7%) assigned to influenza vaccine and 42 (6.2%) assigned to placebo (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.18) in the late vaccinated group (P = 0.848 for interaction on HR scale at 1 year). We observed similar estimates for the key secondary endpoints of all-cause death and CV death. There was no statistically significant difference in vaccine effectiveness against adverse cardiovascular events by timing of vaccination. The effect of vaccination on all-cause death at one year was more pronounced in the group receiving early vaccination (HR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.86) compared late vaccination group (HR 0.75; 35% CI, 0.40 to 1.40) but there was no statistically significant difference between these groups (Interaction P = 0.335). In conclusion,there is insufficient evidence from the trial to establish whether there is a difference in efficacy between early and late vaccinationbut regardless of vaccination timing we strongly recommend influenza vaccination in all patients with cardiovascular diseases.",

        "abstract": "<i>Clostridium butyricum</i> is known as a probiotic butyric acid bacterium that can improve the intestinal environment. In this study, we isolated a new strain of <i>C. butyricum</i> from infant feces and evaluated its physiological characteristics and antiviral efficacy by modulating the innate immune responses <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The isolated <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5 showed typical characteristics of <i>C. butyricum</i> including bile acid resistance, antibacterial ability, and growth promotion of various lactic acid bacteria. As an antiviral effect, <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5 markedly reduced the replication of influenza A virus (PR8), Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) in RAW264.7 cells <i>in vitro</i>. This suppression can be explained by the induction of antiviral state in cells by the induction of antiviral, IFN-related genes and secretion of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. <i>In vivo</i>, oral administration of <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5 exhibited prophylactic effects on BALB/c mice against fatal doses of highly pathogenic mouse-adapted influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2). Before challenge with influenza virus, <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5-treated BALB/c mice showed increased levels of IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-12 in serum, the small intestine, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which correlated with observed prophylactic effects. Interestingly, after challenge with influenza virus, <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5-treated BALB/c mice showed reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and relatively higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines at day 7 post-infection. Taken together, these findings suggest that <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5 plays an antiviral role <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> by inducing an antiviral state and affects immune modulation to alleviate local and systemic inflammatory responses caused by influenza virus infection. Our study provides the beneficial effects of the new <i>C. butyricum</i> S-45-5 with antiviral effects as a probiotic.",
