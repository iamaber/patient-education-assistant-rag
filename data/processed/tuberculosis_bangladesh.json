        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death globally, highlighting the urgent need for novel anticancer therapies with higher efficacy and reduced toxicity. Similarly, the rise in multidrug-resistant pathogens and emerging infectious diseases underscores the critical demand for new antimicrobial agents that target resistant infections through unique mechanisms. This study used computational approaches to investigate twenty quinolone-triazole and conazole-triazole hybrid derivatives as antimicrobial and anticancer agents (<b>1</b>-<b>20</b>) with nine reference drugs. By studying their interactions with 6 bacterial DNA gyrase and 10 cancer-inducing target proteins (<i>E. faecalis</i>, <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, <i>M. smegmatis</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and EGFR, MPO, VEGFR, CDK6, MMP1, Bcl-2, LSD1, HDAC6, Aromatase, ALOX15) and comparing them with established drugs such as ampicillin, cefatrizine, fluconazole, gemcitabine, itraconazole, ribavirin, rufinamide, streptomycin, and tazobactam, compounds <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> emerged as noteworthy antimicrobial and anticancer agents, respectively. In molecular dynamics simulations, compounds <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> had the strongest binding at -10.6 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and -12.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> with the crucial 5CDQ and 2Z3Y proteins, respectively, exceeded drug-likeness criteria, and displayed extraordinary stability within the enzyme's pocket over varied temperatures (300-320 K). In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) to calculate dipole moments and molecular orbital characteristics and analyze the thermodynamic stability of putative antimicrobial and anticancer derivatives. This finding reveals a well-defined, possibly therapeutic relationship, supported by theoretical and future in vitro and in vivo studies. Compounds <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, thus, emerged as intriguing contenders in the fight against infectious diseases and cancer.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), is a contagious, notifiable, chronic bacterial disease that causes economic losses. bTB remains a significant zoonotic threat, particularly in resource-limited settings where reliable prevalence data are still lacking. This study aimed to determine the serological prevalence and molecular detection of bTB from different commercial and individual dairy farms of Sylhet and Sunamganj districts in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 250 blood and 250 milk samples, which were collected across selected dairy farms. Serological testing was performed using indirect ELISA, and molecular detection of M. bovis was carried out through PCR. Associations between infection status and potential risk factors were evaluated using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. The overall prevalence of M. bovis was 10.6%. Molecular detection through PCR revealed a higher prevalence in milk (14.8%) compared to blood (6.4%) samples. Serological testing showed that the prevalence in Sylhet district was lower (5.3%) than in Sunamganj district (12.0%). The highest prevalence was observed in diarrhoeic animals (19.49%), followed by female cattle (13.58%) and Holstein Friesian cows (14.0%). Cattle aged 1-3 years showed a notable prevalence of 17.51%. The presence of M. bovis in dairy cattle herds was confirmed by both molecular and serological methods, highlighting the endemic nature of bTB in the study area. These findings underscore the importance of routine surveillance, combining diagnostic approaches and implementing effective control measures to reduce the burden of bTB in dairy production systems.",

However, its role in diagnosing tubercular arthritis in Bangladesh remains underexplored. This study presents a case series of five patients with monoarthritis - three with ankle involvement and two with knee joint tuberculosis - evaluated using USG-SB or aspiration. The procedures were performed using a high-resolution musculoskeletal ultrasound (14-6 MHz probe, Mindray, Shenzhen, China). Synovial tissue samples were analyzed via histopathology and GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, US) testing, while synovial fluid was examined via cytology, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining, and GeneXpert. Tuberculosis was confirmed histologically in three cases, GeneXpert was positive in two, and AFB staining was positive in one.

We analysed nationally representative health system data from the Service Provision Assessment surveys for six selected LMICs - Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Nepal, Senegal, and Bangladesh. We recorded seven tracer items of standard precautions into binary elements. We calculated a readiness index based on the World Health Organization's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual. We utilised survey-weighted multivariable generalised estimating equations to identify factors associated with the readiness index. Among 6054 healthcare facilities, 55% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 53.1, 56.5) of necessary standard precautions were available, ranging from 48.1% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 65% in Nepal. Readiness varied by service area, with the tuberculosis service area being the least prepared at 38% and the general outpatient service area being the most prepared at 66%. Facilities in Nepal and the urban regions showed higher readiness, with mean (x̄) differences of 16% (95% CI = 13.6, 17.9) and 3% (95% CI = 1.8, 4.9) compared to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and rural areas, respectively. We revealed significant deficiencies in standard precautions within healthcare facilities across six LMICs, notably in rural areas. The findings underscore an urgent need for targeted interventions to improve IPC strategies, particularly in domains like tuberculosis care.",

It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants. Findings advocate for reducing environmental pollution exposure in LMICs to mitigate infectious disease risk.",

        "abstract": "Leprosy is a debilitating, chronic infectious disease, ranking second after tuberculosis in the order of severe human mycobacterial diseases. If timely treatment is not initiated, infection with its causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae, can result in severe nerve damage leading to life-long disabilities. Host immunity largely dictates the spectral disease presentation, ranging from multi- to paucibacillary. Studying the host response to M. leprae is, however, complicated by the inability to culture this mycobacterium in vitro. Immune correlates of protection in persons at risk of leprosy are, therefore, essentially unknown. To identify host factors related to mycobacterial control, functional mycobacterial growth inhibition assays combined with extensive immunophenotyping by spectral flow cytometry were performed for patients with leprosy and their contacts. This integrative approach merged sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in low resource areas with immune-analysis using cutting edge technology. In contrast to the current dogma, no intrinsic differences in mycobacterial control in vitro between patients with high and low bacillary loads were observed. Immunophenotyping at consecutive levels revealed a significant link between the induction of chemokines to mycobacterial antigens and expression of CXCR3 and CCR4 on adaptive immune cells in contacts controlling M. leprae infection. These results offer more detailed insights into protective immunity against M. leprae and define host factors associated with bacterial control, fuelling improved diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.

He had lost six kilograms over this period of illness. He was anemic, with mildly tender swelling in the right parietal region of the scalp. Diffuse tenderness was present over the dorsal spine and right side of the chest, with no evidence of gibbus. Multifocal skeletal tuberculosis was diagnosed based on the presence of lytic lesions in the skull, ribs, and vertebrae, along with high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high tracer uptake on a bone scan, with a biopsy report showing a granulomatous lesion from the vertebra. After six months of anti-TB therapy, during a scheduled follow-up visit, the patient showed significant improvement in pain and general well-being, with an improvement of the skull lytic lesion on the x-ray.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis, posing a critical challenge to healthcare systems, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), where multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) threaten patient survival. This study offers a unique, real-world perspective on AMR dynamics by analyzing 96 metagenomic samples from three key sources: oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of deceased ICU patients (both postadmission and antemortem), healthcare workers, and high-touch ICU surfaces. Findings revealed the ICU environment as a major AMR reservoir, with oropharyngeal swabs carrying the highest AMR burden. While healthcare staff facilitated MDRO spread, they were not primary sources. Staff microbiomes' MDRO pattern closely resembled environmental samples. Key AMR species included B. fragilis, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, with P. aeruginosa persisting on high-touch surfaces. Tetracycline resistance was the most prevalent, with common resistances comprising 36.1% of all detected AMR markers. Staff microbial community exhibited higher resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, and cephamycins. A 10-day survival threshold distinguished early (EM) and late mortality (LM) groups. EM patients exhibited unique AMR species in the oropharynx, suggesting respiratory-driven infections, while LM patients showed greater gut-associated resistance. Higher rectal AMR counts correlated with prolonged survival. Notably, four key MDROs (L. monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis, S. haemolyticus, and S. agalactiae) were enriched in sepsis patients, suggesting early risk markers. Fewer new resistances emerged in rectal than oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to antibiotic selection pressure. Vancomycin and levofloxacin, frequently co-administered, exerted stronger selective pressure in the oropharynx, possibly explaining the high MRSA prevalence in patient and environmental samples.",

        "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a key driver of microbial evolution, promoting genetic diversity and contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This study explores the pangenome dynamics and HGT in <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> (<i>M. marinum</i>), a close relative of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Multiple pangenome datasets were analyzed to quantify gene gain, loss, and pangenome openness, utilizing Panstripe and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework to assess gene presence/absence across strains. Additionally, a comparative benchmarking analysis of gene ontology (GO) annotations were conducted using eggNOG and InterProScan to evaluate their functional annotation accuracy. Our findings demonstrated significant differences in gene gain and loss rates, suggesting variations in annotation accuracy and the presence of mobile genetic elements (MGE). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also identified, highlighting the genetic variability that may impact strain-specific traits such as pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. Pangenome of <i>M. marinum</i> was characterized as highly open, with substantial variability in gene content, reflecting ongoing genetic exchange and adaptability. Functional annotation benchmarking demonstrated that eggNOG and InterProScan provided complementary insights, with each tool excelling in distinct strengths of gene function identification. Overall, these findings highlight the complex interplay between HGT, pangenome evolution, and antibiotic resistance in <i>M. marinum</i>, and the analytical framework presented here provides a robust approach for future studies aiming to inform therapeutic interventions and vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) regained its position as the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious disease agent in 2024. Delayed diagnosis and treatment hamper effective TB control. We investigated the duration of diagnostic and treatment delay along with the associated factors among people with pulmonary TB in Bangladesh. A mixed-method study was conducted between December'19 and March'21, at icddr,b TB Screening and Treatment Centres (TBSTCs), Dhaka. We interviewed people with TB (PWTB) seeking care at these TBSTCs using a structured questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare seeking behaviors. We used established frameworks to define stages of delay and associated factors. Qualitative interviews were conducted among a subset of participants to gain further insight into the factors associated with delay. We enrolled 895 PWTB with mean (±SD) age 36.6 (±16.1) years; majority of participants were males (69.9%) and living in urban areas (82.3%). The median (IQR) patient delay estimated was 47 (29-72) days, with diagnostic delay 45 (30-70) days and treatment delay 2 (2-4) days. The predictors of delay were those with diabetes (OR 2.0, 95% CI - 1.11, 3.42), who initially self-treated (OR 2.1, 95% CI - 1.09, 3.88), and were bacteriologically diagnosed (OR 3.7, 95% CI - 1.31, 10.46). Qualitative approach supported the quantitative findings and revealed the practice of visiting formal physicians during worsening illness, neglecting to acknowledge signs or symptoms consistent with TB, lack of TB related knowledge, and financial insolvency as major reasons for delay. Our findings showed that improper health-seeking behavior is one of the major drivers of patient delay. Thus, targeted programmatic intervention to raise community awareness on TB and its care services with a special focus on informal providers can help reduce this delay.",

This study employed a comprehensive computational approach to identify and optimize inhibitors targeting the PptT-ACP complex, a key enzyme in MTB lipid biosynthesis. Virtual screening of FDA-approved compounds identified Mk3207 as a promising candidate. Stability analysis through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations validated its selection for derivative design. Three chemically tractable regions suitable for structural modification were identified, and the second region was selected for derivative design due to its favorable structural properties and binding interactions. One hundred derivatives were designed using ADMEopt and screened virtually, resulting in three top derivatives selected alongside Mk3207 for further evaluation. All compounds underwent 200 ns MD simulations in triplicate, with Compound_36 exhibiting the highest binding stability, as indicated by low root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values, followed by Compound_98 and Compound_60. Free energy landscape (FEL) and principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the thermodynamic stability of these derivatives. Predicted biological activity using machine learning (Random Forest Regression) indicated pIC50 values of 25.64, 22.43, 22.32, and 26.26 for Compound_36, Compound_98, Compound_60, and Mk3207, respectively.

        "abstract": "Early and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is central to ensuring the proper treatment and curbing the transmission of the disease. Despite the significant burden, the diagnosis of peripheral lymph node(LN)TB, the most prevalent form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), has been challenging in low resource settings. To meet the existing needs, the Mobile-TB-Lab study set out to evaluate two innovative approaches, including thermal imaging and recombinase-aided amplification assay (RAA) in Minoo for point-of-need diagnosis of LNTB. The synergy of these index tests is expected to pave the way for rapid detection of EPTB in resource-constrained settings. Mobile-TB-Lab is a multicountry diagnostic evaluation study to be performed in Bangladesh and Uganda. Under this protocol, a total of 200 suspected EPTB patients with cervical lymphadenitis will be enrolled from tertiary healthcare facilities in Bangladesh and Uganda. Each participant will be subjected to laboratory investigations including microscopy, real-time PCR, cytology, culture and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra with the tissue sample following fine-needle aspiration (FNA). As the index tests, thermal imaging will be performed before performing the FNA, and the leftover aspirate will be used to perform RAA in the Minoo device. The diagnostic efficiency of the index tests will be determined against a composite reference standard based on the laboratory methods. Besides, latent class analysis will be performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests. Finally, health economic evaluation will be performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the investigative methods. The study protocol (PR-23031) has been approved by the research review committee (RRC) and the ethical review committee (ERC) under the institutional review board (IRB) of icddr,b in Bangladesh. In Uganda, the study protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University under reference number IDI-REC-2023-62 and approval from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) under reference number HS3494ES. All the study materials and procedures to be used for the enrolment of the participants have been approved by the ethical review committee. The study will be performed according to the declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice to ensure the participants' rights, safety and well-being. The findings from this study will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international meetings.",

The study looks at the variety and types of microbes that a child is exposed to, the particular microbiome profiles associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the molecular processes that underlie these relationships. We performed a thorough search of PubMed, Scopus, the WHO Global Health Library (GHL), and ISI Web of Science. After screening 2,744 original studies based on predetermined eligibility criteria, 19 studies were included. Microbial groupings, presence (high/low), and related neurodevelopmental disorders were among the primary areas of data extraction. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). The investigated literature repeatedly showed a strong correlation between dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders. Cases of ASD were associated with both a high number of Clostridium species and a low number of Bifidobacterium species. On the other hand, a Low number of E. coli and a high number of the class Clostridia, phylum Firmicute, genus Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia, as well as the species Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, Streptococcus mutans, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been linked to ADHD. The NOS evaluation showed variation in the quality of the methodology; some studies had high scores, suggesting sound technique, while other studies had lower scores, indicating serious methodological flaws. The results highlight the potential impact of the gut microbiome throughout early life on neurodevelopmental outcomes, indicating that microbial imbalances may play a role in the onset of disorders like ASD and ADHD.

Non-specific symptoms and limitations of existing diagnostics involve challenges for informed policymaking and clinical practice. This paper reviews common practices in reporting the selection and definition of cost and effect parameters, and in reporting the translation of effect parameters into utility and disability weights, in health economic evaluations of TB diagnostic tests. A targeted literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar identified health economic evaluations of diagnosis and population screening strategies for TB. We found 28 studies comprising 11 cost-effectiveness and 17 cost-utility analyses. Observed patient data were used in 6 studies, 22 relied solely on model-based evaluations. Variations in prevalence, accuracy, and utility parameters were common, the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards terminology for costing was only used in 8 out of 28 studies. Future studies should state the exact type of TB studied, as it can manifest in multiple organs, remain inactive for long periods of time, and since different diagnostics can perform differently depending on the site involved it may influence test accuracies. Additionally, potential impacts of sequential diagnostics on test accuracy and the cost of inaction should receive more attention. Precise terminology and transparent definitions of parameters and methodology in health economics evaluations are necessary to generate evidence that guides policymakers and supports clinical decision-making in the context of TB.",

Thus, this study co-designed an integrated care pathway for depression case finding and treatment in TB services, that can be delivered by non-mental health specialists within a low resourced settings. We conducted a total of 10 'co-design' workshops with people with TB, carers, tuberculosis and mental health healthcare providers between June and August 2021 in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Peshawar, Pakistan. We adapted the 'Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University' for our codesign process. Information gathered during the workshop, through recordings and contemporaneous notes taking, was collated, and analysed to develop the integrated care pathways and materials for impmenting the carepathway. We co-designed and developed a culturally adaptable care pathway that integrates depression screening into tuberculosis (TB) care, working closely with people affected by TB and healthcare workers in primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings in Bangladesh and Pakistan. We used PHQ-9 only to identify and screen for depression among people with TB in Bangladesh, whereas both PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were used for depression screening among the Pakistani population. A trained paramedic or laboratory technologist (Bangladesh) and DOTS Facilitator (Pakistan), working within the TB facilities were identified and agreed to deliver the integrated depression screening services. Stakeholders valued the opportunity to jointly design a care pathway. Iterative and coordinated working with these stakeholders enabled the researchers to understand better, explore and refine the co-design process. This approach assisted in mobilising knowledge about depression and integrating screening for depression within the existing usual TB care pathway, using the lived experience of people with TB and health workers' expertise.",

The current prevention and treatment options are limited and increasingly complicated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. This study employs reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine targeting the MPB83, ArfA, DnaK, GrpE, and LpqH proteins of <i>M. bovis</i>. The T-cell and B-cell epitopes of the candidate vaccine were predicted and evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. The promising epitopes were then assembled into three vaccine constructs (bTBV1, bTBV2, and bTBV3) using appropriate adjuvants, pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE), and linkers. The constructs were analyzed for physicochemical properties, 3D structure, cytokines induction and stability, followed by molecular docking with bovine CD molecules and toll-like receptor, TLR-9. Among the candidates, bTBV3 was chosen as one of the most promising vaccine candidates due to its high aliphatic index (67.60), lowest instability score (27.26), and a strong binding affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations and the results of interactions between the vaccine-receptor complexes (eigenvalue 2.318704e-06) show that the vaccine construct bTBV3 is stable. <i>In silico</i> immune simulation findings, such as elevated IgM levels and increased Th cell populations, suggest that the designed multi-epitope vaccine candidate bTBV3 elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, confirming the vaccine's potential efficacy. Additionally, codon optimization (CAI: 0.997 and GC: 54.687%) and <i>in silico</i> cloning facilitated efficient expression in <i>E. coli</i>.

Wars and the resulting migratory waves massively disrupt normal animal health services and surveillance. Among other consequences, they adversely impact the early detection, prevention, and control of animal diseases. Uncontrolled movement of animals or their undisposed carcasses, the destruction of wildlife habitats, and the increased interface between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals contribute to uncontrolled transmission and spread of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. In the last millennium, zoonotic diseases such as the \"Black Death\" were triggered by devastating wars and led to the deaths of a large fraction of the human population. However, also recent and ongoing wars carry the risk of an uncontrollable increase in zoonotic diseases. The most significant zoonotic diseases reported during the recent wars are African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, rabies, leptospirosis, and brucellosis, as well as foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases. Indeed, alarming rates of infections by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> go along with wars, as seen in the current Ukraine-Russia conflict. Considering human migration, foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases are key health threats for refugees due to the consumption of unsafe food, lack of safe water, and disruption of the water supply and sanitation system.

Spatial autocorrelation analysis utilizing Moran's I revealed geographical clusters and significant determinants affecting TB incidence. Treatment success rates and MDR-TB treatment initiation were identified as pivotal determinants of TB incidence. The correlation study revealed a substantial positive relationship between TB incidence in HIV-positive patients and overall TB incidence (r = 0.83). Confirmed cases of MDR-TB had the most significant impact on TB incidence (SHAP = 0.874). Additionally, air pollution had a notable impact on TB incidence (SHAP = 1.36). The XGBoost model demonstrated the best predictive performance for TB incidence and mortality, exhibiting the lowest RMSE (0.88), the highest R<sup>2</sup> (0.67), and Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> (0.65).

This study evaluated the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), an improved version of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), for detecting TBM in children using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Children (0-14 years) presumptive of TBM were enrolled prospectively from three tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from December 2019 to January 2022. CSF was tested by Ultra, Xpert, Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) culture, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy. Diagnostic performance was assessed against clinical case definitions, composite microbiological reference standard (CMRS), and L-J culture. Of 187 children, Ultra detected TBM in 23.4% of cases, significantly higher than the 9.1% detected by Xpert (p < 0.001). Compared to the clinical case definition of probable and definite TBM, Ultra exhibited a sensitivity of 88% (44/50), markedly outperforming Xpert (34%, 17/50) and L-J culture (30%, 15/50) (p < 0.001). Against the CMRS, Ultra's sensitivity was 100% (44/44), compared to Xpert (38.6%, 17/44) and L-J culture (34.1%, 15/44) (p < 0.001). AFB microscopy showed very low sensitivity (2.3%, 1/44). Negative predictive values for both clinical case definition and CMRS were higher for Ultra (95.8-100%) than Xpert (80.6-84.1%) and L-J culture (79.7-83.1%) (p < 0.001). Compared to gold standard L-J culture, Ultra's sensitivity (100%, 15/15) was also higher than Xpert (93.3%, 14/15) (p = 0.316), with specificities of 83.1% (143/172) and 98.3% (169/172), respectively. Ultra detected 26 TBM cases missed by other tests, with most (84.6%) in the 'trace detected' category. Due to the high performance, Ultra can be used widely at health care settings of high TB burden countries like Bangladesh for rapid and accurate diagnosis of paediatric TBM using CSF samples.",

        "abstract": "TB and helminth infections are co-endemic in many parts of the world. This has led to the hypothesis that immunomodulation due to helminth infections could adversely affect the ability to control <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection. Anti-helminthic treatment has been associated with improved anti-mycobacterial cellular responses and decreases in the frequency of regulatory T-cells. We therefore investigated how control of mycobacterial growth and anti-mycobacterial immune responses are modulated in helminth and TB co-infected individuals using a mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA). Migrants with eosinophilia or suspected/diagnosed helminth infection and/or TB infection (TBI) were recruited when attending University College London Hospitals (London, UK) and followed up after completing anti-helminthic treatment. Mycobacterial growth inhibition was assessed using the BACTEC™ MGIT™ system after 72 hours of co-culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with <i>M</i>. <i>bovis</i> bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or <i>M. tuberculosis</i> Erdman. Anti-helminthic treatment reduced total and helminth-specific antibodies in helminth-infected and TBI-helminth co-infected individuals. Helminth-infected individuals displayed lower growth inhibition in the MGIA than those without helminth infections, and mycobacterial growth inhibition improved after anti-helminthic treatment. Blocking interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) improved mycobacterial growth inhibition, while blocking interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) did not alter growth inhibition. Infection with helminths such as <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> and <i>Strongyloides</i> spp. may reduce the ability to control mycobacterial growth.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis is one of the oldest diseases that still affects millions of people worldwide and remains a significant public health challenge. The N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme metabolizes isoniazid (INH), a primary antibiotic in tuberculosis treatment. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NAT2 affect the metabolism and function of isoniazid. The rs1801280 (T341C) and rs1208 (G803A) variants of NAT2 are associated with INH drug responses. Individuals with the slow-metabolizing rs1801280 variant of the NAT2 enzyme are at a higher risk of INH-induced liver damage and require lower doses or longer treatment regimens. At the same time, individuals with the fast-metabolizing rs1208 variant are at risk of treatment failure due to rapid drug metabolism. Genotyping of the NAT2 variants can help clinicians personalize tuberculosis treatment, optimize drug doses, and thus minimize adverse effects. Under this study, an allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) method was developed for genotyping the NAT2 variants, and the results were validated through targeted sequencing. The allele frequencies at the rs1801280 locus were 0.60 for the T allele and 0.40 for the C. For rs1208, the participants' allele frequencies were 0.27 for the G allele and 0.73 for the A allele. This ASPCR method is quick, affordable, and could be used in routine genotyping to personalize the treatment for tuberculosis patients, leading to more effective and safer treatments. We also used molecular docking to study how the rs1801280 and rs1208 variants affect the interaction between the NAT2 enzyme and drugs. A slight change was visible in the flexibility of the amino acid residues. However, those amino acids were not involved in the ligand binding mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Declared as one of the ten most pressing threats to global health in 2019, the complexity around vaccine acceptance and hesitancy has once again gained great momentum following the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of vaccine acceptance may endanger the mission of improving vaccine uptake globally to tackle pandemics, reduce morbidity and mortality of preventable diseases and to prevent antibiotic resistance worldwide. Countries of the global south, including South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries are especially affected by the dangers of low vaccination uptake and continue to show decreases in coverage in recent years. This paper examines factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy in south Asia and the extent to which they are context and disease specific, guided by a modified version of the WHO SAGE 5 C model by Razai et al. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles by using a comprehensive search strategy. Results from 44 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies were included in the systematic review and appraised for quality, thematically analyzed and mapped onto the 5 C model. findings from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed vaccine hesitancy to be context and vaccine-specific within different settings of the countries. The main factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy can be identified as narrow confidence in vaccines, miscommunication, and lack of knowledge embedded into overarching constraints and contexts. To tackle vaccine hesitancy in SAARC countries, interventions need to be co-created by communities and mutual trust needs to be ensured, for instance through increased equity in knowledge distribution.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of drug resistance in patients with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial for prompt and effective treatment. This study evaluated the performance of Xpert MTB/XDR assay (Xpert XDR) for detecting resistance to isoniazid (INH), fluoroquinolones (FLQ), aminoglycosides (AMG), and ethionamide (ETH) in patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) in Bangladesh. Xpert XDR was performed on sputum samples from 793 Xpert MTB/RIF positive patients with PTB enrolled between April 2021 and March 2023. Results were compared with phenotypic drug susceptibility test (pDST) performed on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) media for the detection of resistance to INH, FLQ, AMG, and ETH. The performance of the assay was also compared between newly diagnosed or rifampicin (RIF)-sensitive versus re-treated or RIF-resistant patients with PTB. Of 793 samples tested by Xpert XDR, indeterminate results for INH, FLQ, AMG, and ETH were observed for 3 (0.4%), 5 (0.6%), 33 (4.2%), and 0 (0%) isolates, respectively. The assay's sensitivity and specificity compared to pDST was 94.0% (95% CI 90.5-96.4; 264/281) and 97.3% (95% CI 95.4-98.5; 495/509), respectively for INH; 86.0% (95% CI 78.2-91.8; 98/114) and 99.3% (95% CI 98.3-99.3; 669/674), respectively for FLQ; 85.7% (95% CI 42.1-99.6; 6/7) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.3-100.0; 752/753), respectively for AMG; and 25.0% (95% CI 19.0-31.7; 48/192) and 96.7% (95% CI 94.9-98.0; 581/601), respectively for ETH. Agreement of Xpert XDR with pDST was almost perfect for detecting resistance to INH, FLQ, and AMG (kappa: 0.91, 0.89, and 0.86, respectively), but fair for ETH (kappa: 0.28). Xpert XDR performed significantly better among re-treated or RIF-resistant patients with TB compared to newly diagnosed or RIF-sensitive cases. Given the high performance, Xpert XDR assay can be programmatically implemented nationwide for rapid and accurate detection of resistance to INH, FLQ, and AMG in patients with PTB, aiding clinicians in selecting appropriate regimens for the treatment of drug-resistant TB.",

The main target of the illness is young Asian adults and is more prevalent in females. This disease probably has viral triggering or autoimmune responses, and diagnosis depends on histopathological examination. We present a case of an 18-month history of recurrent high-grade fever with marked weight loss and an enlarged occipital lymph node in a 42-year-old diabetic male from Karachi, Pakistan. The patient's symptoms did not subside despite being hospitalized several times and receiving multiple courses of antibiotics. Physical examination revealed a firm, non-tender occipital lymph node. Laboratory studies showed mild anemia and leukopenia, raised inflammatory markers, but unremarkable imaging studies and autoimmune tests. An excisional biopsy of the lymph node confirmed KFD with necrotizing lymphadenitis showing characteristic karyorrhectic debris. This case epitomizes the diagnostic challenges of KFD, which can mimic a host of conditions like tuberculosis and lymphoma. The recurrent fevers in the presence of significant weight loss and failure to respond to the usual treatments raised suspicion for further detailed investigation. Excisional biopsy established the diagnosis and differentiated it from other conditions. The patient's rapid improvement with corticosteroid therapy aligns with established treatment protocols for KFD, thus proving its efficacy. KFD should be included in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin. Diagnosis and management of KFD can avoid misdiagnosis and hence improve patient outcomes.",

Among 1,967 children with reported outcomes, 99.3% (<i>n</i> = 1,954) were successful. The primary reason for unsuccessful treatment was LTFU (<i>n</i> = 12, 0.6%), followed by treatment failure (<i>n</i> = 1, 0.1%).

In addition to pulmonary symptoms, tuberculosis can also manifest outside the lungs. The ocular involvement of tuberculosis, often presenting as primary tuberculous chorioretinitis (PTCR), poses a significant diagnostic challenge for healthcare professionals. This review article sheds light on the intricate nature of diagnosing tuberculous infectious diseases in Bangladesh, highlighting the specific challenges faced in this setting. Despite commendable progress in tuberculosis control in Bangladesh, the advanced diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly when it involves the eyes, presents formidable obstacles. This is especially true in cases of primary tuberculous chorioretinitis, which can pose a grave threat to vision and lead to life-threatening conditions, particularly in resource-poor settings. The article underscores the necessity for innovative and improvised diagnostic approaches to address the unique nature of these cases. Furthermore, the article delves into the implications of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the eye, emphasizing its potential to cause severe blindness. To mitigate bias and enhance patient outcomes, the healthcare community must focus on raising public awareness, improving diagnostic techniques, and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards. This multifaceted approach is essential to effectively combat the challenges posed by tuberculosis, particularly in cases involving ocular manifestations.",

Established smoking cessation approaches such as mHealth may help patients with TB quit smoking. This paper summarises the methodology proposed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mTB-Tobacco (an mHealth intervention) in helping patients with TB stop smoking and have improved health outcomes. A two-arm, parallel, open-label, multicentre, cluster randomised, two-stage adaptive design trial is proposed to first evaluate the superiority of mTB-Tobacco, compared with usual care and then the non-inferiority of mTB-tobacco compared with face-to-face behaviour support. Study settings include TB treatment centres in Bangladesh and Pakistan. The study population includes adult patients, newly diagnosed (within 4 weeks) with pulmonary TB disease, daily smokers, willing to quit and have access to mobile phones. The primary outcome includes biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence assessed at 6 months per Russell Standard. A generalised linear mixed-effects model will be used to assess the impact of mTB-Tobacco intervention on continuous outcomes, incorporating fixed effects for the intervention, random effects for clusters and relevant covariates. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be done to estimate the cost per quitter and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to establish the value for money for mTB-Tobacco.

        "title": "Frequency of Lower Lung Field Tuberculosis in Diabetes Mellitus Patients Attending Tertiary Care Hospital in Bangladesh: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "People who have diabetes mellitus (DM) are thought to be more susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Several published comparative investigations have reported that chest x-ray images from PTB with DM are considered atypical due to their frequent involvement of the lower lung field (LLF). This study aimed to investigate the frequency of lower lung field tuberculosis (LLF-TB) in DM and the risk factor of DM for the development of TB. This study was a cross-sectional study. PTB was diagnosed by positive sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB),/Culture,/Gene Xpert MTB/RIF, and DM, which was proven by taking oral hypoglycemic drugs or receiving insulin at the time of hospital admission. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis and seropositive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were excluded from this study. A chest x-ray posterior-anterior (P/A) view was done to assess the frequency and patterns of lung involvement. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factor of DM for the development of TB. A total of 117 PTB-DM participants were studied in this study. The mean age and frequency of isolated LLF-TB were 53.17 ± 14.38 years and 20.5%, respectively. The prevalence of LLF-TB and other radiological patterns were statistically significantly correlated with smear positivity (83.3% vs. 20.4%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 50 mm (95.8% vs. 16.1%), and HbA1c > 7 (79.2% vs. 16.1%). Regression analysis showed that the odds ratio (OR) was 6.81 and 3.93 for DM and age (> 40 years) for the development of LLF-TB (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The frequency of LLF-TB among PTB DM patients was around 1/5th. The development of LLF-TB was substantially associated with DM and age greater than 40 years.",

        "abstract": "There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230). 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success. Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

        "abstract": "Programmatic interventions to increase the detection of children with tuberculosis (TB) are rarely evaluated to understand age- and sex-specific completion rates. We applied modified TB screening and treatment cascade frameworks to assess indicators of effective implementation by age and sex of a TB screening program for children (zero to 14 years) in Bangladesh. We implemented an intensified screening program for paediatric TB detection in 119 health care facilities (2018-21). We followed systematic verbal screening by referral for full evaluation for children who reported symptoms or contact history with a patient with TB. Further, we linked children to treatment if diagnosed and followed for outcomes. We calculated the percentage of children, by age and sex, progressing through each step of the care cascade and compared the frequency of step completion by sex using χ<sup>2</sup> tests. In total, we screened 552 182 males and 461 419 females for TB. 2.8% of males and 2.6% of females screened positive (P < 0.001). 74.2% of males and 73.9% of females underwent appropriate evaluation (P = 0.560). 10.3% of males and 11.5% of females were diagnosed with TB (P = 0.008). 100% of children initiated treatment, and 97.6% of males and 97.1% of females achieved a successful treatment outcome (P = 0.428). The percent of children screening positive on verbal screen, who were clinically evaluated for TB, and who were diagnosed with TB generally increased with age, with some variability throughout (ranges: 1.2-9.1%, 59.8-88.5%, 6.5-21.9%, respectively). The largest gap observed for both sexes and among all ages was children who were not appropriately evaluated for TB despite screening positive. In our research, we highlight the value of identifying gaps in paediatric TB care to inform innovative, age- and sex-tailored interventions to improve future care in children.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death due to infectious disease. It is a treatable disease; however, conventional treatment requires a lengthy treatment regimen with severe side effects, resulting in poor compliance among TB patients. Intermittent drug use, the non-compliance of patients, and prescription errors, among other factors, have led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB, while the mismanagement of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) has eventually led to the development of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). Thus, there is an urgent need for new drug development, but due to the enormous expenses and time required (up to 20 years) for new drug research and development, new therapeutic approaches to TB are required. Host-directed therapies (HDT) could be a most attractive strategy, as they target the host defense processes instead of the microbe and thereby may prevent the alarming rise of MDR- and XDR-TB. This paper reviews the progress in HDT for the treatment of TB using repurposed drugs which have been investigated in clinical trials (completed or ongoing) and plant-derived natural products that are in clinical or preclinical trial stages. Additionally, this review describes the existing challenges to the development and future research directions in the implementation of HDT.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which is one of the most important problems in medical and surgical patients. Therefore, it is very important to identify the influencing factors to reduce the dimensions of the problem. This study was conducted to investigate the mortality rate in medical and surgical patients with AKI requiring CRRT treatment. In this observational study, which was conducted as a cross- sectional analytical study, 100 patients with AKI requiring CRRT treatment, including medical and surgical patients, were selected from 2018 to 2021 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital. The mortality rate was estimated. Also, the effective factors were investigated and compared between the dead and surviving patients. 85 cases (85%) of the patients died. Most underlying and demographic variables had no statistically significant difference between the dead and surviving patients (P>0.05). However, in the cases of primary calcium (P=0.001), primary leukocyte (P=0.037), bicarbonate during hospitalization (P=0.025), bicarbonate during AKI (P=0.028), magnesium during hospitalization (P=0.038), and magnesium at the end of CRRT (P=0.019), the differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, mortality is observed in 5 out of 6 patients with acute kidney failure who need CRRT treatment, which is related to risk factors such as bicarbonate, magnesium, leukocyte, and calcium levels. Therefore, multifaceted planning is needed to reduce its dimensions to improve the prognosis of this group of patients.",

        "abstract": "Leishmanias is a parasitic infection caused by a protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania and transmitted by sand fly, Phlebotomus fly in the old world and Lutzomyia in the New world. The disease is prevalent in the tropics, subtropics, and Southern Europe, where it affects about 1.5 million to 2 million people annually. India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil and Ethiopia account for up to 90% of all the VL cases. While Leishmania cases in Asia are declining, cases in East Africa especially in Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have been increasing. The rise in East African cases is partially attributed to ongoing armed conflicts especially in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan, which has displaced people and increased their exposure to sand fly bites. Migration from endemic to non-endemic regions, misdiagnosis, famine, malnutrition, climate change and an increase in HIV cases are other contributing factors. The clinical diagnosis of Leishmania in East Africa combines the patient's clinical signs with either serological or parasitological test, with rK39 strip and microscopy being the major methods used. Diagnosis of the condition remains challenging, as current techniques have limitations, including the inability to detect parasites in tissue, the need for specialized expertise, prohibitive costs of testing equipment, low antibody titers, and the risk of misdiagnosis due to co-infections with diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid. Various techniques, including serological and molecular parasitological methods, have been employed in attempts to address these challenges, but with limited success. This article therefore, reviews some of the techniques that have been used in Leishmania diagnosis in East Africa and discusses other available new techniques with aim of overcoming the current challenges.",

We sought to undertake such measurements in the little studied Bangladeshi population. The MAGPIE (Multidimensional Approach of Genotype and Phenotype in Stroke Etiology) study is a Bangladeshi stroke case-control study that recruited nationwide between January 2022 and June 2024. The univariate analysis was utilised to curtail the risk of independent variables, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to identify the cut-off values of Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC), and Hip Circumference (HC). Furthermore, a multivariate logistic regression (LR) model demonstrated the risk of independent predictors of haemorrhagic stroke (HS) among sexes. Of a total of 1491 age- and sex-matched study population, 918 were haemorrhagic stroke (61.5%) with female predominance (n=489; 53.3%) and significantly older than men (P=0.003). The BMI (22.9 ±3.0 vs 21.3 ±3.0; P<0.001), WC (84.0 ±7.3 vs 80.8 ±7.3; P<0.001) and HC (90.6 ±7.1 vs 85.5 ±7.7; P<0.001) was significantly higher among women compared to men. A ROC curve demonstrated that the cut-off values of BMI, WC, and HC are 20.6kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 78.8cm, and 84.6cm, respectively, in men and 21.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 81.5cm, and 88.1cm, respectively, in women haemorrhagic stroke population. Furthermore, an age-adjusted multivariate LR model identified a HC of ≥84.6 cm in men (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.61-4.97; P <0.001) and a WC of ≥81.5cm in women (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.01-2.37; P=0.001) as potential independent predictors of haemorrhagic stroke.

        "abstract": "Chest disease identification for Tuberculosis and Pneumonia diseases presents diagnostic challenges due to overlapping radiographic features and the limited availability of expert radiologists, especially in developing countries. The present study aims to address these challenges by developing a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to provide consistent and objective analyses of chest X-ray images, thereby reducing potential human error. By leveraging the complementary strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), we propose a hybrid model for the accurate detection of Tuberculosis and for distinguishing between Tuberculosis and Pneumonia. We designed a two-step hybrid model that integrates the ResNet-50 CNN with the ViT-b16 architecture. It uses the transfer learning on datasets from <i>Guangzhou Women's and Children's Medical Center</i> for Pneumonia cases and datasets from <i>Qatar and Dhaka (Bangladesh) universities</i> for Tuberculosis cases. CNNs capture hierarchical structures in images, while ViTs, with their self-attention mechanisms, excel at identifying relationships between features. Combining these approaches enhances the model's performance on binary and multi-class classification tasks. Our hybrid CNN-ViT model achieved a binary classification accuracy of 98.97% for Tuberculosis detection. For multi-class classification, distinguishing between Tuberculosis, viral Pneumonia, and bacterial Pneumonia, the model achieved an accuracy of 96.18%. These results underscore the model's potential in improving diagnostic accuracy and reliability for chest disease classification based on X-ray images. The proposed hybrid CNN-ViT model demonstrates substantial potential in advancing the accuracy and robustness of CAD systems for chest disease diagnosis. By integrating CNN and ViT architectures, our approach enhances the diagnostic precision, which may help to alleviate the burden on healthcare systems in resource-limited settings and improve patient outcomes in chest disease diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Despite 30 years as a public health emergency, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world's deadliest diseases. Most deaths are among persons with TB who are not reached with diagnosis and treatment. Thus, timely screening and accurate detection of TB, particularly using sensitive tools such as chest radiography, is crucial for reducing the global burden of this disease. However, lack of qualified human resources represents a common limiting factor in many high TB-burden countries. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful complement in many facets of life, including for the interpretation of chest X-ray images. However, while AI may serve as a viable alternative to human radiographers and radiologists, there is a high likelihood that those suffering from TB will not reap the benefits of this technological advance without appropriate, clinically effective use and cost-conscious deployment. The World Health Organization recommended the use of AI for TB screening in 2021, and early adopters of the technology have been using the technology in many ways. In this manuscript, we present a compilation of early user experiences from nine high TB-burden countries focused on practical considerations and best practices related to deployment, threshold and use case selection, and scale-up. While we offer technical and operational guidance on the use of AI for interpreting chest X-ray images for TB detection, our aim remains to maximize the benefit that programs, implementers, and ultimately TB-affected individuals can derive from this innovative technology.",

        "abstract": "The 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) recommend 6 months of bedaquiline (Bdq) in the all-oral 9-month shorter regimen and 6 months or longer for Bdq and delamanid (Dlm) in the 18-20-month longer regimen. However, lack of evidence on extended treatment using Bdq or Dlm has limited their use to 6 months. We examine the frequency and incidence of QT prolongation based on duration of Bdq and/or Dlm use in longer regimens. We analyzed a prospective cohort of MDR/RR-TB patients from 16 countries who initiated treatment with Bdq and/or Dlm containing regimens from 1 April 2015 to 30 September 2018. Data were systematically collected using a shared protocol. The outcome of interest was the first clinically relevant prolonged QT interval (grade 3 or above) or a serious adverse event (SAE) involving prolonged QT of any grade. Among 2553 patients, 59% received >6 months of Bdq and/or Dlm. Of these, 579 (20.9%) patients experienced a prolonged QT event, the majority (95.5%) being grade 1 or 2. Sixty-four (2.5%) patients experienced the outcome of interest with only 12 (0.5%) having ≥1 QT prolonging drugs permanently suspended. The incidence rate of the first prolonged QT event was highest in the first six months of treatment and lower in subsequent 6-month periods. We demonstrate that Bdq and/or Dlm use beyond 6 months is safe in longer MDR/RR-TB regimens with most clinically relevant QT prolongation events occurring in the first 6 months. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for early identification of QT prolongating events is possible in programmatic conditions.",

However, since there is no worldwide-implemented standard test for M. leprae infection, detection of infection in asymptomatic individuals remains a major challenge for control programs in endemic areas. In previous studies, we developed and field-tested a lateral flow assay (LFA) quantitatively detecting human IgM against M. leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid I (anti-PGL-I), a marker for both active and past infection. This rapid test utilizes luminescent, background-free, up-converting reporter particles (UCP) and immunochromatography (i.e. the UCP-LF test platform) for accurate quantitation of anti-PGL-I IgM without operator bias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the final version of this quantitative UCP-based rapid test (i.e. PGL-I QURapid), using serum and fingerstick blood (FSB). The test comprises a lateral flow strip, in a standard plastic or biodegradable cassette. It can be provided with a humanized, recombinant control to monitor test performance and calculate accurate anti-PGL-I IgM levels. The performance of this QUR-test was assessed using serum and FSB from patients with leprosy (n = 214), tuberculosis (n = 20), buruli ulcer (n = 19), leishmaniasis (n = 14), non-tuberculous mycobacterial (n = 35) infections, as well as healthy Dutch individuals (n = 710) and humanized, recombinant anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies. Plot receiver operating characteristic curves were created and sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and the area under the curve were calculated to evaluate test performance. Test results classified multibacillary leprosy patients with 95.0% Sn and 100% Sp using serum and 91.5% Sn and 99.8% Sp using FSB. Qualitative test results could be read after 2 min flow time, with accurate quantitation from 10 min onwards. The new anti-PGL-I IgM control supports production of batches with predetermined seropositivity thresholds and monitoring of the PGL-I QUR-test in various settings. The operational version of the PGL-I QURapid with point-of-care applicability, meets the WHO target product profile criteria. Thus, this QUR-test is ready for public health implementations.",

        "abstract": "Reverse zoonosis or zooanthroponosis is the transfer of pathogens from humans to animals. Although less studied than zoonotic diseases, this phenomenon poses significant risks to both animal and public health. The increasing human-animal interactions driven by urbanization, globalization, and environmental changes have exacerbated the occurrence of reverse zoonosis. This review evaluated the global impact and transmission patterns of reverse zoonosis, highlighting the anthropogenic and intrinsic factors contributing to its emergence. The study performed a systematic review and included 91 scientific articles published from 2000 to 2022, covering viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and protozoal reverse zoonoses. This study indicated that viral infections, particularly respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and influenza, have the highest incidence of reverse zoonosis, followed by bacterial infections like tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The United States, India, and Hong Kong are among the most reported regions for reverse zoonotic events. Major risk factors identified include environmental degradation, climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and global wildlife trade. The review underscores the need for enhanced surveillance systems, interdisciplinary collaboration, and stringent regulations on wildlife trade and animal husbandry practices to mitigate the risks associated with reverse zoonosis. Understanding the dynamics of human-animal pathogen transmission is crucial for developing not only effective but also sustainable strategies to protect animal populations as well as public health from emerging infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "This study has been carried out using a novel mathematical model on the dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) transmission considering vaccination, endogenous re-activation of the dormant infection, and exogenous re-infection. We can comprehend the behavior of TB under the influence of vaccination from this article. We compute the basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>R</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </math> ) as well as the vaccination reproduction number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>v</mi></msub> </math> ) using the next-generation matrix (NGM) approach. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable, and the fractional order system is Ulam-Hyers type stable. We perform numerical simulation of our model using the Adams-Bashforth 3-step method to verify the theoretical results and to show the model outputs graphically. By performing data fitting, we observe that our formulated model produces results that closely match real-world data. Our findings indicate that vaccinating a limited segment of the population can effectively eradicate the disease. The numerical simulations also show that vaccination can reduce the number of susceptible and infectious individuals in the population. Moreover, the graphical representations illustrate that the number of infected individuals rises due to both exogenous reinfection and endogenous reactivation.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide. Bangladesh ranks 7th among the 30 high TB burdened countries in the world. Accurate detection of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTBC) is challenging for developing countries as most of the resource poor settings are not suitable to perform molecular techniques. The purpose of the study was to compare the multiplex TB-LAMP assay with MTB/NTM qPCR, culture, Z-N staining, and fluorescence microscopy in order to assess the effectiveness of the LAMP assay for detecting cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. This research work was done from March 2022 to February 2023. Fulfilling the inclusion criteria 130 sputum samples were collected. TB-LAMP assay, qPCR, culture in L-J media, Z-N staining and fluorescence microscopy were performed. Out of 130 samples qPCR detected MTBC in 56.92 % cases and TB-LAMP detected 53.85 %. MTBC was detected by culture 46.15 %, by Fluorescence microscopy 40.77 % and Z-N staining 36.92 %. TB-LAMP detected 16.93 % more cases than Z-N staining and 13.08 % more cases than fluorescence microscopy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of multiplex-LAMP assay were 95 %, 81.4 %, 81.4 % and 95 % respectively considering culture as a gold-standard. MTBC negative culture samples (18.57 %) showed positivity by LAMP assay as well as by qPCR. This study detected 7.69 % non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) by qPCR. All NTM positive samples were negative by TB-LAMP. TB-LAMP is an easy to perform, cost-effective, reliable assay with high sensitivity and specificity. World Health Organization recommended TB-LAMP as a rapid molecular test for rapid detection of tuberculosis and as replacement of microscopy in resource poor settings/hard to reach areas. Bangladesh being a high TB burden country it is essential to implement TB-LAMP to achieve End TB Strategy by 2035.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health issue in South Asia and accounts for a large share of the global TB burden. Despite global efforts to curb TB incidence and mortality, progress in South Asia has been uneven, necessitating focused regional analysis to guide effective interventions. This study aims to analyse the trends in the TB burden in South Asia from 1990 to 2021 and project future TB incidence rates up to 2031. This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 results to analyse trends in age-standardized incidence (ASIR), prevalence (ASPR), mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates (ASDR) associated with TB in South Asia from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to identify significant trends, whereas ARIMA models were used to project future TB incidence rates up to 2031. This study revealed significant declines in the ASIR, ASPR, ASDR, and ASMR related to TB in South Asia over the past three decades. Prominent reductions were found in Bangladesh and Bhutan, whereas India, Pakistan, and Nepal continue to bear the highest TB burdens. The ARIMA model projections indicate a continued decline in TB incidence across the region, although the extent of the decline varies by country, with less favourable trends observed in Nepal and Pakistan. The analysis also highlights tobacco use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index as significant risk factors contributing to the TB burden. Substantial progress has been made in reducing the TB burden in South Asia; however, sustained and intensified efforts are needed, particularly in countries with inconsistent progress. These findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to meet the WHO End TB Strategy (WETS) targets by 2035. Continuous monitoring and adaptive strategies will be crucial in maintaining and accelerating progress toward TB elimination in South Asia.",

        "abstract": "Cancer prevention and care efforts have been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic and armed conflicts, resulting in a decline in the global Human Development Index (HDI), particularly in low- and middle-income countries. These challenges and subsequent shifts in health care priorities underscore the need to continuously monitor cancer outcome disparities and statistics globally to ensure delivery of equitable and optimal cancer prevention and care in uncertain times. To measure the global burden of 36 cancers in 2022 by sex, age, and geographic location and to project future trends by 2050. This cross-sectional study used population-based data from 2022 in 185 countries and territories were obtained from the Global Cancer Observatory database. Data extraction and analysis were carried out in April 2024. Counts, rates, prevalence, mortality to incidence ratios (MIRs), and demography-based projections were used to characterize current and future cancer burden. This population-based study included 36 cancer types from 185 countries and territories. By 2050, 35.3 million cancer cases worldwide are expected, a 76.6% increase from the 2022 estimate of 20 million. Similarly, 18.5 million cancer deaths are projected by 2050, an 89.7% increase from the 2022 estimate of 9.7 million. Cancer cases and deaths are projected to nearly triple in low-HDI countries by 2050, compared to a moderate increase in very high-HDI countries (142.1% vs 41.7% for cancer cases and 146.1% vs 56.8% for cancer deaths). Males had a higher incidence and greater number of deaths in 2022 than females, with this disparity projected to widen by up to 16.0% in 2050. In 2022, the MIR for all cancers was 46.6%, with higher MIRs observed for pancreatic cancer (89.4%), among males (51.7%), among those aged 75 years or older (64.3%), in low-HDI countries (69.9%), and in the African region (67.2%). In this cross-sectional study based on data from 2022, cancer disparities were evident across HDI, geographic regions, age, and sex, with further widening projected by 2050. These findings suggest that strengthening access to and quality of health care, including universal health insurance coverage, is key to providing evidence-based cancer prevention, diagnostics, and care.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the trends and current situation of the injury burden as well as attributable burden to injury risk factors at global, regional, and national levels based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 are presented. To assess the attributable burden of injury risk factors, the data of interest on data sources were retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and analyzed. Cause-specific death from injuries was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model in the GBD 2019. The burden attributable to each injury risk factor was incorporated in the population attributable fraction to estimate the total attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) was used to evaluate countries' developmental status. Globally, there were 713.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 663.8 to 766.9) injuries incidence and 4.3 million (UI: 3.9 to 4.6) deaths caused by injuries in 2019. There was an inverse relationship between age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate and SDI quintiles in 2019. Overall, low bone mineral density was the leading risk factor of injury deaths in 2019, with a contribution of 10.5% (UI: 9.0 to 11.6) of total injuries and age-standardized deaths, followed by occupational risks (7.0% [UI: 6.3-7.9]) and alcohol use (6.8% [UI: 5.2 to 8.5]). Various risks were responsible for the imposed burden of injuries. This study highlighted the small but persistent share of injuries in the global burden of diseases and injuries to provide beneficial data to produce proper policies to reach an effective global injury prevention plan.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) is a significant global health issue due to its high incidence, drug resistance, contagious nature, and impact on people with compromised immune systems. As mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is responsible for more global fatalities than any other infectious illness. On the other side, WHO also claims that noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people yearly worldwide. In this regard, several studies suggest that PTB and NCDs are linked in various ways and that people with PTB are more likely to acquire NCDs. At the same time, NCDs can increase susceptibility to active TB infection. Furthermore, because of potential drug interactions and therapeutic challenges, treating individuals with both PTB and NCDs can be difficult. This study focuses on seven NCDs (lung cancer (LC), diabetes mellitus (DM), Parkinson's disease (PD), silicosis (SI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) and rigorously presents the genetic relationship with PTB regarding shared genes and outlines possible treatment plans. BlueThis study aims to identify the drug components that can regulate abnormal gene expression in NCDs. The study will reveal hub genes, potential biomarkers, and drug components associated with hub genes through statistical measures. This will contribute to targeted therapeutic interventions. Numerous investigations, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene regulatory network (GRN), enrichment analysis, physical interaction, and protein-chemical interaction, have been carried out to demonstrate the genetic correlation between PTB and NCDs. During the study, nine shared genes such as TNF, IL10, NLRP3, IL18, IFNG, HMGB1, CXCL8, IL17A, and NFKB1 were discovered between TB and the above-mentioned NCDs, and five hub genes (NFKB1, TNF, CXCL8, NLRP3, and IL10) were selected based on degree values. In this study, we found that all of the hub genes are linked with the 10 drug components, and it was observed that aspirin CTD 00005447 was mostly associated with all the other hub genes. This bio-informatics study may help researchers better understand the cause of PTB and its relationship with NCDs, and eventually, this can lead to exploring effective treatment plans.",

Of 142 articles screened, systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on 22 (15.5%) articles. The apparent estimated bovine tuberculosis prevalence was 7%. The apparent Bayesian pooled mean bovine tuberculosis prevalences based on caudal fold test and single intradermal comparative tuberculin test were 7.83% and 9.89%, respectively, and the true pooled mean prevalences were 10.39% and 10.48%, respectively. Targeted interventions are recommended for districts with higher prevalence to effectively reduce the bovine tuberculosis burden in those areas. Current diagnostic practices employed in Bangladesh may not accurately reflect the bovine tuberculosis burden. Our findings highlight the need for better diagnostic tools and supplemental testing methods to ensure accurate diagnosis and surveillance. Efforts should prioritize obtaining 'true' prevalence estimates corrected for misclassification bias, rather than relying solely on apparent prevalence.

Our study aims to determine the prevalence of INH resistance among pulmonary TB patients in selected health care facilities in Bangladesh. This study was conducted across nine TB Screening and Treatment Centres situated in Bangladesh. Sputum samples from 1084 Xpert-positive pulmonary TB patients were collected between April 2021 and December 2022 and cultured for drug susceptibility testing. Demographic and clinical characteristics of Hr-TB and drug-susceptible TB patients were compared. Among available drug susceptibility testing results of 998 culture-positive isolates, the resistance rate of any INH regardless of RIF susceptibility was 6.4% (64/998, 95% CI: 4.9-8.2). The rate was significantly higher in previously treated (21.1%, 16/76, 95% CI: 12.0-34.2) compared with newly diagnosed TB patients (5.2%, 48/922, 95% CI: 3.8-6.9) (p < 0.001). The rate of Hr-TB was 4.5% (45/998, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0), which was also higher among previously treated patients (6.6%, 5/76, 95% CI: 1.4-13.5) compared with newly diagnosed TB patients (4.3%; 40/922, 95% CI: 3.1-5.9) (p 0.350). Most importantly, the rate of Hr-TB was more than double compared with MDR-TB (4.5%, 45/998, vs. 1.9%, 19/998) found in the current study. This study reveals a high prevalence of Hr-TB, surpassing even that of the multi-drug-resistant TB in Bangladesh.

        "title": "Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

        "abstract": "The diagnosis of recurrent breast carcinoma is crucial for patient treatment. The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) as a sero-marker among recurrent breast carcinoma patients. This prospective observational study evaluated the serum CA 15-3 among women (age ≥18 years) with recurrent breast carcinoma. The CA 15-3 was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and concentrations were stratified using a cut-off value of 30 U/mL. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve observed that the sensitivity and specificity of the CA 15-3 cut-off value and the area under the AUROC curve demonstrate the goodness-of-fit of the prediction model. A total of 50 patients were recruited, with a mean age of 48.4 ±9.7years. The majority (n=28, 56.0%) of patients were 41 to 50 years old. Further, a total of 42 (84%) patients had high serum levels of CA 15-3, with a mean value of 72.7±9.5 U/mL. At the cut-off level of 30 U/mL, the ROC curve demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 95.7%, 69.4%, 84.1%, and 72.8%, respectively, to diagnose recurrent breast carcinoma. Nonetheless, the area under the ROC (AUROC) curve was 0.712, indicating a satisfactory fit for the prediction model. We found that CA 15-3 level ≥30 U/mL is highly sensitive and specific as a seromarker for detecting recurrent breast cancer among the Bangladeshi population. We recommend routinely monitoring breast cancer survivors using CA 15-3 biomarkers.",

However, there is a dearth of literature investigating the clinical and radiological pattern of sputum positive pulmonary TB among adults in Bangladesh. The current study explored these patterns in presentation. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at outpatients in department of medicine of a tertiary care hospital. A total of 50 newly diagnosed adult cases of smear positive pulmonary TB attending at the Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) corners were consecutively included. Informed written consent was taken before inclusion. Data were collected through face-to-face interview. Radiological presentation was explored using chest X-ray. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 26.0. The average age of patients was 41.0±17.12 years and majority were male (78.0%). The most prevalent respiratory symptom was cough (80.0%) followed by constitutional symptom like fever (70.0%) and weight loss (72.0%). Wasting was the predominant sign (60.0%). Radiologically both lungs were involved in 32.0%, left lung were involved in 30.0% cases and right lung were involved in 26.0% of cases. Twelve percent (12.0%) of patients had normal chest X-ray. Upper zone involvement was commonly observed in this study's patients (66.0%). The predominant pattern was consolidation (46.0%) followed by fibrosis (26.0%), nodular opacity (12.0%), collapse (10.0%), cavity (6.0%), pleural effusion (2.0%) and bronchiectasis (2.0%). Findings of this study would help familiarize and identify the common clinical and radiological presentations of sputum positive pulmonary TB patients in day-to-day practice.",

        "abstract": "This is important to note that altered mental status is not a disease in itself, but rather a symptom with a wide range of potential diagnoses. But a structured approach to assessing the patients with this symptom frequently leads to helpful information and can rule out worst-case scenarios. In cases where fever is followed by changes in consciousness, quick assessment of the patient's level of consciousness and potential causes is decisive. A focused history and physical assessment can help differentiate between structural or medical causes. Asymmetrical neurological findings, such as a dilated and fixed pupil, dysconjugated extraocular movements and asymmetrical motor findings, suggest brainstem dysfunction due to a structural lesion, while symmetrical neurological findings usually indicate a medical disorder. A recent study aimed to identify features of different etiologies, demographic patterns, and common causes of both acute and prolonged febrile illness in patients. This cross-sectional type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from April 2014 to October 2015. Over the study period patients admitted with satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of study and purposively selected (non-probability) from the hospitalized patients. Total 100 cases with febrile illness and altered consciousness meeting the exclusion and inclusion criteria were examined and investigated to find out the actual etiology. Out of 100 patients, it was observed that 26(26.0%) of patients were suffering from pneumonia, 22(22.0%) urinary tract infection, 18(18.0%) meningitis, 14(14.0%) typhoid fever, 8(8.0%) meningo-encephalitis, 6(6.0%) cerebral malaria, 4(4.0%) tuberculosis and 2(2.0%) from tuberculoma.

        "abstract": "Most significant findings from the Global Tuberculosis (TB) Report 2023 indicate that India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) collectively contribute to approximately two-thirds of global TB cases. This study aims to provide crucial data-driven insights and references to improve TB control measures through a comprehensive analysis of these eight high-burden countries. The eight high-burden TB countries analyzed in this study include India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and the DRC. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) of TB were derived from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2021 data. Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression. An age-period-cohort model was applied to examine the risk ratios (RR) of TB across diverse age groups, periods, and birth cohorts. A Bayesian age-period-cohort framework was employed to predict the ASIR of TB by 2030. The study found that the Philippines (average annual percentage change = 3.1%, P < 0.001) exhibited an upward trend from 1990 to 2021. In India, the Philippines, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the RR of TB incidence exceeded 1 after individuals reached 25 years old. Notably, the RR has shown a consistent upward trend since 2001, peaking during the period of 2017-2021 with an estimated RR of 1.5 (P < 0.001) in the Philippines. Similarly, the highest RR was observed during the period of 2017-2021 reaching 1.1 (P < 0.001) in the DRC. In the Philippines, the markedly increasing RR values for TB have been observed among individuals born after 1997-2001. Projections suggest that the ASIR of TB is expected to follow a continued upward trajectory, with an estimated rate of 392.9 per 100,000 by 2030 in the Philippines; India and Indonesia are projected to achieve less than 20.0% of the target set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Among the eight high-burden countries, the Philippines, India and Indonesia are diverging from the goals set by the WHO, and the risk of TB in the Philippines and the DRC shows a trend toward affecting younger populations, which suggests that the management strategies for TB patients need to be further strengthened.",

        "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

        "abstract": "The WHO estimates a gap of about 30% between the incident (10.6 million) and notified (7.5 million) cases of tuberculosis (TB). Combined with the growing recognition in prevalence surveys of the high proportion of cases identified who are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, these data underscore how current symptom screening approaches and use of diagnostic tests with suboptimal performance on sputum miss large numbers of cases. Thus, the development of sputum-free biomarker-based tests for diagnosis is becoming necessary, which the WHO has already identified as a priority for new TB diagnostics.The objective of this study is to evaluate a combination of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples and mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM) as point-of-care (POC) assays to identify TB patients. This prospective diagnostic accuracy study is conducted at the TB Screening and Treatment Centre of International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, on a cohort of adults and adolescents >11 years of age. A total of 614 individuals with presumptive pulmonary TB based on TB signs, symptoms and radiography are being recruited from 28 August 2023. Spot sputum is collected for standard reference testing (L-J culture, GeneXpert MTB/Rif, acid-fast Bacilli microscopy) to fine-tune categorisation of TB disease status for each participant, defined as (1) definite TB (at least one positive standard reference test); (2) probable TB (not microbiologically confirmed but under TB treatment); (3) possible TB (no TB treatment but signs, symptoms and radiography suggestive of TB); (4) other respiratory disease (microbiologically not confirmed and no radiography presenting abnormalities compatible with TB); and (5) unknown (no microbiological evidence with normal/no TB abnormalities with radiography). Urine and EBC specimens will be subjected to LAM POC testing and biobanked for further investigation. Statistical analyses will include an assessment of diagnostic accuracy by constructing receiver operating curves and calculating sensitivity and specificity, as well as post-test probabilities. The study protocol was approved by the Research Review Committee as well as the Ethical Review Committee of icddr,b and recorded under a protocol reference number, PR-2301.

        "abstract": "Around one-quarter of the global population has latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). If left untreated, LTBI has 5-10% lifetime risk of developing into TB. Interferon-gamma release Assays (IGRAs) are more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test for LTBI detection. However, the high cost and complexity of IGRAs are barriers to adoption in resource-constrained settings. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a more affordable IGRA, Standard E TB-Feron (TBE), among different risk groups in Bangladesh. 532 participants of all age groups were enrolled from the TB Screening and Treatment Centers and Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b between June and September 2023. The participants were categorized into four risk groups: healthy people, healthcare workers/ attendants of TB patients, patients with microbiologically confirmed TB, and people with a history of TB. The diagnostic performance of TBE was compared to QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) for all groups. GeneXpert, culture, and microscopy were used to confirm TB microbiologically. TBE had an overall agreement of 85.9% (95% CI, 82.5% to 88.7%), positive percent agreement of 86.1% (95% CI, 80.6% to 90.5%), and negative percent agreement of 85.7% (95% CI, 81.3% -89.4%) with QFT-Plus. Among 81 culture-positive patients, TBE and QFT-Plus were positive for 60 (74.1%) and 62 (76.5%) respectively. Among healthy people, TBE and QFT results were positive for 49 (24.5%) and 59 (29.5%) respectively. Among health workers and contacts, TBE and QFT-Plus were positive for 79 (39.5%) and 73 (35.5%) respectively. We found a substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.71) between TBE and QFT-Plus in detecting LTBI across different groups, suggesting its potential as a cost-effective diagnostic tool. Implementation of TBE in routine clinical practice could increase accessibility to LTBI diagnosis, facilitating the timely initiation of preventative therapy, and leading to a reduction of active TB incidence.",

Here, two molecular techniques were demonstrated such as PCR sequencing-based and GeneXpert assay for rapidly identifying MDR-TB. Pulmonary samples (sputum) were collected from 55 MDR-TB suspected patients from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (NTRL), Dhaka where the research work was partially accomplished and continued in the department of Microbiology, University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We strived for sequencing technique as well as GeneXpert assay to identify mutations in <i>rpo</i>B and <i>kat</i>G genes in MTB strains and sputum directly. Culture-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed to measure the efficacy of the molecular methods employed. When analyzed, <i>rpo</i>B gene mutations at codons 531 (54.54%), 526 (14.54%), and 516 (10.91%) were found by sequencing in 80% of the samples. Nucleotide substitution at <i>kat</i>G315 (AGC→ACC) was spotted in 16 (76.19%) out of 21 samples. When comparing the sequencing results with DST, sensitivity and specificity were investigated to determine drug-resistance (rifampicin-resistance were 98 and 100% whereas isoniazid-resistance were 94 and 100% respectively). Additionally, as a point of comparison with DST, only 85.45% of RIF mono-resistant TB cases were accurately evaluated by the GeneXpert assay. This research supports the adoption of PCR sequencing approach as an efficient tool in detecting MDR-TB, counting the higher sensitivity and specificity as well as the short period to produce the results.",

        "abstract": "Comorbidity of diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health concern in low- and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. An integrated approach is required for adequate management of diabetes mellitus and TB. The objective of the present study was to investigate the availability and readiness of the TB care centers of Bangladesh toward diabetic patients' management. The present study was conducted based on existing data obtained from the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey (BHFS) 2017. Data collected from a total of 303 facilities providing TB services were retrieved. The outcome variables of the present study were availability and readiness of the TB health facilities for providing diabetes mellitus service. Readiness was measured for four domains: staff and guidelines, equipment, diagnostic facility and basic medicine. The independent variables were: facility level, management authority and location of the facility. Binary and multiple logistic regression models were constructed for both the outcome variables (availability and readiness) to find out their predictors. Services for diabetes mellitus were available in 68% of the TB facilities while high readiness was present in 36% of the facilities. For domain-specific readiness index, readiness for the domains of staff and guidelines, equipment, diagnostic facility and basic medicine was reported in 46%, 96%, 38% and 25% facilities respectively. In the logistic regression model, availability of diabetes mellitus services was better in primary level (aOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.78-4.77) and secondary level (aOR 3.26, 95% CI 1.82-9.05) facilities than community facilities. Similarly, readiness of diabetes mellitus care was also better in these facilities (aOR 2.55, 95% CI 1.05-4.71 for primary and aOR 2.75, 95% CI 1.80-4.32 for secondary facilities). Besides, private TB facilities had better availability (aOR 2.84, 95% CI 1.75-5.89) and readiness (aOR 2.52, 95% CI 1.32-4.29) for diabetes mellitus care. Availability and readiness for providing diabetes mellitus services in TB care providing facilities in Bangladesh is inadequate.",

We conducted this systematic review to understand the distribution of bovine and zoonotic tuberculosis in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Southeast Asia Region (SEAR) and Western Pacific Region (WPR) to inform our understanding of the risk posed by this disease. A two-pronged strategy was used by evaluating data from peer-reviewed literature and official reports. A systematic search was conducted using a structured query in four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, and PubMed) to identify any reports of the occurrence of zoonotic TB. No language and time constraints were used during the search, but non-English language articles were later excluded. The official data were sourced from the World Organization for Animal Health's (WOAH) World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) and WHO's global TB database. The retrieved records from SEAR and WPR (<i>n</i> = 113) were screened for eligibility, and data about disease occurrence were extracted and tabulated. In SEAR, all of the five studies that conducted <i>Mycobacterium</i> speciation (5/6) in humans were from India, and the reported <i>Mycobacterium</i> species included <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>M. bovis</i>, <i>M. scrofulacium</i>, <i>M. kansasii</i>, <i>M. phlei</i>, <i>M. smegmatis</i> and <i>M. orygis</i>. In WPR, <i>Mycobacterium</i> speciation investigations in humans were conducted in Australia (8), China (2), Japan (2), NewZealand (2) and Malaysia (1), and the reported <i>Mycobacterium</i> species included <i>M. bovis</i>, <i>M. africanum</i> and <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Seven countries in WHO's SEAR have officially reported the occurrence of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in their animals: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In WPR, the WAHIS information system includes reports of the identification of <i>M. bovis</i> from 11 countries - China, Fiji, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Tonga and Viet Nam. In contrast, human zoonotic TB cases in the WHO database were only listed from Australia, Brunei Darussalam and Palau countries. The available data suggests under-reporting of zoonotic TB in the regions. Efforts are required to strengthen zoonotic TB surveillance systems from both animal and human health sides to better understand the impact of zoonotic TB in order to take appropriate action to achieve the goal of ending the TB epidemic.",

        "abstract": "Lack of appropriate early diagnostic tools for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and their incomplete drug susceptibility testing (DST) profiling is concerning for TB disease control. Existing methods, such as phenotypic DST (pDST), are time-consuming, while Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and line probe assay (LPA) are limited to detecting resistance to few drugs. Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) has been recently approved by WHO as an alternative approach for rapid and comprehensive DST. We aimed to investigate the performance and feasibility of tNGS for detecting DR-TB directly from clinical samples in Bangladesh. pDST, LPA and tNGS were performed among 264 sputum samples, either rifampicin-resistant (RR) or rifampicin-sensitive (RS) TB cases confirmed by Xpert assay. Resistotypes of tNGS were compared with pDST, LPA and composite reference standard (CRS, resistant if either pDST or LPA showed a resistant result). tNGS results revealed higher sensitivities for rifampicin (RIF) (99.3%), isoniazid (INH) (96.3%), fluoroquinolones (FQs) (94.4%), and aminoglycosides (AMGs) (100%) but comparatively lower for ethambutol (76.6%), streptomycin (68.7%), ethionamide (56.0%) and pyrazinamide (50.7%) when compared with pDST. The sensitivities of tNGS for INH, RIF, FQs and AMGs were 93.0%, 96.6%, 90.9%, and 100%, respectively and the specificities ranged from 91.3 to 100% when compared with CRS. This proof of concept study, conducted in a high-burden setting demonstrated that tNGS is a valuable tool for identifying DR-TB directly from the clinical specimens. Its feasibility in our laboratory suggests potential implementation and moving tNGS from research settings into clinical settings.",

There is limited understanding of the prophage role in ecological, evolutionary, adaptive processes and pathogenicity of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, a widespread bacterium causally associated with gastric cancer. Inferring the exact prophage genomic location and completeness requires complete genomes. The international <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> Genome Project (<i>Hp</i>GP) dataset comprises 1011 <i>H. pylori</i> complete clinical genomes enriched with epigenetic data. We thoroughly evaluated the <i>H. pylori</i> prophage genomic content in the <i>Hp</i>GP dataset. We investigated population evolutionary dynamics through phylogenetic and pangenome analyses. Additionally, we identified genome rearrangements and assessed the impact of prophage presence on bacterial gene disruption and methylome. We found that 29.5% (298) of the <i>Hp</i>GP genomes contain prophages, of which only 32.2% (96) were complete, minimizing the burden of prophage carriage. The prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> prophage sequences was variable by geography and ancestry, but not by disease status of the human host. Prophage insertion occasionally results in gene disruption that can change the global bacterial epigenome. Gene function prediction allowed the development of the first model for lysogenic-lytic cycle regulation in <i>H. pylori</i>. We have disclosed new prophage inactivation mechanisms that appear to occur by genome rearrangement, merger with other mobile elements, and pseudogene accumulation. Our analysis provides a comprehensive framework for <i>H. pylori</i> prophage biological and genomics, offering insights into lysogeny regulation and bacterial adaptation to prophages.",

        "abstract": "In 2022, fewer than half of persons with tuberculosis (TB) had access to molecular diagnostic tests for TB due to their high costs. Studies have found that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) software for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation and sputum specimen pooling can each reduce the cost of testing. We modeled the combination of both strategies to estimate potential savings in consumables that could be used to expand access to molecular diagnostics. We obtained Xpert testing and positivity data segmented into deciles by AI probability scores for TB from the community- and healthcare facility-based active case finding conducted in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Viet Nam, and Zambia. AI scores in the model were based on CAD4TB version 7 (Zambia) and qXR (all other countries). We modeled four ordinal screening and testing approaches involving AI-aided CXR interpretation to indicate individual and pooled testing. Setting a false negative rate of 5%, for each approach we calculated additional and cumulative savings over the baseline of universal Xpert testing, as well as the theoretical expansion in diagnostic coverage. In each country, the optimal screening and testing approach was to use AI to rule out testing in deciles with low AI scores and to guide pooled vs individual testing in persons with moderate and high AI scores, respectively. This approach yielded cumulative savings in Xpert tests over baseline ranging from 50.8% in Zambia to 57.5% in Nigeria and 61.5% in Bangladesh and Viet Nam. Using these savings, diagnostic coverage theoretically could be expanded by 34% to 160% across the different approaches and countries. Using AI software data generated during CXR interpretation to inform a differentiated pooled testing strategy may optimize TB diagnostic test use, and could extend molecular tests to more people who need them. The optimal AI thresholds and pooled testing strategy varied across countries, which suggests that bespoke screening and testing approaches may be needed for differing populations and settings.

It is yet a severe risk factor to the patients, who are also suffering from one or more chronic diseases including different lung diseases. In this study, we explored common molecular signatures for which SARS-CoV-2 infections and different lung diseases stimulate each other, and associated candidate drug molecules. We identified both SARS-CoV-2 infections and different lung diseases (Asthma, Tuberculosis, Cystic Fibrosis, Pneumonia, Emphysema, Bronchitis, IPF, ILD, and COPD) causing top-ranked 11 shared genes (STAT1, TLR4, CXCL10, CCL2, JUN, DDX58, IRF7, ICAM1, MX2, IRF9 and ISG15) as the hub of the shared differentially expressed genes (hub-sDEGs). The gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of hub-sDEGs revealed some crucial common pathogenetic processes of SARS-CoV-2 infections and different lung diseases. The regulatory network analysis of hub-sDEGs detected top-ranked 6 TFs proteins and 6 micro RNAs as the key transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory factors of hub-sDEGs, respectively. Then we proposed hub-sDEGs guided top-ranked three repurposable drug molecules (Entrectinib, Imatinib, and Nilotinib), for the treatment against COVID-19 with different lung diseases. This recommendation is based on the results obtained from molecular docking analysis using the AutoDock Vina and GLIDE module of Schrödinger. The selected drug molecules were optimized through density functional theory (DFT) and observing their good chemical stability. Finally, we explored the binding stability of the highest-ranked receptor protein RELA with top-ordered three drugs (Entrectinib, Imatinib, and Nilotinib) through 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations with YASARA and Desmond module of Schrödinger and observed their consistent performance. Therefore, the findings of this study might be useful resources for the diagnosis and therapies of COVID-19 patients who are also suffering from one or more lung diseases.",

        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

        "title": "What is the state of the art on traditional medicine interventions for zoonotic diseases in the Indian subcontinent? A scoping review of the peer-reviewed evidence base.",
        "abstract": "Traditional medicine (TM) interventions are plausible therapeutic alternatives to conventional medical interventions against emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases, particularly in low-and middle-income countries that may lack resources and infrastructure. Despite the growing popularity in the usage of TM interventions, their clinical safety and effectiveness are still contested within conventional healthcare in many countries. We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature that synthesises and maps the evidence on TM interventions for the treatment and prevention of zoonoses on the Indian subcontinent. The region, a global hotspot of biodiversity and emerging infections, is characterised by high prevalence of TM use. Based on the scientific literature (mostly case study research, n=l06 studies), our review (1) maps the scope of the literature, (2) synthesises the evidence on the application of TM interventions for zoonoses, and (3) critically reflects on the state of TM and identifies areas for future research focus. The evidence synthesis confirmed widespread usage of TM interventions for zoonoses on the subcontinent, with the majority of research reported from India (n=99 studies, 93.4%), followed by Pakistan (n=3 studies, 2.8%), Bangladesh (n=2 studies, 1.9%), and Sri Lanka (n=1, 0.9%). Most of the reviewed studies reported on ethno-medicinal uses of plant species, primarily for treating dengue (n=20 studies), tuberculosis (n=18 studies), Escherichia coli infection (n=16 studies), lymphatic filariasis and cholera (n=9 apiece). However, the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these reported TM interventions is limited, indicating that these data are rarely collected and/or shared within the peer-reviewed literature. This review thus highlights that, whilst TMs are already being used and could offer more widely accessible interventions against emerging and endemic zoonoses and ectoparasites, there is an urgent need for rigorous clinical testing and validation of the safety and effectiveness of these interventions.",

The national surveillance data from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region on the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance trends of TB, including MDR-TB remains scarce. A retrospective 12-year analysis of <i>N</i> = 8,086 non-duplicate diagnostic <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTB complex) isolates from the UAE was conducted. Data were generated through routine patient care during the 2010-2021 years, collected by trained personnel and reported by participating surveillance sites to the UAE National Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Surveillance program. Data analysis was conducted with WHONET, a windows-based microbiology laboratory database management software developed by the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance, Boston, United States (https://whonet.org/). A total of 8,086 MTB-complex isolates were analyzed. MTB-complex was primarily isolated from respiratory samples (sputum 80.1%, broncho-alveolar lavage 4.6%, pleural fluid 4.1%). Inpatients accounted for 63.2%, including 1.3% from ICU. Nationality was known for 84.3% of patients, including 3.8% Emiratis. Of UAE non-nationals, 80.5% were from 110 countries, most of which were Asian countries. India accounted for 20.8%, Pakistan 13.6%, Philippines 12.7%, and Bangladesh 7.8%. Rifampicin-resistant MTB-complex isolates (RR-TB) were found in 2.8% of the isolates, resistance to isoniazid, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, was 8.9, 6.9, 3.4 and 0.4%, respectively. A slightly increasing trend of resistance among MTB-complex was observed for rifampicin from 2.5% (2010) to 2.8% (2021). Infections due to MTB-complex are relatively uncommon in the United Arab Emirates compared to other countries in the MENA region. Most TB patients in the UAE are of Asian origin, mainly from countries with a high prevalence of TB. Resistance to first line anti-tuberculous drugs is generally low, however increasing trends for MDR-TB mainly rifampicin linked resistance is a major concern. MDR-TB was not associated with a higher mortality, admission to ICU, or increased length of hospitalization as compared to non-MDR-TB.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted for a period of one year from January 2008 to December 2008 in the Department of Medicine, Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital, Bogura, Bangladesh enrolling 50 subjects with exudative pleural effusion. The cases with transudative pleural effusion were not included. Needle biopsy was done in all the cases. Histopathological reports of pleural biopsy specimen were correlated with other data and analyzed to detect the causes of effusion. Major incidence of malignant effusion occurred between 41 to 70 years of age. No malignant effusion was found before 30 years of age. Incidence of tuberculous and malignant pleural effusion was much more common in males than in females. Sensitivity and specificity of combined pleural biopsy and pleural fluid analysis in the diagnosis of pleural effusion was 97.06% and 100.% for tuberculosis and 81.82% and 100.0% for malignancy.

Despite breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment, few safe and effective therapeutics have been reported. Phytochemicals are gaining popularity due to their beneficial effects and low toxicity. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites with high molecular weights found at high levels in natural food sources such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and citrus seeds. Over recent decades, polyphenols and their beneficial effects on human health have been the subject of intense research, with notable successes in preventing major chronic non-communicable diseases. Many respiratory syndromes can be treated effectively with polyphenolic supplements, including acute lung damage, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer.

        "abstract": "Airborne diseases due to climate change pose significant public health challenges in Bangladesh. Little was known about the spatio-temporal pattern of airborne diseases at the district level in the country. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern and associated meteorological factors of airborne diseases in Bangladesh using exploratory analysis and spatial regression models. This study used district-level reported cases of airborne diseases (meningococcal, measles, mumps, influenza, tuberculosis, and encephalitis) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) from 2017 to 2020. Geospatial mapping and spatial error regression models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 to 2020, a total of 315 meningococcal, 5159 measles, 1341 mumps, 346 influenza, 4664 tuberculosis, and 229 encephalitis cases were reported in Bangladesh. Among airborne diseases, measles demonstrated the highest prevalence, featuring a higher incidence rate in the coastal Bangladeshi districts of Lakshmipur, Patuakhali, and Cox's Bazar, as well as in Maulvibazar and Bandarban districts from 2017 to 2020. In contrast, tuberculosis (TB) emerged as the second most prevalent disease, with a higher incidence rate observed in districts such as Khagrachhari, Rajshahi, Tangail, Bogra, and Sherpur. The spatial error regression model revealed that among climate variables, mean (<i>β</i> = 9.56, standard error [SE]: 3.48) and maximum temperature (<i>β</i> = 1.19, SE: 0.40) were significant risk factors for airborne diseases in Bangladesh. Maximum temperature positively influenced measles (<i>β</i> = 2.74, SE: 1.39), whereas mean temperature positively influenced both meningococcal (<i>β</i> = 5.57, SE: 2.50) and mumps (<i>β</i> = 11.99, SE: 3.13) diseases. The findings from the study provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat airborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries.

However, creating dry powder inhaler (DPI) with suitable aerodynamic characteristics while preserving nanostructure integrity and maintaining bioactivity until the active ingredient travels deeply into the lungs is a difficult challenge. We developed DPI formulations containing levofloxacin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) via spray-drying technique with tailored aerosolization characteristics for effective inhalation therapy. A range of biophysical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure the morphologies and sizes of the spray-dried microparticles that explored both the geometric and aerodynamic properties. Spray drying substantially reduced the particle sizes of the SLNs while preserving their nanostructural integrity and enhancing aerosol dispersion with efficient mucus penetration. Despite a slower uptake rate compared to plain SLNs, the polyethylene glycol modified formulations exhibited enhanced cellular uptake in both A549 and NR8383 cell lines. The percent viability of Mycobacterium bovis had dropped to nearly 0 % by day 5 for both types of SLNs. Interestingly, the levofloxacin-loaded SLNs demonstrated a lower minimum bactericidal concentration (0.25 µg/mL) compared with pure levofloxacin (1 µg/mL), which indicated the formulations have potential as effective treatments for tuberculosis.",

This case-control study was conducted among 254 patients (127 cases and 127 controls) from January 2022 - December 2022. Patients were recruited by purposive sampling from 92 centers of the Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS).

Viral infections, multidrug-resistant and ex-tensively drug-resistant TB strains, as well as the coexistence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM) greatly aggravate TB morbidity and mortality. DM [particularly type 2 DM (T2DM)] and TB have converged making their control even more challenging. Two contemporary global epidemics, TB-DM behaves like a syndemic, a synergistic confluence of two highly prevalent diseases. T2DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment. Since a bidirectional relationship exists between TB and DM, it is necessary to concurrently treat both, and promote recommendations for the joint management of both diseases. There are also some drug-drug interactions resulting in adverse treatment outcomes in TB-DM patients including treatment failure, and reinfection. In addition, autophagy may play a role in these comorbidities. Therefore, the TB-DM comorbidities present several health challenges, requiring a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated strategies, to effectively deal with this double burden. To effectively manage the comorbidity, further screening in affected countries, more suitable drugs, and better treatment strategies are required.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health concern, necessitating the exploration of novel drug delivery systems to combat the challenges posed by conventional approaches. We investigated the potential of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as an innovative platform for efficient and targeted delivery of antituberculosis drugs. Specifically, the electronic and optical properties of prominent TB drugs, isoniazid (INH) and pyrazinamide (PZA), adsorbed on tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) and tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>) monolayers were studied using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The investigation revealed that the band gaps of WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> monolayers remain unaltered upon adsorption of PZA or INH, with negative adsorption energy indicating stable physisorption. We explored different vertical and horizontal configurations, and the horizontal ones were more stable. When INH and PZA drugs were horizontally adsorbed together on WSe<sub>2</sub>, the most stable configuration was found with an adsorption energy of -2.35 eV. Moreover, the adsorbed drugs could be readily released by light within the visible or near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range. This opened up possibilities for their potential application in photothermal therapy, harnessing the unique properties of these 2D materials. The comprehensive analysis of the band structures and density of states provides valuable insights into how the drug molecules contributed to the conduction and valence bands. The optical responses of anti-TB drugs adsorbed in 2D WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> were similar to those of pristine 2D WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>. We demonstrated the temperature-dependent release mechanism of our 2D WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> drug complexes, confirming the feasibility of releasing the discussed anti-tuberculosis drugs by generating heat through photothermal therapy.

        "abstract": "The rise of pyrazinamide (PZA)-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) poses a major challenge to conventional tuberculosis (TB) treatments. PZA, a cornerstone of TB therapy, must be activated by the mycobacterial enzyme pyrazinamidase (PZase) to convert its active form, pyrazinoic acid, which targets the ribosomal protein S1. Resistance, often associated with mutations in the RpsA protein, complicates treatment and highlights a critical gap in the understanding of structural dynamics and mechanisms of resistance, particularly in the context of the G97D mutation. This study utilizes a novel integration of computational techniques, including multiscale biomolecular and molecular dynamics simulations, physicochemical and medicinal chemistry predictions, quantum computations and virtual screening from the ZINC and Chembridge databases, to elucidate the resistance mechanism and identify lead compounds that have the potential to improve treatment outcomes for PZA-resistant MTB, namely ZINC15913786, ZINC20735155, Chem10269711, Chem10279789 and Chem10295790. These computational methods offer a cost-effective, rapid alternative to traditional drug trials by bypassing the need for organic subjects while providing highly accurate insight into the binding sites and efficacy of new drug candidates.

In the last few decades, several new types of lung-related diseases have taken the lives of millions of people, and COVID-19 has taken almost 6.27 million lives. To fight against lung diseases, timely and correct diagnosis with appropriate treatment is crucial in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, an intelligent recognition system for seven lung diseases has been proposed based on machine learning (ML) techniques to aid the medical experts. Chest X-ray (CXR) images of lung diseases were collected from several publicly available databases. A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used to extract characteristic features from the raw pixel values of the CXR images. The best feature subset has been identified using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC). Finally, the extreme learning machine (ELM) has been used to perform the classification task to assist faster learning and reduced computational complexity. The proposed CNN-PCC-ELM model achieved an accuracy of 96.22% with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 99.48% for eight class classification. The outcomes from the proposed model demonstrated better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the case of COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis detection in both binary and multiclass classifications. For eight class classification, the proposed model achieved precision, recall and fi-score and ROC are 100%, 99%, 100% and 99.99% respectively for COVID-19 detection demonstrating its robustness. Therefore, the proposed model has overshadowed the existing pioneering models to accurately differentiate COVID-19 from the other lung diseases that can assist the medical physicians in treating the patient effectively.",

When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.
