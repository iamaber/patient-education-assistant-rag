        "abstract": "Malaria continues to pose a global health challenge, exacerbated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> potential of Propolis extracts collected from various Iranian regions and to characterize the molecular interactions of their bioactive phytochemicals with <i>P. falciparum</i> lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH), a key enzyme in parasite glycolysis. The anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity of ethanol-extracted Propolis was assessed against <i>P. falciparum</i> NF54 using the SYBR Green I fluorescence assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified major phytochemicals in the most active extract. Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the binding affinity and stability of selected compounds (tectochrysin and galangin) against PfLDH in both holo (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 1LDG) and apo (PDB ID: 2X8L) forms. Propolis collected from Kermanshah city exhibited the highest anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.69 ± 1.44 μg/mL). GC-MS analysis identified tectochrysin and galangin as major constituents. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities of tectochrysin (-7.8 kcal/mol) and galangin (-7.5 kcal/mol) to PfLDH, surpassing the binding energies of standard antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and quinine). MD simulations confirmed the stability of tectochrysin and galangin within the PfLDH active sites, with favorable root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, molecular surface area, and polar surface area profiles, indicating persistent and stable protein-ligand interactions throughout the simulation. The findings support the promising anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> potential of Propolis-derived compounds, particularly tectochrysin and galangin, as novel PfLDH inhibitors. Their potential applicability in transdisciplinary anti-parasitic therapy across human and veterinary medicine warrants further <i>in vivo</i> validation and clinical investigations.",

        "abstract": "Infectious disease research is essential for disease prevention and management within refugee camps and informal settlements. The objective of this study is to identify the characteristics of existing infectious disease research in these settings and to assess stated research challenges, ethical considerations, and studied interventions within these studies. This is a systematic review of forty primary studies focused on infectious disease research conducted among displaced populations. Included studies are published in English between 1995 and 2023. Three databases were searched, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, and this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023461567). The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. 85 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 34) researched an intervention for infectious disease prevention or control and 70 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 28) were randomized controlled trials. 75 % of studies were located in Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 15) or Pakistan (<i>n</i> = 15). 40 % of studies focused on diarrheal diseases (<i>n</i> = 16) and 28 % on malaria (<i>n</i> = 11). Common identified research challenges included population mobility, limited external validity, and low recruitment. No studies included the community in the initial study conception or investigated the research impact on the community. Community involvement was often through community health workers (45 %). Of the 18 studies that studied a resource-based intervention, 20 % explicitly noted that the intervention was unsustainable. While guidelines for conducting research in displaced settings exist, there are gaps in their utilization. We identified a disconnect between where displaced individuals reside and where research is conducted, as well as a prioritization of particular infectious diseases. Researchers identified numerous challenges in conducting research in these settings, though the community was rarely involved in the research. Context-specific considerations and community involvement are vital in research with displaced communities. Wellcome Trust (Contract Number C-010,656).",

        "abstract": "People with disabilities experience significant health inequalities and barriers to healthcare access globally. While poverty alleviation interventions show promise for improving health outcomes, evidence specifically for people with disabilities remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a disability-inclusive graduation (DIG) programme on health outcomes among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda. We conducted a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial in four districts of Northern Uganda. Clusters were randomly assigned to either the DIG intervention (96 clusters) or control group (89 clusters). This analysis focused on households with people with disabilities, as identified by the Washington Group Short Set questions and verified by BRAC programme managers. Households in treatment clusters received up to 18 months DIG intervention between December 2020 and June 2022, combining asset transfers, cash support, skills training, financial inclusion activities, and disability-specific services including rehabilitation and assistive devices. The primary outcome was experience of illness/injury in the past 3 months, assessed at both first follow-up (immediately post-intervention) and second follow-up (about 16 months post-intervention), with secondary outcomes including unmet health needs, mental health status, unmet assistive product needs, and healthcare expenditure. Effects were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression or generalized estimating equations, reporting minimally-adjusted and fully-adjusted mean differences (FAMD) or odds ratios (FAOR) with 95% CIs. The trial was registered with RIDIE (RIDIE-STUDY-ID-626008898983a) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN-78592382). At baseline, 691 participants (370 intervention, 321 control) were included. The DIG intervention did not significantly impact overall illness/injury prevalence at either first follow-up (41.18% vs 45.86%, FAOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22) or second follow-up (55.65% vs 53.98%, FAOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.56). However, the intervention demonstrated a progressively strengthening effect on reducing unmet health needs, from marginal improvement immediately post-intervention (FAOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.02, p = 0.06) to significant reduction at 16 months post-intervention (FAOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Notably, the intervention produced temporal potential shifts in disease patterns, with malaria showing contrasting trends between follow-up periods. Sex-differentiated effects emerged by second follow-up, with females in the intervention group experiencing fewer injuries (FAOR for interaction 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.74, p = 0.02) but more pain-related conditions compared to males (FAOR for interaction 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.59, p = 0.04), though these subgroup findings require replication in future studies. No significant differences were observed in mental health outcomes or health expenditure. This first randomized evaluation of a disability-inclusive graduation programme demonstrates that while economic empowerment alone may not reduce overall illness prevalence among people with disabilities, it can progressively improve healthcare access over time. The temporal evolution of effects and emerging sex-differentiated impacts highlight the need for sustained support and gender-sensitive approaches in future disability-inclusive poverty reduction programmes, with additional health-specific components to achieve broader improvements in health outcomes.

The parasitic nematode <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> infects an estimated 600 million people worldwide and is one of the soil-transmitted helminthiases, a WHO-defined neglected tropical disease. It has long been suggested that human <i>S. stercoralis</i> infection may be a zoonosis from dogs. We investigated this by whole genome sequence analysis of <i>S. stercoralis</i> from sympatric human and dog populations in Asia. We find that human- and dog-derived <i>S. stercoralis</i> have genetically distinct nuclear genomes, but we also find evidence of rare cross-infection. Analysis of the <i>S. stercoralis</i> mitochondrial genome reveals evidence of historical introgression between human- and dog-derived parasites. Based on these data, we suggest that <i>S. stercoralis</i> was originally a parasite of canids, that began to infect humans when people domesticated dogs, since when human- and dog-derived parasites have differentiated, but have not become separate species.",

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

        "abstract": "Noise in histopathology images from hardware limitations, preparation artifacts, and environmental factors complicates disease analysis and increases risks. With growing workloads and the complexity of histopathology images, developing efficient and precise histopathology image analysis methods is essential. However, many denoising models struggle to extract spatial features and are computationally expensive, primarily due to the limited capacity of convolutions to capture visual patterns across spatial locations, and tend to occupy the largest share of computational costs. In histopathology, many spatial features, such as anomalies or microorganisms, located sparsely across an image, are crucial for the final diagnosis, and many denoising processes often either blur them or introduce artifacts. In this study, we propose a lightweight autoencoder (43.11 kilobytes) for denoising histopathology images by fusing a single involution layer within a small convolution model, resulting in better denoising performance in a hybrid model, which has both channel-specific and location-specific feature extraction capabilities. Building upon the idea of a shallow autoencoder, our model results in much lower memory and compute overhead requirements, while also not avoiding the generation of artifacts. On Malaria Blood Smear and CRC datasets, SSIM Loss and Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio were used for performance evaluation, with lower SSIM Loss (0.058 and 0.34) in denoising images with an added Gaussian noise of 0.3. Our proposed autoencoder, with low weight parameters of 11,037 and 81,630,000 floating point operations (FLOPs), is over 20 times less computationally expensive than Xception, the second-best performing model, establishing ours as the most efficient denoising autoencoder for histopathology images.",

        "abstract": "Dengue cases in Bangladesh have surged in recent years. The existing insecticide-based control program is challenged by issues of insufficient household coverage and high levels of insecticide resistance in the primary dengue virus (DENV) vector, Aedes aegypti. A more sustainable, effective alternative could be the implementation of a Wolbachia-mediated disease management strategy. Hence, we created and characterised a Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti strain with a Dhaka wild-type genetic background, and compared its reproductive compatibility, maternal inheritance, fitness, and virus-blocking ability to the parental strains (Dhaka wild-type and wAlbB2-F4). The new Ae. aegypti strain wAlbB2-Dhaka demonstrated complete cytoplasmic incompatibility with the wild-type and complete maternal transmission, retaining levels of pyrethroid resistance of the Dhaka wild-type. No significant fitness costs were detected during laboratory comparison. Compared to the wild-type, wAlbB2-Dhaka mosquitoes demonstrated a significantly reduced genome copies of DENV in the bodies (44.4%, p = 0.0034); a two-fold reduction in dissemination to legs and wings (47.6%, p < 0.0001); and > 13-fold reduction of DENV in saliva expectorates (proxy of transmission potential) (92.7%, p < 0.0001) 14 days after ingesting dengue-infected blood. Our work indicates that the wAlbB2-Dhaka strain could be used for Ae. aegypti suppression or replacement strategies for dengue management in Bangladesh.",

Homology-based taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analyses identified a broad diversity of putative viruses from 12 known families, with additional unclassified viruses also likely present. Analysis of male mosquitoes showed some of these viruses are likely capable of being vertically transmitted.

        "abstract": "Most child deaths can be averted through prompt and appropriate treatment of child illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria. However, research has suggested that increases in care seeking do not necessarily mean that quality care is being received. We assessed the service readiness and process quality of curative healthcare during childhood and determined whether children are receiving health services with sufficient quality across countries. We linked data from household surveys including the standard Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to data from facility surveys including the Service Provision Assessment and Health Facility Assessment in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania to estimate the effective coverage of child illness treatment. We assessed the gaps in service availability and coverage, lack of service readiness, missed care opportunities, and inadequate service process, where service readiness and process quality were defined according to global standards with country-specific adaptations. We analysed the service readiness, quality of care, and effective coverage by individual illness and combined illnesses accounting for equity dimensions. Seven to 42% of children experienced at least one illness. An integrated management of child illnesses (IMCI) service was available in 58-85% of facilities. We found that 55-66% of health facilities in the countries were ready to deliver treatment to sick children. However, the readiness-adjusted contact suggested that child healthcare was mostly sought in facilities with low readiness score, ranging from 15% (Nepal) to 46.0% (Malawi). Health facilities had low diagnostics, supervision, and trained personnel capacity to manage child illnesses. Concerning the quality of care, only 51-60% of the procedures during clinical encounters were in line with standards. Counselling of caretakers had the lowest score, while treatment components had the highest process quality score. Hospitals had higher readiness and process quality scores compared to primary facilities and the private sector. There were, however, large gaps in service readiness and significant inadequate service processes in all countries; 35% (Haiti) to 79% (Bangladesh) of sick children sought care from a health facility, with only 7% (Nepal) to 29% (Malawi) of them actually receiving appropriate treatment. We found large inequalities in care seeking, quality of care, and effective coverage across levels of education and poverty, and places of residence. A large proportion of facilities did not meet the required capacity to provide IMCI services. The provision of health services has major quality gaps, highlighting the need for strengthening health service access, capacity and quality of care to reach universal child health coverage.",

The World Health Organization recommends G6PD testing prior to 8AQ-based hypnozoitocidal treatment. We undertook an individual level meta-analysis of the performance of commercially available quantitative point-of-care diagnostics (PoCs) compared with reference spectrophotometry. A systematic literature search (PROSPERO: CRD42022330733) identified 595 articles of which 16 (2.7%) fulfilled pre-defined inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, plus an additional 4 datasets. In total there were 12,678 paired measurements analyzed, 10,446 (82.4%) by STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, RoK, [SDB]), 2,042 (16.1%) by CareStart G6PD Biosensor (AccessBio, USA, [CSA]), 150 (1.2%) by CareStart Biosensor (WellsBio, RoK [CSW]), and 40 (0.3%) by FINDER (Baebies, USA, [FBA]). The pooled sensitivities of the SDB when measuring G6PD activity <30% of normal were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.89) for capillary and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99) for venous blood samples. The corresponding values for measuring <70% G6PD activity were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.67-0.99) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73-0.96), respectively. The pooled specificity of the SDB was high (>96%) for all blood samples and G6PD activity thresholds. Irrespective of the blood samples and thresholds applied, sensitivity of the CSA did not exceed 62%, although specificity remained high at both 30% and 70% thresholds (>88%). Only one study each for CSW and FBA was included. Sensitivities of the CSW were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.14) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89) at the 30% and 70% thresholds, respectively (venous blood samples). Sensitivities of the FBA were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.29-1.00) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.19-0.99) at the 30% and 70% thresholds (venous blood samples). Specificities of the CSW and FBA were consistently high (>90%) at both thresholds. Accuracy of the SDB was higher in females at the 30% cut-off (OR: 3.49, p=0.002) and lower in malaria patients at the 70% cut-off (OR: 0.59, p = 0.005). The SDB performed better than other PoCs. More evidence was available for the performance of the SDB compared to other PoCs, giving higher confidence in its utility in diagnosing G6PD deficiency.",

Participants were randomly assigned via interactive web response system technology equally into five study groups, stratified by site: two doses of 2vHPV, the first at baseline and the second 6, 12, or 24 months later; a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) at baseline followed 24 months later by 2vHPV; or two doses of 4vHPV given 6 months apart (referent). We tested for antigen-specific (HPV-16 and HPV-18) binding antibodies by ELISA at baseline and before and 1 month after the second dose. The primary objective was to show immunological non-inferiority of the 2vHPV vaccine schedules to the referent 1 month after the second dose in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of 0·5 for the lower bound of the 98·3% CI for the geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio. Adverse events and serious adverse events were evaluated as secondary endpoints in the total vaccinated population. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04508309) and is completed. Between March 15 and Nov 18, 2021, 1025 girls were enrolled and received 2vHPV at baseline and 6 months (n=205), 12 months (n=206), or 24 months (n=204); 4vHPV at baseline and 6 months (n=205); or 4vHPV at baseline and 2vHPV at 24 months (n=205). 96-99% of participants across groups were included in the per-protocol analysis. 1 month after the second dose, 2vHPV non-inferiority was shown, with GMC ratios between 1·1 and 2·4 (lower bound of the 98·3% CI of the GMC ratio between 0·9 and 1·9) for HPV-16, and between 1·3 and 1·7 (1·0 and 1·4) for HPV-18. As an exploratory objective, we assessed 2vHPV immunogenicity after one dose, finding that it was similar to that of 4vHPV up to 24 months, with GMC ratios at 24 months of 1·1 (95% CI 0·9-1·4) for HPV-16 and 1·4 (1·1-1·7) for HPV-18. The frequency of adverse events was similar across study groups, with no related unsolicited events reported. Serious adverse events were rare and none were determined to be related to vaccination. Non-inferior immune responses for extended two-dose regimens of 2vHPV support dosing flexibility. For up to 24 months, one dose of 2vHPV elicited immunogenicity that was similar to one dose of 4vHPV, for which single-dose efficacy has been shown, supporting a single-dose use of 2vHPV. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and immunological testing was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic use, access to quality antibiotics and weak antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). There is a need to review current evidence on antibiotic use, access, and AMR, in primary care across key countries. This narrative review analyzes publications from 2018 to 2024 regarding access, availability, and use of appropriate antibiotics. There were very few studies focussing on a lack of access to antibiotics in primary care. However, there was considerable evidence of high rates of inappropriate antibiotic use, including Watch antibiotics, typically for minor infections, across studied countries exacerbated by patient demand. The high costs of antibiotics in a number of LMICs impact on their use, resulting in short courses and sharing of antibiotics. This can contribute to AMR alongside the use of substandard and falsified antibiotics. Overall, limited implementation of national action plans, insufficient resources, and knowledge gaps affects sustainable development goals to provide routine access to safe, effective, and appropriate antibiotics. There is a clear need to focus health policy on the optimal use of essential AWaRe antibiotics in primary care settings to reduce AMR in LMICs.",

However, few contextual data are available at the village level in rural South and Southeast Asia. This study addressed the gap by profiling representative villages across seven sites in Thailand (n=3), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Key informant surveys supplemented by other information sources were used to collect data from 687 villages on four key indicators (literacy rate, and percentages of attended deliveries, fully immunised children and latrine coverage), as well as access to various services. Data were analysed descriptively. Sites varied considerably. Five were highly diverse ethno-culturally and linguistically, and all relied on primary health centres and village health/malaria workers as the main providers of primary healthcare. These were generally bypassed by severely ill patients for urban first-level referral hospitals and private sector facilities. While >75% of villages were near primary schools, educational attainment was generally low. Over 70% of villages at each site had mobile phone coverage and availability of electricity was high (≥65% at all sites bar Myanmar). These results illustrate the similarities and differences of villages in this region that must be considered in public health research and policymaking.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

        "abstract": "Childhood illness and hospitalisation result in both direct and indirect costs to families before, during and after admission. We aimed to estimate the catastrophic expenditure during hospitalisation for children with acute illness. This was a prespecified cross-sectional substudy nested within two prospective studies. Participants were recruited and interviewed from three rural and three urban hospitals in Kenya and Uganda. A costing questionnaire was administered to the caregivers of 731 children hospitalised for acute illness to evaluate direct and indirect costs incurred by caregivers and families. Costs incurred were compared for families with children both with and without complicated severe malnutrition (CSM). Catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure exceeding 10% and 25% of monthly income was assessed. The median (IQR) total cost during hospitalisation per child was US$47 (US$24-US$84), with higher costs for children with CSM, especially during hospitalisation (US$56 (US$26-US$99) vs US$36 (US$20-US$65); p<0.001). During hospitalisation, bed charges followed by food were the main cost drivers. Caregivers reported losing a median of 7 (4-11) days of productive time during a child's hospitalisation with a mean loss of income of US$10 (SD US$25.6, median US$0 (US$0-US$10)). 92% and 74% of households experienced catastrophic expenditure at thresholds of 10% and 25% of monthly income, respectively. Caregivers reported borrowing, selling property and withdrawing other children from school to cope with costs. Despite intentions of free healthcare services for under 5, families of acutely ill children very commonly faced catastrophic expenditure, especially for children with CSM. Interventions aimed at supporting financial protection, reducing additional healthcare costs, and lowering health service charges may help prevent catastrophic expenditures.",

        "title": "Improving Malaria diagnosis through interpretable customized CNNs architectures.",
        "abstract": "Malaria, which is spread via female Anopheles mosquitoes and is brought on by the Plasmodium parasite, persists as a serious illness, especially in areas with a high mosquito density. Traditional detection techniques, like examining blood samples with a microscope, tend to be labor-intensive, unreliable and necessitate specialized individuals. To address these challenges, we employed several customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including Parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN), Soft Attention Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (SPCNN), and Soft Attention after Functional Block Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (SFPCNN), to improve the effectiveness of malaria diagnosis. Among these, the SPCNN emerged as the most successful model, outperforming all other models in evaluation metrics. The SPCNN achieved a precision of 99.38 ± 0.21%, recall of 99.37 ± 0.21%, F1 score of 99.37 ± 0.21%, accuracy of 99.37 ± 0.30%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 99.95 ± 0.01%, demonstrating its robustness in detecting malaria parasites. Furthermore, we employed various transfer learning (TL) algorithms, including VGG16, ResNet152, MobileNetV3Small, EfficientNetB6, EfficientNetB7, DenseNet201, Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), ImageIntern, and Swin Transformer (versions v1 and v2). The proposed SPCNN model surpassed all these TL methods in every evaluation measure. The SPCNN model, with 2.207 million parameters and a size of 26 MB, is more complex than PCNN but simpler than SFPCNN. Despite this, SPCNN exhibited the fastest testing times (0.00252 s), making it more computationally efficient than both PCNN and SFPCNN. We assessed model interpretability using feature activation maps, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) visualizations for all three architectures, illustrating why SPCNN outperformed the others. The findings from our experiments show a significant improvement in malaria parasite diagnosis. The proposed approach outperforms traditional manual microscopy in terms of both accuracy and speed. This study highlights the importance of utilizing cutting-edge technologies to develop robust and effective diagnostic tools for malaria prevention.",

        "abstract": "There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230). 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success. Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

This systematic review aims to describe pathogens studied using MBAs, the operational implementation of MBAs, and how the data generated were synthesised. In November and December 2023, four databases were searched for studies utilising MBAs for the integrated serosurveillance of infectious diseases. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data regarding the study settings and population, methodology, seroprevalence results, and operational implementation elements. Overall, 4765 studies were identified; 47 were eligible for inclusion, of which 41% (<i>n</i> = 19) investigated multiple malaria species, and 14% performed concurrent surveillance of malaria in combination with other infectious diseases (<i>n</i> = 14). Additionally, 14 studies (29%) investigated a combination of multiple infectious diseases (other than malaria), and seven studies examined a combination of vaccine-preventable diseases. Haiti (<i>n</i> = 8) was the most studied country, followed by Ethiopia (<i>n</i> = 6), Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 3), Kenya (<i>n</i> = 3), and Tanzania (<i>n</i> = 3). Only seven studies were found where integrated serosurveillance was the primary objective. The synthesis of data varied and included the investigation of age-specific seroprevalence (<i>n</i> = 25), risk factor analysis (<i>n</i> = 15), and spatial analysis of disease prevalence (<i>n</i> = 8). This review demonstrated that the use of MBAs for integrated surveillance of multiple pathogens is gaining traction; however, more research and capabilities in lower- and middle-income countries are needed to optimise and standardise sample collection, survey implementation, and the analysis and interpretation of results. Geographical and population seroprevalence data can enable targeted public health interventions, highlighting the potential and importance of integrated serological surveillance as a public health tool.",

        "abstract": "African communities that have been forced to leave their homes experience a considerably greater susceptibility to malaria as a result of densely populated living conditions, restricted availability of healthcare, and environmental influences. Internally displaced individuals frequently live in large settlements with restricted availability to drinking water, essential sanitation, and medical services, intensifying the spread of malaria. As a result, the occurrence of malaria is significantly more common among refugees and internally displaced individuals compared to those who are not displaced. This leads to greater rates of illness and death, especially among young people. Insufficient monitoring worsens the condition, leading to delayed identification and medical intervention, and contributing to a higher incidence of severe malaria and deaths. Furthermore, these communities are faced with economic consequences that contribute to the continuation of poverty and the worsening of socio-economic inequalities. Furthermore, the psychological impact of malaria, which is marked by feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, is particularly severe in vulnerable populations such as displaced children and pregnant women, aggravating the overall burden. Hence, addressing malaria in displaced populations in Africa requires comprehensive and well-coordinated strategies. Advanced diagnostic and surveillance technologies are essential for promptly identifying and treating malaria, providing chances to monitor and control its spread effectively. Collaboration among healthcare, policy, and humanitarian sectors is crucial for implementing comprehensive solutions that incorporate enhanced diagnostics, surveillance, and socio-psychological support. Active involvement of the community, usage of Community Health Workers, and regular collection of surveillance data are crucial in increasing awareness, directing control efforts, and tackling the specific difficulties encountered by displaced groups. Moreover, the implementation of environmental management, the incorporation of health services, and the utilization of adaptable healthcare interventions are essential for reducing the effects of malaria. To mitigate the impact of malaria and improve health outcomes among displaced populations in Africa, it is crucial to focus on these specific areas.",

A PLR was performed at baseline, and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. Preload responsiveness assessed through PI was compared to preload responsiveness assessed through cardiac index (CI change ≥5%), as reference test. The primary endpoint was the accuracy of preload responsiveness prediction of PLR using PI at baseline; secondary endpoints were the accuracies at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. <b>Results:</b> The study included 34 patients admitted for sepsis with signs of hypoperfusion and 10 patients admitted for severe malaria. Of 168 PLR tests performed, 143 had reliable PI measurements (85%). The best identified PI change cutoff to discriminate responders from non-responders was 9.7%. The accuracy of PLR using PI in discriminating a preload responsive patient at baseline was good (area under the ROC 0.87 95% CI 0.75-0.99). The test showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value, with comparably lower specificity and positive predictive value. Compared to baseline, the AUROC of PLR using PI was lower at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h.

The COSTAR (Community-led Solutions to Antimicrobial Resistance) project includes a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Community Dialog Approach (CDA) to improve levels of correct and appropriate knowledge and reported practice about antibiotics, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance (ABR) from a One Health perspective, among adult community members in 5 selected sub-districts of Cumilla. The CDA is a community engagement approach involving community members in active discussions also known as Community Dialogs (CD), run by local facilitators. The dialogs promote collective action to produce sustainable social change. The trial's process evaluation will evaluate fidelity, dose, adaptation, reach, mechanisms of impact and the process of knowledge diffusion using the MRC framework for the evaluation of complex interventions. The process evaluation will be implemented in the catchment areas of 25 selected community clinics (CCs) in the intervention group. The key actors involved in the process evaluation are participants from master trainers and trainers training; community dialog facilitators; supervisors; community dialog participants and non-participants; and local and national level government stakeholders. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected through Focus Group Discussion (FGDs); Case Studies; Key Informant Interview (KIIs); CD observations; monitoring forms; quarterly feedback from facilitators and supervisors, and pre-and-post-test questionnaires administered during the training of facilitators. All qualitative data will be coded using <i>a priori</i> coding framework in NVIVO 14. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Ethical approval was obtained from the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC): BMRC/NREC/2019-2022/427 and from the University of Leeds Faculty of Medicine and Health ethics board: MREC 20-034. All results will be disseminated through a one pager summary; infographics; peer-reviewed journal articles and national and international conferences. https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN93756764, identifier ISRCTN93756764.",

        "title": "Diagnostic techniques for visceral leishmaniasis: An overview of methods used in East Africa.",
        "abstract": "Leishmanias is a parasitic infection caused by a protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania and transmitted by sand fly, Phlebotomus fly in the old world and Lutzomyia in the New world. The disease is prevalent in the tropics, subtropics, and Southern Europe, where it affects about 1.5 million to 2 million people annually. India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil and Ethiopia account for up to 90% of all the VL cases. While Leishmania cases in Asia are declining, cases in East Africa especially in Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have been increasing. The rise in East African cases is partially attributed to ongoing armed conflicts especially in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan, which has displaced people and increased their exposure to sand fly bites. Migration from endemic to non-endemic regions, misdiagnosis, famine, malnutrition, climate change and an increase in HIV cases are other contributing factors. The clinical diagnosis of Leishmania in East Africa combines the patient's clinical signs with either serological or parasitological test, with rK39 strip and microscopy being the major methods used. Diagnosis of the condition remains challenging, as current techniques have limitations, including the inability to detect parasites in tissue, the need for specialized expertise, prohibitive costs of testing equipment, low antibody titers, and the risk of misdiagnosis due to co-infections with diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid. Various techniques, including serological and molecular parasitological methods, have been employed in attempts to address these challenges, but with limited success. This article therefore, reviews some of the techniques that have been used in Leishmania diagnosis in East Africa and discusses other available new techniques with aim of overcoming the current challenges.",

        "title": "Indian Shot (<i>Canna Indica</i> L). Leaves Provide Valuable Insights into the Management of Inflammation and Other Associated Disorders Offering Health Benefits.",
        "abstract": "Throughout history, plants have played a crucial role in advancing medicinal treatments by providing a diverse range of compounds for the development of innovative therapies. <i>Canna indica</i> L. a tropical herb of the Cannaceae family, also known as Indian shot, has a rich history of traditional use in treating ailments like inflammation, malaria, dysentery, fever, dropsy, and diarrhea. This comprehensive research invesigates the extract preparation of <i>C. indica</i> leaves using multidisciplinary analytical approaches for this extract in order to shed light on its therapeutic potentials. The research, an international collaboration involving researchers from Bangladesh and China, utilized GC-MS/MS analysis to identify bioactive compounds across different <i>C. indica</i> extracts. Biological assays were conducted to assess antimicrobial activity using the disc diffusion method (in vitro), cytotoxicity through the brine shrimp lethality assay (in vitro), analgesic effects via the acetic acid-induced writhing test (in vivo), and antidiarrheal activity with the castor oil-induced diarrhea model (in vivo). Molecular docking studies were performed to determine binding affinities with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR), Delta Opioid Receptor (DOR), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) receptors. The GC-MS/MS analysis identified 35, 43, 27, and 20 compounds in dichloromethane, aqueous, petroleum ether, and ethyl acetate extracts, respectively. The aqueous (AQSF) and dichloromethane (DCMSF) extracts showed notable antimicrobial activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria. Cytotoxicity tests indicated that ethyl acetate (EASF) and dichloromethane (DCMSF) fractions were potent. Analgesic activity was highest in DCMSF, and antidiarrheal effects were dose-dependent, with DCMSF showing the greatest efficacy. Molecular docking revealed strong affinities of Ergostane-3,5,6,12,25-pentol, 25-acetate, (3.beta.,5.alpha.,6.beta.,12.beta).- for EGFR and Norgestrel for COX-2. This research provides valuable insights into the bioactivity evaluation of <i>C. indica</i>, bridging the gap between its chemical composition and diverse biological effects. The findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in natural product-based drug discovery and underscore the significance of <i>C. indica</i> as a potential source of novel therapeutic agents to treat inflammation and other disease states.",

        "abstract": "The 2022 WHO guidelines on multi-drug/rifampicin resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) recommend six months of bedaquiline (Bdq) in the all-oral 9-month shorter regimen and six months or longer for Bdq and delamanid (Dlm) in the 18-20-month longer regimen. However, lack of evidence on extended treatment using Bdq or Dlm has limited their use to six months. We examine the frequency and incidence of QT prolongation based on duration of Bdq and/or Dlm use in longer regimens. We analyzed a prospective cohort of MDR/RR-TB patients from 16 countries who initiated treatment with Bdq and/or Dlm containing regimens from 1 April 2015-30 September 2018. Data were systematically collected using a shared protocol. The outcome of interest was the first clinically relevant prolonged QT interval (grade 3 or above) or a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) involving prolonged QT of any grade. Among 2,553 patients, 59% received >6 months of Bdq and/or Dlm. Of these, 579 (20.9%) patients experienced a prolonged QT event, the majority (95.5%) being grade 1 or 2. Sixty-four(2.5%) patients experienced the outcome of interest with only 12 (0.5%) having ≥ 1 QT prolonging drugs permanently suspended. The incidence rate of the first prolonged QT event was highest in the first six months of treatment and lower in subsequent six-month periods. We demonstrate that Bdq and/or Dlm use beyond six months is safe in longer MDR/RR-TB regimens with most clinically relevant QT prolongation events occurring in the first six months. ECG monitoring for early identification of QT prolongating events is possible in programmatic conditions.",

In total, 16 publications from 2007 to 2024 were manually screened for inclusion in this systematic review. The articles were divided into three categories: climate and water, climate and health, and climate, water, and health. Due to the climate change, 20 million individuals in Bangladesh have been suffering from water- and health-related illness. The results showed that among Bangladeshi vulnerable groups, cholera, infant diarrhea, pneumonia, dengue, malaria, mental illness, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and an increase in communicable diseases like water-, vector-, and food-borne infections, along with malnutrition, are common. Further findings of the study include health risks, water-related risks, and difficulties in determining the consequences of climate change. This review study focuses on Bangladesh, a developing country, and the correlation between climate change and the dangers of water and health-related diseases. The findings of this study have substantial implications for risk assessment, water quality, climate change, and public health, especially in poor nations, as well as for policymakers and academicians in these fields.",

        "abstract": "The August 2024 floods in Bangladesh have precipitated a major public health crisis, significantly elevating the risk of waterborne and vector-borne diseases and exacerbating existing health vulnerabilities. This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

        "abstract": "Malaria poses a serious issue for pregnant women in African regions. It is crucial to comprehend the various factors that impact receiving IPTp during ANC checkups. These are important for the well-being of both pregnant mothers and their unborn children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the determinants of IPTp coverage among women in Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, and Nigeria. This cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) across Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, and Nigeria, focusing on women who received IPTp during pregnancy with IPTp categorized dichotomously as \"Yes\" for ANC visits and \"No\" for other visits. Chi-squared tests were used to assess associations, and binary logistic regression was conducted to calculate adjusted odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values. Results were summarized in tables. We found IPTp coverage during ANC visits was highest in Cameroon (98.6%), followed by Guinea (97.7%), Mali (97.1%), and lowest in Nigeria (95.5%). In Guinea, rural women were less likely to receive IPTp than urban women (AOR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07-0.41, p<0.001). In Mali, women who received 3 or more doses were less likely to receive IPTp at ANC (AOR: 0.48, p<0.01). In Nigeria, personal transport increased IPTp uptake (AOR: 1.88, p<0.01). In Cameroon, malaria prevention messages improved IPTp coverage (AOR: 3.12, p<0.05). This study highlights significant disparities in IPTp uptake, with rural Mali and Guinea facing lower coverage. In Nigeria, personal transport improved IPTp uptake. Targeted interventions are needed to improve ANC services and ensure equitable IPTp access across the study regions.",

        "title": "The 2024 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: facing record-breaking threats from delayed action.",
        "abstract": "Despite the initial hope inspired by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world is now dangerously close to breaching its target of limiting global multiyear mean heating to 1·5°C. Annual mean surface temperature reached a record high of 1·45°C above the pre-industrial baseline in 2023, and new temperature highs were recorded throughout 2024. The resulting climatic extremes are increasingly claiming lives and livelihoods worldwide. The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established the same year the Paris Agreement entered into force, to monitor the health impacts and opportunities of the world’s response to this landmark agreement. Supported through strategic core funding from Wellcome, the collaboration brings together over 300 multidisciplinary researchers and health professionals from around the world to take stock annually of the evolving links between health and climate change at global, regional, and national levels. The 2024 report of the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown, building on the expertise of 122 leading researchers from UN agencies and academic institutions worldwide, reveals the most concerning findings yet in the collaboration’s 8 years of monitoring. Data in this year’s report show that people all around the world are facing record-breaking threats to their wellbeing, health, and survival from the rapidly changing climate. Of the 15 indicators monitoring climate change-related health hazards, exposures, and impacts, ten reached concerning new records in their most recent year of data. Heat-related mortality of people older than 65 years increased by a record-breaking 167%, compared with the 1990s, 102 percentage points higher than the 65% that would have been expected without temperature rise (indicator 1.1.5). Heat exposure is also increasingly affecting physical activity and sleep quality, in turn affecting physical and mental health. In 2023, heat exposure put people engaging in outdoor physical activity at risk of heat stress (moderate or higher) for a record high of 27·7% more hours than on average in the 1990s (indicator 1.1.2) and led to a record 6% more hours of sleep lost in 2023 than the average during 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.4). People worldwide are also increasingly at risk from life-threatening extreme weather events. Between 1961–90 and 2014–23, 61% of the global land area saw an increase in the number of days of extreme precipitation (indicator 1.2.3), which in turn increases the risk of flooding, infectious disease spread, and water contamination. In parallel, 48% of the global land area was affected by at least 1 month of extreme drought in 2023, the second largest affected area since 1951 (indicator 1.2.2). The increase in drought and heatwave events since 1981–2010 was, in turn, associated with 151 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity across 124 countries assessed in 2022, the highest recorded value (indicator 1.4.2). The hotter and drier weather conditions are increasingly favouring the occurrence of sand and dust storms. This weather-environmental phenomenon contributed to a 31% increase in the number of people exposed to dangerously high particulate matter concentrations between 2003–07 and 2018–22 (indicator 1.2.4). Meanwhile, changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are favouring the transmission of deadly infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, West Nile virus-related illness, and vibriosis, putting people at risk of transmission in previously unaffected locations (indicators 1.3.1–1.3.4). Compounding these impacts, climate change is affecting the social and economic conditions on which health and wellbeing depend. The average annual economic losses from weather-related extreme events increased by 23% from 2010–14 to 2019–23, to US$227 billion (a value exceeding the gross domestic product [GDP] of about 60% of the world’s economies; indicator 4.1.1). Although 60·5% of losses in very high Human Development Index (HDI) countries were covered by insurance, the vast majority of those in countries with lower HDI levels were uninsured, with local communities bearing the brunt of the physical and economic losses (indicator 4.1.1). Extreme weather and climate change-related health impacts are also affecting labour productivity, with heat exposure leading to a record high loss of 512 billion potential labour hours in 2023, worth $835 billion in potential income losses (indicators 1.1.3 and 4.1.3). Low and medium HDI countries were most affected by these losses, which amounted to 7·6% and 4·4% of their GDP, respectively (indicator 4.1.3). With the most underserved communities most affected, these economic impacts further reduce their capacity to cope with and recover from the growing impacts of climate change, thereby amplifying global inequities. Concerningly, multiple hazards revealed by individual indicators are likely to have simultaneous compounding and cascading impacts on the complex and inter-connected human systems that sustain good health, disproportionately threatening people’s health and survival with every fraction of a degree of increase in global mean temperature. Despite years of monitoring exposing the imminent health threats of climate inaction, the health risks people face have been exacerbated by years of delays in adaptation, which have left people ill-protected from the growing threats of climate change. Only 68% of countries reported high-to-very-high implementation of legally mandated health emergency management capacities in 2023, of which just 11% were low HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Moreover, only 35% of countries reported having health early warning systems for heat-related illness, whereas 10% did so for mental and psychosocial conditions (indicator 2.2.1). Scarcity of financial resources was identified as a key barrier to adaptation, including by 50% of the cities that reported they were not planning to undertake climate change and health risk assessments (indicator 2.1.3). Indeed, adaptation projects with potential health benefits represented just 27% of all the Green Climate Fund’s adaptation funding in 2023, despite a 137% increase since 2021 (indicator 2.2.4). With universal health coverage still unattained in most countries, financial support is needed to strengthen health systems and ensure that they can protect people from growing climate change-related health hazards. The unequal distribution of financial resources and technical capacity is leaving the most vulnerable populations further unprotected from the growing health risks. As well as exposing the inadequacy of adaptation efforts to date, this year’s report reveals a world veering away from the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1·5°C, with concerning new records broken across indicators monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that enable them. Far from declining, global energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reached an all-time high in 2023 (indicator 3.1.1). Oil and gas companies are reinforcing the global dependence on fossil fuels and—partly fuelled by the high energy prices and windfall profits of the global energy crisis—most are further expanding their fossil fuel production plans. As of March, 2024, the 114 largest oil and gas companies were on track to exceed emissions consistent with 1·5°C of heating by 189% in 2040, up from 173% 1 year before (indicator 4.2.2). As a result, their strategies are pushing the world further off track from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, further threatening people’s health and survival. Although renewable energy could provide power to remote locations, its adoption is lagging, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The consequences of this delay reflect the human impacts of an unjust transition. Globally, 745 million people still lack access to electricity and are facing the harms of energy poverty on health and wellbeing. The burning of polluting biomass (eg, wood or dung) still accounts for 92% of the energy used in the home by people in low HDI countries (indicator 3.1.2), and only 2·3% of electricity in these countries comes from clean renewables, compared with 11·6% in very high HDI countries (indicators 3.1.1). This persistent burning of fossil fuel and biomass led to at least 3·33 million deaths from outdoor fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2·5</sub>) air pollution globally in 2021 alone (indicator 3.2.1), and the domestic use of dirty solid fuels caused 2·3 million deaths from indoor air pollution in 2020 across 65 countries analysed (indicator 3.2.2). Compounding the growth in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, almost 182 million hectares of forests were lost between 2016 and 2022 (indicator 3.4), reducing the world’s natural capacity to capture atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. In parallel, the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which contributed to 11·2 million deaths attributable to unhealthy diets in 2021 (indicator 3.3.2), has led to a 2·9% increase in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions since 2016 (indicator 3.3.1). Health systems themselves, although essential to protect people’s health, are also increasingly contributing to the problem. Greenhouse gas emissions from health care have increased by 36% since 2016, making health systems increasingly unprepared to operate in a net zero emissions future and pushing health care further from its guiding principle of doing no harm (indicator 3.5). The growing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is pushing the world to a future of increasingly dangerous health hazards and reducing the chances of survival of vulnerable people all around the globe. With the availability of financial resources a key barrier to tackling climate change, a rapid growth in predictable and equitable investment is urgently needed to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. A growing body of literature shows that the economic benefits of a transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions will far exceed the costs of inaction. Healthier, more resilient populations will further support more prosperous and sustainable economies (indicators 4.1.2–4.1.4). However, although funding to enable potentially life-saving climate change adaptation and mitigation activities remains scarce, substantial financial resources are being allocated to activities that harm health and perpetuate a fossil fuel-based economy. The resulting reliance on fossil fuel energy has meant many countries faced sharp increases in energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruption of fossil fuel supplies. To keep energy affordable to local populations, many governments resorted to increasing their explicit fossil fuel subsidies. Consequently, 84% of countries studied still operated net negative carbon prices (explicit net fossil fuel subsidies) in 2022, for a record high net total of $1·4 trillion (indicator 4.3.3), with the sums involved often comparable to countries’ total health budgets. In addition, although clean energy investment grew by 10% globally in 2023—exceeding fossil fuel investment by 73%—considerable regional disparities exist. Clean energy investment is 38% lower than fossil fuel spending in emerging market and developing economies outside China. Clean energy spending in these countries only accounted for 17·4% of the global total. Moreover, investment in energy efficiency and end use, essential for a just transition, decreased by 1·3% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1). The resulting expansion of fossil fuel assets is increasingly jeopardising the economies on which people’s livelihoods depend. On the current trajectory, the world already faces potential global income losses ranging from 11% to 29% by 2050. The number of fossil fuel industry employees reached 11·8 million in 2022, increasing the size of a workforce whose employment cannot be sustained in a world that avoids the most catastrophic human impacts of climate change (indicator 4.2.1). Meanwhile, ongoing investments in coal power have pushed the value of coal-fired power generation assets that risk becoming stranded within 10 years (between 2025 and 2034) in a 1·5°C trajectory to a cumulative total of $164·5 billion—a value that will increase if coal investments persist (indicator 4.2.3). The prioritisation of fossil fuel-based systems means most countries remain ill-prepared for the vital transition to zero greenhouse gas emission economies. As a result of an unjust transition, the risk is unequally distributed: preparedness scores for the transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy were below the global average in all countries with a low HDI, 96% of those with a medium HDI, and 84% of those with a high HDI, compared with just 7% of very high HDI countries (indicator 4.2.4). Following decades of delays in climate change action, avoiding the most severe health impacts of climate change now requires aligned, structural, and sustained changes across most human systems, including energy, transportation, agriculture, food, and health care. Importantly, a global transformation of financial systems is required, shifting resources away from the fossil fuel-based economy towards a zero emissions future. Putting people’s health at the centre of climate change policy making is key to ensuring this transition protects wellbeing, reduces health inequities, and maximises health gains. Some indicators reveal incipient progress and important opportunities for delivering this health-centred transformation. As of December, 2023, 50 countries reported having formally assessed their health vulnerabilities and adaptation needs, up from 11 the previous year, and the number of countries that reported having a Health National Adaptation Plan increased from four in 2022 to 43 in 2023 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Additionally, 70% of 279 public health education institutions worldwide reported providing education in climate and health in 2023, essential to build capacities for health professionals to help shape this transition (indicator 2.2.6). Regarding the energy sector, the global share of electricity from clean modern renewables reached a record high of 10·5% in 2021 (indicator 3.1.1); clean energy investment exceeded fossil fuel investment by 73% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1); and renewable energy-related employment has grown 35·6% since 2016, providing healthier and more sustainable employment opportunities than those in the fossil fuel industry (indicator 4.2.1). Importantly, mostly as a result of coal phase-down in high and very high HDI countries, deaths attributable to outdoor PM<sub>2·5</sub> from fossil fuel combustion decreased by 6·9% between 2016 and 2021 (indicator 3.2.1), showing the life-saving potential of coal phase-out. Important progress was made within international negotiations, which opened new opportunities to protect health in the face of climate change. After years of leadership from WHO on climate change and health, its Fourteenth General Programme of Work, adopted in May, 2024, made responding to climate change its first strategic priority. Within climate negotiations themselves, the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) featured the first health thematic day in 2023: 151 countries endorsed the COP28 United Arab Emirates Declaration on Climate and Health, and the Global Goal on Adaptation set a specific health target. The outcome of the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement also recognised the right to health and a healthy environment, urging parties to take further health adaptation efforts, and opened a new opportunity for human survival, health, and wellbeing to be prioritised in the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) due in 2025. The pending decision of how the Loss and Damage fund will be governed and the definition of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance during COP29 provide further opportunities to secure the financial support crucial for a healthy net zero transition. Although still insufficient to protect people’s health from climate change, these emerging signs of progress help open new opportunities to deliver a healthy, prosperous future. However, much remains to be done. With climate change breaking dangerous new records and emissions persistently rising, preventing the most catastrophic consequences on human development, health, and survival now requires the support and will of all actors in society. However, data suggest that engagement with health and climate change could be declining across key sectors: the number of governments mentioning health and climate change in their annual UN General Debate statements fell from 50% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, and only 47% of the 58 NDCs updated as of February, 2024, referred to health (indicator 5.4.1). Media engagement also dropped, with the proportion of newspaper climate change articles mentioning health falling 10% between 2022 and 2023 (indicator 5.1). The powerful and trusted leadership of the health community could hold the key to reversing these concerning trends and making people’s wellbeing, health, and survival a central priority of political and financial agendas. The engagement of health professionals at all levels of climate change decision making will be pivotal in informing the redirection of efforts and financial resources away from activities that jeopardise people’s health towards supporting healthy populations, prosperous economies, and a safer future. As concerning records continue to be broken and people face unprecedented risks from climate change, the wellbeing, health, and survival of individuals in every country now hang in the balance.",

        "abstract": "Among 13 endemic districts, the Chittagong Hill Tracts bear more than 90% of Bangladesh's malaria burden. Despite the private sector's prominence in rural healthcare, its role in malaria management remains underutilized. This study aimed to strategize leveraging the for-profit private sector, such as diagnostic and treatment centers, to bolster national malaria surveillance and control, advancing Bangladesh toward malaria elimination by 2030. This mixed-method study commenced with a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey followed by selected focused group discussions (FGDs) among the participants. Three FGDs were held with the for-profit service providers so that further insights and qualitative viewpoints of them can be utilized in situation analysis. Based on the endemicity and strategic priorities, a comprehensive mapping of private for-profit facilities from the regions comprising 15 sub-districts across 8 chosen districts (7 malaria endemic districts and the rest non-endemic districts) was created. For the non-endemic zone, the sub-districts were selected based on their proximity to an area with high malaria transmission. Among the 104 representative participants, majority were male (n = 92, 88.5%), had a diploma in their respective fields (n = 53, 51%) and were involved either in laboratory work (n = 49, 47.1%) or as owners/managers of health centers (n = 41, 39.4%). The selected health facilities were close to the corresponding Upazila Health Complexes (mean distance 2.8 km), but were distantly located from the designated district hospitals (mean distance 48.9 km). The main sources of RDT kits (62.3%) and anti-malarial drugs (63.2%) were local wholesale markets. A large share of the corresponding facilities neither provided malaria treatment services (81.7%) nor worked with the NMEP (93.3%). This study highlights challenges and recommendations for engaging private for-profit health facilities in Bangladesh's malaria elimination efforts. The identified challenges include low-quality RDTs, staff shortages, and inadequate capacity building. Recommendations emphasize effective training, stakeholder interaction, and enhanced oversight for successful malaria control efforts.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary oedema is a feared and difficult to predict complication of severe malaria that can emerge after start of antimalarial treatment. Proinflammatory mediators are thought to play a central role in its pathogenesis. An exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the predictive capacity of biomarkers for development of clinical pulmonary oedema in patients with severe falciparum malaria at two hospitals in Bangladesh. Plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), soluble Receptor of Advanced Glycation End-products (sRAGE), surfactant protein-D (SP-D), club cell secretory protein (CC16), and Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) on admission were compared with healthy controls. Correlations between these biomarker and plasma lactate and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) levels were evaluated. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the predictive capacity for clinical pulmonary oedema of the biomarkers of interest. Of 106 screened patients with falciparum malaria, 56 were classified as having severe malaria with a mortality rate of 29%. Nine (16%) patients developed clinical pulmonary oedema after admission. Plasma levels of the biomarkers of interest were higher in patients compared to healthy controls. IL-6, IL-8, TNF, sRAGE, and CC16 levels correlated well with plasma PfHRP2 levels (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.39; P = 0.004, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.43; P = 0.001, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.54; P < 0.001, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.44; P < 0.001, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.43; P = 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-8 levels correlated well with plasma lactate levels (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.37; P = 0.005, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.47; P < 0.001, respectively). None of the biomarkers of interest had predictive capacity for development of clinical pulmonary oedema. IL-6, IL-8, TNF, sRAGE, SP-D, CC16 and KL-6 cannot be used in predicting clinical pulmonary oedema in severe malaria patients.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a life-threatening cause of stroke in Asian countries. South Asia, comprising of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, contributed to 40% of strokes in women. Major CVT registries are from the Western nations, which differs from the Asian countries with respect to epidemiology, gender biases, and risk factors. This review focuses on the various aspects of relevance in evaluation and management of patients with CVT in the Asian context. The incidence of CVT is higher in Asia than in Western nations. Young age, female gender, especially in pregnancy and puerperal period, and dehydration appear to be the critical risk factors. Tropical infections like malaria, scrub typhus, and flaviviral encephalitis predispose to CVT. There is a higher prevalence of inherited thrombophilia in the Asian cohorts, contributing to prothrombotic states. Anticoagulation and supportive management offer excellent outcomes. Newer anticoagulants are safe and efficacious. In medically refractory cases, endovascular treatment offers modest benefits. Decompressive hemicraniectomy, when done early, offers mortality benefits in patients with large hemorrhagic venous infarctions. CVT is an important cause of stroke with a high burden in South Asian countries. Establishment of robust registries is the need of the hour to study the natural history, course, and outcomes and to develop management algorithms tailored to the available resources.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh reduced malaria incidence by 93% from 2008 to 2020 through the action of governmental and non-governmental organizations. The Bangladesh context is unique to South Asia because its successful public sector malaria control programs have historically not engaged corporate partners (as undertaken in Sri Lanka and proposed in India). However, ∼18 million people continue to live at risk of infection in Bangladesh and for-profit private healthcare providers, catalytic for malaria elimination in many countries, are expected to benefit the national program. We distilled (from a large and complex literature) nine distinct strategies important in other developing settings and weighed them in the context of Bangladesh's flourishing private health care sector, driven by patient demand, self-interest and aspirations for public good, as well as heterogeneity in providers and malaria-prevalence. We propose a new model dependent on five strategies and its immediate deployment considerations in high endemic areas, to empower Bangladesh's phased agenda of eliminating indigenous malaria transmission by 2030.",

        "abstract": "This is important to note that altered mental status is not a disease in itself, but rather a symptom with a wide range of potential diagnoses. But a structured approach to assessing the patients with this symptom frequently leads to helpful information and can rule out worst-case scenarios. In cases where fever is followed by changes in consciousness, quick assessment of the patient's level of consciousness and potential causes is decisive. A focused history and physical assessment can help differentiate between structural or medical causes. Asymmetrical neurological findings, such as a dilated and fixed pupil, dysconjugated extraocular movements and asymmetrical motor findings, suggest brainstem dysfunction due to a structural lesion, while symmetrical neurological findings usually indicate a medical disorder. A recent study aimed to identify features of different etiologies, demographic patterns, and common causes of both acute and prolonged febrile illness in patients. This cross-sectional type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from April 2014 to October 2015. Over the study period patients admitted with satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of study and purposively selected (non-probability) from the hospitalized patients. Total 100 cases with febrile illness and altered consciousness meeting the exclusion and inclusion criteria were examined and investigated to find out the actual etiology. Out of 100 patients, it was observed that 26(26.0%) of patients were suffering from pneumonia, 22(22.0%) urinary tract infection, 18(18.0%) meningitis, 14(14.0%) typhoid fever, 8(8.0%) meningo-encephalitis, 6(6.0%) cerebral malaria, 4(4.0%) tuberculosis and 2(2.0%) from tuberculoma. The result revealed that large number of patients with febrile illness and altered consciousness were suffering from pneumonia and urinary tract infection.",

        "abstract": "Existing antimalarial drugs primarily target blood-stage parasites, but there is a need for transmission-blocking drugs to combat malaria effectively. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Calcium-dependent Protein Kinase 4 (CDPK4) is a promising target for such drugs. This study employed advanced in silico analyses of hexahydroquinolines (HHQ) derivatives to identify <i>Pf</i>CDPK4 inhibitors capable of disrupting malaria transmission. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was employed to discover HHQ derivatives with the highest binding affinities against the 3D structure of <i>Pf</i>CDPK4 (PDB 1D: 4QOX). Interaction analysis of protein-ligand complexes utilized Discovery Studio Client, while druglikeness and ADMET properties were assessed using SwissADME and pkCSM web servers, respectively. Quantum mechanical calculations of the top hits were conducted using density functional theory (DFT), and GROMACS was employed to perform the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Binding free energy was predicted using the MMPBSA.py tool from the AMBER package. SBVS identified ten best hits possessing docking scores within the range of -11.2 kcal/mol and -10.6 kcal/mol, surpassing the known inhibitor, BKI-1294 (-9.9 kcal/mol). Among these, 4-[4-(Furan-2-carbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]-1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-oxo-4a,5,6,7,8,8a-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbonitrile (PubChem ID: 145784778) exhibited the highest binding affinity (-11.2 kcal/mol) against <i>Pf</i>CDPK4. Comparative analysis of this compound with BKI-1294 using advanced computational approaches demonstrated competitive potential. These findings suggest the potential of 4-[4-(Furan-2-carbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]-1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-oxo-4a,5,6,7,8,8a-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbonitrile as a promising <i>Pf</i>CDPK4 inhibitor for disrupting malaria transmission.

        "abstract": "The emergence of acute neurological symptoms in children necessitates immediate intervention. Although low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden of neurological diseases, there is a scarcity of diagnostic and therapeutic resources. Therefore, current understanding of the etiology of neurological emergencies in LMICs relies mainly on clinical diagnoses and verbal autopsies. To characterize the association of premortem neurological symptoms and their management with postmortem-confirmed cause of death among children aged younger than 5 years in LMICs and to identify current gaps and improve strategies to enhance child survival. This cross-sectional study was conducted between December 3, 2016, and July 22, 2022, at the 7 participating sites in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa). Minimally invasive tissue sampling was performed at the CHAMPS sites with specimens from deceased children aged younger than 5 years. This study included deceased children who underwent a premortem neurological evaluation and had a postmortem-confirmed cause of death. Data analysis was performed between July 22, 2022, and January 15, 2023. Descriptive analysis was performed using neurological evaluations from premortem clinical records and from postmortem determination of cause of death (based on histopathology, microbiological testing, clinical records, and verbal autopsies). Of the 2127 deaths of children codified during the study period, 1330 (62.5%) had neurological evaluations recorded and were included in this analysis. The 1330 children had a median age of 11 (IQR, 2-324) days; 745 (56.0%) were male and 727 (54.7%) presented with neurological symptoms during illness before death. The most common postmortem-confirmed neurological diagnoses related to death were hypoxic events (308 [23.2%]), meningoencephalitis (135 [10.2%]), and cerebral malaria (68 [5.1%]). There were 12 neonates with overlapping hypoxic events and meningoencephalitis, but there were no patients with overlapping meningoencephalitis and cerebral malaria. Neurological symptoms were similar among diagnoses, and no combination of symptoms was accurate in differentiating them without complementary tools. However, only 25 children (18.5%) with meningitis had a lumbar puncture performed before death. Nearly 90% of deaths (442 of 511 [86.5%]) with neurological diagnoses in the chain of events leading to death were considered preventable. In this cross-sectional study of children aged younger than 5 years, neurological symptoms were frequent before death. However, clinical phenotypes were insufficient to differentiate the most common underlying neurological diagnoses. The low rate of lumbar punctures performed was especially worrying, suggesting a challenge in quality of care of children presenting with neurological symptoms. Improved diagnostic management of neurological emergencies is necessary to ultimately reduce mortality in this vulnerable population.",

Bangladesh has a noticeable rise in VBDs attributed to climate change. Despite the severity of this issue, the interconnections between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this research gap, our review meticulously examined existing literature on the relationship between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, we identified 3849 records from SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Ultimately, 22 research articles meeting specific criteria were included. We identified that the literature on the subject matter of this study is non-contemporaneous, with 68% of studies investing datasets before 2014, despite studies on climate change and dengue nexus having increased recently. We pinpointed Dhaka and Chittagong Hill Tracts as the dengue and malaria research hotspots, respectively. We highlighted that the 2023 dengue outbreak illustrates a possible shift in dengue-endemic areas in Bangladesh. Moreover, dengue cases surged by 317% in 2023 compared to 2019 records, with a corresponding 607% increase in mortality compared to 2022. A weak connection was observed between dengue incidents and climate drivers, including the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). However, no compelling evidence supported an association between malaria cases, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Bay of Bengal, along with the NINO3 phenomenon. We observed minimal microclimatic and non-climatic data inclusion in selected studies. Our review holds implications for policymakers, urging the prioritization of mitigation measures such as year-round surveillance and early warning systems. Ultimately, it calls for resource allocation to empower researchers in advancing the understanding of VBD dynamics amidst changing climates.",

        "abstract": "Undernutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a small vulnerable newborn. Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) contain both macro- and micronutrients and can help prevent multiple nutritional deficiencies. We examined the effects of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy compared with 1) iron and folic acid or standard of care (IFA/SOC) or 2) multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) and identified characteristics that modified the estimates of effects of SQ-LNSs on birth outcomes. We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 4 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy (n = 5273). We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with IFA/SOC or MMS and pooled the estimates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether the results differed depending on methods for gestational age dating, birth anthropometry, or study design. SQ-LNSs (compared with IFA/SOC) increased birth weight [mean difference: +49 g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 26, 71 g] and all birth anthropometric z-scores (+0.10-0.13 standard deviation); they reduced risk of low birth weight by 11%, newborn stunting by 17%, newborn wasting by 11%, and small head size by 15%. Only 2 trials compared SQ-LNSs and MMSs; P values for birth outcomes were >0.10 except for head circumference (e.g., z-score for gestational age: +0.11; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.23). Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with IFA/SOC were greater among female infants and, for certain outcomes, among mothers with body mass index <20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, inflammation, malaria, or household food insecurity. Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with MMSs were greater for certain outcomes among female infants, first-born infants, and mothers <25 y. SQ-LNSs had positive impacts on multiple outcomes compared to IFA/SOC, but further research directly comparing SQ-LNSs and MMSs is needed. Targeting SQ-LNSs to vulnerable subgroups may be worth considering. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021283391.",

        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

        "title": "Seasonal variability and stochastic branching process in malaria outbreak probability.",
        "abstract": "Malaria is the world's most fatal and challenging parasitic disease, caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Bangladesh is the most vulnerable region to spread malaria because of its geographic position. In this paper, we have considered the dynamics of vector-host models and observed the stochastic behavior. This study elaborates on the seasonal variability and calculates the probability of disease outbreaks. We present a model for malaria disease transmission and develop its corresponding continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) representation. The proposed vector-host models illustrate the malaria transmission model along with sensitivity analysis. The deterministic model with CTMC curves is depicted to show the randomness in real scenarios. Sequentially, we expand these studies to a time-varying stochastic vector-host model that incorporates seasonal variability. Phase plane analysis is conducted to explore the characteristics of the disease, examine interactions among various compartments, and evaluate the impact of key parameters. The branching process approximation is developed for the corresponding vector-host model to calculate the probability outbreak. Numerous numerical results are accomplished to observe the analytical investigation. Seasonality and contact patterns affect the dynamics of disease outbreaks. The numerical illustration provides that the probability of a disease outbreak depends on the infected host or vector. Additionally, periodic transmission rates have a great influence on the probability outbreak. The basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) is derived, which is the main justification for studying the dynamical behavior of epidemic models. Seasonal variability significantly impacts malaria transmission, and the probability of disease outbreaks is influenced by time and the initial number of infected individuals. Moreover, the branching process approximation is applicable when the population size is large enough and the basic reproduction number is less than 1. In the future, such analysis can help decision-makers understand the impact of various parameters and their stochastic behavior in the vector-host model to prevent such types of disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "A number of studies have detected relationships between weather and diarrhea. Few have investigated associations with specific enteric pathogens. Understanding pathogen-specific relationships with weather is crucial to inform public health in low-resource settings that are especially vulnerable to climate change. Our objectives were to identify weather and environmental risk factors associated with diarrhea and enteropathogen prevalence in young children in rural Bangladesh, a population with high diarrheal disease burden and vulnerability to weather shifts under climate change. We matched temperature, precipitation, surface water, and humidity data to observational longitudinal data from a cluster-randomized trial that measured diarrhea and enteropathogen prevalence in children 6 months-5.5 years from 2012-2016. We fit generalized additive mixed models with cubic regression splines and restricted maximum likelihood estimation for smoothing parameters. Comparing weeks with 30°C versus 15°C average temperature, prevalence was 3.5% higher for diarrhea, 7.3% higher for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), 17.3% higher for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and 8.0% higher for Cryptosporidium. Above-median weekly precipitation (median: 13mm; range: 0-396mm) was associated with 29% higher diarrhea (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.07, 1.55); higher Cryptosporidium, ETEC, STEC, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, and adenovirus 40/41; and lower Giardia, sapovirus, and norovirus prevalence. Other associations were weak or null. Higher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher prevalence of diarrhea and multiple enteropathogens; higher precipitation was associated with lower prevalence of some enteric viruses. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneity of the relationships between hydrometeorological variables and specific enteropathogens, which can be masked when looking at composite measures like all-cause diarrhea. Our results suggest that preventive interventions targeted to reduce enteropathogens just before and during the rainy season may more effectively reduce child diarrhea and enteric pathogen carriage in rural Bangladesh and in settings with similar meteorological characteristics, infrastructure, and enteropathogen transmission.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains one the leading communicable causes of death. Approximately half of the world's population is considered at risk of infection, predominantly in African and South Asian countries. Although malaria is preventable, heterogeneity in sociodemographic and environmental risk factors over time and across diverse geographical and climatological regions make outbreak prediction challenging. Data-driven approaches accounting for spatiotemporal variability could offer potential for location-specific early warning tools for malaria. In this case study, we developed and internally validated a data fusion approach to predict malaria incidence in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh using geo-referenced environmental factors. For 2000-17, district-level malaria incidence rates for each country were obtained from the US Agency for International Development's Demographic and Health Survey datasets. Environmental factors included average annual temperature, rainfall, and normalised difference vegetation index, obtained from the Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (known as AReNA) project conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute in 2020. Data on night-time light intensity was derived from two satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System: Nighttime Lights Time Series Version 4, and VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites version 1. A multi-dimensional spatiotemporal long short-term memory (M-LSTM) model was developed using data from 2000-16 and internally validated for the year 2017. The M-LSTM model consisted of four hidden layers, each with 100 LSTM units; a fully connected layer was used, followed by linear regression, to predict the malaria incidence rate for 2017 using spatiotemporal partitioning. Model performance was measured using accuracy and root mean squared error. Country-specific models were produced for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Bivariate geospatial heatmaps were produced for a qualitative comparison of univariate environmental factors with malaria rates. Malaria incidence was predicted with 80·6% accuracy in districts across Pakistan, 76·7% in districts across India, and 99·1% in districts across Bangladesh. The root mean squared error was 7 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for Pakistan, 4·86 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for India, and 1·32 × 10<sup>-5</sup> for Bangladesh. Bivariate maps showed an inverse relationship between night-time lights and malaria rates; whereas high malaria rates were found in areas with high temperature, rainfall, and vegetation. Malaria outbreaks could be forecasted using remotely measured environmental factors. Modelling techniques that enable simultaneously forecasting ahead in time as well as across large geographical areas might potentially empower regional decision makers to manage outbreaks early.

        "abstract": "Systems for disease vector control should be effective, efficient, and flexible to be able to tackle contemporary challenges and threats in the control and elimination of vector-borne diseases. As a priority activity towards the strengthening of vector control systems, it has been advocated that countries conduct a vector-control needs assessment. A review was carried out of the perceived needs for disease vector control programs among eleven countries and subnational states in South Asia and the Middle East. In each country or state, independent teams conducted vector control needs assessment with engagement of stakeholders. Important weaknesses were described for malaria, dengue and leishmaniases regarding vector surveillance, insecticide susceptibility testing, monitoring and evaluation of operations, entomological capacity and laboratory infrastructure. In addition, community mobilization and intersectoral collaboration showed important gaps. Countries and states expressed concern about insecticide resistance that could reduce the continued effectiveness of interventions, which demands improved monitoring. Moreover, attainment of disease elimination necessitates enhanced vector surveillance. Vector control needs assessment provided a useful planning tool for systematic strengthening of vector control systems. A limitation in conducting the vector control needs assessment was that it is time- and resource-intensive. To increase the feasibility and utility of national assessments, an abridged version of the guidance should focus on operationally relevant topics of the assessment.

        "abstract": "Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

        "abstract": "In low-income and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia, the burden of diseases among rural population remains poorly understood, posing a challenge for effective healthcare prioritisation and resource allocation. Addressing this knowledge gap, the South and Southeast Asia Community-based Trials Network (SEACTN) will undertake a survey that aims to determine the prevalence of a wide range of non-communicable and communicable diseases, as one of the key initiatives of its first project-the Rural Febrile Illness project (RFI). This survey, alongside other RFI studies that explore fever aetiology, leading causes of mortality, and establishing village and health facility maps and profiles, will provide an updated epidemiological background of the rural areas where the network is operational. During 2022-2023, a cross-sectional household survey will be conducted across three SEACTN sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Thailand. Using a two-stage cluster-sampling approach, we will employ a probability-proportional-to-size sample method for village, and a simple random sample for household, selection, enrolling all members from the selected households. Approximately 1500 participants will be enrolled per country. Participants will undergo questionnaire interview, physical examination and haemoglobin point-of-care testing. Blood samples will be collected and sent to central laboratories to test for chronic and acute infections, and biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Prevalences will be presented as an overall estimate by country, and stratified and compared across sites and participants' sociodemographic characteristics. Associations between disease status, risk factors and other characteristics will be explored. This study protocol has been approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, National Research Ethics Committee of Bangladesh Medical Research Council, the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health Research, the Chiang Rai Provincial Public Health Research Ethical Committee.

        "abstract": "Antimalarial drug resistance poses a severe danger to global health. In Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), there is a lack of reliable information on antimalarial prescriptions for recent malarial fever in children under five. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of unqualified sources of antimalarial drug prescription for children under the age of five in 19 low- and middle-income countries. We performed a cross-sectional study of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) datasets (n = 106265) across 19 LMICs. The recent MIS datasets were used, and the study only included children under five who had taken an antimalarial drug for a recent malarial fever. The outcome variable was classified into two distinct categories: those who had taken antimalarial drugs for malarial fever from qualified sources and those who did not. Among LMICs, we found that 87.1% of children under five received an antimalarial prescription from unqualified sources who had recently experienced malarial fever. In several LMICs (Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana), a substantial portion of recent antimalarial prescriptions for malaria was taken from unqualified sources (about 60%). Some LMICs (Guinea (31.8%), Mali (31.3%), Nigeria (20.4%), Kenya (2.6%), and Senegal (2.7%)) had low rates of antimalarial drug consumption even though children under five received a high percentage of antimalarial prescriptions from qualified sources for a recent malarial fever. Living in rural areas, having mothers with higher education, and having parents with more wealth were frequently taken antimalarial from qualified sources for recent malarial fever in children under five across the LMICs. The study draws attention to the importance of national and local level preventative strategies across the LMICs to restrict antimalarial drug consumption. This is because antimalarial prescriptions from unqualified sources for recent malarial fever in children under five were shockingly high in most LMICs and had high rates of unqualified prescriptions in certain other LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV are among the most lethal diseases, with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) being a chronic and potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Individually, each of these infections presents a significant health challenge. However, when tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV co-occur, the symptoms can worsen, leading to an increased mortality risk. Mathematical models have been created to study coinfections involving tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. This systematic literature review explores the importance of coinfection models by examining articles from reputable databases such as Dimensions, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and PubMed. The primary emphasis is on investigating coinfection models related to tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. The findings demonstrate that each article thoroughly covers various aspects, including model development, mathematical analysis, sensitivity analysis, optimal control strategies, and research discoveries. Based on our comprehensive evaluation, we offer valuable recommendations for future research efforts in this field.",

        "title": "Mathematical models of Plasmodium vivax transmission: A scoping review.",
        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is one of the most geographically widespread malaria parasites in the world, primarily found across South-East Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa. One of the significant characteristics of the P. vivax parasite is its ability to remain dormant in the human liver as hypnozoites and subsequently reactivate after the initial infection (i.e. relapse infections). Mathematical modelling approaches have been widely applied to understand P. vivax dynamics and predict the impact of intervention outcomes. Models that capture P. vivax dynamics differ from those that capture P. falciparum dynamics, as they must account for relapses caused by the activation of hypnozoites. In this article, we provide a scoping review of mathematical models that capture P. vivax transmission dynamics published between January 1988 and May 2023. The primary objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive summary of the mathematical models and techniques used to model P. vivax dynamics. In doing so, we aim to assist researchers working on mathematical epidemiology, disease transmission, and other aspects of P. vivax malaria by highlighting best practices in currently published models and highlighting where further model development is required. We categorise P. vivax models according to whether a deterministic or agent-based approach was used. We provide an overview of the different strategies used to incorporate the parasite's biology, use of multiple scales (within-host and population-level), superinfection, immunity, and treatment interventions. In most of the published literature, the rationale for different modelling approaches was driven by the research question at hand. Some models focus on the parasites' complicated biology, while others incorporate simplified assumptions to avoid model complexity. Overall, the existing literature on mathematical models for P. vivax encompasses various aspects of the parasite's dynamics. We recommend that future research should focus on refining how key aspects of P. vivax dynamics are modelled, including spatial heterogeneity in exposure risk and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection, the accumulation of hypnozoite variation, the interaction between P. falciparum and P. vivax, acquisition of immunity, and recovery under superinfection.",

The ongoing Phase 3 trial of Innovax's bivalent (types 16 and 18) HPV vaccine (Cecolin®) assesses in low- and middle-income countries alternative dosing schedules and generates data following one dose in girls 9-14 years old. Interim data for the 6-month dosing groups are presented. In Bangladesh and Ghana, 1,025 girls were randomized to receive either two doses of Cecolin at 6-, 12-, or 24-month intervals; one dose of Gardasil® followed by one dose of Cecolin at month 24; or two doses of Gardasil 6 months apart (referent). Serology was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, in a subset, by neutralization assays. Primary objectives include immunological non-inferiority of the Cecolin schedules to referent one month after the second dose. Safety endpoints include reactogenicity and unsolicited adverse events for 7 and 30 days post-vaccination, respectively, as well as serious adverse events throughout the study. Interim analyses included data from the two groups on a 0, 6-month schedule with 205 participants per group. One month after Dose 2, 100% of participants were seropositive by ELISA and had seroconverted for both antigens. Non-inferiority of Cecolin to Gardasil was demonstrated. Six months following one dose, over 96% of participants were seropositive by ELISA for both HPV antigens, with a trend for higher geometric mean concentration following Cecolin administration. Reactogenicity and safety were comparable between both vaccines. Cecolin in a 0, 6-month schedule elicits robust immunogenicity. Non-inferiority to Gardasil was demonstrated one month after a 0, 6-month schedule. Immunogenicity following one dose was comparable to Gardasil up to six months. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov No. 04508309).",

        "abstract": "The \"Bedia\" tribal people are found all over India; they are poor, illiterate, and confined culturally. In many parts of India, malaria, a disease caused by mosquitoes, is becoming more common. Raising awareness and educating people about it is the best method to stop disease and maintain good health. This study aimed to determine the perception, attitudes, and practices of a particularly vulnerable tribal group-the \"Bedia\"-in the rural region of eastern India. A questionnaire with 19 structured questions has been created. The Bedia participants received the questionnaire from us. They had already responded. The intervention took the form of several health education workshops that were created in response to the deficiencies identified in the pre-test assessment's replies. The identical questionnaire used for the pre-test evaluation was given to each participant for the post-test who attended the training sessions. The current study found that while the first cognitive domain question on malaria transmission was not statistically significant, changes in malaria breeding grounds, regions with higher mosquito numbers, and the source of information about malaria are. Their knowledge of the treatment for malaria and the agent used to treat it is statistically significant in the current study, but the fifth question on the most common symptom of malaria was not statistically significant. The answers to the questions about \"What you will do if you see someone suffering from malaria,\" \"How much time was spent in the malaria control program,\" \"Malaria detection,\" and \"Regular usage of bed-nets\" in the affective and psychomotor domains all had statistical significance. Our research on interventions to raise awareness of malaria in this tribal region of northern West Bengal, eastern India, bordering Bangladesh, was published for the first time to our knowledge. In the majority of the items from the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning domains, we have seen significant changes.",

We searched electronic databases and grey literature sources for studies published between 2012 and 2022. The studies written in English were included, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. Among these 25 studies documented M&E and four studies documented OR practices. The majority of the studies were from India and Bangladesh, with no evidence found from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. M&E of surveillance programs were identified among which PHE due to COVID-19 was most prevalent. M&E was conducted in response to COVID-19, cholera, Nipah, Ebola, <i>Candida auris</i>, and hepatitis A. OR practice was minimal and reported from India and Indonesia. India conducted OR on COVID-19 and malaria, whereas Indonesia focused on COVID-19 and influenza. While most SEAR countries have mechanisms for conducting M&E, there is a noticeable limitation in OR practices. There is a compelling need to develop a standard framework for M&E. Additionally, enhancing private sector engagement is crucial for strengthening preparedness against PHE. Furthermore, there is a necessity to increase awareness about the importance of conducting M&E and OR during PHE.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. However, accurate estimates of malaria prevalence and causality among patients who die at the country level are lacking due to the limited specificity of diagnostic tools used to attribute etiologies. Accurate estimates are crucial for prioritizing interventions and resources aimed at reducing malaria-related mortality. Seven Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network sites collected comprehensive data on stillbirths and children <5 years, using minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). A DeCoDe (Determination of Cause of Death) panel employed standardized protocols for assigning underlying, intermediate, and immediate causes of death, integrating sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory (including extensive microbiology, histopathology, and malaria testing), and verbal autopsy data. Analyses were conducted to ascertain the strength of evidence for cause of death (CoD), describe factors associated with malaria-related deaths, estimate malaria-specific mortality, and assess the proportion of preventable deaths. Between December 3, 2016, and December 31, 2022, 2673 deaths underwent MITS and had a CoD attributed from four CHAMPS sites with at least 1 malaria-attributed death. No malaria-attributable deaths were documented among 891 stillbirths or 924 neonatal deaths, therefore this analysis concentrates on the remaining 858 deaths among children aged 1-59 months. Malaria was in the causal chain for 42.9% (126/294) of deaths from Sierra Leone, 31.4% (96/306) in Kenya, 18.2% (36/198) in Mozambique, 6.7% (4/60) in Mali, and 0.3% (1/292) in South Africa. Compared to non-malaria related deaths, malaria-related deaths skewed towards older infants and children (p < 0.001), with 71.0% among ages 12-59 months. Malaria was the sole infecting pathogen in 184 (70.2%) of malaria-attributed deaths, whereas bacterial and viral co-infections were identified in the causal pathway in 24·0% and 12.2% of cases, respectively. Malnutrition was found at a similar level in the causal pathway of both malaria (26.7%) and non-malaria (30.7%, p = 0.256) deaths. Less than two-thirds (164/262; 62.6%) of malaria deaths had received antimalarials prior to death. Nearly all (98·9%) malaria-related deaths were deemed preventable. Malaria remains a significant cause of childhood mortality in the CHAMPS malaria-endemic sites. The high bacterial co-infection prevalence among malaria deaths underscores the potential benefits of antibiotics for severe malaria patients. Compared to non-malaria deaths, many of malaria-attributed deaths are preventable through accessible malaria control measures.",

We investigated developmental stage-specific RNA editing in selected genes in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> 3D7. We detected extensive amination- and deamination-type RNA editing at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 46 h in tightly synchronized <i>Plasmodium</i>. Most of the editing events were observed in 8 and 16 h ring-stage parasites. Extensive A-to-G deamination-type editing was detected more during the 16 h ring stage (25%) than the 8 h ring stage (20%). Extensive U-to-C amination-type editing was detected more during the 16 h ring stage (31%) than the 8 h ring stage (22%). In 28S, rRNA editing converted the loop structure to the stem structure. The hemoglobin binding activity of PF3D7_0216900 was also altered due to RNA editing. Among the expressed 28S rRNA genes, PF3D7_0532000 and PF3D7_0726000 expression was higher. Increased amounts of the transcripts of these two genes were found, particularly PF3D7_0726000 in the ring stage and PF3D7_0532000 in the trophozoite and schizont stages. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) expression did not correlate with the editing level.

Evidently, there has been a significant expansion in the public funding allocated to the health sector in Bangladesh, intending to enhance health outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of healthcare expenditure on health outcomes, specifically focusing on the reduction in different mortality rates and the transmission of various infectious diseases. A total of 30 years of data (1990-2019) on the health sector of Bangladesh were collected from different national and international sources. The Vector Autoregression with Exogenous Variables (VARX) model was employed to determine the effects of healthcare expenditure on health outcomes. Results revealed that the per capita health expenditure and the number of doctors showed a significant positive impact on life expectancy and maternal and child health. Also, the government's annual budget on the health sector and number of doctors had a significant positive impact on lowering deaths by Diphtheria, Cholera, Tuberculosis, and Malaria diseases.

        "abstract": "Pneumonia remains the leading cause of mortality in under-five children outside the neonatal period. Progress has slowed down in the last decade, necessitating increased efforts to scale up effective pneumonia interventions. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), a modelling software for child mortality in low- and middle-income settings, to prospectively analyse the potential impact of upscaling pneumonia interventions in Bangladesh, Chad, and Ethiopia from 2023 to 2030. We included Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccination, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), oral antibiotics, pulse oximetry, and oxygen as pneumonia interventions in our analysis. Outcomes of interest were the number of pneumonia deaths averted, the proportion of deaths averted by intervention, and changes in the under-five mortality rate. We found that 19 775 lives of children under-five could be saved in Bangladesh, 76 470 in Chad, and 97 343 in Ethiopia by scaling intervention coverages to ≥90% by 2030. Our estimated reductions in pneumonia deaths among children under five range from 44.61% to 57.91% in the respective countries. Increased coverage of oral antibiotics, pulse oximetry, and oxygen show similar effects in all three countries, averting between 18.80% and 23.65% of expected pneumonia deaths. Scaling-up PCV has a prominent effect, especially in Chad, where it could avert 14.04% of expected pneumonia deaths. Under-five mortality could be reduced by 1.42 per 1000 live births in Bangladesh, 22.52 per 1000 live births in Chad, and 5.48 per 1000 live births in Ethiopia. This analysis shows the high impact of upscaling pneumonia interventions.

The overall treatment adherence frequency was 92.7% (95% CI: 83.0-96.3%). A total of eight participants were found to be nonadherent to treatment and all of them were from Bandarban. Level of nonadherence was equally observed in two age groups: 11-17 and 18+ years. However, male participants (<i>n</i> = 6) were found to be more nonadherent than females (<i>n</i> = 2). Among 7.3% with nonadherence to treatment, a single participant with <i>P. falciparum</i> mono-infection refused to take medication and became nonadherent. Remaining participants stated that they were feeling well and going to work, thus leaving treatment course uncompleted. Although overall compliance with malaria medication seems good, a gradual increase in noncompliance to <i>P. vivax</i> malaria treatment suggests that the National Malaria Elimination Program must be enhanced and monitored to fulfil the projected malaria elimination goal before 2030 from Bangladesh.",

In 791 patients from 7 studies in the one-stage meta-analysis, the day 180 cumulative risk of recurrence was 61.1% (95% CI 42.2% to 80.4%; 201 patients; 25 recurrences) after treatment without primaquine, 28.8% (95% CI 8.2% to 74.1%; 398 patients; 4 recurrences) following low total (2 to <5 mg/kg) and 0% (96 patients; 0 recurrences) following high total dose primaquine (≥5 mg/kg). In the subsequent two-stage meta-analysis of nine studies (3529 patients), the pooled proportions of <i>P. vivax</i> recurrences by day 180 were 12.1% (95% CI 7.7% to 17.2%), 2.3% (95% CI 0.3% to 5.4%) and 0.7% (95% CI 0% to 6.1%), respectively. No patients had a >25% drop in haemoglobin to <70 g/L. Primaquine treatment led to a marked decrease in <i>P. vivax</i> recurrences following low (~3.5 mg/kg) and high (~7 mg/kg) total doses, with no reported severe haemolytic events. CRD42022313730.",

        "abstract": "Causes of deaths often go unrecorded in lower income countries, yet this information is critical. Verbal autopsy is a questionnaire interview with a family member or caregiver to elicit the symptoms and circumstances preceding a death and assign a probable cause. The social and cultural aspects of verbal autopsy have gotten less attention than the technical aspects and have not been widely explored in South and Southeast Asia settings. Between October 2021 and March 2023, prior to implementing a verbal autopsy study at rural sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, focus group discussions were conducted with village heads, religious leaders and community members from varied demographic backgrounds. Thematic analysis elucidated customs and traditional views surrounding death to understand local ethnocultural sensitivities. We found that death rituals varied greatly among religions, ethnicities and by socioeconomic status. Mourning periods were reported to last 3-100 days and related to the cause of death, age and how close the deceased person was to the family. Participants advised that interviews should happen after mourning periods to avoid emotional distress, but not long after so as to avoid recall bias. Interviewers should be introduced to respondents by a trusted local person. To provide reassurance and confidentiality, a family's residence is the preferred interview location. Interview questions require careful local language translation, and community sensitisation is important before data collection. Verbal autopsy is acceptable across a wide range of cultural settings in Southeast Asia, provided that local norms are preidentified and followed.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is one of the most prominent illnesses affecting children, ranking as one of the key development concerns for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is not much information available on the use of anti-malarial drugs in LMICs in children under five. The study aimed to investigate disparities in anti-malarial drug consumption for malaria among children under the age of five in LMICs. This study used recent available cross-sectional data from the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) datasets across five LMICs (Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone), which covered a portion of sub-Saharan Africa. The study was carried out between January 2, 2023, and April 15, 2023, and included children under the age of five who had taken an anti-malarial drug for malaria 2 weeks before the survey date. The outcome variable was anti-malarial drug consumption, which was classified into two groups: those who had taken anti-malarial drugs and those who had not. In the study of LMICs, 32,397 children under five were observed, and among them, 44.1% had received anti-malarial drugs. Of the five LMICs, Kenya had the lowest (9.2%) and Mali had the highest (70.5%) percentages of anti-malarial drug consumption. Children under five with malaria are more likely to receive anti-malarial drugs if they are over 1 year old, live in rural areas, have mothers with higher education levels, and come from wealthier families. The study emphasizes the importance of developing universal coverage strategies for anti-malarial drug consumption at both the national and local levels. The study also recommends that improving availability and access to anti-malarial drugs may be necessary, as the consumption of these drugs for treating malaria in children under the age of five is shockingly low in some LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Community engagement (CE) interventions often explore and promote behaviour change around a specific challenge. Suggestions for behaviour change should be co-produced in partnership with the community. To facilitate this, it is essential that the intervention includes key content that unpacks the challenge of interest via multiple sources of knowledge. However, where community lived experience and academic evidence appear misaligned, tensions can appear within the co-production dynamic of CE. This is specifically so within the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) where ideal behaviours are often superseded by what is practical or possible in a particular community context. Here we describe a framework for the equitable development of contextually appropriate, clearly evidenced behavioural objectives for CE interventions. This framework explores different sources of knowledge on AMR, including the potentially competing views of different stakeholders. The framework allows key content on AMR to be selected based upon academic evidence, contextual appropriateness and fit to the chosen CE approach. A case study of the framework in action exemplifies how the framework is applicable to a range of contexts, CE approaches and One Health topics beyond just AMR. Within CE interventions, academic evidence is crucial to develop well-informed key content. However, this formative work should also involve community members, ensuring that their contextual knowledge is valued. The type of CE approach also needs careful consideration because methodological constraints may limit the breadth and depth of information that can be delivered within an intervention, and thus the scope of key content.",

        "abstract": "In areas co-endemic for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum there is an increased risk of P vivax parasitaemia following P falciparum malaria. Radical cure is currently only recommended for patients presenting with P vivax malaria. Expanding the indication for radical cure to patients presenting with P falciparum malaria could reduce their risk of subsequent P vivax parasitaemia. We did a multicentre, open-label, superiority randomised controlled trial in five health clinics in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, patients were excluded if they were younger than 1 year, whereas in Ethiopia patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years. Patients with uncomplicated P falciparum monoinfection who had fever or a history of fever in the 48 h preceding clinic visit were eligible for enrolment and were required to have a glucose-6-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity of 70% or greater. Patients received blood schizontocidal treatment (artemether-lumefantrine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Indonesia) and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either high-dose short-course oral primaquine (intervention arm; total dose 7 mg/kg over 7 days) or standard care (standard care arm; single dose oral primaquine of 0·25 mg/kg). Random assignment was done by an independent statistician in blocks of eight by use of sealed envelopes. All randomly assigned and eligible patients were included in the primary and safety analyses. The per-protocol analysis excluded those who did not complete treatment or had substantial protocol violations. The primary endpoint was the incidence risk of P vivax parasitaemia on day 63. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03916003. Between Aug 18, 2019, and March 14, 2022, a total of 500 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, and 495 eligible patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (246 intervention and 249 control). The incidence risk of P vivax parasitaemia at day 63 was 11·0% (95% CI 7·5-15·9) in the standard care arm compared with 2·5% (1·0-5·9) in the intervention arm (hazard ratio 0·20, 95% CI 0·08-0·51; p=0·0009). The effect size differed with blood schizontocidal treatment and site. Routine symptom reporting on day 2 and day 7 were similar between groups. In the first 42 days, there were a total of four primaquine-related adverse events reported in the standard care arm and 26 in the intervention arm; 132 (92%) of all 143 adverse events were mild. There were two serious adverse events in the intervention arm, which were considered unrelated to the study drug. None of the patients developed severe anaemia (defined as haemoglobin <5 g/dL). In patients with a G6PD activity of 70% or greater, high-dose short-course primaquine was safe and relatively well tolerated and reduced the risk of subsequent P vivax parasitaemia within 63 days by five fold. Universal radical cure therefore potentially offers substantial clinical, public health, and operational benefits, but these benefits will vary with endemic setting.

        "title": "The 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: the imperative for a health-centred response in a world facing irreversible harms.",
        "abstract": "The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown is an international research collaboration that independently monitors the evolving impacts of climate change on health, and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. In its eighth iteration, this 2023 report draws on the expertise of 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies worldwide to provide its most comprehensive assessment yet. In 2022, the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown warned that people’s health is at the mercy of fossil fuels and stressed the transformative opportunity of jointly tackling the concurrent climate change, energy, cost-of-living, and health crises for human health and wellbeing. This year’s report finds few signs of such progress. At the current 10-year mean heating of 1·14°C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is increasingly impacting the health and survival of people worldwide, and projections show these risks could worsen steeply with further inaction. However, with health matters gaining prominence in climate change negotiations, this report highlights new opportunities to deliver health-promoting climate change action and a safe and thriving future for all. In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5). Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3). Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3). The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts—both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change. The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world’s populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted each second, each moment of delay worsens the risks to people’s health and survival. In this year’s report, new projections reveal the dangers of further delays in action, with every tracked health dimension worsening as the climate changes. If global mean temperature continues to rise to just under 2°C, annual heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 370% by midcentury, assuming no substantial progress on adaptation (indicator 1.1.5). Under such a scenario, heat-related labour loss is projected to increase by 50% (indicator 1.1.4), and heatwaves alone could lead to 524·9 million additional people experiencing moderate-to-severe food insecurity by 2041–60, aggravating the global risk of malnutrition. Life-threatening infectious diseases are also projected to spread further, with the length of coastline suitable for <i>Vibrio</i> pathogens expanding by 17–25%, and the transmission potential for dengue increasing by 36–37% by midcentury. As risks rise, so will the costs and challenges of adaptation. These estimates provide some indication of what the future could hold. However, poor accounting for non-linear responses, tipping points, and cascading and synergistic interactions could render these projections conservative, disproportionately increasing the threat to the health of populations worldwide. The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people’s lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating. The 2022 <i>Lancet</i> Countdown report highlighted the opportunity to accelerate the transition away from health-harming fossil fuels in response to the global energy crisis. However, data this year show a world that is often moving in the wrong direction. Energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased by 0·9% to a record 36·8 Gt in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1), and still only 9·5% of global electricity comes from modern renewables (mainly solar and wind energy), despite their costs falling below that of fossil fuels. Concerningly, driven partly by record profits, oil and gas companies are further reducing their compliance with the Paris Agreement: the strategies of the world’s 20 largest oil and gas companies as of early 2023 will result in emissions surpassing levels consistent with the Paris Agreement goals by 173% in 2040—an increase of 61% from 2022 (indicator 4.2.6). Rather than pursuing accelerated development of renewable energy, fossil fuel companies allocated only 4% of their capital investment to renewables in 2022. Meanwhile, global fossil fuel investment increased by 10% in 2022, reaching over $1 trillion (indicator 4.2.1). The expansion of oil and gas extractive activities has been supported through both private and public financial flows. Across 2017–21, the 40 banks that lend most to the fossil fuel sector collectively invested $489 billion annually in fossil fuels (annual average), with 52% increasing their lending from 2010–16. Simultaneously, in 2020, 78% of the countries assessed, responsible for 93% of all global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, still provided net direct fossil fuels subsidies totalling $305 billion, further hindering fossil fuel phase-out (indicator 4.2.4). Without a rapid response to course correct, the persistent use and expansion of fossil fuels will ensure an increasingly inequitable future that threatens the lives of billions of people alive today. Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM<sub>2·5</sub>; indicator 3.2.1), and a large proportion of the 78 deaths per 100 000 people associated with exposure to indoor air pollution (indicator 3.2.2). Additionally, the just development of renewable energy markets can generate net employment opportunities with safer, more locally available jobs. Ensuring countries, particularly those facing high levels of energy poverty, are supported in the safe development, deployment, and adoption of renewable energy is key to maximising health gains and preventing unjust extractive industrial practices that can harm the health and livelihoods of local populations and widen health inequities. With fossil fuels accounting for 95% of road transport energy (indicator 3.1.3), interventions to enable and promote safe active travel and zero-emission public transport can further deliver emissions reduction, promote health through physical activity, and avert many of the 460 000 deaths caused annually by transport-derived PM<sub>2·5</sub> pollution (indicator 3.2.1), and some of the 3·2 million annual deaths related to physical inactivity. People-centred, climate-resilient urban redesign to improve building energy efficiency, increase green and blue spaces, and promote sustainable cooling, can additionally prevent heat-related health harms, avoid air-conditioning-derived emissions (indicator 2.2.2), and provide direct physical and mental health benefits. Additionally, food systems are responsible for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 57% of agricultural emissions in 2020 being derived from the production of red meat and milk (indicator 3.3.1). Promoting and enabling equitable access to affordable, healthy, low-carbon diets that meet local nutritional and cultural requirements can contribute to mitigation, while preventing many of the 12·2 million deaths attributable to suboptimal diets (indicator 3.3.2). The health community could play a central role in securing these benefits, by delivering public health interventions to reduce air pollution, enabling and supporting active travel and healthier diets, and promoting improvements in the environmental conditions and commercial activities that define health outcomes. Importantly, the health sector can lead by example and transition to sustainable, resource-efficient, net-zero emission health systems, thereby preventing its 4·6% contribution to global GHG emissions, with cascading impacts ultimately affecting the broader economy (indicator 3.4). Some encouraging signs of progress offer a glimpse of the enormous human benefits that health-centred action could render. Deaths attributable to fossil-fuel-derived air pollution have decreased by 15·7% since 2005, with 80% of this reduction being the result of reduced coal-derived pollution. Meanwhile the renewable energy sector expanded to a historical high of 12·7 million employees in 2021 (indicator 4.2.2); and renewable energy accounted for 90% of the growth in electricity capacity in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1). Supporting this, global clean energy investment increased by 15% in 2022, to $1·6 trillion, exceeding fossil fuel investment by 61% (indicator 4.2.1); and lending to the green energy sector rose to $498 billion in 2021, approaching fossil fuel lending (indicator 4.2.7). Scientific understanding of the links between health and climate change is rapidly growing, and although coverage lags in some of the most affected regions, over 3000 scientific articles covered this topic in 2022 (indicators 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Meanwhile, the health dimensions of climate change are increasingly acknowledged in the public discourse, with 24% of all climate change newspaper articles in 2022 referring to health, just short of the 26% in 2020 (indicator 5.1). Importantly, international organisations are increasingly engaging with the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation (indicator 5.4.2), and governments increasingly acknowledge this link, with 95% of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement now referring to health—up from 73% in 2020 (indicator 5.4.1). These trends signal what could be the start of a life-saving transition. With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine—rather than protect—the future of people alive today and generations to come. Safeguarding people’s health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all.",

        "abstract": "Copper (Cu), an essential trace mineral regulating multiple actions of inflammation and oxidative stress, has been implicated in risk for preterm birth (PTB). This study aimed to determine the association of maternal Cu concentration during pregnancy with PTB risk and gestational duration in a large multicohort study including diverse populations. Maternal plasma or serum samples of 10,449 singleton live births were obtained from 18 geographically diverse study cohorts. Maternal Cu concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The associations of maternal Cu with PTB and gestational duration were analyzed using logistic and linear regressions for each cohort. The estimates were then combined using meta-analysis. Associations between maternal Cu and acute-phase reactants (APRs) and infection status were analyzed in 1239 samples from the Malawi cohort. The maternal prenatal Cu concentration in our study samples followed normal distribution with mean of 1.92 μg/mL and standard deviation of 0.43 μg/mL, and Cu concentrations increased with gestational age up to 20 wk. The random-effect meta-analysis across 18 cohorts revealed that 1 μg/mL increase in maternal Cu concentration was associated with higher risk of PTB with odds ratio of 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 1.57) and shorter gestational duration of 1.64 d (95% CI: 0.56, 2.73). In the Malawi cohort, higher maternal Cu concentration, concentrations of multiple APRs, and infections (malaria and HIV) were correlated and associated with greater risk of PTB and shorter gestational duration. Our study supports robust negative association between maternal Cu and gestational duration and positive association with risk for PTB. Cu concentration was strongly correlated with APRs and infection status suggesting its potential role in inflammation, a pathway implicated in the mechanisms of PTB. Therefore, maternal Cu could be used as potential marker of integrated inflammatory pathways during pregnancy and risk for PTB.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a social and biological problem. Although resistance to antimicrobials is a natural phenomenon, many human behaviors are increasing the pressure on microbes to develop resistance which is resulting in many commonly used treatments becoming ineffective. These behaviors include unregulated use of antimicrobial medicines, pesticides and agricultural chemicals, the disposal of heavy metals and other pollutants into the environment, and human-induced climatic change. Addressing AMR thus calls for changes in the behaviors which drive resistance. Community engagement for antimicrobial resistance (CE4AMR) is an international and interdisciplinary network focused on tackling behavioural drivers of AMR at community level. Since 2019 this network has worked within Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs), predominantly within Southeast Asia, to tackle behavioral drivers of AMR can be mitigated through bottom-up solutions championed by local people. This commentary presents seven Key Concepts identified from across the CE4AMR portfolio as integral to tackling AMR. We suggest it be used to guide future interventions aimed at addressing AMR via social, participatory, and behavior-change approaches.",

        "abstract": "Malaria infection still represents a notable public health risk in Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium species among clinically suspected cases who presented at Badr General Hospital and healthcare facilities in selected regions of Badr Governorate, Madinah Province, Saudi Arabia between January 2021 and January 2022. A total of 493 suspected patients were recruited from Badr Governorate, investigated for malaria infection using CBFME and rapid diagnostic test- CareStart Malaria Pf/PAN (HRP2/pLDH) Ag Combo rapid diagnostic tests. The results showed that malaria infection was 34 (6.89%) cases among 493 suspected patients using microscopic examination as reference test. Moreover, subjects aged 31 to 40 years and those aged 51 to 60 years had the highest (50%) and lowest (8.82%) percentages of malaria cases. Plasmodium vivax (19/34, 55.88%) was higher than P falciparum (15/34, 44.1%) as the causative agents of malaria cases. The majority of malaria cases (29/34, 80.9%) among non-Saudi mainly from Sudan (15/34, 44.1%), Pakistan (5/34, 14.7%), Bangladesh (5/34, 14.7%) and India (4/34, 11.76%) whereas malaria cases among Saudis (5/34, 14.7%). In addition, the majority of malaria cases (32/34, 94.11%) among male subjects while (2/34, 5.88%) among females. The current study revealed that malaria transmission is still active in Badr Governorate, Madinah Province, Saudi Arabia and represents a public health concern. Further screening implements and continuous epidemiological monitor of the status of malaria infection in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are thus warranted to improve its controlling activities and eradicate malaria endemicity in the country.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children aged 6-59 months worldwide are anaemic. Iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) and iron supplements (syrup/drops) are used to combat anaemia in children in different parts of the world. However, evidence for functional benefits of iron supplementation in children is scarce, and potential risks remain poorly defined, particularly concerning diarrhoea and malaria. This trial aims to determine if: (1) the efficacy of iron supplements or MNPs (containing iron) given with malaria chemoprevention is superior to malaria chemoprevention alone, or (2) if the efficacy of malaria chemoprevention alone is superior to placebo on child cognitive development. IRMA is a four-arm, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, triple-dummy, randomised trial in Southern Malawi. The study recruits 2168 infants aged 6 months, with an intervention period of 6 months and a post-intervention period of a further 6 months. Children are randomised into four arms: (1) No intervention (placebo); (2) malaria chemoprevention only; (3) MNPs and malaria chemoprevention; and (4) iron syrup and malaria chemoprevention. The primary outcome, cognitive development (Cognitive Composite Score (CogCS)), is measured at the end of the 6 months intervention. Secondary outcomes include CogCS at a further 6 months post-intervention, motor, language and behavioural development, physical growth and prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency. Safety outcomes include incidence of malaria and other infections, and prevalence of malaria parasitaemia during and post-intervention period. The trial is approved by the National Health Sciences Research Committee (#19/01/2213) (Malawi) and the Human Research Ethics Committee (WEHI: 19/012) (Australia). Written informed consent in the local language is obtained from each participant before conducting any study-related procedure.

        "abstract": "Screening for G6PD deficiency can inform disease management including malaria. Treatment with the antimalarial drugs primaquine and tafenoquine can be guided by point-of-care testing for G6PD deficiency. Data from similar clinical studies evaluating the performance of the STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, South Korea) conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were pooled. Test performance was assessed in a retrospective analysis on capillary and venous specimens. All study sites used spectrophotometry for reference G6PD testing, and either the HemoCue or complete blood count for reference hemoglobin measurement. The sensitivity of the STANDARD G6PD Test using the manufacturer thresholds for G6PD deficient and intermediate cases in capillary specimens from 4212 study participants was 100% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 97.5%-100%) for G6PD deficient cases with <30% activity and 77% (95% CI 66.8%-85.4%) for females with intermediate activity between 30%-70%. Specificity was 98.1% (95% CI 97.6%-98.5%) and 92.8% (95% CI 91.6%-93.9%) for G6PD deficient individuals and intermediate females, respectively. Out of 20 G6PD intermediate females with false normal results, 12 had activity levels >60% on the reference assay. The negative predictive value for females with G6PD activity >60% was 99.6% (95% CI 99.1%-99.8%) on capillary specimens. Sensitivity among 396 P. vivax malaria cases was 100% (69.2%-100.0%) for both deficient and intermediate cases. Across the full dataset, 37% of those classified as G6PD deficient or intermediate resulted from true normal cases. Despite this, over 95% of cases would receive correct treatment with primaquine, over 87% of cases would receive correct treatment with tafenoquine, and no true G6PD deficient cases would be treated inappropriately based on the result of the STANDARD G6PD Test. The STANDARD G6PD Test enables safe access to drugs which are contraindicated for individuals with G6PD deficiency. Operational considerations will inform test uptake in specific settings.",

An epidemiological investigation was conducted on malaria disease distribution and risk factors in the world's largest refugee settlement, the Rohingya refugee camps on the south-eastern border area of Bangladesh, within 2017-2020. From February 2017 to March 2020, 30,460 febrile patients were tested for malaria using light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. Most were self-presenting symptomatic patients and a minority were from door-to-door malaria screening. Diagnostic tests were done by trained medical technologists upon the advice of the concerned physicians in the camps. Test positivity rate (%) and annual parasite incidence were calculated and compared using chi-squared (χ <sup>2</sup>) test or odds ratios. The overall average annual test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.05%. TPR was highest in people who had travelled to the forest in the previous 2 months, at 13.60%. Cases were clustered among male adults aged 15-60 years. There were no cases among children under five years or pregnant women and no deaths from malaria. This study found very few malaria cases among Rohingya refugees with the majority of cases being imported from hilly forested areas, which were thus assumed to act as the reservoir for transmission.",

        "title": "Antimalarial drug discovery against malaria parasites through haplopine modification: An advanced computational approach.",
        "abstract": "The widespread emergence of antimalarial drug resistance has created a major threat to public health. Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium spp., which includes Apicoplast DNA polymerase and Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2. These components play a critical role in their life cycle and metabolic pathway, and are involved in the breakdown of erythrocyte hemoglobin in the host, making them promising targets for anti-malarial drug design. Our current study has been designed to explore the potential inhibitors from haplopine derivatives against these two targets using an in silico approach. A total of nine haplopine derivatives were used to perform molecular docking, and the results revealed that Ligands 03 and 05 showed strong binding affinity compared to the control compound atovaquone. Furthermore, these ligand-protein complexes underwent molecular dynamics simulations, and the results demonstrated that the complexes maintained strong stability in terms of RMSD (root mean square deviation), RMSF (root mean square fluctuation), and Rg (radius of gyration) over a 100 ns simulation period. Additionally, PCA (principal component analysis) analysis and the dynamic cross-correlation matrix showed positive outcomes for the protein-ligand complexes. Moreover, the compounds exhibited no violations of the Lipinski rule, and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) predictions yielded positive results without indicating any toxicity. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) and molecular electrostatic potential calculations were conducted, revealing that the mentioned derivatives exhibited better stability and outstanding performance. Overall, this computational approach suggests that these haplopine derivatives could serve as a potential source for developing new, effective antimalarial drugs to combat malaria. However, further in vitro or in vivo studies might be conducted to determine their actual effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. No specific funding was awarded for this meta-analysis.

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, sexually transmitted infection (STI) services are available for all populations in public health facilities. However, STI services for key populations (KPs) at risk of HIV need specifically designed approaches that are predominantly administered to KPs through donor-supported service centers operated by non-government organizations (NGOs) and community-based organisations (CBOs). However, the steady decline in donor funding warrants a sustainable transition of STI services for the KPs into public health facilities. This article aimed to explore the service availability and readiness of public health facilities to provide STI services for the KPs. This qualitative study explored the service availability and readiness of public health facilities in three districts of Bangladesh by adapting the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool. We conducted 34 in-depth interviews,11 focus group discussions with KPs, and 29 key-informant interviews with healthcare providers, researchers, programme implementers and policy planners, in addition to series of direct observations at the public healthcare facilities. Data were analysed through thematic analysis, and categorised in relation to the WHO building blocks. This study revealed that the public health system was generally not ready to serve the KPs' needs in terms of providing them with quality STI services. The 'service delivery' component, which is the most crucial facet of the public health system, was not ready to provide STI services to KPs. Findings also indicated that health workforce availability was limited in the primary and secondary healthcare layers but adequate in the tertiary layer, but needed to be oriented on providing culturally sensitised treatment. Counseling, an essential component of STI services, was neither ready nor available. However, health information systems and a few other components were partially ready, although this warrants systematic approaches to address these challenges. The findings show that public health facilities are yet to be fully ready to render STI services to KPs, especially in terms of service delivery and human and health resources. Therefore, it is not only integral to mobilize communities towards the uptake of public health services, but health systems need to be prepared to cater to their needs.",

Our objective was to describe adherence to World Health Organization recommendations for the management of leading causes of death among children. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study examining clinical data for children aged 1-59 months who were hospitalized and died in a Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment, December 2016-June 2021.

We reviewed medical records of those who died from lower respiratory tract infections, sepsis, malnutrition, malaria, and diarrheal diseases to determine the proportion who received recommended treatments and compared adherence by hospitalization duration. CHAMPS enrolled 460 hospitalized children who died from the leading causes (median age 12 months, 53.0% male). Median hospital admission was 31 h. There were 51.0% (n = 127/249) of children who died from lower respiratory tract infections received supplemental oxygen.

        "abstract": "Malaria exists as an endemic in many countries including Bangladesh and the malaria vaccine is not yet available here. The study aimed to assess the level of knowledge and acceptance of the malaria vaccination among the parents of children under the age of five in Bangladesh's malaria-endemic areas and the sociodemographic, behavioural, and household factors associated with the acceptance and knowledge of the malaria vaccine. From January to March 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted in all five malaria-endemic districts of Bangladesh, involving 405 parents of children under the age of 5 who met the inclusion criteria. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the factor affecting parents' acceptance and knowledge of malaria vaccination in children under five and other variables. Majority (54%) of the respondents were mothers. Almost half (49%) of the respondents were aged between 26 and 35 years old and around 90% were from rural areas. A small portion (20%) of the participants were housewives and 46% of them completed primary education. Overall, 70% of the study participants reported that they would accept malaria vaccination independently. About one-fourth (25%) heard about the malaria vaccine and 48% of them mentioned health professionals as the source of information. Knowledge of malaria vaccination was found associated with residence, income, and family size. Acceptance and knowledge were both associated with residence, education, occupation, income, and family size. In a multivariable analysis, housing structure, house wall, house window, knowledge of malaria, testing for malaria, and being diagnosed with malaria were all associated with knowledge of and acceptance of getting vaccinated against malaria. The present study highlights the necessity of creating awareness of malaria vaccines in epidemic areas of Bangladesh. This study offers crucial data to develop a policy for a novel malaria vaccine, supporting its adoption in Bangladesh. This study was based on interviews. The interviewees were recruited as public representatives from the malaria-endemic area to assist us in building an understanding of knowledge and acceptance of the malaria vaccine among parents of under-five children in Bangladesh.",

        "title": "Causes of Death Among Infants and Children in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network.",
        "abstract": "The number of deaths of children younger than 5 years has been steadily decreasing worldwide, from more than 17 million annual deaths in the 1970s to an estimated 5.3 million in 2019 (with 2.8 million deaths occurring in those aged 1-59 months [53% of all deaths in children aged <5 years]). More detailed characterization of childhood deaths could inform interventions to improve child survival. To describe causes of postneonatal child deaths across 7 mortality surveillance sentinel sites in Africa and Asia. The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network conducts childhood mortality surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia using innovative postmortem minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). In this cross-sectional study, MITS was conducted in deceased children aged 1 to 59 months at 7 sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia from December 3, 2016, to December 3, 2020. Data analysis was conducted between October and November 2021. The expert panel attributed underlying, intermediate, and immediate conditions in the chain of events leading to death, based on histopathologic analysis, microbiological diagnostics, clinical data, and verbal autopsies. In this study, MITS was performed in 632 deceased children (mean [SD] age at death, 1.3 [0.3] years; 342 [54.1%] male). The 6 most common underlying causes of death were malnutrition (104 [16.5%]), HIV (75 [11.9%]), malaria (71 [11.2%]), congenital birth defects (64 [10.1%]), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs; 53 [8.4%]), and diarrheal diseases (46 [7.2%]). When considering immediate causes only, sepsis (191 [36.7%]) and LRTI (129 [24.8%]) were the 2 dominant causes. An infection was present in the causal chain in 549 of 632 deaths (86.9%); pathogens most frequently contributing to infectious deaths included Klebsiella pneumoniae (155 of 549 infectious deaths [28.2%]; 127 [81.9%] considered nosocomial), Plasmodium falciparum (122 of 549 [22.2%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (109 of 549 [19.9%]). Other organisms, such as cytomegalovirus (57 [10.4%]) and Acinetobacter baumannii (39 [7.1%]; 35 of 39 [89.7%] considered nosocomial), also played important roles. For the top underlying causes of death, the median number of conditions in the chain of events leading to death was 3 for malnutrition, 3 for HIV, 1 for malaria, 3 for congenital birth defects, and 1 for LRTI. Expert panels considered 494 of 632 deaths (78.2%) preventable and 26 of 632 deaths (4.1%) preventable under certain conditions. In this cross-sectional study investigating causes of child mortality in the CHAMPS Network, results indicate that, in these high-mortality settings, infectious diseases continue to cause most deaths in infants and children, often in conjunction with malnutrition. These results also highlight opportunities for action to prevent deaths and reveal common interaction of various causes in the path toward death.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum parasites are the primary cause of malaria across Africa. The problem of drug resistance to malaria is ever growing and novel therapeutic strategies need to be developed, particularly those targeting the parasite and also the host or host-pathogen interaction. Previous studies have shown that the development of cerebral malaria (CM) is related to dysregulation of the immune system in a murine malaria model of experimental cerebral malaria. It involves a complex interaction of events and interferon-gamma seems to be the unifying factor. Therefore, the antiplasmodial activity targeting the parasite and immunomodulatory strategies that reduce overall host inflammation, with IFN-γ in focus, could delay CM onset and prove beneficial in malaria infection therapy. Phyllanthus niruri is used to treat fever and other symptoms of malaria in Nigeria. Its modes of action as an anti-malarial remedy have not been exhaustively investigated. This study therefore examined the aqueous extract of P. niruri (PE) for its antiplasmodial activity in vitro using the Plasmodium falciparum HB3 strain. Furthermore, in vivo murine malaria model using the Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain was used to investigate its anti-malarial effects. We showed that PE has multiple anti-malarial effects, including anti-parasitic and host immunomodulatory activities. Co-culture of P. falciparum with PE and some of its phytoconstituents drastically reduced parasite number. PE also decreased parasitemia, and increased the survival of infected mice. We also observed that the integrity of the blood-brain barrier was maintained in the PE-treated mice. The results confirmed that PE showed moderate antiplasmodial activity. In vivo murine malaria model using P. berghei ANKA for experimental cerebral malaria revealed that PE suppressed parasite growth, and modulate the production of interferon-gamma. The findings demonstrate that PE affects malaria progression, targeting parasites and host cells.",

It is needed to measure how the malaria parasite infection in <i>A</i>. <i>stephensi</i> is influenced by environmental factors to predict its expansion in a new environment. Effects of temperature and food conditions during larval periods on larval mortality, larval period, female wing size, egg production, egg size, adult longevity, and malaria infection rate were studied using a laboratory strain. Larval survival and female wing size were generally reduced when reared at higher temperatures and with a low food supply during the larval period. Egg production was not significantly affected by temperature during the larval period. Egg size was generally smaller in females reared at higher temperatures during the larval period. The infection rate of mosquitoes that fed on blood from malaria-infected mice was not affected by rearing temperature or food conditions during the larval period. Higher temperatures may reduce infection. <i>A</i>. <i>stephensi</i>; however, larger individuals can still be infective.

        "abstract": "Joint efforts by government and non-government organizations have helped to reduce malaria in Bangladesh and set the country on a clear path to eventual malaria elimination. However, achieving that goal would be challenging without a comprehensive understanding of vector bionomics. Targeted capturing of Anopheles mosquitoes over a rainy season, utilizing specific sampling methods, including human landing catches (HLCs), CDC-light traps (CDC-LTs), and pyrethrum spray catches (PSCs) were aimed to characterize entomological drivers of transmission in four sites of Bandarban, Bangladesh. Molecular characterization of a subset of 4637 mosquitoes has demonstrated the presence of at least 17 species whose capture rates were representative of the rainy season. Species compositions and bionomic traits did not vary between sites with Anopheles maculatus having the highest landing rate by HLCs and Anopheles vagus having the highest capture rate with CDC-LTs. Interestingly, Anopheles species compositions and capture rates varied significantly (p < 0.05) for An. vagus, between HLCs and its often-used proxy-CDC-LTs- suggesting impacts on downstream analysis. CDC-LTs capture rates demonstrated differing compositions with indoor and outdoor biting rates. For example, Anopheles nigerrimus and Anopheles nivipes were more endophagic by HLCs and more exophagic by CDC-LTs. The use of a cow-baited CDC-LT also demonstrated significantly different results when compared to a human-baited CDC-LT considering the high degree of anthropophily in these species. The exception to both zoophily and indoor resting was An. vagus, which demonstrated both anthropophily and high resting rates indoors-pointing to this species being a possible primary vector at this site. A diverse Anopheles fauna in Bandarban has been confirmed through molecular methods, highlighting the potential impact of sampling techniques. Given the complexity of the local ecosystem, a better understanding of mosquito behaviour and ecology is required to achieve the goal of malaria elimination in Bangladesh.",

This study explored the possibility of natural extract (alcoholic) from peppermint leaves, stems, and garlic cloves to use as a mosquito-repellent finish material on knit fabric. Accordingly, different concentration (5%, 15%, 25%, and 35%) of PGE (Peppermint Garlic Extract) solution was prepared and applied to the developed fabric using an exhaust dyeing process to assess the mosquito (Aedes Aegypti L.) repellency performance. Following WHO (World Health Organization) standard (cone bioassay) and a self-modified cage technique from literature survey, mosquito protection and repellency tests have been performed for characterization. The findings revealed that the PGE-treated fabric samples C (25% PGE) and D (35% PGE) had the highest mosquito mortality (50.00% and 76.67%, respectively) and repellency (78.6% and 85.6%, respectively) rates. Moreover, this study evaluated the prepared PGE formulations' shelf-life performance and colorfastness properties of PGE-treated fabrics, including the impact of washing cycles on the treated fabrics.

We synthesised qualitative studies from our setting in the Indian subcontinent to understand the dimensions and dynamics involved to help inform service provision. Qualitative synthesis comprising inductive coding, thematic analysis and forming a conceptual framework. Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos were databases searched on 26 March 2020 for studies published since 1 January 2000. We included reports in English from the Indian subcontinent that used qualitative or mixed-methodology designs and reported findings around adherence to TB treatment. Full texts meeting eligibility were sampled based on 'thickness' (the richness of the qualitative data reported). Two reviewers used standardised methods to screen abstracts and code. Included studies were assessed for reliability and quality using a standard tool. Qualitative synthesis was performed by inductive coding, thematic analysis and developing conceptual framework. Of 1729 abstracts screened from initial search, 59 were shortlisted for full-text review. Twenty-four studies that qualified as 'thick' were included in the synthesis. Studies were set in India (12), Pakistan (6), Nepal (3), Bangladesh (1) or in two or more of these countries (2). Of the 24 studies, all but one included people who were taking TB treatment (1 study included only healthcare providers), and 17 included healthcare workers, community members or both.We identified three themes: (1) personal influences on the people with TB include interconnections between their social role in the family unit, their own priorities in day-to-day living and their experience to date with the disease; (2) adherence is profoundly influenced by how individual healthcare providers interact with patients on treatment and address their needs; (3) adherence is influenced across communities by structural, social, economic and cultural factors related to treatment. Staff in TB programmes require an understanding of the various competing influences on individuals undergoing treatment. Programmes need to have more flexible and people-centred approaches to service provision in order to achieve adherence, and thus improve treatment outcomes. CRD42020171409.",

        "title": "Optimal Interruption of P. vivax Malaria Transmission Using Mass Drug Administration.",
        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread malaria-causing parasite resulting in significant associated global morbidity and mortality. One of the factors driving this widespread phenomenon is the ability of the parasites to remain dormant in the liver. Known as 'hypnozoites', they reside in the liver following an initial exposure, before activating later to cause further infections, referred to as 'relapses'. As around 79-96% of infections are attributed to relapses from activating hypnozoites, we expect it will be highly impactful to apply treatment to target the hypnozoite reservoir (i.e. the collection of dormant parasites) to eliminate P. vivax. Treatment with radical cure, for example tafenoquine or primaquine, to target the hypnozoite reservoir is a potential tool to control and/or eliminate P. vivax. We have developed a deterministic multiscale mathematical model as a system of integro-differential equations that captures the complex dynamics of P. vivax hypnozoites and the effect of hypnozoite relapse on disease transmission. Here, we use our multiscale model to study the anticipated effect of radical cure treatment administered via a mass drug administration (MDA) program. We implement multiple rounds of MDA with a fixed interval between rounds, starting from different steady-state disease prevalences. We then construct an optimisation model with three different objective functions motivated on a public health basis to obtain the optimal MDA interval. We also incorporate mosquito seasonality in our model to study its effect on the optimal treatment regime. We find that the effect of MDA interventions is temporary and depends on the pre-intervention disease prevalence (and choice of model parameters) as well as the number of MDA rounds under consideration. The optimal interval between MDA rounds also depends on the objective (combinations of expected intervention outcomes). We find radical cure alone may not be enough to lead to P. vivax elimination under our mathematical model (and choice of model parameters) since the prevalence of infection eventually returns to pre-MDA levels.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted to people by the bites of infected mosquitoes. As elsewhere, this disease is also a major public health problem in Bangladesh. After independence, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) use was banned in 1985, and the number of malaria cases began to increase. There were no control programs and inadequate funds, especially in the malaria-endemic areas; thus, malaria cases started to be epidemic in the 1990s. The global fund has been supporting the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in Bangladesh since the approval of the round 6 malaria proposal in 2006. This study aims to review the NMCP and changes in the burden of malaria in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2010. This is a descriptive retrospective study based on the secondary malaria surveillance data (cases and deaths) in 13 malaria-endemic districts, especially five selected districts, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Rangamati, Sylhet, and Mymensingh. A descriptive analysis was carried out to establish the incidence and mortality rate. From 2007 to 2010, a total of 264,293 confirmed malaria cases were notified from 13 malaria-endemic districts. More than 50% of the affected population was under the age group of ≥15 years (55.7%). Males had a higher risk of contracting of malaria than females, accounting for 53.5% of confirmed cases compared to 46.5% of females. Among the affected population, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> caused 85.6% of the total incidence. Rangamati has the highest incidence rate among the five districts. Although the incidence was high, death was declining: in 2007, it was 228, and in 2010, it was 37. The finding shows that while the incidence is still high, mortality is decreasing, therefore, it can be said that the NMCP is functioning. However, to fully achieve the goal of eliminating malaria, the NMCP requires efforts to develop new strategies and maintain a high-quality surveillance and reporting system.",

        "abstract": "With no effective drugs or widely available vaccines, dengue control in Bangladesh is dependent on targeting the primary vector Aedes aegypti with insecticides and larval source management. Despite these interventions, the dengue burden is increasing in Bangladesh, and the country experienced its worst outbreak in 2019 with 101 354 hospitalized cases. This may be partially facilitated by the presence of intense insecticide resistance in vector populations. Here, we describe the intensity and mechanisms of resistance to insecticides commonly deployed against Ae. aegypti in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Dhaka Ae. aegypti colonies exhibited high-intensity resistance to pyrethroids. Using CDC bottle assays, we recorded 2-24% mortality (recorded at 24 h) to permethrin and 48-94% mortality to deltamethrin, at 10× the diagnostic dose. Bioassays conducted using insecticide-synergist combinations suggested that metabolic mechanisms were contributing to pyrethroid resistance, specifically multi-function oxidases, esterases, and glutathione S-transferases. In addition, kdr alleles were detected, with a high frequency (78-98%) of homozygotes for the V1016G mutation. A large proportion (≤ 74%) of free-flying and resting mosquitoes from Dhaka colonies survived exposure to standard applications of pyrethroid aerosols in an experimental free-flight room. Although that exposure affected the immediate host-seeking behavior of Ae. aegypti, the effect was transient in surviving mosquitoes. The intense resistance characterized in this study is likely compromising the operational effectiveness of pyrethroids against Ae. aegypti in Dhaka. Switching to alternative chemical classes may offer a medium-term solution, but ultimately a more sustainable and effective approach to controlling dengue vectors is required. © 2023 The Authors.

        "abstract": "India has made tremendous progress in reducing malaria mortality and morbidity in the last decade. Mizoram State in North-East India is one of the few malaria-endemic regions where malaria transmission has continued to remain high. As Mizoram shares international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, malaria control in this region is critical for malaria elimination efforts in all the three countries. For identifying hotspots for targeted intervention, malaria data from 385 public health sub-centers across Mizoram were analyzed in the Geographic Information System. Almost all the sub-centers reporting high Annual Parasite Index (> 10) are located in Mizoram's districts that border Bangladesh. Getis-Ord G<sub>i</sub>* statistic shows most of the sub-centers located along the Bangladesh border in the Lawngtlai and Lunglei districts to be the malaria hotspots. The hotspots also extended into the Mamit and Siaha districts, especially along the borders of Lawngtlai and Lunglei. Analysis of terrain, climatic, and land use/land cover datasets obtained from the Global Modelling and Assimilation Office and satellite images show Mizoram's western part (Lawngtlai, Lunglei, and Mamit districts) to experience similar topographic and climatic conditions as the bordering Rangamati district in the Chittagong division of Bangladesh. Climatic trends in this region from 1981 to 2021, estimated by the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimates, show an increasing trend in minimum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and the associated shift of climatic pattern (temperate to tropical monsoon) could facilitate malaria transmission. The quasi-Poisson regression model estimates a strong association (p < 0.001) between total malaria cases, temperature range, and elevation. The Kruskal-Wallis H test shows a statistically significant association between malaria cases and forest classes (p < 0.001). A regional coordination and strategic plan are required to eliminate malaria from this hyper-endemic malaria region of North-East India.",

        "abstract": "We determined the pulse oximetry benefit in pediatric pneumonia mortality risk stratification and chest-indrawing pneumonia in-hospital mortality risk factors. We report the characteristics and in-hospital pneumonia-related mortality of children aged 2-59 months who were included in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations dataset. We developed multivariable logistic regression models of chest-indrawing pneumonia to identify mortality risk factors. Among 285,839 children, 164,244 (57.5%) from hospital-based studies were included. Pneumonia case fatality risk (CFR) without pulse oximetry measurement was higher than with measurement (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-5.9% vs 2.1%, 95% CI 1.9-2.4%). One in five children with chest-indrawing pneumonia was hypoxemic (19.7%, 95% CI 19.0-20.4%), and the hypoxemic CFR was 10.3% (95% CI 9.1-11.5%). Other mortality risk factors were younger age (either 2-5 months [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 9.94, 95% CI 6.67-14.84] or 6-11 months [aOR 2.67, 95% CI 1.71-4.16]), moderate malnutrition (aOR 2.41, 95% CI 1.87-3.09), and female sex (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.32). Children with a pulse oximetry measurement had a lower CFR. Many children hospitalized with chest-indrawing pneumonia were hypoxemic and one in 10 died. Young age and moderate malnutrition were risk factors for in-hospital chest-indrawing pneumonia-related mortality. Pulse oximetry should be integrated in pneumonia hospital care for children under 5 years.",

Our clinical trials programme, which relied on in-person visits for training, monitoring and capacity building across nine low- and middle-income countries, had to adapt to those unprecedented operational challenges. We report the adaptation of our working model with a focus on the operational areas of training, monitoring and cross-site collaboration. Adaptations include changing training strategies from in-person site visits with three or four team members to a multi-pronged virtual approach, with generic online training for good clinical practice, the development of a library of study-specific training videos, and interactive virtual training sessions, including practical laboratory-focused training sessions. We also report changes from in-person monitoring to remote monitoring as well as the development of a more localized network of clinical trial monitors to support hybrid models with in-person and remote monitoring depending on identified risks at each site. We established a virtual network across different trial and study sites with the objective to further build capacity for good clinical practice-compliant antimalarial trials and foster cross-country and cross-study site collaboration. The forced adaptation of these new strategies has come with advantages that we did not envisage initially. This includes improved, more frequent engagement through the established network with opportunities for increased south-to-south support and a substantially reduced carbon footprint and budget savings. Our new approach is challenging for study sites with limited prior experience but this can be overcome with hybrid models. Capacity building for laboratory-based work remains difficult using a virtual environment. The changes to our working model are likely to last, even after the end of the pandemic, providing a more sustainable and equitable approach to our research.",

This study has aimed to evaluate the nature and extent at which these relations are maintained across all the malaria endemic countries of Africa and Asia-Pacific region. We have utilized the last two decades of malaria incidence, annual minimum temperature, and annual precipitation time series data (2000-2020) for the two most malaria-impacted regions. These data were fitted in the generalized linear model and the mixed effects model. The results showed that there exists a large heterogeneity in malaria incidence across the countries, and between the regions. Last two decadal tendencies showed significant reductions in the disease burden in almost all the countries in the Asia Pacific, with several exceptions or relatively slowed reductions in the Africa. We found significant changes in the positive linear associations between malaria incidence, annual minimum temperature, and annual precipitation across African countries. Many Asia-Pacific countries namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam showed negative effects in the associations with the annual precipitation. This study indicates that increasing temperature within the range of 12-30 °C can generate positive effects on malaria incidence, but the nature and extent of precipitation effects vary across countries and at a large regional scale.",

This prospective observational study was conducted for six months following ethical approval. Informed consent was obtained prior enrollment. A total of 50 patients with complaints of fever for <2 weeks duration with altered sensorium with or without seizure were included in the study. GCS was calculated for all patients just after admission and before starting interventions. All patients were investigated and managed according to the hospital protocol. The outcome of the patients (living or dead within the hospital) was evaluated against the admission GCS score. The study was performed in accordance with the current Declaration of Helsinki. Of all, 42.0% (n=21) of the patients had bacterial meningitis, followed by viral encephalitis, cerebral malaria and coma vigil. Complete recovery occurred in 60.0% of cases, while recovery with disability occurred in 28.0% of cases. Death occurred in 12.0% of cases (n=6) due to cerebral malaria, viral encephalitis and bacterial meningitis (n=2 each cause). A higher number of deaths occurred in the lower GCS group (n=5 in GCS group 3-5) and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Moreover, considering death as an outcome, multivariate logistic regression showed that GCS (OR 70.598, 95% CI-1.243-4009.41; p=0.039) was an independent predictor of the outcome. GCS seemed to be a predictor of the short-term outcome of the patient presenting with fever and altered sensorium in our setting. However, further exploration in larger setting with appropriate study design is recommended.",

We aimed to collate an individual patient-level data set from large, high-quality pre-existing studies on pneumonia in children to identify a set of signs and symptoms with greater validity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatment of childhood pneumonia for the improvement of current pneumonia case management guidelines. Using data from a published systematic review and expert knowledge, we identified studies meeting our eligibility criteria and invited investigators to share individual-level patient data. We collected data on demographic information, general medical history, and current illness episode, including history, clinical presentation, chest radiograph findings when available, treatment, and outcome. Data were gathered separately from hospital-based and community-based cases. We performed a narrative synthesis to describe the final data set. Forty-one separate data sets were included in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) database, 26 of which were hospital-based and 15 were community-based. The PREPARE database includes 285 839 children with pneumonia (244 323 in the hospital and 41 516 in the community), with detailed descriptions of clinical presentation, clinical progression, and outcome. Of 9185 pneumonia-related deaths, 6836 (74%) occurred in children <1 year of age and 1317 (14%) in children aged 1-2 years. Of the 285 839 episodes, 280 998 occurred in children 0-59 months old, of which 129 584 (46%) were 2-11 months of age and 152 730 (54%) were males. This data set could identify an improved specific, sensitive set of criteria for diagnosing clinical pneumonia and help identify sick children in need of referral to a higher level of care or a change of therapy. Field studies could be designed based on insights from PREPARE analyses to validate a potential revised pneumonia algorithm.

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA. We analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5 × 5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units. We found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group. As the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.",

The causative agent Plasmodium falciparum is resistant to several currently available anti-malarial drugs, such as mefloquine, chloroquine, and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), and this has been a major global challenge towards the control of the disease. There is urgent need for novel anti-malarial chemotherapeutic agents. The present study aimed to evaluate antimalarial activity of methanolic extracts of three Bangladeshi medicinal plants- Acorus calamus, Dichapetalum gelonioides and Leucas aspera - against both chloroquine sensitive (3D7) and resistant (Dd2) strains of P. falciparum. Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) based ELISA was used to evaluate the in vitro inhibitory activity of the extracts. D. gelonioides extract showed moderate (IC50 = 19.15 µg/mL) and promising activity (IC50 = 10.43 µg/mL) against 3D7 and Dd2 strains respectively. A. calamus remained inactive against both 3D7 (IC50 = 72.29 µg/mL) and Dd2 strain (IC50 = 67.81 µg/mL). L. aspera initially remained inactive against 3D7 strain (IC50 = 60.51 µg/mL), but displayed promising activity (IC50 = 7.693) against Dd2 strain. This is the first time these plant materials have been assessed for their in vitro antimalarial properties. It is pivotal to conduct further phytochemical analysis of D. gelonioides and L. aspera to evaluate the presence of potential novel antimalarial drug compounds.",

Widespread long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) distribution and use is one of the measures responsible for this success. Recalcitrant malaria hotspots within the Chittagong Hill Tracts districts suggest important drivers of malaria risk may remain uncharacterized. Towards understanding how household-level human behaviour impacts exposure to mosquitoes, parallel human landing catches and human behavioural observations were conducted in four households for 6 months (May-October) over the rainy season in the Bandarban District. Analysis quantifies spatiotemporal human behaviour-adjusted exposure to Anopheles with and without LLINs. This small-scale operational study demonstrates that human spatial and temporal presence along with LLIN use drives exposure to Anopheles. Though the four households had both outdoor and indoor exposure, especially in the evening (1800-2000 h) and early morning (0400-0500 h), data points to household-based heterogeneity in malaria exposure even with similar LLIN access. Incorporating human behaviour into exposure estimates can be used to understand the efficacy and limitations of local vector control strategies and identify gaps in protection, as well as where present intervention strategies may be optimized.",

This study aimed to analyze the potential spatial relationships between the dengue vector (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>) and dengue cases in the megacity of Bangladesh during the 2019 dengue outbreak. Vector density measures were used to estimate spatial associations with dengue case distribution. Location was determined for 364 dengue cases who were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital over a period of 4 months. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and prior consent was ensured before participation. The Moran global index, Getis-Ord Gi∗, ordinary least squares regression, geographically weighted regression and count data regression methods were used for spatial analysis. We found that dengue case distribution was not associated with immature <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito (larvae) density across the city. The relationship between larval density measured by the Breteau Index (BI) and House Index (HI) with dengue cases was nonstationary and not statistically significant. The location of dengue cases appears to be unrelated to vector distribution and vector density. These findings should prompt the search for other transmission risk factors.",

The present work showed that blocking the EphA2 receptor by these phytochemicals prevents endothelial cell apoptosis by averting ephrin-A ligand-expressing CD8+ T cell bioadhesion. These phytochemicals showed excellent docking scores and binding affinity, demonstrating hydrogen bond, electrostatic, Pi-sigma, and pi alkyl hydrophobic binding interactions when compared with native ligands at the EphA2 receptor. The comparative MD study using two PDB IDs showed that isocolumbin, carnosol, luteolin, and taraxasterol have better binding affinities (viz. -9.3, -9.0, -9.5, and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively). <i>Ocimum basilicum</i> phytochemicals showed a lower docking score but more binding interactions than native ligands at the EphA2 receptor for both PDB IDs. This suggests that these phytochemicals may serve as potential drug candidates in the management of CM. We consider that the present MD study provides leads in drug development by targeting the EphA2 receptor in managing CM. The approach is innovative because a role for EphA2 receptors in CM has never been highlighted.",

        "abstract": "<i>Plasmodium malariae</i> is a neglected human malaria parasite with low parasitemia that often results in the misdiagnosis and underestimation of the actual disease burden of this pathogen. Microscopy is the best diagnostic tool, despite the fact that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are the best surveillance tool for malaria diagnosis in many rural areas for their ease of use in elimination settings. For parasite antigen detection other than <i>P. falciparum</i>, RDTs depend on essential glycolytic <i>Plasmodium</i> proteins, i.e., <i>Plasmodium</i> lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) and <i>Plasmodium</i> aldolase (pAldo) antigens. There is a lack of species-specific test kits for <i>P. malariae</i>, and overall, its rapid antigenic test accuracy is questionable. False negative results can accelerate the burden of asymptomatic malaria infection and transmission. Here, we report a case of a malaria patient in Bangladesh infected with <i>P. malariae</i> who tested negative on pLDH and pAldo based RDTs. This case provides useful information for health providers to be aware of possible RDT failure and also for the future development of analytically sensitive test kits for <i>P. malariae.</i>",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease, and Africa is still one of the most affected endemic regions despite years of policy to limit infection and transmission rates. Further, studies into the variable efficacy of the vaccine are needed to provide a better understanding of protective immunity. Thus, the current study is designed to delineate the effect of each dose of vaccine on the transcriptional profiles of subjects to determine its efficacy and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the protection this vaccine provides. Here, we used gene expression profiles of pre and post-vaccination patients after various doses of RTS,S based on samples collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Subsequently, differential gene expression analysis using edgeR revealed the significantly (false discovery rate < 0.005) 158 downregulated and 61 upregulated genes between control vs. controlled human malaria infection samples. Further, enrichment analysis of significant genes delineated the involvement of CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, XCR1, CSF3, IFNB1, IFNE, IL12B, IL22, IL6, IL27, etc., genes which found to be upregulated after earlier doses but downregulated after the 3rd dose in cytokine-chemokine pathways. Notably, we identified 13 cytokine genes whose expression significantly varied during three doses. Eventually, these findings give insight into the dual role of cytokine responses in malaria pathogenesis. The variations in their expression patterns after various doses of vaccination are linked to the protection as it decreases the severe inflammatory effects in malaria patients. This study will be helpful in designing a better vaccine against malaria and understanding the functions of cytokine response as well.",

        "abstract": "Diagnostic approaches capable of ultrasensitive pathogen detection from low-volume clinical samples, running without any sophisticated instrument and laboratory setup, are easily field-deployable, inexpensive, and rapid, and are considered ideal for monitoring disease progression and surveillance. However, standard pathogen detection methods, including culture and microscopic observation, antibody-based serologic tests, and primarily polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-oriented nucleic acid screening techniques, have shortcomings that limit their widespread use in responding to outbreaks and regular diagnosis, especially in remote resource-limited settings (RLSs). Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based programmable technology has emerged to challenge the unmet criteria of conventional methods. It consists of CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) capable of targeting virtually any specific RNA or DNA genome based on the guide RNA (gRNA) sequence. Furthermore, the discovery of programmable trans-cleavage Cas proteins like Cas12a and Cas13 that can collaterally damage reporter-containing single-stranded DNA or RNA upon formation of target Cas-gRNA complex has strengthened this technology with enhanced sensitivity. Current advances, including automated multiplexing, ultrasensitive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based screening, inexpensive paper-based lateral flow readouts, and ease of use in remote global settings, have attracted the scientific community to introduce this technology in nucleic acid-based precise detection of bacterial and viral pathogens at the point of care (POC). This review highlights CRISPR-Cas-based molecular technologies in diagnosing several tropical diseases, namely malaria, zika, chikungunya, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), and rabies.",

        "abstract": "Mapping asymptomatic malaria infections, which contribute to the transmission reservoir, is important for elimination programs. This analysis compared the spatiotemporal patterns of symptomatic and asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections in a cohort study of ∼25,000 people living in a rural hypoendemic area of about 179 km2 in a small area of the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh. Asymptomatic infections were identified by active surveillance; symptomatic clinical cases presented for care. Infections were identified by a positive rapid diagnostic test and/or microscopy. Fifty-three subjects with asymptomatic P. falciparum infection were compared with 572 subjects with symptomatic P. falciparum between mid-October 2009 and mid-October 2012 with regard to seasonality, household location, and extent of spatial clustering. We found increased spatial clustering of symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infections, and the areas of high intensity were only sometimes overlapping. Symptomatic cases had a distinct seasonality, unlike asymptomatic infections, which were detected year-round. In a comparison of 42 symptomatic Plasmodium vivax and 777 symptomatic P. falciparum cases from mid-October 2009 through mid-March 2015, we found substantial spatial overlap in areas with high infection rates, but the areas with the greatest concentration of infection differed. Detection of both symptomatic P. falciparum and symptomatic P. vivax infections was greater during the May-to-October high season, although a greater proportion of P. falciparum cases occurred during the high season compared with P. vivax. These findings reinforce that passive malaria surveillance and treatment of symptomatic cases will not eliminate the asymptomatic reservoirs that occur distinctly in time and space.",

        "abstract": "In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended single low-dose (SLD, 0.25 mg/kg) primaquine to be added as a Plasmodium (P.) falciparum gametocytocide to artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) without glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing, to accelerate malaria elimination efforts and avoid the spread of artemisinin resistance. Uptake of this recommendation has been relatively slow primarily due to safety concerns. A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of single-dose (SD) primaquine studies for P. falciparum malaria were performed. Absolute and fractional changes in haemoglobin concentration within a week and adverse effects within 28 days of treatment initiation were characterised and compared between primaquine and no primaquine arms using random intercept models. Data comprised 20 studies that enrolled 6406 participants, of whom 5129 (80.1%) had received a single target dose of primaquine ranging between 0.0625 and 0.75 mg/kg. There was no effect of primaquine in G6PD-normal participants on haemoglobin concentrations. However, among 194 G6PD-deficient African participants, a 0.25 mg/kg primaquine target dose resulted in an additional 0.53 g/dL (95% CI 0.17-0.89) reduction in haemoglobin concentration by day 7, with a 0.27 (95% CI 0.19-0.34) g/dL haemoglobin drop estimated for every 0.1 mg/kg increase in primaquine dose. Baseline haemoglobin, young age, and hyperparasitaemia were the main determinants of becoming anaemic (Hb < 10 g/dL), with the nadir observed on ACT day 2 or 3, regardless of G6PD status and exposure to primaquine. Time to recovery from anaemia took longer in young children and those with baseline anaemia or hyperparasitaemia. Serious adverse haematological events after primaquine were few (9/3, 113, 0.3%) and transitory. One blood transfusion was reported in the primaquine arms, and there were no primaquine-related deaths. In controlled studies, the proportions with either haematological or any serious adverse event were similar between primaquine and no primaquine arms. Our results support the WHO recommendation to use 0.25 mg/kg of primaquine as a P. falciparum gametocytocide, including in G6PD-deficient individuals. Although primaquine is associated with a transient reduction in haemoglobin levels in G6PD-deficient individuals, haemoglobin levels at clinical presentation are the major determinants of anaemia in these patients.

        "abstract": "Meta-analyses show that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) reduce child wasting and stunting. There is little information regarding effects on severe wasting or stunting. We aimed to identify the effect of SQ-LNSs on prevalence of severe wasting (weight-for-length z score < -3) and severe stunting (length-for-age z score < -3). We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided to children 6-24 mo of age. We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with control and pooled the estimates using fixed-effects models. We used random-effects meta-regression to examine study-level effect modifiers. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether results differed depending on study arm inclusion criteria and types of comparisons. SQ-LNS provision led to a relative reduction of 31% in severe wasting [prevalence ratio (PR): 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.86; n = 34,373] and 17% in severe stunting (PR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.90; n = 36,795) at endline. Results were similar in most of the sensitivity analyses but somewhat attenuated when comparisons using passive control arms were excluded (PR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.96; n = 26,327 for severe wasting and PR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.95; n = 28,742 for severe stunting). Study-level characteristics generally did not significantly modify the effects of SQ-LNSs, but results suggested greater effects of SQ-LNSs in sites with greater burdens of wasting or stunting, or with poorer water quality or sanitation. Including SQ-LNSs in preventive interventions to promote healthy child growth and development is likely to reduce rates of severe wasting and stunting.

Analysis revealed that the risk of malaria infection was higher in the ≥5-year-old subjects than in the under-5 age group. The mean parasite density of <i>P. malariae</i> (1455.00/μL blood) was the lowest; cf. with <i>P. falciparum</i>: 12,275.08/μL blood.

Thalassemia is a major health problem in Bangladesh. There are two types of thalassemia in Bangladesh: β-thalassemia (β-thal) and Hb E (<i>HBB</i>: c.79G>A)/β-thal, with the prevalence rate of β-thal trait being 4.1% and Hb E trait 6.1%. This study discusses spectrum types of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies in Bangladesh and the types of carrier detection. The distribution of common mutations of thalassemia are also discussed and the distribution frequencies of genotypes and alleles of β-thal and Hb E patients are also compared. Additionally, we also conducted a study of the spectrum of thalassemia using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the tribal populations and analyzed the findings in our discussion. The results of these studies show that the phenotypic and genotypic presentation in Bangladesh is highly diverse.

While most of them knew about dengue (97.1%), chikungunya (81.4%), and malaria (85.2%), only half of them were aware of filaria (53.3%), which is endemic to the northern region. A knowledge score (0−8, low), (9−16, moderate), (17−24, high), and attitude score (0−4, poor), (5−8, moderate), and (9−13, high) were assigned. While poor and moderate attitudes were considered negative, good attitudes were considered positive. About 45% of the respondents had a moderate knowledge score (50−70); however, about 67.9% of participants showed a good attitude score (>70) towards the control of MBDs. It was found that the knowledge and attitude of the responders were related to their profession (knowledge p < 0.001; attitude, p = 0.002), residential area (knowledge p < 0.001; attitude, p < 0.001), and education level (knowledge p < 0.001; attitude p = 0.004). A mosquito is a kind of nuisance bug, and about 79.8% of responders admitted that they kill mosquitoes as soon as they notice them. They also use bed nets (93.7%) followed by mosquito coils (85.7%) as a preventive method. Interestingly, 73.2% of the responders were reluctant to contact the local government during an increase in mosquito numbers. Overall, the people of Bangladesh have a positive attitude towards the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases. It is highly recommended that the government creates more knowledge regarding this issue and develops collaborative approaches with local people to implement robust preventive measures against mosquito-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Severe malaria caused by <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is difficult to diagnose accurately in children in high-transmission settings. Using data from 2649 pediatric and adult patients enrolled in four studies of severe illness in three countries (Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda), we fitted Bayesian latent class models using two diagnostic markers: the platelet count and the plasma concentration of <i>P. falciparum</i> histidine-rich protein 2 (<i>Pf</i>HRP2). In severely ill patients with clinical features consistent with severe malaria, the combination of a platelet count of ≤150,000/μl and a plasma <i>Pf</i>HRP2 concentration of ≥1000 ng/ml had an estimated sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 93% in identifying severe falciparum malaria. Compared with misdiagnosed children, pediatric patients with true severe malaria had higher parasite densities, lower hematocrits, lower rates of invasive bacterial disease, and a lower prevalence of both sickle cell trait and sickle cell anemia. We estimate that one-third of the children enrolled into clinical studies of severe malaria in high-transmission settings in Africa had another cause of their severe illness.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains endemic in Bangladesh, with the majority of cases occurring in forested, mountainous region in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). This area is home to Bengali and diverse groups of indigenous people (Pahari) residing largely in mono-ethnic villages. 1002 individuals of the 9 most prominent Pahari and the Bengali population were randomly selected and screened by RDT and qPCR. Parasites were genotyped by msp2 and deep sequencing of 5 amplicons (ama1-D3, cpmp, cpp, csp, and msp7) for Plasmodium falciparum (n = 20), and by microsatellite (MS) typing of ten loci and amplicon sequencing of msp1 for Plasmodium vivax (n = 21). Population structure was analysed using STRUCTURE software. Identity-by-state (IBS) was calculated as a measure of parasite relatedness and used to generate relatedness networks. The prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax infection was 0.7% by RDT (P. falciparum 6/1002; P. vivax 0/1002, mixed: 1/1002) and 4% by qPCR (P. falciparum 21/1002; P. vivax 16/1002, mixed: 5/1002). Infections were highly clustered, with 64% (27/42) of infections occurring in only two Pahari groups, the Khumi and Mro. Diversity was high; expected heterozygosity was 0.93 for P. falciparum and 0.81 for P. vivax. 85.7% (18/21) of P. vivax and 25% (5/20) of P. falciparum infections were polyclonal. No population structure was evident for either species, suggesting high transmission and gene flow among Pahari groups. High subclinical infection prevalence and genetic diversity mirror ongoing transmission. Control activities should be specifically directed to Pahari groups at greatest risk.",

Most of these deaths occur as a result of a delayed or incorrect diagnosis. At the moment, the manual microscope is considered to be the most effective equipment for diagnosing malaria. It is, on the other hand, time-consuming and prone to human error. Because it is such a serious global health issue, it is important that the evaluation process be automated. The objective of this article is to advocate for the automation of the diagnosis process in order to eliminate the need for human intervention in the process. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep-learning technologies, such as image processing, are being utilized to evaluate parasitemia in microscopic blood slides in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The approach is based on the intensity characteristics of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites and erythrocytes, which are both known to be variable. Images of infected and noninfected erythrocytes are gathered and fed into the CNN models ResNet50, ResNet34, VGG-16, and VGG-19, which are all trained on the same dataset. The techniques of transfer learning and fine-tuning are employed, and the outcomes are contrasted. The VGG-19 model obtained the best overall performance given the parameters and dataset that were evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites which are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium vivax is distinct from other malaria species in its ability to remain dormant in the liver (as hypnozoites) and activate later to cause further infections (referred to as relapses). Mathematical models to describe the transmission dynamics of P. vivax have been developed, but most of them fail to capture realistic dynamics of hypnozoites. Models that do capture the complexity tend to involve many governing equations, making them difficult to extend to incorporate other important factors for P. vivax, such as treatment status, age and pregnancy. In this paper, we have developed a multiscale model (a system of integro-differential equations) that involves a minimal set of equations at the population scale, with an embedded within-host model that can capture the dynamics of the hypnozoite reservoir. In this way, we can gain key insights into dynamics of P. vivax transmission with a minimum number of equations at the population scale, making this framework readily scalable to incorporate more complexity. We performed a sensitivity analysis of our multiscale model over key parameters and found that prevalence of P. vivax blood-stage infection increases with both bite rate and number of mosquitoes but decreases with hypnozoite death rate. Since our mathematical model captures the complex dynamics of P. vivax and the hypnozoite reservoir, it has the potential to become a key tool to inform elimination strategies for P. vivax.",

Many measures have been taken over the past few years to reduce the burden of malaria on public health following the recommendation of WHO, still, malaria has continued to rake devastation in Africa. Combating malaria in Africa has grown into an international concern. The eradication of malaia is a long-standing goal of public health initiatives globally. The development of vaccines will go a long way to provide the required immunity needed for the people living with malaria or vulnerable to malaria. It is imperative that a vaccine should be produced and rolled out for use, especially during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when attention is given to mitigating the impact of the pandemic on public health. The malaria vaccine will reduce the number of hospital admission for malaria illness among children and other age groups. Africa will need to build strong innovations to overcome country-specific challenges in vaccination drive, human resources, and supply chain management. Accelerating education, sensitization, diagnosis, and eradication through joint efforts of the government, healthcare professionals and general population will help to prevent the dual synchronous epidemic of COVID-19 and Malaria in Africa.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by female anopheles mosquito bites. Various plasmodium parasites spread in the victim's blood cells and keep their life in a critical situation. If not treated at the early stage, malaria can cause even death. Microscopy is a familiar process for diagnosing malaria, collecting the victim's blood samples, and counting the parasite and red blood cells. However, the microscopy process is time-consuming and can produce an erroneous result in some cases. With the recent success of machine learning and deep learning in medical diagnosis, it is quite possible to minimize diagnosis costs and improve overall detection accuracy compared with the traditional microscopy method. This paper proposes a multiheaded attention-based transformer model to diagnose the malaria parasite from blood cell images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the gradient-weighted class activation map (Grad-CAM) technique was implemented to identify which parts of an image the proposed model paid much more attention to compared with the remaining parts by generating a heatmap image. The proposed model achieved a testing accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC score of 96.41%, 96.99%, 95.88%, 96.44%, and 99.11%, respectively, for the original malaria parasite dataset and 99.25%, 99.08%, 99.42%, 99.25%, and 99.99%, respectively, for the modified dataset. Various hyperparameters were also finetuned to obtain optimum results, which were also compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for malaria parasite detection, and the proposed method outperformed the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "To avoid misuse of anti-malarials, correct diagnosis of fever prior to drug prescription is essential. Presumptive treatment in the private healthcare sector is a concern in Nigeria, where availability of affordable artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is high following the implementation of subsidy schemes from 2010 to 2017. Similar subsidies have not, however, been implemented for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). A market survey in 2018 predominantly designed to assess the ACT market in the private sector also collected data related to RDTs, results of which are presented herein. A 2018 market survey consisted of (i) an outlet survey targeting private pharmacies and Proprietary and Patent Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) across different regions of Nigeria to assess supply-side market factors related to availability of RDTs (defined as having stock available for purchase at the time of the survey) and (ii) a household survey to determine demand-side factors related to knowledge of RDTs, healthcare-seeking practices and affordability. Availability of RDTs at the time of the survey was low in both outlet types and significantly lower in PPMVs (22.1%, 95% CI) among pharmacies versus (13.6%, 95% CI) among PPMVs (p < 0.01). Reasons for not restocking RDTs included low demand and no supply. The majority of households diagnose malaria based on experience, while one-third would visit a PPMV or pharmacy. Half of households had heard of RDTs (48.4%) and 38.6% thought they were affordable. Low availability of RDTs among PPMVs and pharmacies may be attributed to lack of demand, supply-side issues and cost. Increasing household knowledge of RDTs may aid increasing demand, while subsidized RDTs may address supply and price issues. Addressing the deficit in RDT provision is important for targeting of ACT medicines.",

In low-transmission areas of Southeast Asia, where resistance has emerged, P. falciparum antibodies confound parasite clearance measures. However, variation in naturally acquired antibodies across Asian and sub-Saharan African epidemiological contexts and their impact on parasite clearance re yet to be quantified. In an artemisinin therapeutic efficacy study, antibodies to 12 pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic P. falciparum antigens were measured in 118 children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and compared with responses in patients from Asian sites, described elsewhere. Parasite clearance half-life was shorter in DRC patients (median, 2 hours) compared with most Asian sites (median, 2-7 hours), but P. falciparum antibody levels and seroprevalences were similar. There was no evidence for an association between antibody seropositivity and parasite clearance half-life (mean difference between seronegative and seropositive, -0.14 to +0.40 hour) in DRC patients. In DRC, where artemisinin remains highly effective, the substantially shorter parasite clearance time compared with Asia was not explained by differences in the P. falciparum antibody responses studied.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax forms dormant liver stages that can reactivate weeks or months following an acute infection. Recurrent infections are often associated with a febrile illness and can cause a cumulative risk of severe anaemia, direct and indirect mortality, and onward transmission of the parasite. There is an increased risk of P. vivax parasitaemia following falciparum malaria suggesting a rationale for universal use of radically curative treatment in patients with P. falciparum malaria even in the absence of detectable P. vivax parasitaemia in areas that are co-endemic for both species. This is a multicentre, health care facility-based, randomized, controlled, open-label trial in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Ethiopia. Patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, G6PD activity of ≥70% of the adjusted male median (AMM) and haemoglobin levels ≥8g/dl are recruited into the study and randomized to either receive standard schizonticidal treatment plus 7-day high dose primaquine (total dose 7mg/kg) or standard care in a 1:1 ratio. Patients are followed up weekly until day 63. The primary endpoint is the incidence risk of any P. vivax parasitemia on day 63. Secondary endpoints include incidence risk on day 63 of symptomatic P. vivax malaria and the risk of any P. falciparum parasitaemia. Secondary safety outcomes include the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events, the incidence risk of severe anaemia (Hb<5g/dl and <7g/dl) and/or the risk for blood transfusion, the incidence risk of ≥ 25% fall in haemoglobin with and without haemoglobinuria, and the incidence risk of ≥ 25% fall in haemoglobin to under 7g/dl with and without haemoglobinuria. This study evaluates the potential benefit of a universal radical cure for both P. vivax and P. falciparum in different endemic locations. If found safe and effective universal radical cure could represent a cost-effective approach to clear otherwise unrecognised P. vivax infections and hence accelerate P. vivax elimination.

In Bangladesh and Indonesia G6PD activity was significantly higher during acute malaria than when the same individuals were retested during follow up (40.9% (95%CI: 33.4-48.1) and 7.4% (95%CI: 0.2 to 14.6) respectively), whereas in Ethiopia G6PD activity was 3.6% (95%CI: -1.0 to -6.1) lower during acute malaria. The change in G6PD activity was apparent in patients presenting with either P. vivax or P. falciparum infection. Overall, 66.7% (4/6) severely deficient participants and 87.2% (34/39) with intermediate deficiency had normal activities when presenting with malaria. These findings suggest that G6PD activity rises significantly and at clinically relevant levels during acute malaria. Prospective case-control studies are warranted to confirm the degree to which the predicted population attributable risks of drug induced haemolysis is lower than would be predicted from cross sectional surveys.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is an endemic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. In clinical practice, the main concern is the overdiagnosis of malaria leading to inappropriate drug prescription without laboratory confirmation. This study aimed to evaluate clinical examination reliability compared with translational laboratory methods of malaria diagnosis. The study was conducted in Goundi Hospital among hospitalized patients over a seven-month period. Patients were interviewed, and malaria tests done included the Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. Diagnostic accuracy was analysed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Among 1,874 participants, 674 (35.96%) patients had positive Giemsa-stained thick blood films. The rate of positivity is higher for patients under 5 years of age. The parasite densities were between 160 and 84.000 parasites/<i>μ</i>L. The threshold pyrogen of the parasitic density was around 10.000 parasites/<i>μ</i>L for patients between 0 and 11 months of age, between 1 and 4 years of age, and between 5 and 14 years of age. This threshold was lower for patients over 15 years of age. The study reported some issues in the findings: 60.88% (607/997) cases of fever without positivity of the blood thick smear and 40.13% (284/674) cases of positivity of the thick drop without fever. The positive predictive value of malaria was between 80 and 85% for patients under 5 years of age. This value is lower for patients between 5 and 14 years of age and patients over 15 years of age. A presumptive diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by the laboratory in all suspected cases in all possible scenarios. Every parasitemia should be followed by the calculation of parasitic density. However, for the children under 5 years of age in areas of high transmission, the presumptive diagnosis of malaria in certain circumstances could be considered.",

In a multi-national clinical efficacy trial of artemisinin therapies (13 sites of varying transmission over South-East Asia and Africa), we measured Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to recombinant <i>P. falciparum</i> gametocyte antigens expressed on the gametocyte plasma membrane and leading transmission blocking vaccine candidates <i>Pf</i>s230 (<i>Pf</i>s230c and <i>Pf</i>s230D1M) and <i>Pf</i>s48/45 at enrolment in 1,114 participants with clinical falciparum malaria. Mixed effects linear and logistic regression were used to determine the association between gametocyte measures (gametocytemia and gametocyte density) and antibody outcomes at enrolment. Microscopy detectable gametocytemia was observed in 11% (127/1,114) of participants at enrolment, and an additional 9% (95/1,114) over the follow-up period (up to day 42) (total 20% of participants [222/1,114]). IgG levels in response to <i>Pf</i>s230c, <i>Pf</i>s48/45 and <i>Pf</i>s230D1M varied across study sites at enrolment (<i>p < 0.001</i>), as did IgG seroprevalence for anti-<i>Pf</i>s230c and D1M IgG (<i>p < 0.001</i>), but not for anti-<i>Pf</i>s48/45 IgG (<i>p = 0.159</i>). In adjusted analyses, microscopy detectable gametocytemia at enrolment was associated with an increase in the odds of IgG seropositivity to the three gametocyte antigens (<i>Pf</i>s230c OR [95% CI], <i>p</i>: 1.70 [1.10, 2.62], <i>0.017</i>; <i>Pf</i>s48/45: 1.45 [0.85, 2.46], <i>0.174</i>; <i>Pf</i>s230D1M: 1.70 [1.03, 2.80], <i>0.037</i>), as was higher gametocyte density at enrolment (per two-fold change in gametocyte density <i>Pf</i>s230c OR [95% CI], <i>p</i>: 1.09 [1.02, 1.17], <i>0.008</i>; <i>Pf</i>s48/45: 1.05 [0.98, 1.13], <i>0.185</i>; <i>Pf</i>s230D1M: 1.07 [0.99, 1.14], <i>0.071</i>). <i>Pf</i>s230 and <i>Pf</i>s48/45 antibodies are naturally immunogenic targets associated with patent gametocytemia and increasing gametocyte density across multiple malaria endemic settings, including regions with emerging artemisinin-resistant <i>P. falciparum</i>.",

However, the benefits or costs of geoengineering for human health are largely unknown. We project how geoengineering could impact malaria risk by comparing current transmission suitability and populations-at-risk under moderate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5) with and without geoengineering. We show that if geoengineering deployment cools the tropics, it could help protect high elevation populations in eastern Africa from malaria encroachment, but could increase transmission in lowland sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Compared to extreme warming, we find that by 2070, geoengineering would nullify a projected reduction of nearly one billion people at risk of malaria. Our results indicate that geoengineering strategies designed to offset warming are not guaranteed to unilaterally improve health outcomes, and could produce regional trade-offs among Global South countries that are often excluded from geoengineering conversations.",

        "abstract": "Brief behavioural support can effectively help tuberculosis (TB) patients quit smoking and improve their outcomes. In collaboration with TB programmes in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan, we evaluated the implementation and scale-up of cessation support using four strategies: (1) brief tobacco cessation intervention, (2) integration of tobacco cessation within routine training, (3) inclusion of tobacco indicators in routine records and (4) embedding research within TB programmes. We used mixed methods of observation, interviews, questionnaires and routine data. We aimed to understand the extent and facilitators of vertical scale-up (institutionalization) within 59 health facility learning sites in Pakistan, 18 in Nepal and 15 in Bangladesh, and horizontal scale-up (increased coverage beyond learning sites). We observed training and surveyed all 169 TB health workers who were trained, in order to measure changes in their confidence in delivering cessation support. Routine TB data from the learning sites were analysed to assess intervention delivery and use of TB forms revised to report smoking status and cessation support provided. A purposive sample of TB health workers, managers and policy-makers were interviewed (Bangladesh n = 12; Nepal n = 13; Pakistan n = 19). Costs of scale-up were estimated using activity-based cost analysis. Routine data indicated that health workers in learning sites asked all TB patients about tobacco use and offered them cessation support. Qualitative data showed use of intervention materials, often with adaptation and partial implementation in busy clinics. Short (1-2 hours) training integrated within existing programmes increased mean confidence in delivering cessation support by 17% (95% CI: 14-20%). A focus on health system changes (reporting, training, supervision) facilitated vertical scale-up. Dissemination of materials beyond learning sites and changes to national reporting forms and training indicated a degree of horizontal scale-up. Embedding research within TB health systems was crucial for horizontal scale-up and required the dynamic use of tactics including alliance-building, engagement in the wider policy process, use of insider researchers and a deep understanding of health system actors and processes. System-level changes within TB programmes may facilitate routine delivery of cessation support to TB patients. These strategies are inexpensive, and with concerted efforts from TB programmes and donors, tobacco cessation can be institutionalized at scale.",

        "abstract": "Although great improvements in child survival were achieved in the past two decades, progress has been uneven within and across countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to reverse previous advances. Demographic and epidemiological transitions around the world have resulted in shifts in the causes and distribution of child death and diseases, and many children are living with short-term and long-term chronic illnesses and disabilities. These changes, plus global threats such as pandemics, transnational and national security issues, and climate change, mean that regular monitoring of child health and wellbeing is essential if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This Health Policy describes the three-phased process undertaken by the Child Health Accountability Tracking technical advisory group (CHAT) to develop a core set of indicators on child health and wellbeing for global monitoring purposes, and presents CHAT's research recommendations to address data gaps. CHAT reached consensus on 20 core indicators specific to the health sector, which include 11 impact-level indicators and nine outcome-level indicators that cover the topics of: acute conditions and prevention; health promotion and child development; and chronic conditions, disabilities, injuries, and violence against children. An additional six indicators (three impact and three outcome) that capture information on child health issues such as malaria and HIV are recommended; however, these indicators are only relevant to high-burden regions. CHAT's four research priorities will require investments in health information systems and measurement activities. These investments will help to increase data on children aged 5-9 years; develop standard metadata and data collection processes to enable cross-country comparisons and progress assessments over time; reach a global consensus on essential interventions and associated indicators for monitoring emerging priority areas such as child development, chronic conditions, disabilities, and injuries; and implement strategies to increase the uptake of data on child health to improve evidence-based planning, programming, and advocacy efforts.",

        "abstract": "Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films remains the reference standard for malaria parasite detection and quantification, but is undermined by difficulties in ensuring high-quality manual reading and inter-reader reliability. Automated parasite detection and quantification may address this issue. A multi-centre, observational study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 at 11 sites to assess the performance of the EasyScan Go, a microscopy device employing machine-learning-based image analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of species detection and parasite density estimation were assessed with expert microscopy as the reference. Intra- and inter-device reliability of the device was also evaluated by comparing results from repeat reads on the same and two different devices. This study has been reported in accordance with the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) checklist. In total, 2250 Giemsa-stained blood films were prepared and read independently by expert microscopists and the EasyScan Go device. The diagnostic sensitivity of EasyScan Go was 91.1% (95% CI 88.9-92.7), and specificity 75.6% (95% CI 73.1-78.0). With good quality slides sensitivity was similar (89.1%, 95%CI 86.2-91.5), but specificity increased to 85.1% (95%CI 82.6-87.4). Sensitivity increased with parasitaemia rising from 57% at < 200 parasite/µL, to ≥ 90% at > 200-200,000 parasite/µL. Species were identified accurately in 93% of Plasmodium falciparum samples (kappa = 0.76, 95% CI 0.69-0.83), and in 92% of Plasmodium vivax samples (kappa = 0.73, 95% CI 0.66-0.80). Parasite density estimates by the EasyScan Go were within ± 25% of the microscopic reference counts in 23% of slides. The performance of the EasyScan Go in parasite detection and species identification accuracy fulfil WHO-TDR Research Malaria Microscopy competence level 2 criteria. In terms of parasite quantification and false positive rate, it meets the level 4 WHO-TDR Research Malaria Microscopy criteria. All performance parameters were significantly affected by slide quality. Further software improvement is required to improve sensitivity at low parasitaemia and parasite density estimations.

        "abstract": "In rural areas of South and Southeast Asia malaria is declining but febrile illnesses still account for substantial morbidity and mortality. Village health workers (VHWs) are often the first point of contact with the formal health system, and for patients with febrile illnesses they can provide early diagnosis and treatment of malaria. However, for the majority of febrile patients, VHWs lack the training, support and resources to provide further care. Consequently, treatable bacterial illnesses are missed, antibiotics are overused and poorly targeted, and patient attendance wanes along with declining malaria. This <i>Open Letter</i> announces the start of a new initiative, the Rural Febrile Illness (RFI) project, the first in a series of projects to be implemented as part of the South and Southeast Asian Community-based Trials Network (SEACTN) research programme. This multi-country, multi-site project will run in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar. It will define the epidemiological baseline of febrile illness in nine remote and underserved areas of Asia where malaria endemicity is declining and access to health services is limited. The RFI project aims to determine the incidence, causes and outcomes of febrile illness; understand the opportunities, barriers and appetite for adjustment of the role of VHWs to include management of non-malarial febrile illnesses; and establish a network of community healthcare providers and facilities capable of implementing interventions designed to triage, diagnose and treat patients presenting with febrile illnesses within these communities in the future.",

The device can only be considered for routine care if precision of the assay is high. Commercial lyophilised controls (ACS Analytics, USA) with high, intermediate, and low G6PD activities were assessed 20 times on 10 Biosensor devices and compared to spectrophotometry (Pointe Scientific, USA). Each device was then dispatched to one of 10 different laboratories with a standard set of the controls. Each control was tested 40 times at each laboratory by a single user and compared to spectrophotometry results. When tested at one site, the mean coefficient of variation (CV) was 0.111, 0.172 and 0.260 for high, intermediate, and low controls across all devices respectively; combined G6PD Biosensor readings correlated well with spectrophotometry (rs = 0.859, p<0.001). When tested in different laboratories, correlation was lower (rs = 0.604, p<0.001) and G6PD activity determined by Biosensor for the low and intermediate controls overlapped. The use of lyophilised human blood samples rather than fresh blood may have affected these findings. Biosensor G6PD readings between sites did not differ significantly (p = 0.436), whereas spectrophotometry readings differed markedly between sites (p<0.001). Repeatability and inter-laboratory reproducibility of the Biosensor were good; though the device did not reliably discriminate between intermediate and low G6PD activities of the lyophilized specimens. Clinical studies are now required to assess the devices performance in practice.",

        "abstract": "The private sector plays a large role in malaria treatment provision in Nigeria. To improve access to, and affordability of, quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (QA-ACT) within this sector, the Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria began operations in 2010 and transitioned to a private sector co-payment mechanism (PSCM) until 2017. To assess the impact of the scheme on the ACT market, cross-sectional household and outlet surveys were conducted in 2018 to coincide with the final stockages of ACT medicines procured under the PSCM. An outlet survey was conducted targeting private pharmacies and Proprietary and Patent Medicine Vendors (PPMVs) across different regions of Nigeria to assess supply-side market factors related to availability and cost of anti-malarials, including artemisinin-based combinations subsidised under the PSCM (called green leaf ACT on account of their green leaf logo) and those not subsidised (non-green leaf ACT). A concurrent household survey was conducted to determine demand-side factors related to treatment-seeking practices, ACT brand preference and purchase decision. Data were compared with previous ACTWatch surveys to consider change over time. Availability of artemisinin-based combinations increased significantly over the PSCM period and was almost universal by the time of the 2018 market survey. This increase was seen particularly among PPMVs. While the cost of green leaf ACT remained relatively stable over time, the cost of non-green leaf ACT reduced significantly so that by 2018 they had equivalent affordability. Unsubsidised brands were also available in different formulations and dosages, with double-strength artemisinin-based combination reported as the most frequently purchased dosage type, and child artemisinin-based combinations popular in suspension and dispersible forms (forms not subsidised by the PSCM). The PSCM had a clear impact on increasing not only the reach of subsidized QA brands, but also of non-subsidised brands. Increased market competition led to innovation from unsubsidised brands and large reductions in costs to make them competitive with subsidised brands. Concerns are drawn from the large market share that non-QA brands have managed to gain as well as the continued market share of oral artemisinin monotherapies. Continued monitoring of the market is recommended, along with improved local capacity for QA-certification and monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Emerging resistance to artemisinin drugs threatens the elimination of malaria. Resistance is widespread in South East Asia (SEA) and Myanmar. Neighboring Bangladesh, where 90% of infections occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs), lacks recent assessment. We undertook a prospective study in the sole district-level hospital in Bandarban, a CHT district with low population densities but 60% of reported malaria cases. Thirty patients presented with malaria in 2018. An increase to 68 patients in 2019 correlated with the district-level rise in malaria, rainfall, humidity, and temperature. Twenty-four patients (7 in 2018 and 17 in 2019) with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection were assessed for clearing parasites after starting artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). The median (range) time to clear half of the initial parasites was 5.6 (1.5 to 9.6) h, with 20% of patients showing a median of 8 h. There was no correlation between parasite clearance and initial parasitemia, blood cell counts, or mutations of P. falciparum gene <i>Pfkelch13</i> (the molecular marker of artemisinin resistance [AR]). The <i>in vitro</i> ring-stage survival assay (RSA) revealed one (of four) culture-adapted strains with a quantifiable resistance of 2.01% ± 0.1% (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]). Regression analyses of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> measurements of the four CHT strains and WHO-validated K13 resistance mutations yielded good correlation (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.7; ρ = 0.9, <i>P</i> < 0.005), strengthening evaluation of emerging AR with small sample sizes, a challenge in many low/moderate-prevalence sites. There is an urgent need to deploy multiple, complementary approaches to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the emergence of P. falciparum resistant to artemisinin derivatives in countries where malaria is endemic. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Malaria elimination is a Millennium Development Goal. Artemisinins, fast-acting antimalarial drugs, have played a key role in malaria elimination. Emergence of artemisinin resistance threatens the global elimination of malaria. Over the last decade, advanced clinical and laboratory methods have documented its spread throughout South East Asia and Myanmar. Neighboring Bangladesh lies in the historical path of dissemination of antimalarial resistance to the rest of the world, yet it has not been evaluated by combinations of leading methods, particularly in the highland Chittagong Hill Tracts adjacent to Myanmar which contain >90% of malaria in Bangladesh. We show the first establishment of capacity to assess clinical artemisinin resistance directly in patients in the hilltops and laboratory adaptation of Bangladeshi parasite strains from a remote, sparsely populated malaria frontier that is responsive to climate. Our study also provides a generalized model for comprehensive monitoring of drug resistance for countries where malaria is endemic.",

Several vaccines have obtained 'emergency approval ', but difficulties are being faced in the even distribution of vaccines amongst high- and low- income countries . On top of it, comorbidities associated with COVID -19 like diabetes, hypertension and malaria can seriously impede the treatment of the main disease, thus increasing the fatality rate . This is more so in the context of sub -Saharan African and south Asian countries . Our objective was to demonstrate that a single plant containing different phytoconstituents may be used for treatment of COVID -19 and comorbidities . Towards initial selection of a plant, existing scientific literature was scanned for reported relevant traditional uses, phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of a number of plants and their phytoconstituents pertaining to treatment of COVID-19 symptoms and comorbidities. Molecular docking studies were then performed with phytochemicals of the selected plant and SARS-CoV-2 components - Mpro, and spike protein receptor binding domain and hACE2 interface using AutoDock V ina. We showed that crude extracts of an indigenous African plant, Costus afer having traditional antidiabetic and antimalarial uses, has phytochemicals with high binding affinities for Mpro, and /or spike protein receptor binding domain and hACE2 interface; the various phytochemicals with predicted high binding energies include aferoside C, dibutyl phthalate, nerolidol, suginal, and ± -terpinene, making them potential therapeutics for COVID -19. The results suggest that crude extracts and phytochemicals of C. afer can function as a treatment modality for COVID -19 and comorbidities like especially diabetes and malaria .",

        "abstract": "In many countries, the fruit of betel (<i>Piper betle</i> Linn) is traditionally used as medicine for treating malaria. It is a fatal disease, and existing medications are rapidly losing potency, necessitating the development of innovative pharmaceutics. The current study attempted to determine the compounds in the n-hexane fraction of betel fruit extract and investigate the potential inhibition of bioactive compounds against aspartic protease plasmepsin 1 (PDB ID: 3QS1) and plasmepsin 2 (PDB ID: 1LEE) of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> using a computational approach. The ethanol extract was fractionated into n-hexane and further analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to obtain information regarding the compounds contained in betel fruit. Each compound's potential antimalarial activity was evaluated using AutoDock Vina and compared to artemisinin, an antimalarial drug. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) were performed to evaluate the stability of the interaction between the ligand and receptors. Results detected 20 probable compounds in the n-hexane extract of betel fruit based on GC-MS analysis. The docking study revealed that androstan-17-one,3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5 alpha)- has the highest binding affinity for plasmepsin 1 and plasmepsin 2. The compound exhibits a similar interaction with artemisinin at the active site of the receptors. The compound does not violate Lipinski's rules of five. It belongs to class 5 toxicity with an LD<sub>50</sub> of 3000 mg/kg. MDS results showed stable interactions between the compound and the receptors. Our study concluded that androstan-17-one,3-ethyl-3-hydroxy-, (5 alpha)- from betel fruit has the potential to be further investigated as a potential inhibitor of the aspartic protease plasmepsin 1 and plasmepsin 2 of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>.",

To date research suggests that natural products may become a potential therapeutic option for their prodigious anti-viral or anti-microbial effects on infectious diseases. TQ, a natural phytochemical from black seeds, is known for its health-beneficial activities against several diseases, including infections. It is evident from different <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies that TQ is effective against tuberculosis, influenza, dengue, Ebola, Zika, hepatitis, malaria, HIV, and even recent pandemics caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). In these cases, the molecular mechanism of TQ is partly clear but mostly obscure. In this review article, we have discussed the role of TQ against different infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and also critically reviewed the future use of TQ use to fight against infectious diseases.",

With a concurrent COVID-19 pandemic, economic complications, and overlap of symptoms between both diseases, these challenges are complex, but not unfamiliar. Organizations such as Médecins Sans Frontières have carried out spraying campaigns, and the government is actively mitigating efforts to handle the pandemic.

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar is a vector borne protozoan infection caused by Leishmania donovani in the Indian subcontinent mainly India, Nepal and Bangladesh. It is a major public health problem in these countries mostly affecting the socio-economically poor population. Leishmaniasis ranks the third most important disease after malaria and filariasis but is still considered as one of the neglected tropical diseases of the world. For development of better therapeutic agents and effective vaccine against VL, there is a need to understand host immunological changes that play a vital role during course of infection. Therefore, we investigated the role of Th17 pathway in Balb/c mice during Leishmania donovani infection and treatment with amphotericin B. Mice were divided in four groups i.e. Control, Infected, Uninfected treated and Infected treated. The cytokine levels were estimated in the spleen of Balb/c mice on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35, 45 and 60 post infection and during course of treatment. The mRNA levels of the Th17 pathway during active Leishmania donovani infection and after treatment were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein levels by flow cytometry and ELISA. Results of our study revealed that active infection was associated with low levels of Th17 cytokines IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 and elevated levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TGF-β. Amphotericin B treatment restored production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-22. The levels of transcription factor RORγt were found to correlate with the levels of IL-17 during infection and also after chemotherapy whereas STAT3 levels were elevated during infection and vice versa after treatment. The findings of this study suggest that Th17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 are associated with protection against VL infection and development of any interventions or chemotherapeutic agents targeting Th17 pathway could be an important approach for VL treatment.",

        "abstract": "This is the concluding paper of our 11-paper supplement, \"Community health workers at the dawn of a new era\". We relied on our collective experience, an extensive body of literature about community health workers (CHWs), and the other papers in this supplement to identify the most pressing challenges facing CHW programmes and approaches for strengthening CHW programmes. CHWs are increasingly being recognized as a critical resource for achieving national and global health goals. These goals include achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals of Universal Health Coverage, ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and making a major contribution to the control of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and noncommunicable diseases. CHWs can also play a critical role in responding to current and future pandemics. For these reasons, we argue that CHWs are now at the dawn of a new era. While CHW programmes have long been an underfunded afterthought, they are now front and centre as the emerging foundation of health systems. Despite this increased attention, CHW programmes continue to face the same pressing challenges: inadequate financing, lack of supplies and commodities, low compensation of CHWs, and inadequate supervision. We outline approaches for strengthening CHW programmes, arguing that their enormous potential will only be realized when investment and health system support matches rhetoric. Rigorous monitoring, evaluation, and implementation research are also needed to enable CHW programmes to continuously improve their quality and effectiveness. A marked increase in sustainable funding for CHW programmes is needed, and this will require increased domestic political support for prioritizing CHW programmes as economies grow and additional health-related funding becomes available. The paradigm shift called for here will be an important step in accelerating progress in achieving current global health goals and in reaching the goal of Health for All.",

        "abstract": "Access to and utilization of health services have remained major challenges for people living in low- and middle-income countries, especially for those living in impaired public health environment such as refugee camps and temporary settlements. This study presents health problems and utilization of health services among Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs) living in the southern part of Bangladesh. A mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) approach was used. Altogether 999 household surveys were conducted among the FDMNs living in makeshift/temporary settlements and host communities. We used a grounded theory approach involving in-depth interviews (IDIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews (KIIs) including 24 IDIs, 10 FGDs, and 9 KIIs. The quantitative data were analysed with STATA. The common health problems among the women were pregnancy and childbirth-related complications and violence against women. Among the children, fever, diarrhoea, common cold and malaria were frequently observed health problems. Poor general health, HIV/AIDS, insecurity, discrimination, and lack of employment opportunity were common problems for men. Further, 61.2% women received two or more antenatal care (ANC) visits during their last pregnancy, while 28.9% did not receive any ANC visit. The majority of the last births took place at home (85.2%) assisted by traditional birth attendants (78.9%), a third (29.3%) of whom suffered pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications. The clinics run by the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (76.9%) and private health facilities (86.0%) were the most accessible places for seeking healthcare for the FDMNs living in the makeshift settlements. All participants heard about HIV/AIDS. 78.0% of them were unaware about the means of HIV transmission, and family planning methods were poorly used (45.2%). Overall, the health of FDMNs living in the southern part of Bangladesh is poor and they have inadequate access to and utilization of health services to address the health problems and associated factors. Existing essential health and nutrition support programs need to be culturally appropriate and adopt an integrated approach to encourage men's participation to improve utilization of health and family planning services, address issues of gender inequity, gender-based violence, and improve women empowerment and overall health outcomes.",

We analysed Service Provision Assessments (SPAs) from ten low-income and middle-income countries to benchmark diagnostic availability. Diagnostic availabilities were determined for Bangladesh, Haiti, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda, with multiple timepoints for Haiti, Kenya, Senegal, and Tanzania. A smaller set of diagnostics were included in the analysis for primary care facilities compared with those expected at hospitals, with 16 evaluated in total. Surveys spanned 2004-18, including 8512 surveyed facilities. Country-specific facility types were mapped to basic primary care, advanced primary care, or hospital tiers. We calculated percentages of facilities offering each diagnostic, accounting for facility weights, stratifying by tier, and for some analyses, region. The tier-level estimate of diagnostic availability was defined as the median of all diagnostic-specific availabilities at each tier, and country-level estimates were the median of all diagnostic-specific availabilities of each of the tiers. Associations of country-level diagnostic availability with country income as well as (within-country) region-level availability with region-specific population densities were determined by multivariable linear regression, controlling for appropriate covariates including tier. Median availability of diagnostics was 19·1% in basic primary care facilities, 49·2% in advanced primary care facilities, and 68·4% in hospitals. Availability varied considerably between diagnostics, ranging from 1·2% (ultrasound) to 76·7% (malaria) in primary care (basic and advanced) and from 6·1% (CT scan) to 91·6% (malaria) in hospitals. Availability also varied between countries, from 14·9% (Bangladesh) to 89·6% (Namibia). Availability correlated positively with log(income) at both primary care tiers but not the hospital tier, and positively with region-specific population density at the basic primary care tier only. Major gaps in diagnostic availability exist in many low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in primary care facilities. These results can serve as a benchmark to gauge progress towards implementing guidelines such as the WHO Essential Diagnostics List and Priority Medical Devices initiatives.

        "title": "Postmortem investigations and identification of multiple causes of child deaths: An analysis of findings from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network.",
        "abstract": "The current burden of >5 million deaths yearly is the focus of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years old by 2030. To accelerate progression toward this goal, data are needed that accurately quantify the leading causes of death, so that interventions can target the common causes. By adding postmortem pathology and microbiology studies to other available data, the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network provides comprehensive evaluations of conditions leading to death, in contrast to standard methods that rely on data from medical records and verbal autopsy and report only a single underlying condition. We analyzed CHAMPS data to characterize the value of considering multiple causes of death. We examined deaths identified from December 2016 through November 2020 from 7 CHAMPS sites (in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa), including 741 neonatal, 278 infant, and 241 child <5 years deaths for which results from Determination of Cause of Death (DeCoDe) panels were complete. DeCoDe panelists included all conditions in the causal chain according to the ICD-10 guidelines and assessed if prevention or effective management of the condition would have prevented the death. We analyzed the distribution of all conditions listed as causal, including underlying, antecedent, and immediate causes of death. Among 1,232 deaths with an underlying condition determined, we found a range of 0 to 6 (mean 1.5, IQR 0 to 2) additional conditions in the causal chain leading to death. While pathology provides very helpful clues, we cannot always be certain that conditions identified led to death or occurred in an agonal stage of death. For neonates, preterm birth complications (most commonly respiratory distress syndrome) were the most common underlying condition (n = 282, 38%); among those with preterm birth complications, 256 (91%) had additional conditions in causal chains, including 184 (65%) with a different preterm birth complication, 128 (45%) with neonatal sepsis, 69 (24%) with lower respiratory infection (LRI), 60 (21%) with meningitis, and 25 (9%) with perinatal asphyxia/hypoxia. Of the 278 infant deaths, 212 (79%) had ≥1 additional cause of death (CoD) beyond the underlying cause. The 2 most common underlying conditions in infants were malnutrition and congenital birth defects; LRI and sepsis were the most common additional conditions in causal chains, each accounting for approximately half of deaths with either underlying condition. Of the 241 child deaths, 178 (75%) had ≥1 additional condition. Among 46 child deaths with malnutrition as the underlying condition, all had ≥1 other condition in the causal chain, most commonly sepsis, followed by LRI, malaria, and diarrheal disease. Including all positions in the causal chain for neonatal deaths resulted in 19-fold and 11-fold increases in attributable roles for meningitis and LRI, respectively. For infant deaths, the proportion caused by meningitis and sepsis increased by 16-fold and 11-fold, respectively; for child deaths, sepsis and LRI are increased 12-fold and 10-fold, respectively. While comprehensive CoD determinations were done for a substantial number of deaths, there is potential for bias regarding which deaths in surveillance areas underwent minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), potentially reducing representativeness of findings. Including conditions that appear anywhere in the causal chain, rather than considering underlying condition alone, markedly changed the proportion of deaths attributed to various diagnoses, especially LRI, sepsis, and meningitis. While CHAMPS methods cannot determine when 2 conditions cause death independently or may be synergistic, our findings suggest that considering the chain of events leading to death can better guide research and prevention priorities aimed at reducing child deaths.",

        "abstract": "Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) were designed to provide multiple micronutrients within a food base that also provides energy, protein, and essential fatty acids, targeted towards preventing malnutrition in vulnerable populations. Previous meta-analyses demonstrated beneficial effects of SQ-LNSs on child growth, anemia, and mortality. To further examine the efficacy and effectiveness of SQ-LNSs, and explore study-level and individual-level effect modifiers, we conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided to children 6-24 mo of age (n > 37,000). We examined growth, development, anemia, and micronutrient status outcomes. Children who received SQ-LNSs had a 12-14% lower prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight; were 16-19% less likely to score in the lowest decile for language, social-emotional, and motor development; had a 16% lower prevalence of anemia; and had a 64% lower prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia compared with control group children. For most outcomes, beneficial effects of SQ-LNSs were evident regardless of study-level characteristics, including region, stunting burden, malaria prevalence, sanitation, water quality, duration of supplementation, frequency of contact, or average reported compliance with SQ-LNSs. For development, the benefits of SQ-LNSs were greater in populations with higher stunting burden, in households with lower socioeconomic status, and among acutely malnourished children. For hemoglobin and iron status, benefits were greater in populations with higher anemia prevalence and among acutely malnourished children, respectively. Thus, targeting based on potential to benefit may be worthwhile for those outcomes. Overall, co-packaging SQ-LNSs with interventions that reduce constraints on response, such as the prevention and control of prenatal and child infections, improving health care access, and promotion of early child development, may lead to greater impact. Policymakers and program planners should consider including SQ-LNSs in strategies to reduce child mortality, stunting, wasting, anemia, iron deficiency, and delayed development.

        "abstract": "Meta-analyses show that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) reduce child stunting and wasting. Identification of subgroups who benefit most from SQ-LNSs may facilitate program design. We aimed to identify study-level and individual-level modifiers of the effect of SQ-LNSs on child growth outcomes. We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided to children 6-24 mo of age (n = 37,066). We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with control and pooled the estimates using fixed-effects models. We used random-effects meta-regression to examine study-level effect modifiers. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether results differed depending on study arm inclusion criteria and types of comparisons. SQ-LNS provision decreased stunting (length-for-age z score < -2) by 12% (relative reduction), wasting [weight-for-length (WLZ) z score < -2] by 14%, low midupper arm circumference (MUAC) (<125 mm or MUAC-for-age z score < -2) by 18%, acute malnutrition (WLZ < -2 or MUAC < 125 mm) by 14%, underweight (weight-for-age z score < -2) by 13%, and small head size (head circumference-for-age z score < -2) by 9%. Effects of SQ-LNSs generally did not differ by study-level characteristics including region, stunting burden, malaria prevalence, sanitation, water quality, duration of supplementation, frequency of contact, or average compliance with SQ-LNS. Effects of SQ-LNSs on stunting, wasting, low MUAC, and small head size were greater among girls than among boys; effects on stunting, underweight, and low MUAC were greater among later-born (than among firstborn) children; and effects on wasting and acute malnutrition were greater among children in households with improved (as opposed to unimproved) sanitation. The positive impact of SQ-LNSs on growth is apparent across a variety of study-level contexts. Policy-makers and program planners should consider including SQ-LNSs in packages of interventions to prevent both stunting and wasting.This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO as CRD42019146592.",

There are no effective drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of most of these diseases, so the primary option for disease prevention and control is to target mosquitoes, often using insecticides. Despite vector control efforts, cases of arboviral diseases are increasing in Bangladesh and it is important to understand if this escalation is associated with the presence of insecticide resistance in Aedes populations, including Ae. albopictus. The CDC bottle bioassays performed on Ae. albopictus from two districts in Bangladesh detected resistance to permethrin but susceptibility to deltamethrin, malathion, and bendiocarb. The detection of permethrin resistance is worrisome, since arbovirus vector control strategies in Bangladesh currently include the use of permethrin. Routine monitoring of the susceptibility status of key vector populations in Bangladesh will allow a better understanding of resistance trends, enabling the strengthening of control strategies.",

        "abstract": "With the recent developments in deep learning, automatic cell segmentation from images of microscopic examination slides seems to be a solved problem as recent methods have achieved comparable results on existing benchmark datasets. However, most of the existing cell segmentation benchmark datasets either contain a single cell type, few instances of the cells, not publicly available. Therefore, it is unclear whether the performance improvements can generalize on more diverse datasets. In this paper, we present a large and diverse cell segmentation dataset BBBC041Seg<sup>1</sup>, which consists both of uninfected cells (i.e., red blood cells/RBCs, leukocytes) and infected cells (i.e., gametocytes, rings, trophozoites, and schizonts). Additionally, all cell types do not have equal instances, which encourages researchers to develop algorithms for learning from imbalanced classes in a few shot learning paradigm. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative study using both classical rule-based and recent deep learning state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for automatic cell segmentation and provide them as strong baselines. We believe the introduction of BBBC041Seg will promote future research towards clinically applicable cell segmentation methods from microscopic examinations, which can be later used for downstream tasks such as detecting hematological diseases (i.e., malaria).",

Koenig is traditionally used to treat various diseases including diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, fever, malaria, and viral infections, among others. To summarize critically the taxonomy, ethnomedicinal, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activities of <i>X. granatum</i>, information was collected from different databases. An up-to-date search (till June 2020) was carried out with the help of various scientific web resources from databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and various patent offices (e.g., WIPO, CIPO, and USPTO) using the keywords \"<i>Xylocarpus granatum</i>\" and then paired with ethnomedicinal use and phytochemical, phytochemistry, and pharmacological activity (<i>in vitro, ex vivo</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> studies). Findings revealed that seeds, fruits, stem bark, leaf, and twigs of <i>X. granatum</i> exhibited a wide range of key phytochemicals including limonoids, phragmalin, limonoid-based alkaloids, mexicanolides, protolimonoids, flavonols, and lactones. The plant possessed potent antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antimalarial, antifeedant, and neuroprotective activities. No clinical studies have been reported in the databases. Ethnomedicinal assessment indicated the application of <i>X. granatum</i> in various fields of medical science specially to treat various human ailments, and this was attributed to the presence of enormous alkaloids as confirmed by pharmacological studies. However, to understand the mechanism of action in-depth studies are required. In view of these findings, more research is necessary to explore and characterize the chemical compounds and toxicological aspects of this medicinal mangrove plant. Overall, it can be stated that <i>X. granatum</i> may be one of the hopeful medicinal herbs for the treatment of various diseases in human beings.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading causes of death globally. In Kenya, the number of deaths resulting from NCDs is projected to surpass malaria and tuberculosis by 2030. Studies in Kenya show increasing NCDs; the aim of the present study is to examine the clustering of NCDs and risk factors in Kenya. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the 2015 Kenya STEPwise Survey. This study examined relationships between NCDs (e.g. obesity, hypertension and diabetes) and health behaviours (e.g. sedentary activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption). Survey probability weights, which estimated the sampling design effect, were applied to consider the sampling units, and stratifications were used during sampling so that the results could be generalisable to the national adult Kenyan population. In total, 4350 adults were included in the study sample. Overall, 24.43% of participants were classified as having hypertension, 1.88% as having type 2 diabetes, and 27.94% were classified as being overweight or obese. The best-fit model was a four-class solution. Class 1 is best described as 'young with high NCD risk' and had the highest sedentary activity. Class 2 is best described as 'poor rural with lower NCD risk' with a high chance of smoking and alcohol consumption. Class 3 is best described as 'rural with high NCD risk' and had the highest fruit and vegetable consumption. Class 4 is best described as 'wealthy young urban dwellers with high NCD risk' with a high chance of alcohol consumption and smoking. Individuals in Class 4 had the highest chance (40%) of being overweight/obese, a 2% chance of type 2 diabetes and a 23% chance of having hypertension. NCDs are clustered in groups with high-risk behaviours. The group with the highest chance of having NCDs also had the highest chance of engaging in high-risk behaviours. The findings of this study suggest that smoking and alcohol consumption increase NCD risk in rural areas. Tailored and targeted interventions are needed to curb the increasing NCD prevalence in Kenya.",

The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is a vast expanse encompassing 18% of the world's mountainous area. Sprawling over 4.3 million km<sup>2</sup>, the HKH region occupies areas of eight countries namely Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan. The HKH region is warming at a rate higher than the global average and precipitation has also increased significantly over the last 6 decades along with increased frequency and intensity of some extreme events. Changes in temperature and precipitation have affected and will like to affect the climate-dependent sectors such as hydrology, agriculture, biodiversity, and human health. This paper aims to document how climate change has impacted and will impact, health and well-being of the people in the HKH region and offers adaptation and mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of climate change on health and well-being of the people. In the HKH region, climate change boosts infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), malnutrition, and injuries. Hence, climate change adaptation and mitigation measures are needed urgently to safeguard vulnerable populations residing in the HKH region.",

We have developed GenRe-Mekong, a platform for genetic surveillance of malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) that enables NMCPs to implement large-scale surveillance projects by integrating simple sample collection procedures in routine public health procedures. Samples from symptomatic patients are processed by SpotMalaria, a high-throughput system that produces a comprehensive set of genotypes comprising several drug resistance markers, species markers and a genomic barcode. GenRe-Mekong delivers Genetic Report Cards, a compendium of genotypes and phenotype predictions used to map prevalence of resistance to multiple drugs. GenRe-Mekong has worked with NMCPs and research projects in eight countries, processing 9623 samples from clinical cases. Monitoring resistance markers has been valuable for tracking the rapid spread of parasites resistant to the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination therapy. In Vietnam and Laos, GenRe-Mekong data have provided novel knowledge about the spread of these resistant strains into previously unaffected provinces, informing decision-making by NMCPs. GenRe-Mekong provides detailed knowledge about drug resistance at a local level, and facilitates data sharing at a regional level, enabling cross-border resistance monitoring and providing the public health community with valuable insights. The project provides a rich open data resource to benefit the entire malaria community. The GenRe-Mekong project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP11188166, OPP1204268).

Here we describe a new release of curated genome variation data on 7,000 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> samples from MalariaGEN partner studies in 28 malaria-endemic countries. High-quality genotype calls on 3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short indels were produced using a standardised analysis pipeline. Copy number variants associated with drug resistance and structural variants that cause failure of rapid diagnostic tests were also analysed.  Almost all samples showed genetic evidence of resistance to at least one antimalarial drug, and some samples from Southeast Asia carried markers of resistance to six commonly-used drugs. Genes expressed during the mosquito stage of the parasite life-cycle are prominent among loci that show strong geographic differentiation. By continuing to enlarge this open data resource we aim to facilitate research into the evolutionary processes affecting malaria control and to accelerate development of the surveillance toolkit required for malaria elimination.",

        "abstract": "<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>'s resistance to available antimalarial drugs highlights the need for the development of novel drugs. Pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis is a validated drug target for the prevention and treatment of malaria infection. <i>P. falciparum</i> dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate and utilize ubiquinone as an electron acceptor in the fourth step of pyrimidine de novo biosynthesis. PfDHODH is targeted by the inhibitor DSM265, which binds to a hydrophobic pocket located at the N-terminus where ubiquinone binds, which is known to be structurally divergent from the mammalian orthologue. In this study, we screened 40,400 compounds from the Kyoto University chemical library against recombinant PfDHODH.

It is unknown, however, if quitting smoking during the 6 months of TB treatment improves TB outcomes. The TB & Tobacco Trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of cytisine for smoking cessation in 2472 patients with pulmonary TB in Bangladesh and Pakistan. In a secondary analysis, we investigated the hypothesis that smoking cessation improves health outcomes in patients during the TB treatment course. The outcomes included an eight-point TB clinical score, sputum conversion rates, chest X-ray grades, quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), TB cure <i>plus</i> treatment completion rates and relapse rates. These were compared between those who stopped smoking and those who did not, using regression analysis. We analysed the data of 2273 (92%) trial participants. Overall, 25% (577/2273) of participants stopped smoking. Compared with non-quitters, those who quit had better TB cure <i>plus</i> treatment completion rates (91% vs 80%, p<0.001) and lower TB relapse rates (6% vs 14%, p<0.001). Among quitters, a higher sputum conversion rate at week 9 (91% vs 87%, p=0.036), lower mean TB clinical scores (-0.20 points, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.08, p=0.001) and slightly better quality of life (mean EQ-5D-5L 0.86 vs 0.85, p=0.015) at 6 months were also observed. These differences, except quality of life, remained statistically significant after adjusting for baseline values, trial arm and TB treatment adherence rates. Patients with TB who stop smoking may have better outcomes than those who don't. Health professionals should support patients in stopping smoking.",

        "abstract": "India is a malaria endemic country which is targeting malaria elimination by 2027. Transmission intensities are low-to-moderate depending on the region supported by multiple disease vectors. Among these, comparatively North-East India contributes to high proportions of malaria cases annually, the majority of which are due to Plasmodium falciparum (90%). Anopheles minimus and An. baimaii (sibling species in the An. dirus complex) are widely prevalent and incriminated as vectors of malaria. Number of intervention tools were field-evaluated beginning 1988 to date against disease vectors and causative parasites to contain the spread of malaria. These included (i) insecticide-treated netting materials (ITNs) for vector control, (ii) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for in situ diagnosis, and (iii) therapeutic efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for improved drug-policy; all of which were incorporated in healthcare services resulting in substantial disease transmission reduction. Populations of both An. minimus and An. baimaii were observed depleting, instead An. culicifacies s.l. recorded to be fast invading degraded forests and assessed to be resistant to multiple insecticides. Of the two prevalent Plasmodium species, while P. vivax continued to be susceptible to chloroquine therapy, P. falciparum had emerged resistant to most available antimalarial drugs except ACTs over space and time and spreading to peninsular India threatening elimination efforts. Disease transmission trends were observed to be declining for which the state of Assam has made huge strides reporting steady fall in cases each passing year vis-à-vis Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura (all sharing international border with Bangladesh), in which malaria transmission remained uninterrupted. Consequently, control of malaria in the North-East region of India is of immediate importance and needs prioritization for intensified disease surveillance and control interventions coupled with improved access to healthcare services mitigating risk of disease outbreaks and spread of drug-resistant malaria helping realize the goal of malaria elimination in the country.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a high priority across countries as it increases morbidity, mortality and costs. Concerns with AMR have resulted in multiple initiatives internationally, nationally and regionally to enhance appropriate antibiotic utilization across sectors to reduce AMR, with the overuse of antibiotics exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Effectively tackling AMR is crucial for all countries. Principally a narrative review of ongoing activities across sectors was undertaken to improve antimicrobial use and address issues with vaccines including COVID-19. Point prevalence surveys have been successful in hospitals to identify areas for quality improvement programs, principally centering on antimicrobial stewardship programs. These include reducing prolonged antibiotic use to prevent surgical site infections. Multiple activities centering on education have been successful in reducing inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials in ambulatory care for essentially viral infections such as acute respiratory infections. It is imperative to develop new quality indicators for ambulatory care given current concerns, and instigate programs with clear public health messaging to reduce misinformation, essential for pandemics. Regular access to effective treatments is needed to reduce resistance to treatments for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. Key stakeholder groups can instigate multiple initiatives to reduce AMR.

However, synthesizing medical images using CycleGAN can lead to misdiagnosis of a medical condition as it might hallucinate unwanted features, especially if theres a data bias. This can potentially change the original class of the input image, which is a very serious problem. In this paper, we have introduced a modified distribution matching loss for CycleGAN to eliminate feature hallucination on the malaria dataset. In the context of the malaria dataset, unintentional feature hallucination may introduce a facet that resembles a parasite or remove the parasite after the translation. Our proposed approach has enabled us to shift the domain of the malaria dataset without the risk of changing their corresponding class. We have presented experimental evidence that our modified loss significantly reduced feature hallucination by preserving original class labels. The experimental results are better in comparison to the baseline (classic CycleGAN) that targets the translating domain. We believe that our approach will expedite the process of developing unsupervised unpaired GAN that is safe for clinical use.",

        "title": "Implementing radical cure diagnostics for malaria: user perspectives on G6PD testing in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The radical cure of Plasmodium vivax requires treatment with an 8-aminoquinoline drug, such as primaquine and tafenoquine, to eradicate liver hypnozoite stages, which can reactivate to cause relapsing infections. Safe treatment regimens require prior screening of patients for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency to avoid potential life-threatening drug induced haemolysis. Testing is rarely available in malaria endemic countries, but will be needed to support routine use of radical cure. This study investigates end-user perspectives in Bangladesh on the introduction of a quantitative G6PD test (SD Biosensor STANDARD™ G6PD analyser) to support malaria elimination. The perspectives of users on the SD Biosensor test were analysed using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with health care providers and malaria programme officers in Bangladesh. Key emerging themes regarding the feasibility of introducing this test into routine practice, including perceived barriers, were analysed. In total 63 participants were interviewed. Participants emphasized the life-saving potential of the biosensor, but raised concerns including the impact of limited staff time, high workload and some technical aspects of the device. Participants highlighted that there are both too few and too many P. vivax patients to implement G6PD testing owing to challenges of funding, workload and complex testing infrastructure. Implementing the biosensor would require flexibility and improvisation to deal with remote sites, overcoming a low index of suspicion and mutual interplay of declining patient numbers and reluctance to test. This approach would generate new forms of evidence to justify introduction in policy and carefully consider questions of deployment given declining patient numbers. The results of the study show that, in an elimination context, the importance of malaria needs to be maintained for both policy makers and the affected communities, in this case by ensuring P. vivax, PQ treatment, and G6PD deficiency remain visible. Availability of new technologies, such as the biosensor, will fuel ongoing debates about priorities for allocating resources that must be adapted to a constantly evolving target. Technical and logistical concerns regarding the biosensor should be addressed by future product designs, adequate training, strengthened supply chains, and careful planning of communication, advocacy and staff interactions at all health system levels.",

        "abstract": "Successful achievement of global targets for elimination of trachoma as a public health problem and eradication of yaws will require control efforts to reach marginalized populations, including refugees. Testing for serologic evidence of transmission of trachoma and yaws in residents of registered camps and a Makeshift Settlement in Cox's Bazar District, Bangladesh, was added to a serosurvey for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) conducted April-May 2018. The survey was primarily designed to estimate remaining immunity gaps for VPDs, including diphtheria, measles, rubella, and polio. Blood specimens from 1- to 14-year-olds from selected households were collected and tested for antibody responses against antigens from Treponema pallidum and Chlamydia trachomatis using a multiplex bead assay to evaluate for serologic evidence of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) yaws and trachoma, respectively. The prevalence of antibodies against two C. trachomatis antigens in children ranged from 1.4% to 1.5% for Pgp3 and 2.8% to 7.0% for CT694. The prevalence of antibody responses against both of two treponemal antigens (recombinant protein17 and treponemal membrane protein A) tested was 0% to 0.15% in two camps. The data are suggestive of very low or no transmission of trachoma and yaws, currently or previously, in children resident in these communities. This study illustrates how integrated serologic testing can provide needed data to help NTD programs prioritize limited resources.",

The conventional diagnostic PCR is an inexpensive process but consumes a lot of time, reagents and lacks sensitivity. On the other hand, real-time PCR assays currently being used are mostly probe-based expensive methods and sometimes not feasible to detect all the species in a single amplification reaction condition. Here we have established a real-time PCR method that is time and cost effective with a single protocol to detect and distinguish five human <i>Plasmodium</i> species using the existing primers efficiently. The primers used here are being used in the conventional method and the sensitivity as well as specificity of this method has also been immensely improved (100%). The lower limit of detection for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and <i>Plasmodium malariae</i> are 0.064 parasites/µL, 1.6 parasites/µL, and 0.32 parasites/µL respectively and no cross reactivity was observed. Besides, we have analyzed melt curves that can be used for further species confirmation and validation purposes using multiplex systems.

Peripheral parasitemia with Plasmodium spp. induces hemolysis, replacing older RBCs with younger cells with higher G6PD activity. This study aimed to assess whether G6PD activity varies between individuals with and without malaria or a history of malaria. Individuals living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh were enrolled into 3 complementary studies: (i) a prospective, single-arm clinical efficacy trial of patients (n = 175) with uncomplicated malaria done between 2014 and 2015, (ii) a cross-sectional survey done between 2015 and 2016 (n = 999), and (iii) a matched case-control study of aparasitemic individuals with and without a history of malaria done in 2020 (n = 506). G6PD activity was compared between individuals with and without malaria diagnosed by microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in aparasitemic participants with and without a history of malaria. In the cross-sectional survey and clinical trial, 15.5% (182/1,174) of participants had peripheral parasitemia detected by microscopy or RDT, 3.1% (36/1,174) were positive by PCR only, and 81.4% (956/1,174) were aparasitemic. Aparasitemic individuals had significantly lower G6PD activity (median 6.9 U/g Hb, IQR 5.2-8.6) than those with peripheral parasitemia detected by microscopy or RDT (7.9 U/g Hb, IQR 6.6-9.8, p < 0.001), but G6PD activity similar to those with parasitemia detected by PCR alone (submicroscopic parasitemia) (6.1 U/g Hb, IQR 4.8-8.6, p = 0.312). In total, 7.7% (14/182) of patients with malaria had G6PD activity < 70% compared to 25.0% (248/992) of participants with submicroscopic or no parasitemia (odds ratio [OR] 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.44, p < 0.001). In the case-control study, the median G6PD activity was 10.3 U/g Hb (IQR 8.8-12.2) in 253 patients with a history of malaria and 10.2 U/g Hb (IQR 8.7-11.8) in 253 individuals without a history of malaria (p = 0.323). The proportion of individuals with G6PD activity < 70% was 11.5% (29/253) in the cases and 15.4% (39/253) in the controls (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.41-1.23, p = 0.192). Limitations of the study included the non-contemporaneous nature of the clinical trial and cross-sectional survey. Patients with acute malaria had significantly higher G6PD activity than individuals without malaria, and this could not be accounted for by a protective effect of G6PD deficiency. G6PD-deficient patients with malaria may have higher than expected G6PD enzyme activity and an attenuated risk of primaquine-induced hemolysis compared to the risk when not infected.",

In the Indian sub-continent, VL is caused by <i>Leishmania donovani</i> and transmitted <i>via</i> the bite of an infected <i>Phlebotomus argentipes</i> female sand fly, the only competent vector species in the region. The highest disease burden is in the northern part of the Indian sub-continent, especially in the state of Bihar. India, Bangladesh, and Nepal embarked on an initiative, coordinated by World Health Organization, to eliminate VL as a public health problem by the year 2020. The main goal is to reduce VL incidence below one case per 10,000 people through early case-detection, prompt diagnosis and treatment, and reduction of transmission using vector control measures. Indoor residual spraying, a major pillar of the elimination program, is the only vector control strategy used by the government of India. Though India is close to its VL elimination target, important aspects of vector bionomics and sand fly transmission dynamics are yet to be determined. To achieve sustained elimination and to prevent a resurgence of VL, knowledge gaps in vector biology and behavior, and the constraints they may pose to current vector control methods, need to be addressed. Herein, we discuss the successes and failures of previous and current vector-control strategies implemented to combat kala-azar in Bihar, India, and identify gaps in our understanding of vector transmission towards development of innovative tools to ensure sustained vector control in the post-elimination period.",

However, the Kato-Katz technique has shown low sensitivity for the detection of light-intensity infections, and therefore highly sensitive diagnostic tools are urgently required to monitor prevalence of infection in low transmission settings. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate and synthesize the performance of diagnostic tests for detecting Schistosoma japonicum and S. mekongi infection in people living in endemic areas. We comprehensively searched these nine electronic databases and other resources until July 2019, with no language or publication limits: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, HTA, CINAHL PLUS, The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. We included original studies that assessed diagnostic performance using antibody, antigen, and molecular tests with stool examination test as a reference standard. Two reviewers independently extracted a standard set of data and assessed study quality. We estimated the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for each index test. We used diagnostic odds ratio to determine the overall accuracy and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) curve to assess the index tests performance. Fifteen studies (S. japonicum [n = 13] and S. mekongi [n = 2]) testing 15,303 participants were included in the review. Five studies reported performance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), seven studies reported indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), and four studies reported polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detecting S. japonicum. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.84-0.98) and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.29-0.53) for ELISA, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.90-0.99) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58-0.73) for IHA, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71-0.96) and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29-0.69) for PCR respectively. A global summary indicated the best performance for IHA, closely followed by ELISA. We were unable to perform meta-analysis for S. mekongi due to insufficient number of studies. IHA showed the highest detection accuracy for S. japonicum. Further studies are needed to determine the suitable diagnostic methods to verify the absence of transmission of S. mekongi and also to compare detection accuracy against more sensitive reference standards such as PCR.",

        "title": "Global Tuberculosis Report 2020 - Reflections on the Global TB burden, treatment and prevention efforts.",
        "abstract": "The October 2020 Global TB report reviews TB control strategies and United Nations (UN) targets set in the political declaration at the September 2018 UN General Assembly high-level meeting on TB held in New York. Progress in TB care and prevention has been very slow. In 2019, TB remained the most common cause of death from a single infectious pathogen. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2019, and there were an estimated 1.2 million TB deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 208, 000 deaths among people living with HIV. Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%). Only 30% of the 3.5 million five-year target for children treated for TB was met. Major advances have been development of new all oral regimens for MDRTB and new regimens for preventive therapy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dislodged TB from the top infectious disease cause of mortality globally. Notably, global TB control efforts were not on track even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges remain to improve sub-optimal TB treatment and prevention services. Tuberculosis screening and diagnostic test services need to be ramped up. The major drivers of TB remain undernutrition, poverty, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and household air pollution and these need be addressed to achieve the WHO 2035 TB care and prevention targets. National programs need to include interventions for post-tuberculosis holistic wellbeing. From first detection of COVID-19 global coordination and political will with huge financial investments have led to the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV2 infection. The world now needs to similarly focus on development of new vaccines for TB utilizing new technological methods.",

        "title": "Antibiotic practices among household members and their domestic animals within rural communities in Cumilla district, Bangladesh: a cross-sectional survey.",
        "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to human health, and inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals is widely considered to be a key driver of antibiotic resistant infections. Antibiotic use in humans and animals is growing rapidly in low- and, particularly, middle-income countries. However, there is little detailed understanding about practices related to the use of antibiotics in humans and animals within community settings in such countries. Here we aimed to understand the antibiotic practices of rural households across Cumilla district, Bangladesh, in relation to household members and their domestic animals. In 2018 we conducted a cross-sectional survey using representative cluster sampling methods. We collected self-reported information from 682 female and 620 male household heads, with women also asked about their children's antibiotic practices. Only 48% (95% CI: 40, 56%) of women and men had heard of antibiotics, and among those women and men who were aware of antibiotics and the children of those women 70% (95% CI: 64, 76%) reported having previously taken antibiotics, while among these individuals who reported previously taking antibiotics 21% (95% CI: 18, 25%) said they had done so most recently within the last month. Risky/inappropriate antibiotic practices in humans and animals were often reported. For example, among women and men who were aware of antibiotics and the children of those women 52% (95% CI: 40, 63%) reported previously taking antibiotics for a \"cough/cold\", despite antibiotics being typically inappropriate for use against viral upper respiratory tract infections. Among poultry-owning respondents who were aware of antibiotics 11% (95% CI: 8, 15%) reported previously giving healthy poultry antibiotics, mainly for growth/prophylaxis, while among cattle-owning respondents who were aware of antibiotics and reported previously giving their cattle feed 20% (95% CI: 9, 37%) said the feed had contained antibiotics at least sometimes. Our results highlight the need for context-adapted interventions at both the community level and the health systems level to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use among humans and domestic animals in rural Bangladesh. Successfully reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics among humans and animals is a required and critical step in tackling antimicrobial resistance.",

Computer-aided diagnosis of malaria is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of some uninfected and infected class. In this paper, we transform a malaria parasite object detection dataset into a classification dataset, making it the largest malaria classification dataset (63,645 cells), and evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures pretrained on both natural and medical images on this new dataset. We provide detailed insights into the variation of the dataset and qualitative analysis of the results produced by the best models. We also evaluate the models using an independent test set to demonstrate the model's ability to generalize in different domains. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of conditional image synthesis on malaria parasite detection.

        "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum, the prime causative agent of malaria, is responsible for 4, 05,000 deaths per year and fatality rates are higher among the children aged below 5 years. The emerging distribution of the multi-drug resistant P. falciparum becomes a worldwide concern, so the identification of unique targets and novel inhibitors is a prime need now. In the present study, we have employed pharmacoinformatics approaches to analyze 265 lead-like compounds from PubChem databases for virtual screening. Thereafter, 15 lead-like compounds were docked within the active side pocket of importin alpha. Comparative ligand properties and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile were also assessed. Finally, a novel inhibitor was designed and assessed computationally for its efficacy. From the comparative analysis we have found that our screened compounds possess better results than the existing lead ivermectin; having the highest binding energy of -15.6 kcal/mol, whereas ivermectin has -12.4 kcal/mol. The novel lead compound possessed more fascinating output without deviating any of the rules of Lipinski. It also possessed higher bioavailability and the drug-likeness score of 0.55 and 0.71, respectively compared to ivermectin. Furthermore, the binding study was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation over 25 ns by evaluating the stability of the complex. Finally, all the screened compounds and the novel compound showed promising ADMET properties likewise. To end, we hope that our proposed screened compounds, as well as the novel compound, might give some advances to treat malaria efficiently in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Malaria occurrence in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh varies by season and year, but this pattern is not well characterized. The role of environmental conditions on the occurrence of this vector-borne parasitic disease in the region is not fully understood. We extracted information on malaria patients recorded in the Upazila (sub-district) Health Complex patient registers of Rajasthali in Rangamati district of Bangladesh from February 2000 to November 2009. Weather data for the study area and period were obtained from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Non-linear and delayed effects of meteorological drivers, including temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall on the incidence of malaria, were investigated. We observed significant positive association between temperature and rainfall and malaria occurrence, revealing two peaks at 19 °C (logarithms of relative risks (logRR) = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.1-7.5) and 24.5 °C (logRR = 4.7, 95% CI: 1.8-7.6) for temperature and at 86 mm (logRR = 19.5, 95% CI: 11.7-27.3) and 284 mm (logRR = 17.6, 95% CI: 9.9-25.2) for rainfall. In sub-group analysis, women were at a much higher risk of developing malaria at increased temperatures. People over 50 years and children under 15 years were more susceptible to malaria at increased rainfall. The observed associations have policy implications. Further research is needed to expand these findings and direct resources to the vulnerable populations for malaria prevention and control in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and the region with similar settings.",

        "title": "Insecticide resistance status of Aedes aegypti in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Arboviral diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, are major public health concerns in Bangladesh where there have been unprecedented levels of transmission reported in recent years. The primary approach to control these diseases is to control the vector Aedes aegypti using pyrethroid insecticides. Although chemical control has long been practiced, no comprehensive analysis of Ae. aegypti susceptibility to insecticides has been conducted to date. The aim of this study was to determine the insecticide resistance status of Ae. aegypti in Bangladesh and investigate the role of detoxification enzymes and altered target site sensitivity as resistance mechanisms. Eggs of Aedes mosquitoes were collected using ovitraps from five districts across Bangladesh and in eight neighborhoods of the capital city Dhaka, from August to November 2017. CDC bottle bioassays were conducted for permethrin, deltamethrin, malathion, and bendiocarb using 3- to 5-day-old F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>2</sub> non-blood-fed female mosquitoes. Biochemical assays were conducted to detect metabolic resistance mechanisms, and real-time PCR was performed to determine the frequencies of the knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations Gly1016, Cys1534, and Leu410. High levels of resistance to permethrin were detected in all Ae. aegypti populations, with mortality ranging from 0 to 14.8% at the diagnostic dose. Substantial resistance continued to be detected against higher (2×) doses of permethrin (5.1-44.4% mortality). Susceptibility to deltamethrin and malathion varied between populations while complete susceptibility to bendiocarb was observed in all populations. Significantly higher levels of esterase and oxidase activity were detected in most of the test populations as compared to the susceptible reference Rockefeller strain. A significant association was detected between permethrin resistance and the presence of Gly1016 and Cys1534 homozygotes. The frequency of kdr (knockdown resistance) alleles varied across the Dhaka Aedes populations. Leu410 was not detected in any of the tested populations. The detection of widespread pyrethroid resistance and multiple resistance mechanisms highlights the urgency for implementing alternate Ae. aegypti control strategies. In addition, implementing routine monitoring of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti in Bangladesh will lead to a greater understanding of susceptibility trends over space and time, thereby enabling the development of improved control strategies.",

        "abstract": "There is a high risk of Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia following treatment of falciparum malaria. Our study aimed to quantify this risk and the associated determinants using an individual patient data meta-analysis in order to identify populations in which a policy of universal radical cure, combining artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with a hypnozoitocidal antimalarial drug, would be beneficial. A systematic review of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews identified efficacy studies of uncomplicated falciparum malaria treated with ACT that were undertaken in regions coendemic for P. vivax between 1 January 1960 and 5 January 2018. Data from eligible studies were pooled using standardised methodology. The risk of P. vivax parasitaemia at days 42 and 63 and associated risk factors were investigated by multivariable Cox regression analyses. Study quality was assessed using a tool developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. The study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42018097400). In total, 42 studies enrolling 15,341 patients were included in the analysis, including 30 randomised controlled trials and 12 cohort studies. Overall, 14,146 (92.2%) patients had P. falciparum monoinfection and 1,195 (7.8%) mixed infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax. The median age was 17.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 9.0-29.0 years; range = 0-80 years), with 1,584 (10.3%) patients younger than 5 years. 2,711 (17.7%) patients were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (AL, 13 studies), 651 (4.2%) with artesunate-amodiaquine (AA, 6 studies), 7,340 (47.8%) with artesunate-mefloquine (AM, 25 studies), and 4,639 (30.2%) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP, 16 studies). 14,537 patients (94.8%) were enrolled from the Asia-Pacific region, 684 (4.5%) from the Americas, and 120 (0.8%) from Africa. At day 42, the cumulative risk of vivax parasitaemia following treatment of P. falciparum was 31.1% (95% CI 28.9-33.4) after AL, 14.1% (95% CI 10.8-18.3) after AA, 7.4% (95% CI 6.7-8.1) after AM, and 4.5% (95% CI 3.9-5.3) after DP. By day 63, the risks had risen to 39.9% (95% CI 36.6-43.3), 42.4% (95% CI 34.7-51.2), 22.8% (95% CI 21.2-24.4), and 12.8% (95% CI 11.4-14.5), respectively. In multivariable analyses, the highest rate of P. vivax parasitaemia over 42 days of follow-up was in patients residing in areas of short relapse periodicity (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.2, 95% CI 2.0-19.5; p = 0.002); patients treated with AL (AHR = 6.2, 95% CI 4.6-8.5; p < 0.001), AA (AHR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.7; p = 0.001), or AM (AHR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9; p = 0.028) compared with DP; and patients who did not clear their initial parasitaemia within 2 days (AHR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.3; p < 0.001). The analysis was limited by heterogeneity between study populations and lack of data from very low transmission settings. Study quality was high. In this meta-analysis, we found a high risk of P. vivax parasitaemia after treatment of P. falciparum malaria that varied significantly between studies. These P. vivax infections are likely attributable to relapses that could be prevented with radical cure including a hypnozoitocidal agent; however, the benefits of such a novel strategy will vary considerably between geographical areas.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a major global health burden, killing hundreds of thousands annually, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In December 2019, a novel illness termed COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was reported in China. This disease soon spread around the world and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. Considering that the malaria burden is high in many low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hindered by COVID-19. Indeed, access to health care has generally been limited during the pandemic, whereas malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention, and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended because of lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for the treatment of COVID-19 and a shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests to COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests are causes for concern in malaria-endemic regions. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected developed countries, threatening their capacity to aid in malaria control efforts. Here, we address impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and control of malaria in Africa.",

        "title": "Rapid diagnostic tests for Plasmodium vivax malaria in endemic countries.",
        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax (P vivax) is a focus of malaria elimination. It is important because P vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection are co-endemic in some areas. There are asymptomatic carriers of P vivax, and the treatment for P vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria differs from that used in other types of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) will help distinguish P vivax from other malaria species to help treatment and elimination. There are RDTs available that detect P vivax parasitaemia through the detection of P vivax-specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) antigens. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of RDTs for detecting P vivax malaria infection in people living in malaria-endemic areas who present to ambulatory healthcare facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria; and to identify which types and brands of commercial tests best detect P vivax malaria. We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases up to 30 July 2019: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S), both in the Web of Science. Studies comparing RDTs with a reference standard (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in blood samples from patients attending ambulatory health facilities with symptoms suggestive of malaria in P vivax-endemic areas. For each included study, two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-piloted data extraction form. The methodological quality of the studies were assessed using a tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. We grouped studies according to commercial brand of the RDT and performed meta-analysis when appropriate. The results given by the index tests were based on the antibody affinity (referred to as the strength of the bond between an antibody and an antigen) and avidity (referred to as the strength of the overall bond between a multivalent antibody and multiple antigens). All analyses were stratified by the type of reference standard. The bivariate model was used to estimate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), this model was simplified when studies were few. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included 10 studies that assessed the accuracy of six different RDT brands (CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test, Falcivax Device Rapid test, Immuno-Rapid Malaria Pf/Pv test, SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv test, OnSite Pf/Pv test and Test Malaria Pf/Pv rapid test) for detecting P vivax malaria. One study directly compared the accuracy of two RDT brands. Of the 10 studies, six used microscopy, one used PCR, two used both microscopy and PCR separately and one used microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference standard. Four of the studies were conducted in Ethiopia, two in India, and one each in Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and Sudan. The studies often did not report how patients were selected. In the patient selection domain, we judged the risk of bias as unclear for nine studies. We judged all studies to be of unclear applicability concern. In the index test domain, we judged most studies to be at low risk of bias, but we judged nine studies to be of unclear applicability concern. There was poor reporting on lot testing, how the RDTs were stored, and background parasitaemia density (a key variable determining diagnostic accuracy of RDTs). Only half of the included studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the reference standard domain, Studies often did not report whether the results of the reference standard could classify the target condition or whether investigators knew the results of the RDT when interpreting the results of the reference standard. All 10 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in the flow and timing domain. Only two brands were evaluated by more than one study. Four studies evaluated the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test against microscopy and two studies evaluated the Falcivax Device Rapid test against microscopy. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 99% (95% CI 94% to 100%; 251 patients, moderate-certainty evidence) and 99% (95% CI 99% to 100%; 2147 patients, moderate-certainty evidence) for CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test. For a prevalence of 20%, about 206 people will have a positive CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test result and the remaining 794 people will have a negative result. Of the 206 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 794 people with a negative result, two would be incorrect (false negative). For the Falcivax Device Rapid test, the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% CI: 53% to 91%, 89 patients, low-certainty evidence) and the pooled specificity was 99% (95% CI: 98% to 100%, 621 patients, moderate-certainty evidence), respectively. For a prevalence of 20%, about 162 people will have a positive Falcivax Device Rapid test result and the remaining 838 people will have a negative result. Of the 162 people with positive results, eight will be incorrect (false positives), and of the 838 people with a negative result, 46 would be incorrect (false negative). The CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test was found to be highly sensitive and specific in comparison to microscopy for detecting P vivax in ambulatory healthcare in endemic settings, with moderate-certainty evidence. The number of studies included in this review was limited to 10 studies and we were able to estimate the accuracy of 2 out of 6 RDT brands included, the CareStart Malaria Pf/Pv Combo test and the Falcivax Device Rapid test. Thus, the differences in sensitivity and specificity between all the RDT brands could not be assessed. More high-quality studies in endemic field settings are needed to assess and compare the accuracy of RDTs designed to detect P vivax.",

        "abstract": "The control of malaria, in terms of drug resistance, remains a significant global challenge, with Bangladesh, a malaria-endemic country, being no exception. The aim of this study was to explore antimalarial resistance in Bangladesh by molecular analysis of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> chloroquine resistance transporter (<i>pfcrt</i>) and <i>P. falciparum</i> multidrug resistance transporter 1 (<i>pfmdr1</i>) genetic markers of <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i>. Samples were obtained from uncomplicated malaria patients between 2009 and 2014 from six malaria-endemic districts. Based on parasite transmission intensity, the endemic districts were divided into high-transmission (Chittagong Hill Tracts [CHT]) and low-transmission (non-CHT) regions. Falciparum malaria-positive isolates were genotyped for K76T of the <i>pfcrt</i> gene, and N86Y and Y184F of the <i>pfmdr1</i> gene: in total, 262 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates were analyzed. In CHT areas, the prevalence of polymorphisms was 70.6% for 76T, 14.4% for 86Y, and 7.8% for 184F. In non-CHT areas, 76T and 86Y mutations were found in 78.0% and 19.5% of the samples, respectively, whereas no 184F mutations were observed. We compared our data with previous similar molecular observations, which shows a significant decrease in <i>pfcrt</i> 76T mutation prevalence. No <i>pfmdr1</i> amplification was observed in any of the samples suggesting an unaltered susceptibility to amino alcohol drugs such as mefloquine and lumefantrine. This study provides an updated assessment of the current status of <i>pfcrt</i> and <i>pfmdr1</i> gene mutations in Bangladesh, and suggests there is persistent high prevalence of markers of resistance to aminoquinoline drugs.",

        "abstract": "Computer-assisted algorithms have become a mainstay of biomedical applications to improve accuracy and reproducibility of repetitive tasks like manual segmentation and annotation. We propose a novel pipeline for red blood cell detection and counting in thin blood smear microscopy images, named RBCNet, using a dual deep learning architecture. RBCNet consists of a U-Net first stage for cell-cluster or superpixel segmentation, followed by a second refinement stage Faster R-CNN for detecting small cell objects within the connected component clusters. RBCNet uses cell clustering instead of region proposals, which is robust to cell fragmentation, is highly scalable for detecting small objects or fine scale morphological structures in very large images, can be trained using non-overlapping tiles, and during inference is adaptive to the scale of cell-clusters with a low memory footprint. We tested our method on an archived collection of human malaria smears with nearly 200,000 labeled cells across 965 images from 193 patients, acquired in Bangladesh, with each patient contributing five images. Cell detection accuracy using RBCNet was higher than 97 %. The novel dual cascade RBCNet architecture provides more accurate cell detections because the foreground cell-cluster masks from U-Net adaptively guide the detection stage, resulting in a notably higher true positive and lower false alarm rates, compared to traditional and other deep learning methods. The RBCNet pipeline implements a crucial step towards automated malaria diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Smoking cessation is important in patients with tuberculosis because it can reduce the high rates of treatment failure and mortality. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of cystine as a smoking cessation aid in patients with tuberculosis in Bangladesh and Pakistan. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial at 32 health centres in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Eligible patients were adults (aged >18 years in Bangladesh; aged >15 years in Pakistan) with pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed in the previous 4 weeks, who smoked tobacco on a daily basis and were willing to stop smoking. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive behavioural support plus either oral cytisine (9 mg on day 0, which was gradually reduced to 1·5 mg by day 25) or placebo for 25 days. Randomisation was done using pregenerated block randomisation lists, stratified by trial sites. Investigators, clinicians, and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was continuous abstinence at 6 months, defined as self-report (of not having used more than five cigarettes, bidis, a water pipe, or smokeless tobacco products since the quit date), confirmed biochemically by a breath carbon monoxide reading of less than 10 parts per million. Primary and safety analysis were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial Registry, ISRCTN43811467, and enrolment is complete. Between June 6, 2017, and April 30, 2018, 2472 patients (1527 patients from Bangladesh; 945 patients from Pakistan) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive cytisine (n=1239) or placebo (n=1233). At 6 months, 401 (32·4%) participants in the cytisine group and 366 (29·7%) participants in the placebo group had achieved continuous abstinence (risk difference 2·68%, 95% CI -0·96 to 6·33; relative risk 1·09, 95% CI 0·97 to 1·23, p=0·114). 53 (4·3%) of 1239 participants in the cytisine group and 46 (3·7%) of 1233 participants in the placebo group reported serious adverse events (94 events in the cytisine group and 90 events in the placebo group), which included 91 deaths (49 in the cytisine group and 42 in the placebo group). None of the adverse events were attributed to the study medication. Our findings do not support the addition of cytisine to brief behavioural support for the treatment of tobacco dependence in patients with tuberculosis.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has achieved significant progress towards malaria elimination, although health service delivery for malaria remains challenging in remote forested areas such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). The aim of this study was to investigate perceptions of malaria and its treatment among the local population to inform contextualized strategies for rolling out radical cure for <i>P. vivax</i> in Bangladesh. The study comprised two sequential strands whereby the preliminary results of a qualitative strand informed the development of a structured survey questionnaire used in the quantitative strand. Results show that ethnic minority populations in the CHT live in precarious socio-economic conditions which increase their exposure to infectious diseases, and that febrile patients often self-treat, including home remedies and pharmaceuticals, before attending a healthcare facility. Perceived low quality of care and lack of communication between Bengali health providers and ethnic minority patients also affects access to public healthcare. Malaria is viewed as a condition that affects vulnerable people weakened by agricultural work and taking away blood is perceived to increase such vulnerability. Healthcare providers that initiate and sustain a dialogue about these issues with ethnic minority patients may foster the trust that is needed for local malaria elimination efforts.",

Archived rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), used by national malaria control and elimination programs for clinical diagnosis, present a valuable, yet rarely used resource for in-depth studies on malaria epidemiology. 1022 RDTs from two sub-Districts in Bangladesh (Alikadam and Kamalganj) were screened by qPCR for low-density Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections, and by ELISA for Anopheles salivary gland antibodies as a marker for exposure to vectors. Concordance between RDT and qPCR was moderate. qPCR detected 31/1022 infections compared to 36/1022 diagnosed by RDT. Exposure to Anopheles was significantly higher in Kamalganj despite low transmission, which could be explained by low bed net use. Archived RDTs present a valuable source of antibodies for serological studies on exposure to vectors. In contrast, the benefit of screening archived RDTs to obtain a better estimate of clinical case numbers is moderate. Kamalganj could be prone to outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "The proportion of Plasmodium vivax malaria among all malarias is increasing worldwide. Treatment with 8-aminoquinolines remain the only radical cure. However, 8-aminoquinolines can cause severe hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient patients. The population of the multi-ethnic Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) carry the highest malaria burden within Bangladesh. As in many countries the national treatment guidelines recommend 8-aminoquinoline based radical cure without routine G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) testing to guide treatment. Aim of this study was to determine the need for routine testing within a multi-ethnic population by assessing the prevalence of G6PDd among the local population. Participants from 11 ethnicities were randomly selected and malaria status was assessed by microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). G6PD status was determined by spectrophotometry and G6PD genotyping. The adjusted male median (AMM) was defined as 100% G6PD activity, participants were categorized as G6PD deficient (<30% activity), G6PD intermediate (30% to 70% activity) or G6PD normal (>70% activity). Median G6PD activities between ethnicities were compared and the association between G6PD activity and malaria status was assessed. 1002 participants were enrolled and tested for malaria. G6PD activity was measured by spectrophotometry in 999 participants and host G6PD genotyping undertaken in 323 participants. Seven participants (0.7%) had peripheral parasitaemia detected by microscopy or RDT and 42 by PCR (4.2%). Among 106 participants (32.8%) with confirmed genotype, 99 (93.4%) had the Mahidol variant. The AMM was 7.03U/gHb with 90 (9.0%) G6PD deficient participants and 133 (13.3%) with intermediate G6PD activity. Median G6PD activity differed significantly between ethnicities (p<0.001), proportions of G6PD deficient individuals ranged from 2% to 26% but did not differ between participants with and without malaria. The high G6PDd prevalence and significant variation between ethnicities suggest routine G6PDd testing to guide 8-aminoquinoline based radical in the CHT and comparable settings.",

The leaves of the S. cymosum is one of the plant materials used by traditional healers in malaria-endemic areas in Bangladesh for treatment of malaria. Here, we investigated the crude extract and its fractions against chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive 3D7, CQ-resistant Dd2, and artemisinin (ART)-resistant IPC 4912 Mondulkiri strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The antimalarial activities were tested using HRP II based in-vitro antimalarial drug sensitivity ELISA described by WWARN and half inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using GraphaPad Prism. The cytotoxicity of the crude methanolic extract was assessed using the MTT assay on Vero cell line. The methanolic crude extract revealed promising activity against 3D7 (IC50 6.28 µg/mL), Dd2 (IC50 13.42 µg/mL), and moderate activity against IPC 4912 Mondulkiri (IC50 17.47 µg/mL). Among the fractionated portions, the chloroform fraction revealed highest activity against IPC 4912 Mondulkiri (IC50 1.65 µg/mL) followed by Dd2 (1.73 µg/mL) and 3D7 (2.39 µg/mL). The crude methanolic extract also demonstrated good selectivity with the selectivity indices of > 15.92, > 7.45, and > 6.91 against 3D7, Dd2, and IPC 4912, respectively when tested against Vero cell line. This is the first report on S. cymosum for its putative antimalarial activity, and is imperative to go for further phytochemical analyses in order to investigate possible novel antimalarial drug compound(s).",

        "abstract": "The associations between anemia and household water source and sanitation remain unclear. We aimed to assess the associations between anemia and household water source or sanitation in preschool children (PSC; age 6-59 mo) using population-based surveys from the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project. We analyzed national and subnational data from 21 surveys, representing 19 countries (n = 35,963). Observations with hemoglobin (Hb) and ≥1 variable reflecting household water source or sanitation were included. Anemia was defined as an altitude-adjusted Hb concentration <110 g/L. Household water source and sanitation variables were dichotomized as \"improved\" or \"unimproved.\" Poisson regressions with robust variance estimates were conducted for each survey, adjusting for child sex, age, household socioeconomic status, maternal education, and type of residence. Access to an improved water source and improved sanitation ranged from 29.9% (Burkina Faso) to 98.4% (Bangladesh, 2012), and from 0.2% (Kenya, 2007) to 97.4% (Philippines), respectively. Prevalence of anemia ranged from 20.1% (Nicaragua) to 83.5% (Bangladesh, 2010). Seven surveys showed negative associations between anemia and improved sanitation. Three surveys showed association between anemia and improved water, with mixed directions. Meta-analyses suggested a protective association between improved household sanitation and anemia [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.98], and no association between improved household water and anemia (aPR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.10). There was heterogeneity across surveys for sanitation (P < 0.01; I2 = 66.3%) and water (P < 0.01; I2 = 55.8%). Although improved household sanitation was associated with reduced anemia prevalence in PSC in some surveys, this association was not consistent. Access to an improved water source in general had no association with anemia across surveys. Additional research could help clarify the heterogeneity between these conditions across countries to inform anemia reduction programs.",

        "abstract": "The Asia-Pacific region faces formidable challenges in achieving malaria elimination by the proposed target in 2030. Molecular surveillance of Plasmodium parasites can provide important information on malaria transmission and adaptation, which can inform national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) in decision-making processes. In November 2019 a parasite genotyping workshop was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, to review molecular approaches for parasite surveillance and explore ways in which these tools can be integrated into public health systems and inform policy. The meeting was attended by 70 participants from 8 malaria-endemic countries and partners of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network. The participants acknowledged the utility of multiple use cases for parasite genotyping including: quantifying the prevalence of drug resistant parasites, predicting risks of treatment failure, identifying major routes and reservoirs of infection, monitoring imported malaria and its contribution to local transmission, characterizing the origins and dynamics of malaria outbreaks, and estimating the frequency of Plasmodium vivax relapses. However, the priority of each use case varies with different endemic settings. Although a one-size-fits-all approach to molecular surveillance is unlikely to be applicable across the Asia-Pacific region, consensus on the spectrum of added-value activities will help support data sharing across national boundaries. Knowledge exchange is needed to establish local expertise in different laboratory-based methodologies and bioinformatics processes. Collaborative research involving local and international teams will help maximize the impact of analytical outputs on the operational needs of NMCPs. Research is also needed to explore the cost-effectiveness of genetic epidemiology for different use cases to help to leverage funding for wide-scale implementation. Engagement between NMCPs and local researchers will be critical throughout this process.",

        "abstract": "Pneumonia is a virulent disease that causes the death of millions of people around the world. Every year it kills more children than malaria, AIDS, and measles combined and it accounts for approximately one in five child-deaths worldwide. The invention of antibiotics and vaccines in the past century has notably increased the survival rate of Pneumonia patients. Currently, the primary challenge is to detect the disease at an early stage and determine its type to initiate the appropriate treatment. Usually, a trained physician or a radiologist undertakes the task of diagnosing Pneumonia by examining the patient's chest X-ray. However, the number of such trained individuals is nominal when compared to the 450 million people who get affected by Pneumonia every year. Fortunately, this challenge can be met by introducing modern computers and improved Machine Learning techniques in Pneumonia diagnosis. Researchers have been trying to develop a method to automatically detect Pneumonia using machines by analyzing and the symptoms of the disease and chest radiographic images of the patients for the past two decades. However, with the development of cogent Deep Learning algorithms, the formation of such an automatic system is very much within the realms of possibility. In this paper, a novel diagnostic method has been proposed while using Image Processing and Deep Learning techniques that are based on chest X-ray images to detect Pneumonia. The method has been tested on a widely used chest radiography dataset, and the obtained results indicate that the model is very much potent to be employed in an automatic Pneumonia diagnosis scheme.",

        "title": "A process for developing a sustainable and scalable approach to community engagement: community dialogue approach for addressing the drivers of antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Community engagement approaches that have impacted on health outcomes are often time intensive, small-scale and require high levels of financial and human resources. They can be difficult to sustain and scale-up in low resource settings. Given the reach of health services into communities in low income countries, the health system provides a valuable and potentially sustainable entry point that would allow for scale-up of community engagement interventions. This study explores the process of developing an embedded approach to community engagement taking the global challenge of antibiotic resistance as an example. The intervention was developed using a sequential mixed methods study design. This consisted of: exploring the evidence base through an umbrella review, and identifying key international standards on the appropriate use of antibiotics; undertaking detailed formative research through a) a qualitative study to explore the most appropriate mechanisms through which to embed the intervention within the existing health system and community infrastructure, and to understand patterns of knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding antibiotics and antibiotic resistance; and b) a household survey - which drew on the qualitative findings - to quantify knowledge, and reported attitudes and practice regarding antibiotics and antibiotic resistance within the target population; and c) drawing on appropriate theories regarding change mechanisms and experience of implementing community engagement interventions to co-produce the intervention processes and materials with key stakeholders at policy, health system and community level. A community engagement intervention was co-produced and was explicitly designed to link into existing health system and community structures and be appropriate for the cultural context, and therefore have the potential to be implemented at scale. We anticipate that taking this approach increases local ownership, as well as the likelihood that the intervention will be sustainable and scalable. This study demonstrates the value of ensuring that a range of stakeholders co-produce the intervention, and ensuring that the intervention is designed to be appropriate for the health system, community and cultural context.",
