        "abstract": "Malaria continues to pose a global health challenge, exacerbated by the emergence of drug-resistant strains of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> potential of Propolis extracts collected from various Iranian regions and to characterize the molecular interactions of their bioactive phytochemicals with <i>P. falciparum</i> lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH), a key enzyme in parasite glycolysis. The anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity of ethanol-extracted Propolis was assessed against <i>P. falciparum</i> NF54 using the SYBR Green I fluorescence assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified major phytochemicals in the most active extract. Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the binding affinity and stability of selected compounds (tectochrysin and galangin) against PfLDH in both holo (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 1LDG) and apo (PDB ID: 2X8L) forms. Propolis collected from Kermanshah city exhibited the highest anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.69 ± 1.44 μg/mL). GC-MS analysis identified tectochrysin and galangin as major constituents. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities of tectochrysin (-7.8 kcal/mol) and galangin (-7.5 kcal/mol) to PfLDH, surpassing the binding energies of standard antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and quinine). MD simulations confirmed the stability of tectochrysin and galangin within the PfLDH active sites, with favorable root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, molecular surface area, and polar surface area profiles, indicating persistent and stable protein-ligand interactions throughout the simulation. The findings support the promising anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> potential of Propolis-derived compounds, particularly tectochrysin and galangin, as novel PfLDH inhibitors. Their potential applicability in transdisciplinary anti-parasitic therapy across human and veterinary medicine warrants further <i>in vivo</i> validation and clinical investigations.",

        "abstract": "Infectious disease research is essential for disease prevention and management within refugee camps and informal settlements. The objective of this study is to identify the characteristics of existing infectious disease research in these settings and to assess stated research challenges, ethical considerations, and studied interventions within these studies. This is a systematic review of forty primary studies focused on infectious disease research conducted among displaced populations. Included studies are published in English between 1995 and 2023. Three databases were searched, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, and this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023461567). The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. 85 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 34) researched an intervention for infectious disease prevention or control and 70 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 28) were randomized controlled trials. 75 % of studies were located in Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 15) or Pakistan (<i>n</i> = 15). 40 % of studies focused on diarrheal diseases (<i>n</i> = 16) and 28 % on malaria (<i>n</i> = 11). Common identified research challenges included population mobility, limited external validity, and low recruitment. No studies included the community in the initial study conception or investigated the research impact on the community. Community involvement was often through community health workers (45 %). Of the 18 studies that studied a resource-based intervention, 20 % explicitly noted that the intervention was unsustainable. While guidelines for conducting research in displaced settings exist, there are gaps in their utilization. We identified a disconnect between where displaced individuals reside and where research is conducted, as well as a prioritization of particular infectious diseases. Researchers identified numerous challenges in conducting research in these settings, though the community was rarely involved in the research. Context-specific considerations and community involvement are vital in research with displaced communities. Wellcome Trust (Contract Number C-010,656).",

        "abstract": "People with disabilities experience significant health inequalities and barriers to healthcare access globally. While poverty alleviation interventions show promise for improving health outcomes, evidence specifically for people with disabilities remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a disability-inclusive graduation (DIG) programme on health outcomes among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda. We conducted a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial in four districts of Northern Uganda. Clusters were randomly assigned to either the DIG intervention (96 clusters) or control group (89 clusters). This analysis focused on households with people with disabilities, as identified by the Washington Group Short Set questions and verified by BRAC programme managers. Households in treatment clusters received up to 18 months DIG intervention between December 2020 and June 2022, combining asset transfers, cash support, skills training, financial inclusion activities, and disability-specific services including rehabilitation and assistive devices. The primary outcome was experience of illness/injury in the past 3 months, assessed at both first follow-up (immediately post-intervention) and second follow-up (about 16 months post-intervention), with secondary outcomes including unmet health needs, mental health status, unmet assistive product needs, and healthcare expenditure. Effects were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression or generalized estimating equations, reporting minimally-adjusted and fully-adjusted mean differences (FAMD) or odds ratios (FAOR) with 95% CIs. The trial was registered with RIDIE (RIDIE-STUDY-ID-626008898983a) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN-78592382). At baseline, 691 participants (370 intervention, 321 control) were included. The DIG intervention did not significantly impact overall illness/injury prevalence at either first follow-up (41.18% vs 45.86%, FAOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22) or second follow-up (55.65% vs 53.98%, FAOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.56). However, the intervention demonstrated a progressively strengthening effect on reducing unmet health needs, from marginal improvement immediately post-intervention (FAOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.02, p = 0.06) to significant reduction at 16 months post-intervention (FAOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Notably, the intervention produced temporal potential shifts in disease patterns, with malaria showing contrasting trends between follow-up periods. Sex-differentiated effects emerged by second follow-up, with females in the intervention group experiencing fewer injuries (FAOR for interaction 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.74, p = 0.02) but more pain-related conditions compared to males (FAOR for interaction 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.59, p = 0.04), though these subgroup findings require replication in future studies. No significant differences were observed in mental health outcomes or health expenditure. This first randomized evaluation of a disability-inclusive graduation programme demonstrates that while economic empowerment alone may not reduce overall illness prevalence among people with disabilities, it can progressively improve healthcare access over time. The temporal evolution of effects and emerging sex-differentiated impacts highlight the need for sustained support and gender-sensitive approaches in future disability-inclusive poverty reduction programmes, with additional health-specific components to achieve broader improvements in health outcomes.

The parasitic nematode <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i> infects an estimated 600 million people worldwide and is one of the soil-transmitted helminthiases, a WHO-defined neglected tropical disease. It has long been suggested that human <i>S. stercoralis</i> infection may be a zoonosis from dogs. We investigated this by whole genome sequence analysis of <i>S. stercoralis</i> from sympatric human and dog populations in Asia. We find that human- and dog-derived <i>S. stercoralis</i> have genetically distinct nuclear genomes, but we also find evidence of rare cross-infection. Analysis of the <i>S. stercoralis</i> mitochondrial genome reveals evidence of historical introgression between human- and dog-derived parasites. Based on these data, we suggest that <i>S. stercoralis</i> was originally a parasite of canids, that began to infect humans when people domesticated dogs, since when human- and dog-derived parasites have differentiated, but have not become separate species.",

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

        "abstract": "Noise in histopathology images from hardware limitations, preparation artifacts, and environmental factors complicates disease analysis and increases risks. With growing workloads and the complexity of histopathology images, developing efficient and precise histopathology image analysis methods is essential. However, many denoising models struggle to extract spatial features and are computationally expensive, primarily due to the limited capacity of convolutions to capture visual patterns across spatial locations, and tend to occupy the largest share of computational costs. In histopathology, many spatial features, such as anomalies or microorganisms, located sparsely across an image, are crucial for the final diagnosis, and many denoising processes often either blur them or introduce artifacts. In this study, we propose a lightweight autoencoder (43.11 kilobytes) for denoising histopathology images by fusing a single involution layer within a small convolution model, resulting in better denoising performance in a hybrid model, which has both channel-specific and location-specific feature extraction capabilities. Building upon the idea of a shallow autoencoder, our model results in much lower memory and compute overhead requirements, while also not avoiding the generation of artifacts. On Malaria Blood Smear and CRC datasets, SSIM Loss and Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio were used for performance evaluation, with lower SSIM Loss (0.058 and 0.34) in denoising images with an added Gaussian noise of 0.3. Our proposed autoencoder, with low weight parameters of 11,037 and 81,630,000 floating point operations (FLOPs), is over 20 times less computationally expensive than Xception, the second-best performing model, establishing ours as the most efficient denoising autoencoder for histopathology images.",

        "abstract": "Dengue cases in Bangladesh have surged in recent years. The existing insecticide-based control program is challenged by issues of insufficient household coverage and high levels of insecticide resistance in the primary dengue virus (DENV) vector, Aedes aegypti. A more sustainable, effective alternative could be the implementation of a Wolbachia-mediated disease management strategy. Hence, we created and characterised a Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti strain with a Dhaka wild-type genetic background, and compared its reproductive compatibility, maternal inheritance, fitness, and virus-blocking ability to the parental strains (Dhaka wild-type and wAlbB2-F4). The new Ae. aegypti strain wAlbB2-Dhaka demonstrated complete cytoplasmic incompatibility with the wild-type and complete maternal transmission, retaining levels of pyrethroid resistance of the Dhaka wild-type. No significant fitness costs were detected during laboratory comparison. Compared to the wild-type, wAlbB2-Dhaka mosquitoes demonstrated a significantly reduced genome copies of DENV in the bodies (44.4%, p = 0.0034); a two-fold reduction in dissemination to legs and wings (47.6%, p < 0.0001); and > 13-fold reduction of DENV in saliva expectorates (proxy of transmission potential) (92.7%, p < 0.0001) 14 days after ingesting dengue-infected blood. Our work indicates that the wAlbB2-Dhaka strain could be used for Ae. aegypti suppression or replacement strategies for dengue management in Bangladesh.",

Homology-based taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analyses identified a broad diversity of putative viruses from 12 known families, with additional unclassified viruses also likely present. Analysis of male mosquitoes showed some of these viruses are likely capable of being vertically transmitted.

        "abstract": "Most child deaths can be averted through prompt and appropriate treatment of child illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria. However, research has suggested that increases in care seeking do not necessarily mean that quality care is being received. We assessed the service readiness and process quality of curative healthcare during childhood and determined whether children are receiving health services with sufficient quality across countries. We linked data from household surveys including the standard Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to data from facility surveys including the Service Provision Assessment and Health Facility Assessment in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania to estimate the effective coverage of child illness treatment. We assessed the gaps in service availability and coverage, lack of service readiness, missed care opportunities, and inadequate service process, where service readiness and process quality were defined according to global standards with country-specific adaptations. We analysed the service readiness, quality of care, and effective coverage by individual illness and combined illnesses accounting for equity dimensions. Seven to 42% of children experienced at least one illness. An integrated management of child illnesses (IMCI) service was available in 58-85% of facilities. We found that 55-66% of health facilities in the countries were ready to deliver treatment to sick children. However, the readiness-adjusted contact suggested that child healthcare was mostly sought in facilities with low readiness score, ranging from 15% (Nepal) to 46.0% (Malawi). Health facilities had low diagnostics, supervision, and trained personnel capacity to manage child illnesses. Concerning the quality of care, only 51-60% of the procedures during clinical encounters were in line with standards. Counselling of caretakers had the lowest score, while treatment components had the highest process quality score. Hospitals had higher readiness and process quality scores compared to primary facilities and the private sector. There were, however, large gaps in service readiness and significant inadequate service processes in all countries; 35% (Haiti) to 79% (Bangladesh) of sick children sought care from a health facility, with only 7% (Nepal) to 29% (Malawi) of them actually receiving appropriate treatment. We found large inequalities in care seeking, quality of care, and effective coverage across levels of education and poverty, and places of residence. A large proportion of facilities did not meet the required capacity to provide IMCI services. The provision of health services has major quality gaps, highlighting the need for strengthening health service access, capacity and quality of care to reach universal child health coverage.",

The World Health Organization recommends G6PD testing prior to 8AQ-based hypnozoitocidal treatment. We undertook an individual level meta-analysis of the performance of commercially available quantitative point-of-care diagnostics (PoCs) compared with reference spectrophotometry. A systematic literature search (PROSPERO: CRD42022330733) identified 595 articles of which 16 (2.7%) fulfilled pre-defined inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, plus an additional 4 datasets. In total there were 12,678 paired measurements analyzed, 10,446 (82.4%) by STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, RoK, [SDB]), 2,042 (16.1%) by CareStart G6PD Biosensor (AccessBio, USA, [CSA]), 150 (1.2%) by CareStart Biosensor (WellsBio, RoK [CSW]), and 40 (0.3%) by FINDER (Baebies, USA, [FBA]). The pooled sensitivities of the SDB when measuring G6PD activity <30% of normal were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.89) for capillary and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99) for venous blood samples. The corresponding values for measuring <70% G6PD activity were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.67-0.99) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73-0.96), respectively. The pooled specificity of the SDB was high (>96%) for all blood samples and G6PD activity thresholds. Irrespective of the blood samples and thresholds applied, sensitivity of the CSA did not exceed 62%, although specificity remained high at both 30% and 70% thresholds (>88%). Only one study each for CSW and FBA was included. Sensitivities of the CSW were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.14) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89) at the 30% and 70% thresholds, respectively (venous blood samples). Sensitivities of the FBA were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.29-1.00) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.19-0.99) at the 30% and 70% thresholds (venous blood samples). Specificities of the CSW and FBA were consistently high (>90%) at both thresholds. Accuracy of the SDB was higher in females at the 30% cut-off (OR: 3.49, p=0.002) and lower in malaria patients at the 70% cut-off (OR: 0.59, p = 0.005). The SDB performed better than other PoCs. More evidence was available for the performance of the SDB compared to other PoCs, giving higher confidence in its utility in diagnosing G6PD deficiency.",

Participants were randomly assigned via interactive web response system technology equally into five study groups, stratified by site: two doses of 2vHPV, the first at baseline and the second 6, 12, or 24 months later; a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) at baseline followed 24 months later by 2vHPV; or two doses of 4vHPV given 6 months apart (referent). We tested for antigen-specific (HPV-16 and HPV-18) binding antibodies by ELISA at baseline and before and 1 month after the second dose. The primary objective was to show immunological non-inferiority of the 2vHPV vaccine schedules to the referent 1 month after the second dose in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of 0·5 for the lower bound of the 98·3% CI for the geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio. Adverse events and serious adverse events were evaluated as secondary endpoints in the total vaccinated population. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04508309) and is completed. Between March 15 and Nov 18, 2021, 1025 girls were enrolled and received 2vHPV at baseline and 6 months (n=205), 12 months (n=206), or 24 months (n=204); 4vHPV at baseline and 6 months (n=205); or 4vHPV at baseline and 2vHPV at 24 months (n=205). 96-99% of participants across groups were included in the per-protocol analysis. 1 month after the second dose, 2vHPV non-inferiority was shown, with GMC ratios between 1·1 and 2·4 (lower bound of the 98·3% CI of the GMC ratio between 0·9 and 1·9) for HPV-16, and between 1·3 and 1·7 (1·0 and 1·4) for HPV-18. As an exploratory objective, we assessed 2vHPV immunogenicity after one dose, finding that it was similar to that of 4vHPV up to 24 months, with GMC ratios at 24 months of 1·1 (95% CI 0·9-1·4) for HPV-16 and 1·4 (1·1-1·7) for HPV-18. The frequency of adverse events was similar across study groups, with no related unsolicited events reported. Serious adverse events were rare and none were determined to be related to vaccination. Non-inferior immune responses for extended two-dose regimens of 2vHPV support dosing flexibility. For up to 24 months, one dose of 2vHPV elicited immunogenicity that was similar to one dose of 4vHPV, for which single-dose efficacy has been shown, supporting a single-dose use of 2vHPV. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and immunological testing was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic use, access to quality antibiotics and weak antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). There is a need to review current evidence on antibiotic use, access, and AMR, in primary care across key countries. This narrative review analyzes publications from 2018 to 2024 regarding access, availability, and use of appropriate antibiotics. There were very few studies focussing on a lack of access to antibiotics in primary care. However, there was considerable evidence of high rates of inappropriate antibiotic use, including Watch antibiotics, typically for minor infections, across studied countries exacerbated by patient demand. The high costs of antibiotics in a number of LMICs impact on their use, resulting in short courses and sharing of antibiotics. This can contribute to AMR alongside the use of substandard and falsified antibiotics. Overall, limited implementation of national action plans, insufficient resources, and knowledge gaps affects sustainable development goals to provide routine access to safe, effective, and appropriate antibiotics. There is a clear need to focus health policy on the optimal use of essential AWaRe antibiotics in primary care settings to reduce AMR in LMICs.",

However, few contextual data are available at the village level in rural South and Southeast Asia. This study addressed the gap by profiling representative villages across seven sites in Thailand (n=3), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Key informant surveys supplemented by other information sources were used to collect data from 687 villages on four key indicators (literacy rate, and percentages of attended deliveries, fully immunised children and latrine coverage), as well as access to various services. Data were analysed descriptively. Sites varied considerably. Five were highly diverse ethno-culturally and linguistically, and all relied on primary health centres and village health/malaria workers as the main providers of primary healthcare. These were generally bypassed by severely ill patients for urban first-level referral hospitals and private sector facilities. While >75% of villages were near primary schools, educational attainment was generally low. Over 70% of villages at each site had mobile phone coverage and availability of electricity was high (≥65% at all sites bar Myanmar). These results illustrate the similarities and differences of villages in this region that must be considered in public health research and policymaking.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

        "abstract": "Childhood illness and hospitalisation result in both direct and indirect costs to families before, during and after admission. We aimed to estimate the catastrophic expenditure during hospitalisation for children with acute illness. This was a prespecified cross-sectional substudy nested within two prospective studies. Participants were recruited and interviewed from three rural and three urban hospitals in Kenya and Uganda. A costing questionnaire was administered to the caregivers of 731 children hospitalised for acute illness to evaluate direct and indirect costs incurred by caregivers and families. Costs incurred were compared for families with children both with and without complicated severe malnutrition (CSM). Catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure exceeding 10% and 25% of monthly income was assessed. The median (IQR) total cost during hospitalisation per child was US$47 (US$24-US$84), with higher costs for children with CSM, especially during hospitalisation (US$56 (US$26-US$99) vs US$36 (US$20-US$65); p<0.001). During hospitalisation, bed charges followed by food were the main cost drivers. Caregivers reported losing a median of 7 (4-11) days of productive time during a child's hospitalisation with a mean loss of income of US$10 (SD US$25.6, median US$0 (US$0-US$10)). 92% and 74% of households experienced catastrophic expenditure at thresholds of 10% and 25% of monthly income, respectively. Caregivers reported borrowing, selling property and withdrawing other children from school to cope with costs. Despite intentions of free healthcare services for under 5, families of acutely ill children very commonly faced catastrophic expenditure, especially for children with CSM. Interventions aimed at supporting financial protection, reducing additional healthcare costs, and lowering health service charges may help prevent catastrophic expenditures.",

        "title": "Improving Malaria diagnosis through interpretable customized CNNs architectures.",
        "abstract": "Malaria, which is spread via female Anopheles mosquitoes and is brought on by the Plasmodium parasite, persists as a serious illness, especially in areas with a high mosquito density. Traditional detection techniques, like examining blood samples with a microscope, tend to be labor-intensive, unreliable and necessitate specialized individuals. To address these challenges, we employed several customized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including Parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN), Soft Attention Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (SPCNN), and Soft Attention after Functional Block Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (SFPCNN), to improve the effectiveness of malaria diagnosis. Among these, the SPCNN emerged as the most successful model, outperforming all other models in evaluation metrics. The SPCNN achieved a precision of 99.38 ± 0.21%, recall of 99.37 ± 0.21%, F1 score of 99.37 ± 0.21%, accuracy of 99.37 ± 0.30%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 99.95 ± 0.01%, demonstrating its robustness in detecting malaria parasites. Furthermore, we employed various transfer learning (TL) algorithms, including VGG16, ResNet152, MobileNetV3Small, EfficientNetB6, EfficientNetB7, DenseNet201, Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), ImageIntern, and Swin Transformer (versions v1 and v2). The proposed SPCNN model surpassed all these TL methods in every evaluation measure. The SPCNN model, with 2.207 million parameters and a size of 26 MB, is more complex than PCNN but simpler than SFPCNN. Despite this, SPCNN exhibited the fastest testing times (0.00252 s), making it more computationally efficient than both PCNN and SFPCNN. We assessed model interpretability using feature activation maps, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) visualizations for all three architectures, illustrating why SPCNN outperformed the others. The findings from our experiments show a significant improvement in malaria parasite diagnosis. The proposed approach outperforms traditional manual microscopy in terms of both accuracy and speed. This study highlights the importance of utilizing cutting-edge technologies to develop robust and effective diagnostic tools for malaria prevention.",

        "abstract": "There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230). 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success. Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

This systematic review aims to describe pathogens studied using MBAs, the operational implementation of MBAs, and how the data generated were synthesised. In November and December 2023, four databases were searched for studies utilising MBAs for the integrated serosurveillance of infectious diseases. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data regarding the study settings and population, methodology, seroprevalence results, and operational implementation elements. Overall, 4765 studies were identified; 47 were eligible for inclusion, of which 41% (<i>n</i> = 19) investigated multiple malaria species, and 14% performed concurrent surveillance of malaria in combination with other infectious diseases (<i>n</i> = 14). Additionally, 14 studies (29%) investigated a combination of multiple infectious diseases (other than malaria), and seven studies examined a combination of vaccine-preventable diseases. Haiti (<i>n</i> = 8) was the most studied country, followed by Ethiopia (<i>n</i> = 6), Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 3), Kenya (<i>n</i> = 3), and Tanzania (<i>n</i> = 3). Only seven studies were found where integrated serosurveillance was the primary objective. The synthesis of data varied and included the investigation of age-specific seroprevalence (<i>n</i> = 25), risk factor analysis (<i>n</i> = 15), and spatial analysis of disease prevalence (<i>n</i> = 8). This review demonstrated that the use of MBAs for integrated surveillance of multiple pathogens is gaining traction; however, more research and capabilities in lower- and middle-income countries are needed to optimise and standardise sample collection, survey implementation, and the analysis and interpretation of results. Geographical and population seroprevalence data can enable targeted public health interventions, highlighting the potential and importance of integrated serological surveillance as a public health tool.",

        "abstract": "African communities that have been forced to leave their homes experience a considerably greater susceptibility to malaria as a result of densely populated living conditions, restricted availability of healthcare, and environmental influences. Internally displaced individuals frequently live in large settlements with restricted availability to drinking water, essential sanitation, and medical services, intensifying the spread of malaria. As a result, the occurrence of malaria is significantly more common among refugees and internally displaced individuals compared to those who are not displaced. This leads to greater rates of illness and death, especially among young people. Insufficient monitoring worsens the condition, leading to delayed identification and medical intervention, and contributing to a higher incidence of severe malaria and deaths. Furthermore, these communities are faced with economic consequences that contribute to the continuation of poverty and the worsening of socio-economic inequalities. Furthermore, the psychological impact of malaria, which is marked by feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, is particularly severe in vulnerable populations such as displaced children and pregnant women, aggravating the overall burden. Hence, addressing malaria in displaced populations in Africa requires comprehensive and well-coordinated strategies. Advanced diagnostic and surveillance technologies are essential for promptly identifying and treating malaria, providing chances to monitor and control its spread effectively. Collaboration among healthcare, policy, and humanitarian sectors is crucial for implementing comprehensive solutions that incorporate enhanced diagnostics, surveillance, and socio-psychological support. Active involvement of the community, usage of Community Health Workers, and regular collection of surveillance data are crucial in increasing awareness, directing control efforts, and tackling the specific difficulties encountered by displaced groups. Moreover, the implementation of environmental management, the incorporation of health services, and the utilization of adaptable healthcare interventions are essential for reducing the effects of malaria. To mitigate the impact of malaria and improve health outcomes among displaced populations in Africa, it is crucial to focus on these specific areas.",

A PLR was performed at baseline, and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. Preload responsiveness assessed through PI was compared to preload responsiveness assessed through cardiac index (CI change ≥5%), as reference test. The primary endpoint was the accuracy of preload responsiveness prediction of PLR using PI at baseline; secondary endpoints were the accuracies at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. <b>Results:</b> The study included 34 patients admitted for sepsis with signs of hypoperfusion and 10 patients admitted for severe malaria. Of 168 PLR tests performed, 143 had reliable PI measurements (85%). The best identified PI change cutoff to discriminate responders from non-responders was 9.7%. The accuracy of PLR using PI in discriminating a preload responsive patient at baseline was good (area under the ROC 0.87 95% CI 0.75-0.99). The test showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value, with comparably lower specificity and positive predictive value. Compared to baseline, the AUROC of PLR using PI was lower at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h.

The COSTAR (Community-led Solutions to Antimicrobial Resistance) project includes a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Community Dialog Approach (CDA) to improve levels of correct and appropriate knowledge and reported practice about antibiotics, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance (ABR) from a One Health perspective, among adult community members in 5 selected sub-districts of Cumilla. The CDA is a community engagement approach involving community members in active discussions also known as Community Dialogs (CD), run by local facilitators. The dialogs promote collective action to produce sustainable social change. The trial's process evaluation will evaluate fidelity, dose, adaptation, reach, mechanisms of impact and the process of knowledge diffusion using the MRC framework for the evaluation of complex interventions. The process evaluation will be implemented in the catchment areas of 25 selected community clinics (CCs) in the intervention group. The key actors involved in the process evaluation are participants from master trainers and trainers training; community dialog facilitators; supervisors; community dialog participants and non-participants; and local and national level government stakeholders. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected through Focus Group Discussion (FGDs); Case Studies; Key Informant Interview (KIIs); CD observations; monitoring forms; quarterly feedback from facilitators and supervisors, and pre-and-post-test questionnaires administered during the training of facilitators. All qualitative data will be coded using <i>a priori</i> coding framework in NVIVO 14. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Ethical approval was obtained from the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC): BMRC/NREC/2019-2022/427 and from the University of Leeds Faculty of Medicine and Health ethics board: MREC 20-034. All results will be disseminated through a one pager summary; infographics; peer-reviewed journal articles and national and international conferences. https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN93756764, identifier ISRCTN93756764.",

        "title": "Diagnostic techniques for visceral leishmaniasis: An overview of methods used in East Africa.",
        "abstract": "Leishmanias is a parasitic infection caused by a protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania and transmitted by sand fly, Phlebotomus fly in the old world and Lutzomyia in the New world. The disease is prevalent in the tropics, subtropics, and Southern Europe, where it affects about 1.5 million to 2 million people annually. India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil and Ethiopia account for up to 90% of all the VL cases. While Leishmania cases in Asia are declining, cases in East Africa especially in Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have been increasing. The rise in East African cases is partially attributed to ongoing armed conflicts especially in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan, which has displaced people and increased their exposure to sand fly bites. Migration from endemic to non-endemic regions, misdiagnosis, famine, malnutrition, climate change and an increase in HIV cases are other contributing factors. The clinical diagnosis of Leishmania in East Africa combines the patient's clinical signs with either serological or parasitological test, with rK39 strip and microscopy being the major methods used. Diagnosis of the condition remains challenging, as current techniques have limitations, including the inability to detect parasites in tissue, the need for specialized expertise, prohibitive costs of testing equipment, low antibody titers, and the risk of misdiagnosis due to co-infections with diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid. Various techniques, including serological and molecular parasitological methods, have been employed in attempts to address these challenges, but with limited success. This article therefore, reviews some of the techniques that have been used in Leishmania diagnosis in East Africa and discusses other available new techniques with aim of overcoming the current challenges.",

        "title": "Indian Shot (<i>Canna Indica</i> L). Leaves Provide Valuable Insights into the Management of Inflammation and Other Associated Disorders Offering Health Benefits.",
        "abstract": "Throughout history, plants have played a crucial role in advancing medicinal treatments by providing a diverse range of compounds for the development of innovative therapies. <i>Canna indica</i> L. a tropical herb of the Cannaceae family, also known as Indian shot, has a rich history of traditional use in treating ailments like inflammation, malaria, dysentery, fever, dropsy, and diarrhea. This comprehensive research invesigates the extract preparation of <i>C. indica</i> leaves using multidisciplinary analytical approaches for this extract in order to shed light on its therapeutic potentials. The research, an international collaboration involving researchers from Bangladesh and China, utilized GC-MS/MS analysis to identify bioactive compounds across different <i>C. indica</i> extracts. Biological assays were conducted to assess antimicrobial activity using the disc diffusion method (in vitro), cytotoxicity through the brine shrimp lethality assay (in vitro), analgesic effects via the acetic acid-induced writhing test (in vivo), and antidiarrheal activity with the castor oil-induced diarrhea model (in vivo). Molecular docking studies were performed to determine binding affinities with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR), Delta Opioid Receptor (DOR), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) receptors. The GC-MS/MS analysis identified 35, 43, 27, and 20 compounds in dichloromethane, aqueous, petroleum ether, and ethyl acetate extracts, respectively. The aqueous (AQSF) and dichloromethane (DCMSF) extracts showed notable antimicrobial activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria. Cytotoxicity tests indicated that ethyl acetate (EASF) and dichloromethane (DCMSF) fractions were potent. Analgesic activity was highest in DCMSF, and antidiarrheal effects were dose-dependent, with DCMSF showing the greatest efficacy. Molecular docking revealed strong affinities of Ergostane-3,5,6,12,25-pentol, 25-acetate, (3.beta.,5.alpha.,6.beta.,12.beta).- for EGFR and Norgestrel for COX-2. This research provides valuable insights into the bioactivity evaluation of <i>C. indica</i>, bridging the gap between its chemical composition and diverse biological effects. The findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in natural product-based drug discovery and underscore the significance of <i>C. indica</i> as a potential source of novel therapeutic agents to treat inflammation and other disease states.",

        "title": "The Frequency and Incidence of QT Prolongation With Extended Use of Bedaquiline or Delamanid in a Large, Multi-Country Multidrug-Resistant/Rifampicin-Resistant Tuberculosis Cohort.",
        "abstract": "The 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) recommend 6 months of bedaquiline (Bdq) in the all-oral 9-month shorter regimen and 6 months or longer for Bdq and delamanid (Dlm) in the 18-20-month longer regimen. However, lack of evidence on extended treatment using Bdq or Dlm has limited their use to 6 months. We examine the frequency and incidence of QT prolongation based on duration of Bdq and/or Dlm use in longer regimens. We analyzed a prospective cohort of MDR/RR-TB patients from 16 countries who initiated treatment with Bdq and/or Dlm containing regimens from 1 April 2015 to 30 September 2018. Data were systematically collected using a shared protocol. The outcome of interest was the first clinically relevant prolonged QT interval (grade 3 or above) or a serious adverse event (SAE) involving prolonged QT of any grade. Among 2553 patients, 59% received >6 months of Bdq and/or Dlm. Of these, 579 (20.9%) patients experienced a prolonged QT event, the majority (95.5%) being grade 1 or 2. Sixty-four (2.5%) patients experienced the outcome of interest with only 12 (0.5%) having ≥1 QT prolonging drugs permanently suspended. The incidence rate of the first prolonged QT event was highest in the first six months of treatment and lower in subsequent 6-month periods. We demonstrate that Bdq and/or Dlm use beyond 6 months is safe in longer MDR/RR-TB regimens with most clinically relevant QT prolongation events occurring in the first 6 months. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for early identification of QT prolongating events is possible in programmatic conditions.",

In total, 16 publications from 2007 to 2024 were manually screened for inclusion in this systematic review. The articles were divided into three categories: climate and water, climate and health, and climate, water, and health. Due to the climate change, 20 million individuals in Bangladesh have been suffering from water- and health-related illness. The results showed that among Bangladeshi vulnerable groups, cholera, infant diarrhea, pneumonia, dengue, malaria, mental illness, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and an increase in communicable diseases like water-, vector-, and food-borne infections, along with malnutrition, are common. Further findings of the study include health risks, water-related risks, and difficulties in determining the consequences of climate change. This review study focuses on Bangladesh, a developing country, and the correlation between climate change and the dangers of water and health-related diseases. The findings of this study have substantial implications for risk assessment, water quality, climate change, and public health, especially in poor nations, as well as for policymakers and academicians in these fields.",

        "abstract": "The August 2024 floods in Bangladesh have precipitated a major public health crisis, significantly elevating the risk of waterborne and vector-borne diseases and exacerbating existing health vulnerabilities. This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

        "abstract": "Malaria poses a serious issue for pregnant women in African regions. It is crucial to comprehend the various factors that impact receiving IPTp during ANC checkups. These are important for the well-being of both pregnant mothers and their unborn children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the determinants of IPTp coverage among women in Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, and Nigeria. This cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) across Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, and Nigeria, focusing on women who received IPTp during pregnancy with IPTp categorized dichotomously as \"Yes\" for ANC visits and \"No\" for other visits. Chi-squared tests were used to assess associations, and binary logistic regression was conducted to calculate adjusted odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values. Results were summarized in tables. We found IPTp coverage during ANC visits was highest in Cameroon (98.6%), followed by Guinea (97.7%), Mali (97.1%), and lowest in Nigeria (95.5%). In Guinea, rural women were less likely to receive IPTp than urban women (AOR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07-0.41, p<0.001). In Mali, women who received 3 or more doses were less likely to receive IPTp at ANC (AOR: 0.48, p<0.01). In Nigeria, personal transport increased IPTp uptake (AOR: 1.88, p<0.01). In Cameroon, malaria prevention messages improved IPTp coverage (AOR: 3.12, p<0.05). This study highlights significant disparities in IPTp uptake, with rural Mali and Guinea facing lower coverage. In Nigeria, personal transport improved IPTp uptake. Targeted interventions are needed to improve ANC services and ensure equitable IPTp access across the study regions.",

        "title": "The 2024 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: facing record-breaking threats from delayed action.",
        "abstract": "Despite the initial hope inspired by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world is now dangerously close to breaching its target of limiting global multiyear mean heating to 1·5°C. Annual mean surface temperature reached a record high of 1·45°C above the pre-industrial baseline in 2023, and new temperature highs were recorded throughout 2024. The resulting climatic extremes are increasingly claiming lives and livelihoods worldwide. The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established the same year the Paris Agreement entered into force, to monitor the health impacts and opportunities of the world’s response to this landmark agreement. Supported through strategic core funding from Wellcome, the collaboration brings together over 300 multidisciplinary researchers and health professionals from around the world to take stock annually of the evolving links between health and climate change at global, regional, and national levels. The 2024 report of the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown, building on the expertise of 122 leading researchers from UN agencies and academic institutions worldwide, reveals the most concerning findings yet in the collaboration’s 8 years of monitoring. Data in this year’s report show that people all around the world are facing record-breaking threats to their wellbeing, health, and survival from the rapidly changing climate. Of the 15 indicators monitoring climate change-related health hazards, exposures, and impacts, ten reached concerning new records in their most recent year of data. Heat-related mortality of people older than 65 years increased by a record-breaking 167%, compared with the 1990s, 102 percentage points higher than the 65% that would have been expected without temperature rise (indicator 1.1.5). Heat exposure is also increasingly affecting physical activity and sleep quality, in turn affecting physical and mental health. In 2023, heat exposure put people engaging in outdoor physical activity at risk of heat stress (moderate or higher) for a record high of 27·7% more hours than on average in the 1990s (indicator 1.1.2) and led to a record 6% more hours of sleep lost in 2023 than the average during 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.4). People worldwide are also increasingly at risk from life-threatening extreme weather events. Between 1961–90 and 2014–23, 61% of the global land area saw an increase in the number of days of extreme precipitation (indicator 1.2.3), which in turn increases the risk of flooding, infectious disease spread, and water contamination. In parallel, 48% of the global land area was affected by at least 1 month of extreme drought in 2023, the second largest affected area since 1951 (indicator 1.2.2). The increase in drought and heatwave events since 1981–2010 was, in turn, associated with 151 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity across 124 countries assessed in 2022, the highest recorded value (indicator 1.4.2). The hotter and drier weather conditions are increasingly favouring the occurrence of sand and dust storms. This weather-environmental phenomenon contributed to a 31% increase in the number of people exposed to dangerously high particulate matter concentrations between 2003–07 and 2018–22 (indicator 1.2.4). Meanwhile, changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are favouring the transmission of deadly infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, West Nile virus-related illness, and vibriosis, putting people at risk of transmission in previously unaffected locations (indicators 1.3.1–1.3.4). Compounding these impacts, climate change is affecting the social and economic conditions on which health and wellbeing depend. The average annual economic losses from weather-related extreme events increased by 23% from 2010–14 to 2019–23, to US$227 billion (a value exceeding the gross domestic product [GDP] of about 60% of the world’s economies; indicator 4.1.1). Although 60·5% of losses in very high Human Development Index (HDI) countries were covered by insurance, the vast majority of those in countries with lower HDI levels were uninsured, with local communities bearing the brunt of the physical and economic losses (indicator 4.1.1). Extreme weather and climate change-related health impacts are also affecting labour productivity, with heat exposure leading to a record high loss of 512 billion potential labour hours in 2023, worth $835 billion in potential income losses (indicators 1.1.3 and 4.1.3). Low and medium HDI countries were most affected by these losses, which amounted to 7·6% and 4·4% of their GDP, respectively (indicator 4.1.3). With the most underserved communities most affected, these economic impacts further reduce their capacity to cope with and recover from the growing impacts of climate change, thereby amplifying global inequities. Concerningly, multiple hazards revealed by individual indicators are likely to have simultaneous compounding and cascading impacts on the complex and inter-connected human systems that sustain good health, disproportionately threatening people’s health and survival with every fraction of a degree of increase in global mean temperature. Despite years of monitoring exposing the imminent health threats of climate inaction, the health risks people face have been exacerbated by years of delays in adaptation, which have left people ill-protected from the growing threats of climate change. Only 68% of countries reported high-to-very-high implementation of legally mandated health emergency management capacities in 2023, of which just 11% were low HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Moreover, only 35% of countries reported having health early warning systems for heat-related illness, whereas 10% did so for mental and psychosocial conditions (indicator 2.2.1). Scarcity of financial resources was identified as a key barrier to adaptation, including by 50% of the cities that reported they were not planning to undertake climate change and health risk assessments (indicator 2.1.3). Indeed, adaptation projects with potential health benefits represented just 27% of all the Green Climate Fund’s adaptation funding in 2023, despite a 137% increase since 2021 (indicator 2.2.4). With universal health coverage still unattained in most countries, financial support is needed to strengthen health systems and ensure that they can protect people from growing climate change-related health hazards. The unequal distribution of financial resources and technical capacity is leaving the most vulnerable populations further unprotected from the growing health risks. As well as exposing the inadequacy of adaptation efforts to date, this year’s report reveals a world veering away from the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1·5°C, with concerning new records broken across indicators monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that enable them. Far from declining, global energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reached an all-time high in 2023 (indicator 3.1.1). Oil and gas companies are reinforcing the global dependence on fossil fuels and—partly fuelled by the high energy prices and windfall profits of the global energy crisis—most are further expanding their fossil fuel production plans. As of March, 2024, the 114 largest oil and gas companies were on track to exceed emissions consistent with 1·5°C of heating by 189% in 2040, up from 173% 1 year before (indicator 4.2.2). As a result, their strategies are pushing the world further off track from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, further threatening people’s health and survival. Although renewable energy could provide power to remote locations, its adoption is lagging, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The consequences of this delay reflect the human impacts of an unjust transition. Globally, 745 million people still lack access to electricity and are facing the harms of energy poverty on health and wellbeing. The burning of polluting biomass (eg, wood or dung) still accounts for 92% of the energy used in the home by people in low HDI countries (indicator 3.1.2), and only 2·3% of electricity in these countries comes from clean renewables, compared with 11·6% in very high HDI countries (indicators 3.1.1). This persistent burning of fossil fuel and biomass led to at least 3·33 million deaths from outdoor fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2·5</sub>) air pollution globally in 2021 alone (indicator 3.2.1), and the domestic use of dirty solid fuels caused 2·3 million deaths from indoor air pollution in 2020 across 65 countries analysed (indicator 3.2.2). Compounding the growth in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, almost 182 million hectares of forests were lost between 2016 and 2022 (indicator 3.4), reducing the world’s natural capacity to capture atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. In parallel, the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which contributed to 11·2 million deaths attributable to unhealthy diets in 2021 (indicator 3.3.2), has led to a 2·9% increase in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions since 2016 (indicator 3.3.1). Health systems themselves, although essential to protect people’s health, are also increasingly contributing to the problem. Greenhouse gas emissions from health care have increased by 36% since 2016, making health systems increasingly unprepared to operate in a net zero emissions future and pushing health care further from its guiding principle of doing no harm (indicator 3.5). The growing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is pushing the world to a future of increasingly dangerous health hazards and reducing the chances of survival of vulnerable people all around the globe. With the availability of financial resources a key barrier to tackling climate change, a rapid growth in predictable and equitable investment is urgently needed to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. A growing body of literature shows that the economic benefits of a transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions will far exceed the costs of inaction. Healthier, more resilient populations will further support more prosperous and sustainable economies (indicators 4.1.2–4.1.4). However, although funding to enable potentially life-saving climate change adaptation and mitigation activities remains scarce, substantial financial resources are being allocated to activities that harm health and perpetuate a fossil fuel-based economy. The resulting reliance on fossil fuel energy has meant many countries faced sharp increases in energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruption of fossil fuel supplies. To keep energy affordable to local populations, many governments resorted to increasing their explicit fossil fuel subsidies. Consequently, 84% of countries studied still operated net negative carbon prices (explicit net fossil fuel subsidies) in 2022, for a record high net total of $1·4 trillion (indicator 4.3.3), with the sums involved often comparable to countries’ total health budgets. In addition, although clean energy investment grew by 10% globally in 2023—exceeding fossil fuel investment by 73%—considerable regional disparities exist. Clean energy investment is 38% lower than fossil fuel spending in emerging market and developing economies outside China. Clean energy spending in these countries only accounted for 17·4% of the global total. Moreover, investment in energy efficiency and end use, essential for a just transition, decreased by 1·3% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1). The resulting expansion of fossil fuel assets is increasingly jeopardising the economies on which people’s livelihoods depend. On the current trajectory, the world already faces potential global income losses ranging from 11% to 29% by 2050. The number of fossil fuel industry employees reached 11·8 million in 2022, increasing the size of a workforce whose employment cannot be sustained in a world that avoids the most catastrophic human impacts of climate change (indicator 4.2.1). Meanwhile, ongoing investments in coal power have pushed the value of coal-fired power generation assets that risk becoming stranded within 10 years (between 2025 and 2034) in a 1·5°C trajectory to a cumulative total of $164·5 billion—a value that will increase if coal investments persist (indicator 4.2.3). The prioritisation of fossil fuel-based systems means most countries remain ill-prepared for the vital transition to zero greenhouse gas emission economies. As a result of an unjust transition, the risk is unequally distributed: preparedness scores for the transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy were below the global average in all countries with a low HDI, 96% of those with a medium HDI, and 84% of those with a high HDI, compared with just 7% of very high HDI countries (indicator 4.2.4). Following decades of delays in climate change action, avoiding the most severe health impacts of climate change now requires aligned, structural, and sustained changes across most human systems, including energy, transportation, agriculture, food, and health care. Importantly, a global transformation of financial systems is required, shifting resources away from the fossil fuel-based economy towards a zero emissions future. Putting people’s health at the centre of climate change policy making is key to ensuring this transition protects wellbeing, reduces health inequities, and maximises health gains. Some indicators reveal incipient progress and important opportunities for delivering this health-centred transformation. As of December, 2023, 50 countries reported having formally assessed their health vulnerabilities and adaptation needs, up from 11 the previous year, and the number of countries that reported having a Health National Adaptation Plan increased from four in 2022 to 43 in 2023 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Additionally, 70% of 279 public health education institutions worldwide reported providing education in climate and health in 2023, essential to build capacities for health professionals to help shape this transition (indicator 2.2.6). Regarding the energy sector, the global share of electricity from clean modern renewables reached a record high of 10·5% in 2021 (indicator 3.1.1); clean energy investment exceeded fossil fuel investment by 73% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1); and renewable energy-related employment has grown 35·6% since 2016, providing healthier and more sustainable employment opportunities than those in the fossil fuel industry (indicator 4.2.1). Importantly, mostly as a result of coal phase-down in high and very high HDI countries, deaths attributable to outdoor PM<sub>2·5</sub> from fossil fuel combustion decreased by 6·9% between 2016 and 2021 (indicator 3.2.1), showing the life-saving potential of coal phase-out. Important progress was made within international negotiations, which opened new opportunities to protect health in the face of climate change. After years of leadership from WHO on climate change and health, its Fourteenth General Programme of Work, adopted in May, 2024, made responding to climate change its first strategic priority. Within climate negotiations themselves, the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) featured the first health thematic day in 2023: 151 countries endorsed the COP28 United Arab Emirates Declaration on Climate and Health, and the Global Goal on Adaptation set a specific health target. The outcome of the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement also recognised the right to health and a healthy environment, urging parties to take further health adaptation efforts, and opened a new opportunity for human survival, health, and wellbeing to be prioritised in the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) due in 2025. The pending decision of how the Loss and Damage fund will be governed and the definition of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance during COP29 provide further opportunities to secure the financial support crucial for a healthy net zero transition. Although still insufficient to protect people’s health from climate change, these emerging signs of progress help open new opportunities to deliver a healthy, prosperous future. However, much remains to be done. With climate change breaking dangerous new records and emissions persistently rising, preventing the most catastrophic consequences on human development, health, and survival now requires the support and will of all actors in society. However, data suggest that engagement with health and climate change could be declining across key sectors: the number of governments mentioning health and climate change in their annual UN General Debate statements fell from 50% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, and only 47% of the 58 NDCs updated as of February, 2024, referred to health (indicator 5.4.1). Media engagement also dropped, with the proportion of newspaper climate change articles mentioning health falling 10% between 2022 and 2023 (indicator 5.1). The powerful and trusted leadership of the health community could hold the key to reversing these concerning trends and making people’s wellbeing, health, and survival a central priority of political and financial agendas. The engagement of health professionals at all levels of climate change decision making will be pivotal in informing the redirection of efforts and financial resources away from activities that jeopardise people’s health towards supporting healthy populations, prosperous economies, and a safer future. As concerning records continue to be broken and people face unprecedented risks from climate change, the wellbeing, health, and survival of individuals in every country now hang in the balance.",

        "abstract": "Among 13 endemic districts, the Chittagong Hill Tracts bear more than 90% of Bangladesh's malaria burden. Despite the private sector's prominence in rural healthcare, its role in malaria management remains underutilized. This study aimed to strategize leveraging the for-profit private sector, such as diagnostic and treatment centers, to bolster national malaria surveillance and control, advancing Bangladesh toward malaria elimination by 2030. This mixed-method study commenced with a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey followed by selected focused group discussions (FGDs) among the participants. Three FGDs were held with the for-profit service providers so that further insights and qualitative viewpoints of them can be utilized in situation analysis. Based on the endemicity and strategic priorities, a comprehensive mapping of private for-profit facilities from the regions comprising 15 sub-districts across 8 chosen districts (7 malaria endemic districts and the rest non-endemic districts) was created. For the non-endemic zone, the sub-districts were selected based on their proximity to an area with high malaria transmission. Among the 104 representative participants, majority were male (n = 92, 88.5%), had a diploma in their respective fields (n = 53, 51%) and were involved either in laboratory work (n = 49, 47.1%) or as owners/managers of health centers (n = 41, 39.4%). The selected health facilities were close to the corresponding Upazila Health Complexes (mean distance 2.8 km), but were distantly located from the designated district hospitals (mean distance 48.9 km). The main sources of RDT kits (62.3%) and anti-malarial drugs (63.2%) were local wholesale markets. A large share of the corresponding facilities neither provided malaria treatment services (81.7%) nor worked with the NMEP (93.3%). This study highlights challenges and recommendations for engaging private for-profit health facilities in Bangladesh's malaria elimination efforts. The identified challenges include low-quality RDTs, staff shortages, and inadequate capacity building. Recommendations emphasize effective training, stakeholder interaction, and enhanced oversight for successful malaria control efforts.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary oedema is a feared and difficult to predict complication of severe malaria that can emerge after start of antimalarial treatment. Proinflammatory mediators are thought to play a central role in its pathogenesis. An exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the predictive capacity of biomarkers for development of clinical pulmonary oedema in patients with severe falciparum malaria at two hospitals in Bangladesh. Plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), soluble Receptor of Advanced Glycation End-products (sRAGE), surfactant protein-D (SP-D), club cell secretory protein (CC16), and Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) on admission were compared with healthy controls. Correlations between these biomarker and plasma lactate and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) levels were evaluated. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the predictive capacity for clinical pulmonary oedema of the biomarkers of interest. Of 106 screened patients with falciparum malaria, 56 were classified as having severe malaria with a mortality rate of 29%. Nine (16%) patients developed clinical pulmonary oedema after admission. Plasma levels of the biomarkers of interest were higher in patients compared to healthy controls. IL-6, IL-8, TNF, sRAGE, and CC16 levels correlated well with plasma PfHRP2 levels (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.39; P = 0.004, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.43; P = 0.001, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.54; P < 0.001, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.44; P < 0.001, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.43; P = 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-8 levels correlated well with plasma lactate levels (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.37; P = 0.005, r<sub>s</sub> = 0.47; P < 0.001, respectively). None of the biomarkers of interest had predictive capacity for development of clinical pulmonary oedema. IL-6, IL-8, TNF, sRAGE, SP-D, CC16 and KL-6 cannot be used in predicting clinical pulmonary oedema in severe malaria patients.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a life-threatening cause of stroke in Asian countries. South Asia, comprising of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, contributed to 40% of strokes in women. Major CVT registries are from the Western nations, which differs from the Asian countries with respect to epidemiology, gender biases, and risk factors. This review focuses on the various aspects of relevance in evaluation and management of patients with CVT in the Asian context. The incidence of CVT is higher in Asia than in Western nations. Young age, female gender, especially in pregnancy and puerperal period, and dehydration appear to be the critical risk factors. Tropical infections like malaria, scrub typhus, and flaviviral encephalitis predispose to CVT. There is a higher prevalence of inherited thrombophilia in the Asian cohorts, contributing to prothrombotic states. Anticoagulation and supportive management offer excellent outcomes. Newer anticoagulants are safe and efficacious. In medically refractory cases, endovascular treatment offers modest benefits. Decompressive hemicraniectomy, when done early, offers mortality benefits in patients with large hemorrhagic venous infarctions. CVT is an important cause of stroke with a high burden in South Asian countries. Establishment of robust registries is the need of the hour to study the natural history, course, and outcomes and to develop management algorithms tailored to the available resources.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh reduced malaria incidence by 93% from 2008 to 2020 through the action of governmental and non-governmental organizations. The Bangladesh context is unique to South Asia because its successful public sector malaria control programs have historically not engaged corporate partners (as undertaken in Sri Lanka and proposed in India). However, ∼18 million people continue to live at risk of infection in Bangladesh and for-profit private healthcare providers, catalytic for malaria elimination in many countries, are expected to benefit the national program. We distilled (from a large and complex literature) nine distinct strategies important in other developing settings and weighed them in the context of Bangladesh's flourishing private health care sector, driven by patient demand, self-interest and aspirations for public good, as well as heterogeneity in providers and malaria-prevalence. We propose a new model dependent on five strategies and its immediate deployment considerations in high endemic areas, to empower Bangladesh's phased agenda of eliminating indigenous malaria transmission by 2030.",

        "abstract": "This is important to note that altered mental status is not a disease in itself, but rather a symptom with a wide range of potential diagnoses. But a structured approach to assessing the patients with this symptom frequently leads to helpful information and can rule out worst-case scenarios. In cases where fever is followed by changes in consciousness, quick assessment of the patient's level of consciousness and potential causes is decisive. A focused history and physical assessment can help differentiate between structural or medical causes. Asymmetrical neurological findings, such as a dilated and fixed pupil, dysconjugated extraocular movements and asymmetrical motor findings, suggest brainstem dysfunction due to a structural lesion, while symmetrical neurological findings usually indicate a medical disorder. A recent study aimed to identify features of different etiologies, demographic patterns, and common causes of both acute and prolonged febrile illness in patients. This cross-sectional type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from April 2014 to October 2015. Over the study period patients admitted with satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of study and purposively selected (non-probability) from the hospitalized patients. Total 100 cases with febrile illness and altered consciousness meeting the exclusion and inclusion criteria were examined and investigated to find out the actual etiology. Out of 100 patients, it was observed that 26(26.0%) of patients were suffering from pneumonia, 22(22.0%) urinary tract infection, 18(18.0%) meningitis, 14(14.0%) typhoid fever, 8(8.0%) meningo-encephalitis, 6(6.0%) cerebral malaria, 4(4.0%) tuberculosis and 2(2.0%) from tuberculoma. The result revealed that large number of patients with febrile illness and altered consciousness were suffering from pneumonia and urinary tract infection.",

        "abstract": "Existing antimalarial drugs primarily target blood-stage parasites, but there is a need for transmission-blocking drugs to combat malaria effectively. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Calcium-dependent Protein Kinase 4 (CDPK4) is a promising target for such drugs. This study employed advanced in silico analyses of hexahydroquinolines (HHQ) derivatives to identify <i>Pf</i>CDPK4 inhibitors capable of disrupting malaria transmission. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was employed to discover HHQ derivatives with the highest binding affinities against the 3D structure of <i>Pf</i>CDPK4 (PDB 1D: 4QOX). Interaction analysis of protein-ligand complexes utilized Discovery Studio Client, while druglikeness and ADMET properties were assessed using SwissADME and pkCSM web servers, respectively. Quantum mechanical calculations of the top hits were conducted using density functional theory (DFT), and GROMACS was employed to perform the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Binding free energy was predicted using the MMPBSA.py tool from the AMBER package. SBVS identified ten best hits possessing docking scores within the range of -11.2 kcal/mol and -10.6 kcal/mol, surpassing the known inhibitor, BKI-1294 (-9.9 kcal/mol). Among these, 4-[4-(Furan-2-carbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]-1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-oxo-4a,5,6,7,8,8a-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbonitrile (PubChem ID: 145784778) exhibited the highest binding affinity (-11.2 kcal/mol) against <i>Pf</i>CDPK4. Comparative analysis of this compound with BKI-1294 using advanced computational approaches demonstrated competitive potential. These findings suggest the potential of 4-[4-(Furan-2-carbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]-1-(naphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-2-oxo-4a,5,6,7,8,8a-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbonitrile as a promising <i>Pf</i>CDPK4 inhibitor for disrupting malaria transmission.

        "abstract": "The emergence of acute neurological symptoms in children necessitates immediate intervention. Although low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden of neurological diseases, there is a scarcity of diagnostic and therapeutic resources. Therefore, current understanding of the etiology of neurological emergencies in LMICs relies mainly on clinical diagnoses and verbal autopsies. To characterize the association of premortem neurological symptoms and their management with postmortem-confirmed cause of death among children aged younger than 5 years in LMICs and to identify current gaps and improve strategies to enhance child survival. This cross-sectional study was conducted between December 3, 2016, and July 22, 2022, at the 7 participating sites in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa). Minimally invasive tissue sampling was performed at the CHAMPS sites with specimens from deceased children aged younger than 5 years. This study included deceased children who underwent a premortem neurological evaluation and had a postmortem-confirmed cause of death. Data analysis was performed between July 22, 2022, and January 15, 2023. Descriptive analysis was performed using neurological evaluations from premortem clinical records and from postmortem determination of cause of death (based on histopathology, microbiological testing, clinical records, and verbal autopsies). Of the 2127 deaths of children codified during the study period, 1330 (62.5%) had neurological evaluations recorded and were included in this analysis. The 1330 children had a median age of 11 (IQR, 2-324) days; 745 (56.0%) were male and 727 (54.7%) presented with neurological symptoms during illness before death. The most common postmortem-confirmed neurological diagnoses related to death were hypoxic events (308 [23.2%]), meningoencephalitis (135 [10.2%]), and cerebral malaria (68 [5.1%]). There were 12 neonates with overlapping hypoxic events and meningoencephalitis, but there were no patients with overlapping meningoencephalitis and cerebral malaria. Neurological symptoms were similar among diagnoses, and no combination of symptoms was accurate in differentiating them without complementary tools. However, only 25 children (18.5%) with meningitis had a lumbar puncture performed before death. Nearly 90% of deaths (442 of 511 [86.5%]) with neurological diagnoses in the chain of events leading to death were considered preventable. In this cross-sectional study of children aged younger than 5 years, neurological symptoms were frequent before death. However, clinical phenotypes were insufficient to differentiate the most common underlying neurological diagnoses. The low rate of lumbar punctures performed was especially worrying, suggesting a challenge in quality of care of children presenting with neurological symptoms. Improved diagnostic management of neurological emergencies is necessary to ultimately reduce mortality in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Climate change is a significant risk multiplier and profoundly influences the transmission dynamics, geographical distribution, and resurgence of vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Bangladesh has a noticeable rise in VBDs attributed to climate change. Despite the severity of this issue, the interconnections between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this research gap, our review meticulously examined existing literature on the relationship between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, we identified 3849 records from SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Ultimately, 22 research articles meeting specific criteria were included. We identified that the literature on the subject matter of this study is non-contemporaneous, with 68% of studies investing datasets before 2014, despite studies on climate change and dengue nexus having increased recently. We pinpointed Dhaka and Chittagong Hill Tracts as the dengue and malaria research hotspots, respectively. We highlighted that the 2023 dengue outbreak illustrates a possible shift in dengue-endemic areas in Bangladesh. Moreover, dengue cases surged by 317% in 2023 compared to 2019 records, with a corresponding 607% increase in mortality compared to 2022. A weak connection was observed between dengue incidents and climate drivers, including the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). However, no compelling evidence supported an association between malaria cases, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Bay of Bengal, along with the NINO3 phenomenon. We observed minimal microclimatic and non-climatic data inclusion in selected studies. Our review holds implications for policymakers, urging the prioritization of mitigation measures such as year-round surveillance and early warning systems. Ultimately, it calls for resource allocation to empower researchers in advancing the understanding of VBD dynamics amidst changing climates.",

        "abstract": "Undernutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a small vulnerable newborn. Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) contain both macro- and micronutrients and can help prevent multiple nutritional deficiencies. We examined the effects of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy compared with 1) iron and folic acid or standard of care (IFA/SOC) or 2) multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) and identified characteristics that modified the estimates of effects of SQ-LNSs on birth outcomes. We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 4 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy (n = 5273). We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with IFA/SOC or MMS and pooled the estimates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether the results differed depending on methods for gestational age dating, birth anthropometry, or study design. SQ-LNSs (compared with IFA/SOC) increased birth weight [mean difference: +49 g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 26, 71 g] and all birth anthropometric z-scores (+0.10-0.13 standard deviation); they reduced risk of low birth weight by 11%, newborn stunting by 17%, newborn wasting by 11%, and small head size by 15%. Only 2 trials compared SQ-LNSs and MMSs; P values for birth outcomes were >0.10 except for head circumference (e.g., z-score for gestational age: +0.11; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.23). Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with IFA/SOC were greater among female infants and, for certain outcomes, among mothers with body mass index <20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, inflammation, malaria, or household food insecurity. Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with MMSs were greater for certain outcomes among female infants, first-born infants, and mothers <25 y. SQ-LNSs had positive impacts on multiple outcomes compared to IFA/SOC, but further research directly comparing SQ-LNSs and MMSs is needed. Targeting SQ-LNSs to vulnerable subgroups may be worth considering. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021283391.",

        "abstract": "Surveillance and sustained control of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) require reliable serodiagnostic tools. rK39, the gold standard antigen for VL diagnosis, is limited by its documented poor sensitivity in certain endemic regions, such as East Africa, and by the longevity of its antibodies, making it difficult to distinguish active from cured infections. In a recent publication in <i>mBio</i>, Roberts et al. (A. J. Roberts, H.B. Ong, S. Clare, C. Brandt, et al., mBio 15:e00859-24, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00859-24) identified new immunogenic <i>Leishmania</i> candidates in dogs and humans. In dogs, combined antigens LdBPK_290790.1 + LdBPK_362700.1 (D4 +D46) distinguished symptomatic from asymptomatic infections. For humans, LdBPK_323600.1 (D36) antigen produced short-lived antibodies and performed well in patient cohorts from Bangladesh and Ethiopia, but not Kenya. This study adds promising new candidates to our serodiagnostic toolbox but highlights the need for more antigen discovery studies that may have to be focused on regional performance.",

        "title": "The spectrum of health conditions in community-based cross-sectional surveys in Southeast Asia 2010-21: a scoping review.",
        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

        "title": "Seasonal variability and stochastic branching process in malaria outbreak probability.",
        "abstract": "Malaria is the world's most fatal and challenging parasitic disease, caused by the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected female mosquitoes. Bangladesh is the most vulnerable region to spread malaria because of its geographic position. In this paper, we have considered the dynamics of vector-host models and observed the stochastic behavior. This study elaborates on the seasonal variability and calculates the probability of disease outbreaks. We present a model for malaria disease transmission and develop its corresponding continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) representation. The proposed vector-host models illustrate the malaria transmission model along with sensitivity analysis. The deterministic model with CTMC curves is depicted to show the randomness in real scenarios. Sequentially, we expand these studies to a time-varying stochastic vector-host model that incorporates seasonal variability. Phase plane analysis is conducted to explore the characteristics of the disease, examine interactions among various compartments, and evaluate the impact of key parameters. The branching process approximation is developed for the corresponding vector-host model to calculate the probability outbreak. Numerous numerical results are accomplished to observe the analytical investigation. Seasonality and contact patterns affect the dynamics of disease outbreaks. The numerical illustration provides that the probability of a disease outbreak depends on the infected host or vector. Additionally, periodic transmission rates have a great influence on the probability outbreak. The basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) is derived, which is the main justification for studying the dynamical behavior of epidemic models. Seasonal variability significantly impacts malaria transmission, and the probability of disease outbreaks is influenced by time and the initial number of infected individuals. Moreover, the branching process approximation is applicable when the population size is large enough and the basic reproduction number is less than 1. In the future, such analysis can help decision-makers understand the impact of various parameters and their stochastic behavior in the vector-host model to prevent such types of disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "A number of studies have detected relationships between weather and diarrhea. Few have investigated associations with specific enteric pathogens. Understanding pathogen-specific relationships with weather is crucial to inform public health in low-resource settings that are especially vulnerable to climate change. Our objectives were to identify weather and environmental risk factors associated with diarrhea and enteropathogen prevalence in young children in rural Bangladesh, a population with high diarrheal disease burden and vulnerability to weather shifts under climate change. We matched temperature, precipitation, surface water, and humidity data to observational longitudinal data from a cluster-randomized trial that measured diarrhea and enteropathogen prevalence in children 6 months-5.5 years from 2012-2016. We fit generalized additive mixed models with cubic regression splines and restricted maximum likelihood estimation for smoothing parameters. Comparing weeks with 30°C versus 15°C average temperature, prevalence was 3.5% higher for diarrhea, 7.3% higher for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), 17.3% higher for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and 8.0% higher for Cryptosporidium. Above-median weekly precipitation (median: 13mm; range: 0-396mm) was associated with 29% higher diarrhea (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.07, 1.55); higher Cryptosporidium, ETEC, STEC, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, and adenovirus 40/41; and lower Giardia, sapovirus, and norovirus prevalence. Other associations were weak or null. Higher temperatures and precipitation were associated with higher prevalence of diarrhea and multiple enteropathogens; higher precipitation was associated with lower prevalence of some enteric viruses. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneity of the relationships between hydrometeorological variables and specific enteropathogens, which can be masked when looking at composite measures like all-cause diarrhea. Our results suggest that preventive interventions targeted to reduce enteropathogens just before and during the rainy season may more effectively reduce child diarrhea and enteric pathogen carriage in rural Bangladesh and in settings with similar meteorological characteristics, infrastructure, and enteropathogen transmission.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains one the leading communicable causes of death. Approximately half of the world's population is considered at risk of infection, predominantly in African and South Asian countries. Although malaria is preventable, heterogeneity in sociodemographic and environmental risk factors over time and across diverse geographical and climatological regions make outbreak prediction challenging. Data-driven approaches accounting for spatiotemporal variability could offer potential for location-specific early warning tools for malaria. In this case study, we developed and internally validated a data fusion approach to predict malaria incidence in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh using geo-referenced environmental factors. For 2000-17, district-level malaria incidence rates for each country were obtained from the US Agency for International Development's Demographic and Health Survey datasets. Environmental factors included average annual temperature, rainfall, and normalised difference vegetation index, obtained from the Advancing Research on Nutrition and Agriculture (known as AReNA) project conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute in 2020. Data on night-time light intensity was derived from two satellites of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System: Nighttime Lights Time Series Version 4, and VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites version 1. A multi-dimensional spatiotemporal long short-term memory (M-LSTM) model was developed using data from 2000-16 and internally validated for the year 2017. The M-LSTM model consisted of four hidden layers, each with 100 LSTM units; a fully connected layer was used, followed by linear regression, to predict the malaria incidence rate for 2017 using spatiotemporal partitioning. Model performance was measured using accuracy and root mean squared error. Country-specific models were produced for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Bivariate geospatial heatmaps were produced for a qualitative comparison of univariate environmental factors with malaria rates. Malaria incidence was predicted with 80·6% accuracy in districts across Pakistan, 76·7% in districts across India, and 99·1% in districts across Bangladesh. The root mean squared error was 7 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for Pakistan, 4·86 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for India, and 1·32 × 10<sup>-5</sup> for Bangladesh. Bivariate maps showed an inverse relationship between night-time lights and malaria rates; whereas high malaria rates were found in areas with high temperature, rainfall, and vegetation. Malaria outbreaks could be forecasted using remotely measured environmental factors. Modelling techniques that enable simultaneously forecasting ahead in time as well as across large geographical areas might potentially empower regional decision makers to manage outbreaks early.

        "abstract": "Systems for disease vector control should be effective, efficient, and flexible to be able to tackle contemporary challenges and threats in the control and elimination of vector-borne diseases. As a priority activity towards the strengthening of vector control systems, it has been advocated that countries conduct a vector-control needs assessment. A review was carried out of the perceived needs for disease vector control programs among eleven countries and subnational states in South Asia and the Middle East. In each country or state, independent teams conducted vector control needs assessment with engagement of stakeholders. Important weaknesses were described for malaria, dengue and leishmaniases regarding vector surveillance, insecticide susceptibility testing, monitoring and evaluation of operations, entomological capacity and laboratory infrastructure. In addition, community mobilization and intersectoral collaboration showed important gaps. Countries and states expressed concern about insecticide resistance that could reduce the continued effectiveness of interventions, which demands improved monitoring. Moreover, attainment of disease elimination necessitates enhanced vector surveillance. Vector control needs assessment provided a useful planning tool for systematic strengthening of vector control systems. A limitation in conducting the vector control needs assessment was that it is time- and resource-intensive. To increase the feasibility and utility of national assessments, an abridged version of the guidance should focus on operationally relevant topics of the assessment.

        "title": "Global burden of 288 causes of death and life expectancy decomposition in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

        "abstract": "In low-income and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia, the burden of diseases among rural population remains poorly understood, posing a challenge for effective healthcare prioritisation and resource allocation. Addressing this knowledge gap, the South and Southeast Asia Community-based Trials Network (SEACTN) will undertake a survey that aims to determine the prevalence of a wide range of non-communicable and communicable diseases, as one of the key initiatives of its first project-the Rural Febrile Illness project (RFI). This survey, alongside other RFI studies that explore fever aetiology, leading causes of mortality, and establishing village and health facility maps and profiles, will provide an updated epidemiological background of the rural areas where the network is operational. During 2022-2023, a cross-sectional household survey will be conducted across three SEACTN sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Thailand. Using a two-stage cluster-sampling approach, we will employ a probability-proportional-to-size sample method for village, and a simple random sample for household, selection, enrolling all members from the selected households. Approximately 1500 participants will be enrolled per country. Participants will undergo questionnaire interview, physical examination and haemoglobin point-of-care testing. Blood samples will be collected and sent to central laboratories to test for chronic and acute infections, and biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Prevalences will be presented as an overall estimate by country, and stratified and compared across sites and participants' sociodemographic characteristics.

        "abstract": "Antimalarial drug resistance poses a severe danger to global health. In Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), there is a lack of reliable information on antimalarial prescriptions for recent malarial fever in children under five. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of unqualified sources of antimalarial drug prescription for children under the age of five in 19 low- and middle-income countries. We performed a cross-sectional study of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) datasets (n = 106265) across 19 LMICs. The recent MIS datasets were used, and the study only included children under five who had taken an antimalarial drug for a recent malarial fever. The outcome variable was classified into two distinct categories: those who had taken antimalarial drugs for malarial fever from qualified sources and those who did not. Among LMICs, we found that 87.1% of children under five received an antimalarial prescription from unqualified sources who had recently experienced malarial fever. In several LMICs (Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana), a substantial portion of recent antimalarial prescriptions for malaria was taken from unqualified sources (about 60%). Some LMICs (Guinea (31.8%), Mali (31.3%), Nigeria (20.4%), Kenya (2.6%), and Senegal (2.7%)) had low rates of antimalarial drug consumption even though children under five received a high percentage of antimalarial prescriptions from qualified sources for a recent malarial fever. Living in rural areas, having mothers with higher education, and having parents with more wealth were frequently taken antimalarial from qualified sources for recent malarial fever in children under five across the LMICs. The study draws attention to the importance of national and local level preventative strategies across the LMICs to restrict antimalarial drug consumption. This is because antimalarial prescriptions from unqualified sources for recent malarial fever in children under five were shockingly high in most LMICs and had high rates of unqualified prescriptions in certain other LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV are among the most lethal diseases, with AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) being a chronic and potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Individually, each of these infections presents a significant health challenge. However, when tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV co-occur, the symptoms can worsen, leading to an increased mortality risk. Mathematical models have been created to study coinfections involving tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. This systematic literature review explores the importance of coinfection models by examining articles from reputable databases such as Dimensions, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and PubMed. The primary emphasis is on investigating coinfection models related to tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. The findings demonstrate that each article thoroughly covers various aspects, including model development, mathematical analysis, sensitivity analysis, optimal control strategies, and research discoveries. Based on our comprehensive evaluation, we offer valuable recommendations for future research efforts in this field.",

        "title": "Mathematical models of Plasmodium vivax transmission: A scoping review.",
        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is one of the most geographically widespread malaria parasites in the world, primarily found across South-East Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa. One of the significant characteristics of the P. vivax parasite is its ability to remain dormant in the human liver as hypnozoites and subsequently reactivate after the initial infection (i.e. relapse infections). Mathematical modelling approaches have been widely applied to understand P. vivax dynamics and predict the impact of intervention outcomes. Models that capture P. vivax dynamics differ from those that capture P. falciparum dynamics, as they must account for relapses caused by the activation of hypnozoites. In this article, we provide a scoping review of mathematical models that capture P. vivax transmission dynamics published between January 1988 and May 2023. The primary objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive summary of the mathematical models and techniques used to model P. vivax dynamics. In doing so, we aim to assist researchers working on mathematical epidemiology, disease transmission, and other aspects of P. vivax malaria by highlighting best practices in currently published models and highlighting where further model development is required. We categorise P. vivax models according to whether a deterministic or agent-based approach was used. We provide an overview of the different strategies used to incorporate the parasite's biology, use of multiple scales (within-host and population-level), superinfection, immunity, and treatment interventions. In most of the published literature, the rationale for different modelling approaches was driven by the research question at hand. Some models focus on the parasites' complicated biology, while others incorporate simplified assumptions to avoid model complexity. Overall, the existing literature on mathematical models for P. vivax encompasses various aspects of the parasite's dynamics. We recommend that future research should focus on refining how key aspects of P. vivax dynamics are modelled, including spatial heterogeneity in exposure risk and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection, the accumulation of hypnozoite variation, the interaction between P. falciparum and P. vivax, acquisition of immunity, and recovery under superinfection.",

The ongoing Phase 3 trial of Innovax's bivalent (types 16 and 18) HPV vaccine (Cecolin®) assesses in low- and middle-income countries alternative dosing schedules and generates data following one dose in girls 9-14 years old. Interim data for the 6-month dosing groups are presented. In Bangladesh and Ghana, 1,025 girls were randomized to receive either two doses of Cecolin at 6-, 12-, or 24-month intervals; one dose of Gardasil® followed by one dose of Cecolin at month 24; or two doses of Gardasil 6 months apart (referent). Serology was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, in a subset, by neutralization assays. Primary objectives include immunological non-inferiority of the Cecolin schedules to referent one month after the second dose. Safety endpoints include reactogenicity and unsolicited adverse events for 7 and 30 days post-vaccination, respectively, as well as serious adverse events throughout the study. Interim analyses included data from the two groups on a 0, 6-month schedule with 205 participants per group. One month after Dose 2, 100% of participants were seropositive by ELISA and had seroconverted for both antigens. Non-inferiority of Cecolin to Gardasil was demonstrated. Six months following one dose, over 96% of participants were seropositive by ELISA for both HPV antigens, with a trend for higher geometric mean concentration following Cecolin administration. Reactogenicity and safety were comparable between both vaccines. Cecolin in a 0, 6-month schedule elicits robust immunogenicity. Non-inferiority to Gardasil was demonstrated one month after a 0, 6-month schedule. Immunogenicity following one dose was comparable to Gardasil up to six months. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov No. 04508309).",

        "abstract": "The \"Bedia\" tribal people are found all over India; they are poor, illiterate, and confined culturally. In many parts of India, malaria, a disease caused by mosquitoes, is becoming more common. Raising awareness and educating people about it is the best method to stop disease and maintain good health. This study aimed to determine the perception, attitudes, and practices of a particularly vulnerable tribal group-the \"Bedia\"-in the rural region of eastern India. A questionnaire with 19 structured questions has been created. The Bedia participants received the questionnaire from us. They had already responded. The intervention took the form of several health education workshops that were created in response to the deficiencies identified in the pre-test assessment's replies. The identical questionnaire used for the pre-test evaluation was given to each participant for the post-test who attended the training sessions. The current study found that while the first cognitive domain question on malaria transmission was not statistically significant, changes in malaria breeding grounds, regions with higher mosquito numbers, and the source of information about malaria are. Their knowledge of the treatment for malaria and the agent used to treat it is statistically significant in the current study, but the fifth question on the most common symptom of malaria was not statistically significant. The answers to the questions about \"What you will do if you see someone suffering from malaria,\" \"How much time was spent in the malaria control program,\" \"Malaria detection,\" and \"Regular usage of bed-nets\" in the affective and psychomotor domains all had statistical significance. Our research on interventions to raise awareness of malaria in this tribal region of northern West Bengal, eastern India, bordering Bangladesh, was published for the first time to our knowledge. In the majority of the items from the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective learning domains, we have seen significant changes.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to explore the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and operational research (OR) practices during public health emergencies (PHE) in the southeast Asian region (SEAR) over the last decade. We searched electronic databases and grey literature sources for studies published between 2012 and 2022. The studies written in English were included, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. Among these 25 studies documented M&E and four studies documented OR practices. The majority of the studies were from India and Bangladesh, with no evidence found from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. M&E of surveillance programs were identified among which PHE due to COVID-19 was most prevalent. M&E was conducted in response to COVID-19, cholera, Nipah, Ebola, <i>Candida auris</i>, and hepatitis A. OR practice was minimal and reported from India and Indonesia. India conducted OR on COVID-19 and malaria, whereas Indonesia focused on COVID-19 and influenza. While most SEAR countries have mechanisms for conducting M&E, there is a noticeable limitation in OR practices. There is a compelling need to develop a standard framework for M&E. Additionally, enhancing private sector engagement is crucial for strengthening preparedness against PHE. Furthermore, there is a necessity to increase awareness about the importance of conducting M&E and OR during PHE.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. However, accurate estimates of malaria prevalence and causality among patients who die at the country level are lacking due to the limited specificity of diagnostic tools used to attribute etiologies. Accurate estimates are crucial for prioritizing interventions and resources aimed at reducing malaria-related mortality. Seven Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network sites collected comprehensive data on stillbirths and children <5 years, using minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). A DeCoDe (Determination of Cause of Death) panel employed standardized protocols for assigning underlying, intermediate, and immediate causes of death, integrating sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory (including extensive microbiology, histopathology, and malaria testing), and verbal autopsy data. Analyses were conducted to ascertain the strength of evidence for cause of death (CoD), describe factors associated with malaria-related deaths, estimate malaria-specific mortality, and assess the proportion of preventable deaths. Between December 3, 2016, and December 31, 2022, 2673 deaths underwent MITS and had a CoD attributed from four CHAMPS sites with at least 1 malaria-attributed death. No malaria-attributable deaths were documented among 891 stillbirths or 924 neonatal deaths, therefore this analysis concentrates on the remaining 858 deaths among children aged 1-59 months. Malaria was in the causal chain for 42.9% (126/294) of deaths from Sierra Leone, 31.4% (96/306) in Kenya, 18.2% (36/198) in Mozambique, 6.7% (4/60) in Mali, and 0.3% (1/292) in South Africa. Compared to non-malaria related deaths, malaria-related deaths skewed towards older infants and children (p < 0.001), with 71.0% among ages 12-59 months. Malaria was the sole infecting pathogen in 184 (70.2%) of malaria-attributed deaths, whereas bacterial and viral co-infections were identified in the causal pathway in 24·0% and 12.2% of cases, respectively. Malnutrition was found at a similar level in the causal pathway of both malaria (26.7%) and non-malaria (30.7%, p = 0.256) deaths. Less than two-thirds (164/262; 62.6%) of malaria deaths had received antimalarials prior to death. Nearly all (98·9%) malaria-related deaths were deemed preventable. Malaria remains a significant cause of childhood mortality in the CHAMPS malaria-endemic sites. The high bacterial co-infection prevalence among malaria deaths underscores the potential benefits of antibiotics for severe malaria patients. Compared to non-malaria deaths, many of malaria-attributed deaths are preventable through accessible malaria control measures.",

        "abstract": "Transcriptional variation has been studied but post-transcriptional modification due to RNA editing has not been investigated in <i>Plasmodium</i>. We investigated developmental stage-specific RNA editing in selected genes in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> 3D7. We detected extensive amination- and deamination-type RNA editing at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 46 h in tightly synchronized <i>Plasmodium</i>. Most of the editing events were observed in 8 and 16 h ring-stage parasites. Extensive A-to-G deamination-type editing was detected more during the 16 h ring stage (25%) than the 8 h ring stage (20%). Extensive U-to-C amination-type editing was detected more during the 16 h ring stage (31%) than the 8 h ring stage (22%). In 28S, rRNA editing converted the loop structure to the stem structure. The hemoglobin binding activity of PF3D7_0216900 was also altered due to RNA editing. Among the expressed 28S rRNA genes, PF3D7_0532000 and PF3D7_0726000 expression was higher. Increased amounts of the transcripts of these two genes were found, particularly PF3D7_0726000 in the ring stage and PF3D7_0532000 in the trophozoite and schizont stages. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) expression did not correlate with the editing level. This first experimental report of RNA editing will help to identify the editing machinery that might be useful for antimalarial drug discovery and malaria control.",

Evidently, there has been a significant expansion in the public funding allocated to the health sector in Bangladesh, intending to enhance health outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the impact of healthcare expenditure on health outcomes, specifically focusing on the reduction in different mortality rates and the transmission of various infectious diseases. A total of 30 years of data (1990-2019) on the health sector of Bangladesh were collected from different national and international sources. The Vector Autoregression with Exogenous Variables (VARX) model was employed to determine the effects of healthcare expenditure on health outcomes. Results revealed that the per capita health expenditure and the number of doctors showed a significant positive impact on life expectancy and maternal and child health. Also, the government's annual budget on the health sector and number of doctors had a significant positive impact on lowering deaths by Diphtheria, Cholera, Tuberculosis, and Malaria diseases.

        "abstract": "Pneumonia remains the leading cause of mortality in under-five children outside the neonatal period. Progress has slowed down in the last decade, necessitating increased efforts to scale up effective pneumonia interventions. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), a modelling software for child mortality in low- and middle-income settings, to prospectively analyse the potential impact of upscaling pneumonia interventions in Bangladesh, Chad, and Ethiopia from 2023 to 2030. We included Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccination, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), oral antibiotics, pulse oximetry, and oxygen as pneumonia interventions in our analysis. Outcomes of interest were the number of pneumonia deaths averted, the proportion of deaths averted by intervention, and changes in the under-five mortality rate. We found that 19 775 lives of children under-five could be saved in Bangladesh, 76 470 in Chad, and 97 343 in Ethiopia by scaling intervention coverages to ≥90% by 2030. Our estimated reductions in pneumonia deaths among children under five range from 44.61% to 57.91% in the respective countries. Increased coverage of oral antibiotics, pulse oximetry, and oxygen show similar effects in all three countries, averting between 18.80% and 23.65% of expected pneumonia deaths. Scaling-up PCV has a prominent effect, especially in Chad, where it could avert 14.04% of expected pneumonia deaths. Under-five mortality could be reduced by 1.42 per 1000 live births in Bangladesh, 22.52 per 1000 live births in Chad, and 5.48 per 1000 live births in Ethiopia. This analysis shows the high impact of upscaling pneumonia interventions. The lack of data regarding coverage indicators is a barrier for further research, policy, and implementation, all requiring increased attention.",

We conducted this study to assess the current scenario of drug adherence in four endemic sub-districts of Bangladesh. Among 110 enrolled participants, 70% were mono-infected with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> and the remaining 30% with <i>P. vivax</i>. The overall treatment adherence frequency was 92.7% (95% CI: 83.0-96.3%). A total of eight participants were found to be nonadherent to treatment and all of them were from Bandarban. Level of nonadherence was equally observed in two age groups: 11-17 and 18+ years. However, male participants (<i>n</i> = 6) were found to be more nonadherent than females (<i>n</i> = 2). Among 7.3% with nonadherence to treatment, a single participant with <i>P. falciparum</i> mono-infection refused to take medication and became nonadherent. Remaining participants stated that they were feeling well and going to work, thus leaving treatment course uncompleted. Although overall compliance with malaria medication seems good, a gradual increase in noncompliance to <i>P. vivax</i> malaria treatment suggests that the National Malaria Elimination Program must be enhanced and monitored to fulfil the projected malaria elimination goal before 2030 from Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The optimal dosing of primaquine to prevent relapsing <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria in South Asia remains unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of different primaquine regimens to prevent <i>P. vivax</i> relapse. A systematic review identified <i>P. vivax</i> efficacy studies from South Asia published between 1 January 2000 and 23 August 2021. In a one-stage meta-analysis of available individual patient data, the cumulative risks of <i>P. vivax</i> recurrence at day 42 and 180 were assessed by primaquine total mg/kg dose and duration. The risk of recurrence by day 180 was also determined in a two-stage meta-analysis. Patients with a >25% drop in haemoglobin to <70 g/L, or an absolute drop of >50 g/L between days 1 and 14 were categorised by daily mg/kg primaquine dose. In 791 patients from 7 studies in the one-stage meta-analysis, the day 180 cumulative risk of recurrence was 61.1% (95% CI 42.2% to 80.4%; 201 patients; 25 recurrences) after treatment without primaquine, 28.8% (95% CI 8.2% to 74.1%; 398 patients; 4 recurrences) following low total (2 to <5 mg/kg) and 0% (96 patients; 0 recurrences) following high total dose primaquine (≥5 mg/kg). In the subsequent two-stage meta-analysis of nine studies (3529 patients), the pooled proportions of <i>P. vivax</i> recurrences by day 180 were 12.1% (95% CI 7.7% to 17.2%), 2.3% (95% CI 0.3% to 5.4%) and 0.7% (95% CI 0% to 6.1%), respectively. No patients had a >25% drop in haemoglobin to <70 g/L. Primaquine treatment led to a marked decrease in <i>P. vivax</i> recurrences following low (~3.5 mg/kg) and high (~7 mg/kg) total doses, with no reported severe haemolytic events. CRD42022313730.",

        "abstract": "Causes of deaths often go unrecorded in lower income countries, yet this information is critical. Verbal autopsy is a questionnaire interview with a family member or caregiver to elicit the symptoms and circumstances preceding a death and assign a probable cause. The social and cultural aspects of verbal autopsy have gotten less attention than the technical aspects and have not been widely explored in South and Southeast Asia settings. Between October 2021 and March 2023, prior to implementing a verbal autopsy study at rural sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, focus group discussions were conducted with village heads, religious leaders and community members from varied demographic backgrounds. Thematic analysis elucidated customs and traditional views surrounding death to understand local ethnocultural sensitivities. We found that death rituals varied greatly among religions, ethnicities and by socioeconomic status. Mourning periods were reported to last 3-100 days and related to the cause of death, age and how close the deceased person was to the family. Participants advised that interviews should happen after mourning periods to avoid emotional distress, but not long after so as to avoid recall bias. Interviewers should be introduced to respondents by a trusted local person. To provide reassurance and confidentiality, a family's residence is the preferred interview location. Interview questions require careful local language translation, and community sensitisation is important before data collection. Verbal autopsy is acceptable across a wide range of cultural settings in Southeast Asia, provided that local norms are preidentified and followed.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is one of the most prominent illnesses affecting children, ranking as one of the key development concerns for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is not much information available on the use of anti-malarial drugs in LMICs in children under five. The study aimed to investigate disparities in anti-malarial drug consumption for malaria among children under the age of five in LMICs. This study used recent available cross-sectional data from the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) datasets across five LMICs (Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone), which covered a portion of sub-Saharan Africa. The study was carried out between January 2, 2023, and April 15, 2023, and included children under the age of five who had taken an anti-malarial drug for malaria 2 weeks before the survey date. The outcome variable was anti-malarial drug consumption, which was classified into two groups: those who had taken anti-malarial drugs and those who had not. In the study of LMICs, 32,397 children under five were observed, and among them, 44.1% had received anti-malarial drugs. Of the five LMICs, Kenya had the lowest (9.2%) and Mali had the highest (70.5%) percentages of anti-malarial drug consumption. Children under five with malaria are more likely to receive anti-malarial drugs if they are over 1 year old, live in rural areas, have mothers with higher education levels, and come from wealthier families. The study emphasizes the importance of developing universal coverage strategies for anti-malarial drug consumption at both the national and local levels. The study also recommends that improving availability and access to anti-malarial drugs may be necessary, as the consumption of these drugs for treating malaria in children under the age of five is shockingly low in some LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Community engagement (CE) interventions often explore and promote behaviour change around a specific challenge. Suggestions for behaviour change should be co-produced in partnership with the community. To facilitate this, it is essential that the intervention includes key content that unpacks the challenge of interest via multiple sources of knowledge. However, where community lived experience and academic evidence appear misaligned, tensions can appear within the co-production dynamic of CE. This is specifically so within the context of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) where ideal behaviours are often superseded by what is practical or possible in a particular community context. Here we describe a framework for the equitable development of contextually appropriate, clearly evidenced behavioural objectives for CE interventions. This framework explores different sources of knowledge on AMR, including the potentially competing views of different stakeholders. The framework allows key content on AMR to be selected based upon academic evidence, contextual appropriateness and fit to the chosen CE approach. A case study of the framework in action exemplifies how the framework is applicable to a range of contexts, CE approaches and One Health topics beyond just AMR. Within CE interventions, academic evidence is crucial to develop well-informed key content. However, this formative work should also involve community members, ensuring that their contextual knowledge is valued. The type of CE approach also needs careful consideration because methodological constraints may limit the breadth and depth of information that can be delivered within an intervention, and thus the scope of key content.",

        "abstract": "In areas co-endemic for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum there is an increased risk of P vivax parasitaemia following P falciparum malaria. Radical cure is currently only recommended for patients presenting with P vivax malaria. Expanding the indication for radical cure to patients presenting with P falciparum malaria could reduce their risk of subsequent P vivax parasitaemia. We did a multicentre, open-label, superiority randomised controlled trial in five health clinics in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In Bangladesh and Indonesia, patients were excluded if they were younger than 1 year, whereas in Ethiopia patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years. Patients with uncomplicated P falciparum monoinfection who had fever or a history of fever in the 48 h preceding clinic visit were eligible for enrolment and were required to have a glucose-6-dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity of 70% or greater. Patients received blood schizontocidal treatment (artemether-lumefantrine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Indonesia) and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either high-dose short-course oral primaquine (intervention arm; total dose 7 mg/kg over 7 days) or standard care (standard care arm; single dose oral primaquine of 0·25 mg/kg). Random assignment was done by an independent statistician in blocks of eight by use of sealed envelopes. All randomly assigned and eligible patients were included in the primary and safety analyses. The per-protocol analysis excluded those who did not complete treatment or had substantial protocol violations. The primary endpoint was the incidence risk of P vivax parasitaemia on day 63. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03916003. Between Aug 18, 2019, and March 14, 2022, a total of 500 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, and 495 eligible patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (246 intervention and 249 control). The incidence risk of P vivax parasitaemia at day 63 was 11·0% (95% CI 7·5-15·9) in the standard care arm compared with 2·5% (1·0-5·9) in the intervention arm (hazard ratio 0·20, 95% CI 0·08-0·51; p=0·0009). The effect size differed with blood schizontocidal treatment and site. Routine symptom reporting on day 2 and day 7 were similar between groups. In the first 42 days, there were a total of four primaquine-related adverse events reported in the standard care arm and 26 in the intervention arm; 132 (92%) of all 143 adverse events were mild. There were two serious adverse events in the intervention arm, which were considered unrelated to the study drug. None of the patients developed severe anaemia (defined as haemoglobin <5 g/dL). In patients with a G6PD activity of 70% or greater, high-dose short-course primaquine was safe and relatively well tolerated and reduced the risk of subsequent P vivax parasitaemia within 63 days by five fold. Universal radical cure therefore potentially offers substantial clinical, public health, and operational benefits, but these benefits will vary with endemic setting.

        "title": "The 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: the imperative for a health-centred response in a world facing irreversible harms.",
        "abstract": "The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown is an international research collaboration that independently monitors the evolving impacts of climate change on health, and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. In its eighth iteration, this 2023 report draws on the expertise of 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies worldwide to provide its most comprehensive assessment yet. In 2022, the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown warned that people’s health is at the mercy of fossil fuels and stressed the transformative opportunity of jointly tackling the concurrent climate change, energy, cost-of-living, and health crises for human health and wellbeing. This year’s report finds few signs of such progress. At the current 10-year mean heating of 1·14°C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is increasingly impacting the health and survival of people worldwide, and projections show these risks could worsen steeply with further inaction. However, with health matters gaining prominence in climate change negotiations, this report highlights new opportunities to deliver health-promoting climate change action and a safe and thriving future for all. In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5). Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3). Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3). The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts—both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change. The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world’s populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted each second, each moment of delay worsens the risks to people’s health and survival. In this year’s report, new projections reveal the dangers of further delays in action, with every tracked health dimension worsening as the climate changes. If global mean temperature continues to rise to just under 2°C, annual heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 370% by midcentury, assuming no substantial progress on adaptation (indicator 1.1.5). Under such a scenario, heat-related labour loss is projected to increase by 50% (indicator 1.1.4), and heatwaves alone could lead to 524·9 million additional people experiencing moderate-to-severe food insecurity by 2041–60, aggravating the global risk of malnutrition. Life-threatening infectious diseases are also projected to spread further, with the length of coastline suitable for <i>Vibrio</i> pathogens expanding by 17–25%, and the transmission potential for dengue increasing by 36–37% by midcentury. As risks rise, so will the costs and challenges of adaptation. These estimates provide some indication of what the future could hold. However, poor accounting for non-linear responses, tipping points, and cascading and synergistic interactions could render these projections conservative, disproportionately increasing the threat to the health of populations worldwide. The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people’s lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating. The 2022 <i>Lancet</i> Countdown report highlighted the opportunity to accelerate the transition away from health-harming fossil fuels in response to the global energy crisis. However, data this year show a world that is often moving in the wrong direction. Energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased by 0·9% to a record 36·8 Gt in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1), and still only 9·5% of global electricity comes from modern renewables (mainly solar and wind energy), despite their costs falling below that of fossil fuels. Concerningly, driven partly by record profits, oil and gas companies are further reducing their compliance with the Paris Agreement: the strategies of the world’s 20 largest oil and gas companies as of early 2023 will result in emissions surpassing levels consistent with the Paris Agreement goals by 173% in 2040—an increase of 61% from 2022 (indicator 4.2.6). Rather than pursuing accelerated development of renewable energy, fossil fuel companies allocated only 4% of their capital investment to renewables in 2022. Meanwhile, global fossil fuel investment increased by 10% in 2022, reaching over $1 trillion (indicator 4.2.1). The expansion of oil and gas extractive activities has been supported through both private and public financial flows. Across 2017–21, the 40 banks that lend most to the fossil fuel sector collectively invested $489 billion annually in fossil fuels (annual average), with 52% increasing their lending from 2010–16. Simultaneously, in 2020, 78% of the countries assessed, responsible for 93% of all global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, still provided net direct fossil fuels subsidies totalling $305 billion, further hindering fossil fuel phase-out (indicator 4.2.4). Without a rapid response to course correct, the persistent use and expansion of fossil fuels will ensure an increasingly inequitable future that threatens the lives of billions of people alive today. Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM<sub>2·5</sub>; indicator 3.2.1), and a large proportion of the 78 deaths per 100 000 people associated with exposure to indoor air pollution (indicator 3.2.2). Additionally, the just development of renewable energy markets can generate net employment opportunities with safer, more locally available jobs. Ensuring countries, particularly those facing high levels of energy poverty, are supported in the safe development, deployment, and adoption of renewable energy is key to maximising health gains and preventing unjust extractive industrial practices that can harm the health and livelihoods of local populations and widen health inequities. With fossil fuels accounting for 95% of road transport energy (indicator 3.1.3), interventions to enable and promote safe active travel and zero-emission public transport can further deliver emissions reduction, promote health through physical activity, and avert many of the 460 000 deaths caused annually by transport-derived PM<sub>2·5</sub> pollution (indicator 3.2.1), and some of the 3·2 million annual deaths related to physical inactivity. People-centred, climate-resilient urban redesign to improve building energy efficiency, increase green and blue spaces, and promote sustainable cooling, can additionally prevent heat-related health harms, avoid air-conditioning-derived emissions (indicator 2.2.2), and provide direct physical and mental health benefits. Additionally, food systems are responsible for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 57% of agricultural emissions in 2020 being derived from the production of red meat and milk (indicator 3.3.1). Promoting and enabling equitable access to affordable, healthy, low-carbon diets that meet local nutritional and cultural requirements can contribute to mitigation, while preventing many of the 12·2 million deaths attributable to suboptimal diets (indicator 3.3.2). The health community could play a central role in securing these benefits, by delivering public health interventions to reduce air pollution, enabling and supporting active travel and healthier diets, and promoting improvements in the environmental conditions and commercial activities that define health outcomes. Importantly, the health sector can lead by example and transition to sustainable, resource-efficient, net-zero emission health systems, thereby preventing its 4·6% contribution to global GHG emissions, with cascading impacts ultimately affecting the broader economy (indicator 3.4). Some encouraging signs of progress offer a glimpse of the enormous human benefits that health-centred action could render. Deaths attributable to fossil-fuel-derived air pollution have decreased by 15·7% since 2005, with 80% of this reduction being the result of reduced coal-derived pollution. Meanwhile the renewable energy sector expanded to a historical high of 12·7 million employees in 2021 (indicator 4.2.2); and renewable energy accounted for 90% of the growth in electricity capacity in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1). Supporting this, global clean energy investment increased by 15% in 2022, to $1·6 trillion, exceeding fossil fuel investment by 61% (indicator 4.2.1); and lending to the green energy sector rose to $498 billion in 2021, approaching fossil fuel lending (indicator 4.2.7). Scientific understanding of the links between health and climate change is rapidly growing, and although coverage lags in some of the most affected regions, over 3000 scientific articles covered this topic in 2022 (indicators 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Meanwhile, the health dimensions of climate change are increasingly acknowledged in the public discourse, with 24% of all climate change newspaper articles in 2022 referring to health, just short of the 26% in 2020 (indicator 5.1). Importantly, international organisations are increasingly engaging with the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation (indicator 5.4.2), and governments increasingly acknowledge this link, with 95% of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement now referring to health—up from 73% in 2020 (indicator 5.4.1). These trends signal what could be the start of a life-saving transition. With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine—rather than protect—the future of people alive today and generations to come. Safeguarding people’s health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all.",

        "title": "Association of maternal prenatal copper concentration with gestational duration and preterm birth: a multicountry meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Copper (Cu), an essential trace mineral regulating multiple actions of inflammation and oxidative stress, has been implicated in risk for preterm birth (PTB). This study aimed to determine the association of maternal Cu concentration during pregnancy with PTB risk and gestational duration in a large multicohort study including diverse populations. Maternal plasma or serum samples of 10,449 singleton live births were obtained from 18 geographically diverse study cohorts. Maternal Cu concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The associations of maternal Cu with PTB and gestational duration were analyzed using logistic and linear regressions for each cohort. The estimates were then combined using meta-analysis. Associations between maternal Cu and acute-phase reactants (APRs) and infection status were analyzed in 1239 samples from the Malawi cohort. The maternal prenatal Cu concentration in our study samples followed normal distribution with mean of 1.92 μg/mL and standard deviation of 0.43 μg/mL, and Cu concentrations increased with gestational age up to 20 wk. The random-effect meta-analysis across 18 cohorts revealed that 1 μg/mL increase in maternal Cu concentration was associated with higher risk of PTB with odds ratio of 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 1.57) and shorter gestational duration of 1.64 d (95% CI: 0.56, 2.73). In the Malawi cohort, higher maternal Cu concentration, concentrations of multiple APRs, and infections (malaria and HIV) were correlated and associated with greater risk of PTB and shorter gestational duration. Our study supports robust negative association between maternal Cu and gestational duration and positive association with risk for PTB. Cu concentration was strongly correlated with APRs and infection status suggesting its potential role in inflammation, a pathway implicated in the mechanisms of PTB. Therefore, maternal Cu could be used as potential marker of integrated inflammatory pathways during pregnancy and risk for PTB.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a social and biological problem. Although resistance to antimicrobials is a natural phenomenon, many human behaviors are increasing the pressure on microbes to develop resistance which is resulting in many commonly used treatments becoming ineffective. These behaviors include unregulated use of antimicrobial medicines, pesticides and agricultural chemicals, the disposal of heavy metals and other pollutants into the environment, and human-induced climatic change. Addressing AMR thus calls for changes in the behaviors which drive resistance. Community engagement for antimicrobial resistance (CE4AMR) is an international and interdisciplinary network focused on tackling behavioural drivers of AMR at community level. Since 2019 this network has worked within Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs), predominantly within Southeast Asia, to tackle behavioral drivers of AMR can be mitigated through bottom-up solutions championed by local people. This commentary presents seven Key Concepts identified from across the CE4AMR portfolio as integral to tackling AMR. We suggest it be used to guide future interventions aimed at addressing AMR via social, participatory, and behavior-change approaches.",

This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium species among clinically suspected cases who presented at Badr General Hospital and healthcare facilities in selected regions of Badr Governorate, Madinah Province, Saudi Arabia between January 2021 and January 2022. A total of 493 suspected patients were recruited from Badr Governorate, investigated for malaria infection using CBFME and rapid diagnostic test- CareStart Malaria Pf/PAN (HRP2/pLDH) Ag Combo rapid diagnostic tests. The results showed that malaria infection was 34 (6.89%) cases among 493 suspected patients using microscopic examination as reference test. Moreover, subjects aged 31 to 40 years and those aged 51 to 60 years had the highest (50%) and lowest (8.82%) percentages of malaria cases. Plasmodium vivax (19/34, 55.88%) was higher than P falciparum (15/34, 44.1%) as the causative agents of malaria cases. The majority of malaria cases (29/34, 80.9%) among non-Saudi mainly from Sudan (15/34, 44.1%), Pakistan (5/34, 14.7%), Bangladesh (5/34, 14.7%) and India (4/34, 11.76%) whereas malaria cases among Saudis (5/34, 14.7%). In addition, the majority of malaria cases (32/34, 94.11%) among male subjects while (2/34, 5.88%) among females. The current study revealed that malaria transmission is still active in Badr Governorate, Madinah Province, Saudi Arabia and represents a public health concern. Further screening implements and continuous epidemiological monitor of the status of malaria infection in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are thus warranted to improve its controlling activities and eradicate malaria endemicity in the country.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children aged 6-59 months worldwide are anaemic. Iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) and iron supplements (syrup/drops) are used to combat anaemia in children in different parts of the world. However, evidence for functional benefits of iron supplementation in children is scarce, and potential risks remain poorly defined, particularly concerning diarrhoea and malaria. This trial aims to determine if: (1) the efficacy of iron supplements or MNPs (containing iron) given with malaria chemoprevention is superior to malaria chemoprevention alone, or (2) if the efficacy of malaria chemoprevention alone is superior to placebo on child cognitive development. IRMA is a four-arm, parallel-group, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, triple-dummy, randomised trial in Southern Malawi. The study recruits 2168 infants aged 6 months, with an intervention period of 6 months and a post-intervention period of a further 6 months. Children are randomised into four arms: (1) No intervention (placebo); (2) malaria chemoprevention only; (3) MNPs and malaria chemoprevention; and (4) iron syrup and malaria chemoprevention. The primary outcome, cognitive development (Cognitive Composite Score (CogCS)), is measured at the end of the 6 months intervention. Secondary outcomes include CogCS at a further 6 months post-intervention, motor, language and behavioural development, physical growth and prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency. Safety outcomes include incidence of malaria and other infections, and prevalence of malaria parasitaemia during and post-intervention period. The trial is approved by the National Health Sciences Research Committee (#19/01/2213) (Malawi) and the Human Research Ethics Committee (WEHI: 19/012) (Australia). Written informed consent in the local language is obtained from each participant before conducting any study-related procedure.

        "abstract": "Screening for G6PD deficiency can inform disease management including malaria. Treatment with the antimalarial drugs primaquine and tafenoquine can be guided by point-of-care testing for G6PD deficiency. Data from similar clinical studies evaluating the performance of the STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, South Korea) conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were pooled. Test performance was assessed in a retrospective analysis on capillary and venous specimens. All study sites used spectrophotometry for reference G6PD testing, and either the HemoCue or complete blood count for reference hemoglobin measurement. The sensitivity of the STANDARD G6PD Test using the manufacturer thresholds for G6PD deficient and intermediate cases in capillary specimens from 4212 study participants was 100% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 97.5%-100%) for G6PD deficient cases with <30% activity and 77% (95% CI 66.8%-85.4%) for females with intermediate activity between 30%-70%. Specificity was 98.1% (95% CI 97.6%-98.5%) and 92.8% (95% CI 91.6%-93.9%) for G6PD deficient individuals and intermediate females, respectively. Out of 20 G6PD intermediate females with false normal results, 12 had activity levels >60% on the reference assay. The negative predictive value for females with G6PD activity >60% was 99.6% (95% CI 99.1%-99.8%) on capillary specimens. Sensitivity among 396 P. vivax malaria cases was 100% (69.2%-100.0%) for both deficient and intermediate cases. Across the full dataset, 37% of those classified as G6PD deficient or intermediate resulted from true normal cases. Despite this, over 95% of cases would receive correct treatment with primaquine, over 87% of cases would receive correct treatment with tafenoquine, and no true G6PD deficient cases would be treated inappropriately based on the result of the STANDARD G6PD Test. The STANDARD G6PD Test enables safe access to drugs which are contraindicated for individuals with G6PD deficiency. Operational considerations will inform test uptake in specific settings.",

An epidemiological investigation was conducted on malaria disease distribution and risk factors in the world's largest refugee settlement, the Rohingya refugee camps on the south-eastern border area of Bangladesh, within 2017-2020. From February 2017 to March 2020, 30,460 febrile patients were tested for malaria using light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. Most were self-presenting symptomatic patients and a minority were from door-to-door malaria screening. Diagnostic tests were done by trained medical technologists upon the advice of the concerned physicians in the camps. Test positivity rate (%) and annual parasite incidence were calculated and compared using chi-squared (χ <sup>2</sup>) test or odds ratios. The overall average annual test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.05%. TPR was highest in people who had travelled to the forest in the previous 2 months, at 13.60%. Cases were clustered among male adults aged 15-60 years. There were no cases among children under five years or pregnant women and no deaths from malaria. This study found very few malaria cases among Rohingya refugees with the majority of cases being imported from hilly forested areas, which were thus assumed to act as the reservoir for transmission.",

        "title": "Antimalarial drug discovery against malaria parasites through haplopine modification: An advanced computational approach.",
        "abstract": "The widespread emergence of antimalarial drug resistance has created a major threat to public health. Malaria is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by Plasmodium spp., which includes Apicoplast DNA polymerase and Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2. These components play a critical role in their life cycle and metabolic pathway, and are involved in the breakdown of erythrocyte hemoglobin in the host, making them promising targets for anti-malarial drug design. Our current study has been designed to explore the potential inhibitors from haplopine derivatives against these two targets using an in silico approach. A total of nine haplopine derivatives were used to perform molecular docking, and the results revealed that Ligands 03 and 05 showed strong binding affinity compared to the control compound atovaquone. Furthermore, these ligand-protein complexes underwent molecular dynamics simulations, and the results demonstrated that the complexes maintained strong stability in terms of RMSD (root mean square deviation), RMSF (root mean square fluctuation), and Rg (radius of gyration) over a 100 ns simulation period. Additionally, PCA (principal component analysis) analysis and the dynamic cross-correlation matrix showed positive outcomes for the protein-ligand complexes. Moreover, the compounds exhibited no violations of the Lipinski rule, and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) predictions yielded positive results without indicating any toxicity. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) and molecular electrostatic potential calculations were conducted, revealing that the mentioned derivatives exhibited better stability and outstanding performance. Overall, this computational approach suggests that these haplopine derivatives could serve as a potential source for developing new, effective antimalarial drugs to combat malaria. However, further in vitro or in vivo studies might be conducted to determine their actual effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. No specific funding was awarded for this meta-analysis.

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, sexually transmitted infection (STI) services are available for all populations in public health facilities. However, STI services for key populations (KPs) at risk of HIV need specifically designed approaches that are predominantly administered to KPs through donor-supported service centers operated by non-government organizations (NGOs) and community-based organisations (CBOs). However, the steady decline in donor funding warrants a sustainable transition of STI services for the KPs into public health facilities. This article aimed to explore the service availability and readiness of public health facilities to provide STI services for the KPs. This qualitative study explored the service availability and readiness of public health facilities in three districts of Bangladesh by adapting the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment tool. We conducted 34 in-depth interviews,11 focus group discussions with KPs, and 29 key-informant interviews with healthcare providers, researchers, programme implementers and policy planners, in addition to series of direct observations at the public healthcare facilities. Data were analysed through thematic analysis, and categorised in relation to the WHO building blocks. This study revealed that the public health system was generally not ready to serve the KPs' needs in terms of providing them with quality STI services. The 'service delivery' component, which is the most crucial facet of the public health system, was not ready to provide STI services to KPs. Findings also indicated that health workforce availability was limited in the primary and secondary healthcare layers but adequate in the tertiary layer, but needed to be oriented on providing culturally sensitised treatment. Counseling, an essential component of STI services, was neither ready nor available. However, health information systems and a few other components were partially ready, although this warrants systematic approaches to address these challenges. The findings show that public health facilities are yet to be fully ready to render STI services to KPs, especially in terms of service delivery and human and health resources. Therefore, it is not only integral to mobilize communities towards the uptake of public health services, but health systems need to be prepared to cater to their needs.",

Our objective was to describe adherence to World Health Organization recommendations for the management of leading causes of death among children. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study examining clinical data for children aged 1-59 months who were hospitalized and died in a Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment, December 2016-June 2021. Catchment areas included: Baliakandi and Faridpur, Bangladesh; Kersa, Haramaya, and Harar, Ethiopia; Kisumu and Siaya, Kenya; Bamako, Mali; Manhiça and Quelimane, Mozambique; Makeni, Sierra Leone; Soweto, South Africa. We reviewed medical records of those who died from lower respiratory tract infections, sepsis, malnutrition, malaria, and diarrheal diseases to determine the proportion who received recommended treatments and compared adherence by hospitalization duration. CHAMPS enrolled 460 hospitalized children who died from the leading causes (median age 12 months, 53.0% male). Median hospital admission was 31 h. There were 51.0% (n = 127/249) of children who died from lower respiratory tract infections received supplemental oxygen. Administration of intravenous fluids for sepsis (15.9%, n = 36/226) and supplemental feeds for malnutrition (14.0%, n = 18/129) were uncommon. There were 51.4% (n = 55/107) of those who died from malaria received antimalarials. Of the 80 children who died from diarrheal diseases, 76.2% received intravenous fluids. Those admitted for ≥24 h more commonly received antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections and sepsis, supplemental feeds for malnutrition, and intravenous fluids for sepsis than those admitted <24 h.

        "abstract": "Malaria exists as an endemic in many countries including Bangladesh and the malaria vaccine is not yet available here. The study aimed to assess the level of knowledge and acceptance of the malaria vaccination among the parents of children under the age of five in Bangladesh's malaria-endemic areas and the sociodemographic, behavioural, and household factors associated with the acceptance and knowledge of the malaria vaccine. From January to March 2022, a cross-sectional study was conducted in all five malaria-endemic districts of Bangladesh, involving 405 parents of children under the age of 5 who met the inclusion criteria. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the factor affecting parents' acceptance and knowledge of malaria vaccination in children under five and other variables. Majority (54%) of the respondents were mothers. Almost half (49%) of the respondents were aged between 26 and 35 years old and around 90% were from rural areas. A small portion (20%) of the participants were housewives and 46% of them completed primary education. Overall, 70% of the study participants reported that they would accept malaria vaccination independently. About one-fourth (25%) heard about the malaria vaccine and 48% of them mentioned health professionals as the source of information. Knowledge of malaria vaccination was found associated with residence, income, and family size. Acceptance and knowledge were both associated with residence, education, occupation, income, and family size. In a multivariable analysis, housing structure, house wall, house window, knowledge of malaria, testing for malaria, and being diagnosed with malaria were all associated with knowledge of and acceptance of getting vaccinated against malaria. The present study highlights the necessity of creating awareness of malaria vaccines in epidemic areas of Bangladesh. This study offers crucial data to develop a policy for a novel malaria vaccine, supporting its adoption in Bangladesh. This study was based on interviews. The interviewees were recruited as public representatives from the malaria-endemic area to assist us in building an understanding of knowledge and acceptance of the malaria vaccine among parents of under-five children in Bangladesh.",

The strategy has been district-wise, phased elimination; however, the last districts targeted for elimination include remote, forested regions which present several challenges for prevention, detection, and treatment of malaria. These districts border Myanmar which harbors Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites resistant to artemisinins, key drugs used in artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) that have been vital for control programs. Challenges in monitoring emergence of artemisinin resistance (AR), tracking parasite reservoirs, changes in vector behavior and responses to insecticides, as well as other environmental and host factors (including the migration of Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals; FDMNs) may pose added hazards in the final phase of eliminating malaria in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The number of deaths of children younger than 5 years has been steadily decreasing worldwide, from more than 17 million annual deaths in the 1970s to an estimated 5.3 million in 2019 (with 2.8 million deaths occurring in those aged 1-59 months [53% of all deaths in children aged <5 years]). More detailed characterization of childhood deaths could inform interventions to improve child survival. To describe causes of postneonatal child deaths across 7 mortality surveillance sentinel sites in Africa and Asia. The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network conducts childhood mortality surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia using innovative postmortem minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). In this cross-sectional study, MITS was conducted in deceased children aged 1 to 59 months at 7 sites in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia from December 3, 2016, to December 3, 2020. Data analysis was conducted between October and November 2021. The expert panel attributed underlying, intermediate, and immediate conditions in the chain of events leading to death, based on histopathologic analysis, microbiological diagnostics, clinical data, and verbal autopsies. In this study, MITS was performed in 632 deceased children (mean [SD] age at death, 1.3 [0.3] years; 342 [54.1%] male). The 6 most common underlying causes of death were malnutrition (104 [16.5%]), HIV (75 [11.9%]), malaria (71 [11.2%]), congenital birth defects (64 [10.1%]), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs; 53 [8.4%]), and diarrheal diseases (46 [7.2%]). When considering immediate causes only, sepsis (191 [36.7%]) and LRTI (129 [24.8%]) were the 2 dominant causes. An infection was present in the causal chain in 549 of 632 deaths (86.9%); pathogens most frequently contributing to infectious deaths included Klebsiella pneumoniae (155 of 549 infectious deaths [28.2%]; 127 [81.9%] considered nosocomial), Plasmodium falciparum (122 of 549 [22.2%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (109 of 549 [19.9%]). Other organisms, such as cytomegalovirus (57 [10.4%]) and Acinetobacter baumannii (39 [7.1%]; 35 of 39 [89.7%] considered nosocomial), also played important roles. For the top underlying causes of death, the median number of conditions in the chain of events leading to death was 3 for malnutrition, 3 for HIV, 1 for malaria, 3 for congenital birth defects, and 1 for LRTI. Expert panels considered 494 of 632 deaths (78.2%) preventable and 26 of 632 deaths (4.1%) preventable under certain conditions. In this cross-sectional study investigating causes of child mortality in the CHAMPS Network, results indicate that, in these high-mortality settings, infectious diseases continue to cause most deaths in infants and children, often in conjunction with malnutrition. These results also highlight opportunities for action to prevent deaths and reveal common interaction of various causes in the path toward death.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum parasites are the primary cause of malaria across Africa. The problem of drug resistance to malaria is ever growing and novel therapeutic strategies need to be developed, particularly those targeting the parasite and also the host or host-pathogen interaction. Previous studies have shown that the development of cerebral malaria (CM) is related to dysregulation of the immune system in a murine malaria model of experimental cerebral malaria. It involves a complex interaction of events and interferon-gamma seems to be the unifying factor. Therefore, the antiplasmodial activity targeting the parasite and immunomodulatory strategies that reduce overall host inflammation, with IFN-γ in focus, could delay CM onset and prove beneficial in malaria infection therapy. Phyllanthus niruri is used to treat fever and other symptoms of malaria in Nigeria. Its modes of action as an anti-malarial remedy have not been exhaustively investigated. This study therefore examined the aqueous extract of P. niruri (PE) for its antiplasmodial activity in vitro using the Plasmodium falciparum HB3 strain. Furthermore, in vivo murine malaria model using the Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain was used to investigate its anti-malarial effects. We showed that PE has multiple anti-malarial effects, including anti-parasitic and host immunomodulatory activities. Co-culture of P. falciparum with PE and some of its phytoconstituents drastically reduced parasite number. PE also decreased parasitemia, and increased the survival of infected mice. We also observed that the integrity of the blood-brain barrier was maintained in the PE-treated mice. The results confirmed that PE showed moderate antiplasmodial activity. In vivo murine malaria model using P. berghei ANKA for experimental cerebral malaria revealed that PE suppressed parasite growth, and modulate the production of interferon-gamma. The findings demonstrate that PE affects malaria progression, targeting parasites and host cells.",

Effects of temperature and food conditions during larval periods on larval mortality, larval period, female wing size, egg production, egg size, adult longevity, and malaria infection rate were studied using a laboratory strain. Larval survival and female wing size were generally reduced when reared at higher temperatures and with a low food supply during the larval period. Egg production was not significantly affected by temperature during the larval period. Egg size was generally smaller in females reared at higher temperatures during the larval period. The infection rate of mosquitoes that fed on blood from malaria-infected mice was not affected by rearing temperature or food conditions during the larval period.

        "abstract": "Joint efforts by government and non-government organizations have helped to reduce malaria in Bangladesh and set the country on a clear path to eventual malaria elimination. However, achieving that goal would be challenging without a comprehensive understanding of vector bionomics. Targeted capturing of Anopheles mosquitoes over a rainy season, utilizing specific sampling methods, including human landing catches (HLCs), CDC-light traps (CDC-LTs), and pyrethrum spray catches (PSCs) were aimed to characterize entomological drivers of transmission in four sites of Bandarban, Bangladesh. Molecular characterization of a subset of 4637 mosquitoes has demonstrated the presence of at least 17 species whose capture rates were representative of the rainy season. Species compositions and bionomic traits did not vary between sites with Anopheles maculatus having the highest landing rate by HLCs and Anopheles vagus having the highest capture rate with CDC-LTs. Interestingly, Anopheles species compositions and capture rates varied significantly (p < 0.05) for An. vagus, between HLCs and its often-used proxy-CDC-LTs- suggesting impacts on downstream analysis. CDC-LTs capture rates demonstrated differing compositions with indoor and outdoor biting rates. For example, Anopheles nigerrimus and Anopheles nivipes were more endophagic by HLCs and more exophagic by CDC-LTs. The use of a cow-baited CDC-LT also demonstrated significantly different results when compared to a human-baited CDC-LT considering the high degree of anthropophily in these species. The exception to both zoophily and indoor resting was An. vagus, which demonstrated both anthropophily and high resting rates indoors-pointing to this species being a possible primary vector at this site. A diverse Anopheles fauna in Bandarban has been confirmed through molecular methods, highlighting the potential impact of sampling techniques. Given the complexity of the local ecosystem, a better understanding of mosquito behaviour and ecology is required to achieve the goal of malaria elimination in Bangladesh.",

Accordingly, different concentration (5%, 15%, 25%, and 35%) of PGE (Peppermint Garlic Extract) solution was prepared and applied to the developed fabric using an exhaust dyeing process to assess the mosquito (Aedes Aegypti L.) repellency performance. Following WHO (World Health Organization) standard (cone bioassay) and a self-modified cage technique from literature survey, mosquito protection and repellency tests have been performed for characterization. The findings revealed that the PGE-treated fabric samples C (25% PGE) and D (35% PGE) had the highest mosquito mortality (50.00% and 76.67%, respectively) and repellency (78.6% and 85.6%, respectively) rates.

We synthesised qualitative studies from our setting in the Indian subcontinent to understand the dimensions and dynamics involved to help inform service provision. Qualitative synthesis comprising inductive coding, thematic analysis and forming a conceptual framework. Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos were databases searched on 26 March 2020 for studies published since 1 January 2000. We included reports in English from the Indian subcontinent that used qualitative or mixed-methodology designs and reported findings around adherence to TB treatment. Full texts meeting eligibility were sampled based on 'thickness' (the richness of the qualitative data reported). Two reviewers used standardised methods to screen abstracts and code. Included studies were assessed for reliability and quality using a standard tool. Qualitative synthesis was performed by inductive coding, thematic analysis and developing conceptual framework. Of 1729 abstracts screened from initial search, 59 were shortlisted for full-text review. Twenty-four studies that qualified as 'thick' were included in the synthesis. Studies were set in India (12), Pakistan (6), Nepal (3), Bangladesh (1) or in two or more of these countries (2). Of the 24 studies, all but one included people who were taking TB treatment (1 study included only healthcare providers), and 17 included healthcare workers, community members or both.We identified three themes: (1) personal influences on the people with TB include interconnections between their social role in the family unit, their own priorities in day-to-day living and their experience to date with the disease; (2) adherence is profoundly influenced by how individual healthcare providers interact with patients on treatment and address their needs; (3) adherence is influenced across communities by structural, social, economic and cultural factors related to treatment. Staff in TB programmes require an understanding of the various competing influences on individuals undergoing treatment. Programmes need to have more flexible and people-centred approaches to service provision in order to achieve adherence, and thus improve treatment outcomes. CRD42020171409.",

        "title": "Optimal Interruption of P. vivax Malaria Transmission Using Mass Drug Administration.",
        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread malaria-causing parasite resulting in significant associated global morbidity and mortality. One of the factors driving this widespread phenomenon is the ability of the parasites to remain dormant in the liver. Known as 'hypnozoites', they reside in the liver following an initial exposure, before activating later to cause further infections, referred to as 'relapses'. As around 79-96% of infections are attributed to relapses from activating hypnozoites, we expect it will be highly impactful to apply treatment to target the hypnozoite reservoir (i.e. the collection of dormant parasites) to eliminate P. vivax. Treatment with radical cure, for example tafenoquine or primaquine, to target the hypnozoite reservoir is a potential tool to control and/or eliminate P. vivax. We have developed a deterministic multiscale mathematical model as a system of integro-differential equations that captures the complex dynamics of P. vivax hypnozoites and the effect of hypnozoite relapse on disease transmission. Here, we use our multiscale model to study the anticipated effect of radical cure treatment administered via a mass drug administration (MDA) program. We implement multiple rounds of MDA with a fixed interval between rounds, starting from different steady-state disease prevalences. We then construct an optimisation model with three different objective functions motivated on a public health basis to obtain the optimal MDA interval. We also incorporate mosquito seasonality in our model to study its effect on the optimal treatment regime. We find that the effect of MDA interventions is temporary and depends on the pre-intervention disease prevalence (and choice of model parameters) as well as the number of MDA rounds under consideration. The optimal interval between MDA rounds also depends on the objective (combinations of expected intervention outcomes). We find radical cure alone may not be enough to lead to P. vivax elimination under our mathematical model (and choice of model parameters) since the prevalence of infection eventually returns to pre-MDA levels.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by the plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted to people by the bites of infected mosquitoes. As elsewhere, this disease is also a major public health problem in Bangladesh. After independence, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) use was banned in 1985, and the number of malaria cases began to increase. There were no control programs and inadequate funds, especially in the malaria-endemic areas; thus, malaria cases started to be epidemic in the 1990s. The global fund has been supporting the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) in Bangladesh since the approval of the round 6 malaria proposal in 2006. This study aims to review the NMCP and changes in the burden of malaria in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2010. This is a descriptive retrospective study based on the secondary malaria surveillance data (cases and deaths) in 13 malaria-endemic districts, especially five selected districts, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Rangamati, Sylhet, and Mymensingh. A descriptive analysis was carried out to establish the incidence and mortality rate. From 2007 to 2010, a total of 264,293 confirmed malaria cases were notified from 13 malaria-endemic districts. More than 50% of the affected population was under the age group of ≥15 years (55.7%). Males had a higher risk of contracting of malaria than females, accounting for 53.5% of confirmed cases compared to 46.5% of females. Among the affected population, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> caused 85.6% of the total incidence. Rangamati has the highest incidence rate among the five districts. Although the incidence was high, death was declining: in 2007, it was 228, and in 2010, it was 37. The finding shows that while the incidence is still high, mortality is decreasing, therefore, it can be said that the NMCP is functioning. However, to fully achieve the goal of eliminating malaria, the NMCP requires efforts to develop new strategies and maintain a high-quality surveillance and reporting system.",

        "abstract": "With no effective drugs or widely available vaccines, dengue control in Bangladesh is dependent on targeting the primary vector Aedes aegypti with insecticides and larval source management. Despite these interventions, the dengue burden is increasing in Bangladesh, and the country experienced its worst outbreak in 2019 with 101 354 hospitalized cases. This may be partially facilitated by the presence of intense insecticide resistance in vector populations. Here, we describe the intensity and mechanisms of resistance to insecticides commonly deployed against Ae. aegypti in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Dhaka Ae. aegypti colonies exhibited high-intensity resistance to pyrethroids. Using CDC bottle assays, we recorded 2-24% mortality (recorded at 24 h) to permethrin and 48-94% mortality to deltamethrin, at 10× the diagnostic dose. Bioassays conducted using insecticide-synergist combinations suggested that metabolic mechanisms were contributing to pyrethroid resistance, specifically multi-function oxidases, esterases, and glutathione S-transferases. In addition, kdr alleles were detected, with a high frequency (78-98%) of homozygotes for the V1016G mutation. A large proportion (≤ 74%) of free-flying and resting mosquitoes from Dhaka colonies survived exposure to standard applications of pyrethroid aerosols in an experimental free-flight room. Although that exposure affected the immediate host-seeking behavior of Ae. aegypti, the effect was transient in surviving mosquitoes. The intense resistance characterized in this study is likely compromising the operational effectiveness of pyrethroids against Ae. aegypti in Dhaka. Switching to alternative chemical classes may offer a medium-term solution, but ultimately a more sustainable and effective approach to controlling dengue vectors is required. © 2023 The Authors.

        "abstract": "India has made tremendous progress in reducing malaria mortality and morbidity in the last decade. Mizoram State in North-East India is one of the few malaria-endemic regions where malaria transmission has continued to remain high. As Mizoram shares international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, malaria control in this region is critical for malaria elimination efforts in all the three countries. For identifying hotspots for targeted intervention, malaria data from 385 public health sub-centers across Mizoram were analyzed in the Geographic Information System. Almost all the sub-centers reporting high Annual Parasite Index (> 10) are located in Mizoram's districts that border Bangladesh. Getis-Ord G<sub>i</sub>* statistic shows most of the sub-centers located along the Bangladesh border in the Lawngtlai and Lunglei districts to be the malaria hotspots. The hotspots also extended into the Mamit and Siaha districts, especially along the borders of Lawngtlai and Lunglei. Analysis of terrain, climatic, and land use/land cover datasets obtained from the Global Modelling and Assimilation Office and satellite images show Mizoram's western part (Lawngtlai, Lunglei, and Mamit districts) to experience similar topographic and climatic conditions as the bordering Rangamati district in the Chittagong division of Bangladesh. Climatic trends in this region from 1981 to 2021, estimated by the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimates, show an increasing trend in minimum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and the associated shift of climatic pattern (temperate to tropical monsoon) could facilitate malaria transmission. The quasi-Poisson regression model estimates a strong association (p < 0.001) between total malaria cases, temperature range, and elevation. The Kruskal-Wallis H test shows a statistically significant association between malaria cases and forest classes (p < 0.001). A regional coordination and strategic plan are required to eliminate malaria from this hyper-endemic malaria region of North-East India.",

        "abstract": "We determined the pulse oximetry benefit in pediatric pneumonia mortality risk stratification and chest-indrawing pneumonia in-hospital mortality risk factors. We report the characteristics and in-hospital pneumonia-related mortality of children aged 2-59 months who were included in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations dataset. We developed multivariable logistic regression models of chest-indrawing pneumonia to identify mortality risk factors. Among 285,839 children, 164,244 (57.5%) from hospital-based studies were included. Pneumonia case fatality risk (CFR) without pulse oximetry measurement was higher than with measurement (5.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-5.9% vs 2.1%, 95% CI 1.9-2.4%). One in five children with chest-indrawing pneumonia was hypoxemic (19.7%, 95% CI 19.0-20.4%), and the hypoxemic CFR was 10.3% (95% CI 9.1-11.5%). Other mortality risk factors were younger age (either 2-5 months [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 9.94, 95% CI 6.67-14.84] or 6-11 months [aOR 2.67, 95% CI 1.71-4.16]), moderate malnutrition (aOR 2.41, 95% CI 1.87-3.09), and female sex (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.32). Children with a pulse oximetry measurement had a lower CFR. Many children hospitalized with chest-indrawing pneumonia were hypoxemic and one in 10 died. Young age and moderate malnutrition were risk factors for in-hospital chest-indrawing pneumonia-related mortality. Pulse oximetry should be integrated in pneumonia hospital care for children under 5 years.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions, particularly travel restrictions, have had significant impact on the conduct of global clinical trials. Our clinical trials programme, which relied on in-person visits for training, monitoring and capacity building across nine low- and middle-income countries, had to adapt to those unprecedented operational challenges. We report the adaptation of our working model with a focus on the operational areas of training, monitoring and cross-site collaboration. Adaptations include changing training strategies from in-person site visits with three or four team members to a multi-pronged virtual approach, with generic online training for good clinical practice, the development of a library of study-specific training videos, and interactive virtual training sessions, including practical laboratory-focused training sessions. We also report changes from in-person monitoring to remote monitoring as well as the development of a more localized network of clinical trial monitors to support hybrid models with in-person and remote monitoring depending on identified risks at each site. We established a virtual network across different trial and study sites with the objective to further build capacity for good clinical practice-compliant antimalarial trials and foster cross-country and cross-study site collaboration. The forced adaptation of these new strategies has come with advantages that we did not envisage initially. This includes improved, more frequent engagement through the established network with opportunities for increased south-to-south support and a substantially reduced carbon footprint and budget savings. Our new approach is challenging for study sites with limited prior experience but this can be overcome with hybrid models. Capacity building for laboratory-based work remains difficult using a virtual environment. The changes to our working model are likely to last, even after the end of the pandemic, providing a more sustainable and equitable approach to our research.",

The guidelines also provide recommendations for SOT recipients traveling to this region. These guidelines are based on literature review and expert opinion by transplant physicians, surgeons, and infectious diseases specialists, mostly from South Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) as well as transplant experts from other countries. These guidelines cover relevant endemic bacterial infections (tuberculosis, leptospirosis, melioidosis, typhoid, scrub typhus), viral infections (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E; rabies; and the arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Japanese encephalitis), endemic fungal infections (mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, sporotrichosis), and endemic parasitic infections (malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, strongyloidiasis, and filariasis) as well as travelers' diarrhea and vaccination for SOT candidates and recipients including travelers visiting this region. These guidelines are intended to be an overview of each topic; more detailed reviews are being published as a special supplement in the Indian Journal of Transplantation .",
