        "abstract": "Human toxoplasmosis remains a significant, yet often underrecognized, global health concern. This review highlights emerging advances in prevention and management, offering timely updates for clinicians and researchers. Recent venison-associated outbreaks in the United States have emphasized the risk of ocular toxoplasmosis and severe disease in immune competent individuals and the need for heightened clinical suspicion. Updated guidelines for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients now recommend systematic screening, qPCR monitoring, and prophylaxis to reduce mortality from Toxoplasma gondii reactivation. Emerging evidence suggests that chronic T. gondii infection may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, challenging the long-held assumption that chronic infection is protective against these complications. Although the potential association between chronic T. gondii infection and neuropsychiatric disorders remains debated, its public health relevance warrants further investigation. Improved clinical awareness, applied preventive strategies, and expanded research are essential to mitigate the broader health impact of chronic T. gondii infection. Future well designed studies and rigorous analyses are critical to defining maternal-fetal risks and potential neuropsychiatric effects, providing the evidence needed to update clinical guidelines and inform public health policies.",

        "title": "Exploring Practices for Implementing Smoking Cessation in Oncology Settings: A Rapid Systematic Review Update.",
        "abstract": "IntroductionSmoking cessation among individuals with cancer increases the effectiveness of cancer treatments and reduces the risks of death. However, individuals receiving cancer treatments in Ontario's 14 regional cancer centres are provided advice on the benefits of quitting smoking and referrals to smoking cessation treatments at different rates. This rapid systematic review was conducted, with funding from the Canadian Cancer Society, to update a published systematic review (Young et al, 2023) and to (1) identify implementation strategies and related implementation outcomes used in oncology settings; (2) describe the characteristics of these implementation strategies and implementation outcomes; and (3) determine whether specific implementation strategies are associated with increased smoking cessation efforts, referred to as the 3As (Ask, Advise, and Act) approach to smoking cessation.MethodsThis rapid systematic review was registered in The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42023491391). Three databases were searched for relevant studies: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The quality of included studies was assessed based on their study design and narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data extracted.Results3158 studies were found, and eighteen new studies met our inclusion criteria. All eighteen studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. The implementation strategies training and educating stakeholders, using evaluative and iterative strategies, providing interactive assistance, supporting clinicians, and developing stakeholder interrelationships were associated with increased asking, advising, and acting, although these associations do not imply causality. Only 5 studies measured implementation outcomes; however, heterogeneity in the measurement tools used prevented analysis.ConclusionAlthough abundant data on implementation strategies was found, implementation outcomes were sparse and connections between the implementation strategies and implementation outcomes could not be drawn. Future studies should pilot the implementation strategies associated with increased asking, advising, and acting, and measure their success, considering both implementation strategies and implementation outcomes, as this information is lacking in the current literature.",

        "abstract": "Cisplatin resistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of ovarian cancer, significantly limiting therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the role of E26 transformation-specific transcription factor 3 (ELK3) in cisplatin resistance and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism involving the tropomyosin 2 (TPM2)-Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling axis. By silencing ELK3 and TPM2 in combination with cisplatin treatment, the regulatory effects of ELK3 and TPM2 on cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cells were evaluated. The interaction between ELK3 and the TPM2 promoter was verified via chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Western blotting was used to assess the expression of DNA damage marker gamma-histone H2AX and YAP1 to investigate the role of TPM2 in ELK3-mediated signaling and drug response. Cisplatin treatment markedly increased ELK3 expression. Knockdown of ELK3 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity by suppressing cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, and increasing DNA damage. Mechanistically, ELK3 was directly bound to the promoter region of TPM2 and repressed its transcription. Downregulation of TPM2 subsequently led to increased activation of the YAP1 signaling pathway. Rescue experiments demonstrated that silencing TPM2 reversed the chemosensitizing effects of ELK3 knockdown. These findings highlight the ELK3/TPM2/YAP1 axis as a critical regulator of cisplatin resistance. By suppressing TPM2 and subsequently activating YAP1 signaling, our study identified ELK3 as a crucial transcriptional repressor that contributes to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.",

        "abstract": "Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer are at risk of adverse mental health outcomes during and after treatment. Tools identifying AYA at the highest risk would guide screening and interventions. We determined whether self-reported symptoms following cancer diagnosis were associated with early and late severe mental health events (SMHEs). Ontario AYA diagnosed with cancer aged 15-29 between 2010 and 2018 were identified and linked to healthcare databases, including one capturing self-reported Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) scores at cancer-related visits. Scores for depression, anxiety, and poor well-being were categorized as not measured, mild, moderate, or severe. SMHEs were defined as mental health-related Emergency Department visits or hospitalizations. We determined the association of ESAS scores with subsequent early SMHEs (< 5 years). Among 5-year survivors, we determined the association between the maximum ESAS score within 1 year of cancer diagnosis and late SMHEs (occurring > 5 years from cancer diagnosis). Among 5435 AYA, symptom severity was associated with subsequent SMHE risk. AYA who reported severe versus mild anxiety were at > 3-fold higher risk of subsequent early SMHEs [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.6, 95th confidence interval (CI) 1.9-6.7; p < 0.001]. Among 3518 (64.7%) 5-year survivors, symptom severity predicted late SMHE. At 5 years postcancer diagnosis, those who reported severe versus mild depression within 1 year following cancer diagnosis were at 3-fold elevated risk (aHR 3.0, 95 CI 1.8-4.9; p < 0.0001). Systematic symptom screening early postcancer diagnosis identifies AYA at high risk of both early and late SMHEs who may benefit from targeted screening and interventions.",

        "abstract": "Historical genetic sequencing of specific cancer variants has been superseded by comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). This narrative review aimed to capture current international evidence on the clinical utility of CGP for cancer prevention, detection and treatment. A literature search of three databases was performed to identify key studies on the frequency of germline and somatic variants in adult cancers and the extent to which they inform diagnosis, management and outcome. Findings were inductively mapped and narratively synthesised. Consolidated results from 95 original research papers showed that pathogenic germline (familial) variants are found in ~10% of adults with cancer, of whom 53%-61% are offered germline genotype-directed treatment. Importantly, 50% of germline carriers would not have satisfied the eligibility criteria for genetic testing and/or reported a negative family history. Actionable somatic variants occur in 27%-88% of cases, which markedly impact the diagnosis for cancers of unknown primary. Matched treatments were identified for 31%-48% of cancer patients, of whom 33%-45% received it. Response and survival rates were better in individuals receiving matched therapies compared to those receiving standard of care or unmatched therapies. Trials show that circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) assays are feasible and sensitive. The relatively non-invasive ctDNA sample collection is appealing for cancers with inaccessible or unknown primary sites, and serial monitoring of residual disease and/or treatment response. As matched therapies are underutilised due to declining patient condition and fewer prior therapies predicting better response rates, research is needed on the suitability of cancer genomic profiling as a frontline test.",

        "abstract": "The association between an individual's alcohol misuse and their spouse's/partner's behavioral health is well documented. Whether these associations vary by sexual orientation is unknown. We used data from the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III; <i>n</i> = 36,309 U.S. adults ≥18 years). Using multivariable logistic regression models, we examined the associations between sexual orientation (heterosexual-identified with concordant attraction/behavior, heterosexual-identified with discordant attraction/behavior, gay/lesbian, and bisexual) and having a lifetime history of spouse/partner with alcohol problems with lifetime DSM-5 alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, any substance use disorder (SUD), anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and comorbid mental health and SUDs. We conducted two-way interaction tests between history of spouse/partner with alcohol problems and sexual orientation for each outcome. The prevalence of a history of spouse/partner with problem drinking varied by sex and sexual orientation, ranging from 28.8% (bisexual females) to 9.1% (bisexual males). Having a history of a spouse/partner with alcohol problems was associated with increased odds of each outcome (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] range: 1.6 to 2.3, <i>p</i> < 0.001). All sexual minority subgroups had increased odds of each outcome (AOR range: 1.3 to 3.2, <i>p</i> < 0.001), relative to their heterosexual concordant counterparts. Our interaction tests were not significant at the <i>p</i> < 0.001 level; the effect of having a spouse/partner with alcohol problems is similar across sexual orientation subgroups.

Communication between patients and providers is essential in ensuring patients take prescribed medication appropriately. To investigate the available evidence on the effectiveness of bi-directional communication interventions that focus on both patients and clinicians in outpatient settings aimed at changing how patients take their medications. The desired patient medication behavior changes included initiation, adherence, dose escalation, dose reduction, and discontinuation. We performed a systematic review of research studies assessing bi-directional patient-provider communication interventions targeting patient medication behavior change in the outpatient setting. We identified the types of interventions used in each study and the components of successful trials. We included eight randomized controlled trials and two quasi-experimental trial with a total of 2,911 adult participants. Among the 10 studies, 9 reported statistically significant improvement in the desired direction of medication behavior change in the intervention group compared to control group. This scoping review shows the promise of bi-directional patient-provider communication tools in impacting behavior related to how patients take their prescribed medications. More randomized controlled trials with standardized outcomes are needed to better assess the utility of patient-provider communication tools. Including both patient and provider in an effort to improve desired patient medication behavior change should be considered when educational interventions are designed.",

        "abstract": "Cell-cell communication is essential for the regulated exchange of information between cells, coordinating critical cellular processes under physiological and pathological conditions. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex three-dimensional (3D) intercellular macromolecular network that provides structural support to tissues, while actively modulating cellular functions and responses. ECM-mediated intercellular communication is a key player in both homeostasis and disease development. Particularly in cancer, ECM reorganization drives tumor development and progression, shaping dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we present and discuss two principal mechanisms of matrix-mediated cell-cell communication in both physiological and cancerous contexts. First, we explore the impact of ECM biomechanical properties in mechanical sensing and communication, which govern key aspects of cell signaling, adhesion, and migration across normal and malignant tissues. Second, we discuss the role of the ECM in facilitating cell-cell communication through the controlled release and navigation of extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs carry, among other constituents, proteins, enzymes, microRNAs (miRNAs), and signaling molecules that relay information to nearby or distant cells, modulating the initiation of metastasis and pre-metastatic niche formation. Conclusively, in this review, we highlight the critical role of targeting ECM dynamics in cell-cell communication under physiological processes and during cancer progression. Targeted therapies that modulate ECM components and interactions with cells hold promise for future treatment approaches.",

This study explored whether these two populations have the same role in brain tumor progression. In an in vitro coculture model using the astrocytoma cells ALTS1C1 with either the microglial cell line BV2 or the peripheral macrophage cell line RAW264.7, only BV2, not RAW264.7, gathers ALTS1C1 into tumor cell clusters. These BV2-associated clusters limited ALTS1C1 proliferation but not BV2 cell growth. The in vivo studies show that the survival time of mice co-inoculated with ALTS1C1 and BV2 was prolonged from 30.4 ± 3.1 days to more than 77 days in immune-competent mice but not in immune-compromised mice. Examining the tumor microenvironment (TME) by immunohistochemical staining revealed that the co-inoculation of BV2 increased the CD8 T cells' infiltration and the expression of Granzyme B. Mice bearing with BV2-containing ALTS1C1 tumor exhibited a reduced level of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and an elevated level of CD8 T cells in peripheral blood compared to the ALTS1C1 tumor-bearing group.

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of radiomics utilizing pre-surgery contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) for predicting p53 status in IDH-mt gliomas. A total of seventy-eight patients with pathologically confirmed IDH-mutant glioma were admitted to our institution between January 2011 and October 2018. For each patient, three types of volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented: (i) VOI<sup>T</sup>: the entire tumor (including the necrotic area within the tumor); (ii) VOI<sup>PE</sup>: the peritumoral edema; (iii) VOI<sup>T + PE</sup>: the entire tumor and peritumoral edema. A total of 962 radiomic features were extracted for each VOI, followed by feature selection and modeling (Rad_VOI<sup>T</sup>, Rad_VOI<sup>PE</sup>, and Rad_VOI<sup>T + PE</sup> models) using machine learning algorithms. A nomogram was developed to integrate significant clinical factors and radiomic predictors for p53 status prediction. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was leveraged as the stopping rule. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The VOI<sup>PE</sup> model, which included the eight best-performing features, demonstrated the highest predictive performance among the three VOI-based models, with AUCs of 0.811 (95% CI: 0.782-0.840) and 0.810 (95% CI: 0.786-0.834) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Age was identified as the only significant clinical factor and was combined with the Rad-scores from VOI<sup>T</sup>, VOI<sup>PE</sup>, and VOI<sup>T + PE</sup> to construct a clinical-radiomics nomogram with the most notable discriminative ability for p53 status (AIC = -120.19). The AUCs for this nomogram were 0.969 (95% CI: 0.942-0.996) in the training cohort and 0.929 (95% CI: 0.898-0.960) in the validation cohort. The CE-T1WI-based radiomic model can noninvasively predict p53 mutation status in IDH-mt gliomas. The textural differences of peritumoral edema may more accurately reflect the underlying tumor heterogeneity associated with p53 status.",

These needs span physical, psychosocial, spiritual, informational, and practical dimensions and, if unaddressed, can impact quality of life and healthcare satisfaction. This study aimed to identify and understand the unmet needs of CSs in Italy to guide the development of patient-centered survivorship care services. A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted between April 2023 and January 2024 at the Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Reggio Emilia, Italy. Data were collected through focus groups and individual interviews with 35 CSs and seven caregivers selected via convenience sampling. Eligibility criteria included non-cutaneous CSs with a 5-year survival rate of ≥ 65% who had completed active treatment and were in follow-up care. Data were analyzed using the Framework Method. Four key themes emerged: (1) Dignity and Respect: Emphasis on the importance of treating CSs with dignity and respect within healthcare settings; (2) Desire for Normality: Highlighting CSs' strong desire to regain a sense of normalcy post-treatment; (3) Pursuit of Control Over One's Life: CSs' need to maintain control, particularly regarding information needs and treatment management; (4) Existential Vulnerability: The vulnerability and fragility felt by CSs, underscoring their need for emotional support and reassurance. Unmet needs remain a significant challenge for CSs, necessitating the implementation of tailored, patient-centered care interventions. Addressing these needs can enhance quality of life, satisfaction, and outcomes for CSs worldwide. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06236373.",

Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy of the cavity (HFSRT) may offer equivalent tumor control with reduced toxicity. ESTRON is the first randomized trial comparing post-operative HFSRT and WBRT. This single-center phase 2 trial randomized 56 patients with resected BM to receive HFSRT (35 Gy in 7 fractions) or WBRT (30 Gy in 10 fractions). Patients could have ≤10 additional unresected BMs. The primary endpoint was intracranial progression-free survival (ic-PFS). Secondary endpoints included local control (LC), overall survival (OS), leptomeningeal disease (LMD), and toxicity. Fifty-four patients were evaluable (n=27 per arm). At 24.7 months median follow-up, 12-month ic-PFS was 44.4% (HFSRT) versus 59.3% (WBRT) (HR 1.72, p=0.080). Median ic-PFS was 4.7 vs. 15.0 months. LC at 24 months was 94.1% (HFSRT) vs. 85.4% (WBRT) (HR 0.41, p=0.433).

One-year risk of LMD was 27.0% (HFSRT, predominantly outside the irradiated field) vs. 8.7% (WBRT) (log-rank p=0.03). Treatment-related adverse events were more frequent with WBRT (115 vs. 54 events), including 19% vs. 11% grade 3 events, and poorer neurocognitive performance. Survival was similar for HFSRT and WBRT, while WBRT trended towards better ic-PFS. HFSRT showed substantially lower toxicity and better neurocognitive preservation, however a higher risk of LMD.

        "abstract": "Obesity is a common health problem affecting over a third of the population worldwide. Obesity has been correlated with many diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer, brain degeneration, and premature aging. In men, obesity can also cause issues like erectile dysfunction, poor sperm quality, and prostate problems. Factors like high insulin levels, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress may play a role in how obesity affects male fertility. Obesity can disrupt the male reproductive system by changing hormone levels, affecting sperm production, and causing problems with metabolism. This can result in a reduction of sperm count, motility, and normal forms. Obesity can also cause sperm DNA fragmentation, increase cell death, and impact the genetic information that can be passed on to future generations. This narrative review explores how obesity impacts male reproductive health and fertility, as well as possible treatment options like weight management, lifestyle changes, medications, and alternative therapies.",

        "abstract": "Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the standard treatment for intermediate-risk, high-grade, and high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, it is associated with adverse effects, potentially causing treatment interruptions or discontinuation. This study analyzed the tolerability and efficacy of induction BCG, with associated patient- and disease-related factors. A retrospective analysis was conducted on BCG-naive patients diagnosed with high-grade NMIBC, who received induction BCG at our institution between 2011 and 2021. Tolerability was defined as the completion of a 6-week induction course of BCG without treatment interruption or discontinuation. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine risk factors associated with the inability to tolerate treatment. Induction BCG was given to 203 NMIBC patients, where 147 (72%) patients tolerated the treatment. Treatment interruptions occurred in 44 (22%) patients, while 12 (5.9%) patients discontinued the treatment. The median length of interruption was 1 week, primarily due to concerns about urinary tract infection (UTI) (<i>n</i> = 18, 41%) or gross hematuria (<i>n</i> = 5, 11%). No significant difference in 1-year recurrence rates was observed between those who tolerated BCG and those who did not (50% vs. 48%). Risk factors associated with the inability to tolerate induction BCG included male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 5.76, <i>p</i> < 0.01), hypertension (OR = 3.47, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and low pre-treatment hemoglobin levels (OR = 0.73, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Inability to tolerate BCG occurred in 28% of patients, with 5.9% experiencing discontinuation. Interruptions were short, mostly concerning UTI, and rarely leading to discontinuation. Poor tolerability was associated with male sex, hypertension, and low pre-treatment hemoglobin levels, highlighting critical targets for reducing the risk of BCG interruption or discontinuation.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) remains a prevalent and complex malignancy characterized by significant heterogeneity. Treatment strategies are diverse, based on patient characteristics and cancer stage. Early identification of biomarkers is crucial for improving diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. These biomarkers offer valuable insights into lesion features, tumor differentiation, and disease progression, thereby playing a pivotal role in the personalized management of BLCA. This study investigated the expression of cancer-testis antigens <i>SPEF1</i> and <i>SPEF2</i> in BLCA using comprehensive bioinformatic analyses to assess their potential as biomarkers. The UALCAN database, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets, was employed to compare <i>SPEF1</i> and <i>SPEF2</i> expression levels in normal bladder tissues and BLCA samples. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier Plotter, OncoDB, and TIMER 2.0 platforms were utilized to evaluate the prognostic and immunotherapeutic relevance of these antigens. The findings suggest that <i>SPEF1</i> and <i>SPEF2</i> are integral to various biological processes driving BLCA onset and progression. Both genes appear to facilitate BLCA cell progression and migration, contributing to poor prognosis through specific pathways and by altering tumor microenvironment. Notably, <i>SPEF1</i> expression was significantly upregulated in BLCA tissues compared to normal tissues. Conversely, higher <i>SPEF2</i> expression was associated with longer overall survival and positively correlated with immunotherapeutic targets. Although these results were derived from <i>in silico</i> analyses, they offer insights into the potential roles of <i>SPEF1</i> and <i>SPEF2</i> as biomarkers.

BCG-induced cystitis presents with symptoms similar to bacterial infections, such as urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. Conventional treatments, such as BCG discontinuation, antibiotic therapy, and corticosteroid use, are often insufficient. HA therapy works by restoring the bladder's glycosaminoglycan layer, reducing inflammation, and promoting tissue repair. This narrative review assessed the efficacy and safety of HA in managing BCG-induced cystitis based on a literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases, identifying seven relevant studies. HA treatment has been associated with improvements in bladder symptoms, including reductions in pain, urgency, and frequency, as well as an increase in bladder capacity. Combination treatments with chondroitin sulfate or pirarubicin demonstrated superior outcomes compared to HA alone. While the studies reported minimal adverse effects, variability in study design, sample sizes, and follow-up durations limited the strength of the evidence.

        "abstract": "Translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) is a rare and aggressive subtype of kidney cancer driven by an oncogenic fusion involving a transcription factor in the <i>MiT/TFE</i> gene family, most commonly <i>TFE3</i> . Treatment of tRCC currently lacks a clear standard of care, underscoring the pressing need to nominate new therapeutic targets with mechanistic rationale in this cancer. In this study, we applied integrative genomic approaches to identify activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways in tRCC. We tested the activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), alone or in combination with mTORC1-selective inhibition, using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of tRCC. tRCC tumors displayed multiple genomic and transcriptional features associated with activation of the CDK4/6 and mTORC1 signaling pathways. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4/6 suppressed tRCC cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest <i>in vitro</i> but was not cytotoxic, with rapid cell regrowth observed after drug withdrawal. The mTORC1-selective inhibitor, RMC-5552, potently reduced translation of Cyclin D1, which complexes with CDK4/6 proteins to regulate G1-S cell cycle progression. Combined treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, and RMC-5552 resulted in synergistic suppression of tRCC cell viability and increased markers of apoptosis <i>in vitro</i> . The combination of palbociclib and RMC-5552 in a tRCC xenograft model showed greater eOicacy than either single agent while also being well-tolerated. Our study indicates the therapeutic potential of combined CDK4/6 and mTORC1 inhibition in tRCC, providing the rationale for further clinical evaluation of this strategy. Translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC) is a rare and aggressive form of kidney cancer that accounts for 2-5% of all RCCs in adults and around 50% of RCCs in children. tRCC lacks effective therapies and represents a significant unmet clinical need. Therapies approved for clear cell RCC (ccRCC), including VEGF/multikinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade, typically show decreased efficacy in tRCC. Via an integrative genomic analysis, we nominate combined inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways in tRCC. We demonstrate that combining the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib with the mTORC1-selective inhibitor RMC-5552 synergistically inhibits the growth of tRCC cells <i>in vitro</i> and of tRCC xenografts <i>in vivo</i> , where the combination is well-tolerated. This proof-of-concept study provides preclinical evidence supporting CDK4/6 inhibitor-based combination regimens tailored to tRCC biology, offering a foundation for future clinical studies in tRCC, which currently has no clear standard of care.",

N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is a post-transcriptional modification of RNA, and the most prevalent internal chemical modification of mRNA. KIAA1429, also known as virus-like m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase-associated, is a key component of the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, and the largest protein within this complex. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of transcripts >200 nucleotides in length that are able to regulate gene expression.

The current study presents the case of a 62-year-old man admitted to The Second Hospital of Jilin University (Jilin, China) for blurred vision.

The condition of the patient was controlled during the first treatment period, which led to a temporary improvement in quality of life. However, the disease rapidly progressed, and the patient declined further treatment and ultimately succumbed to his illness. Visual symptoms may be the first indication of malignant tumors; therefore, ocular symptoms should be vigilantly monitored in patients diagnosed with malignant tumors.

However, limited real-world comparative data exist regarding its efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with ESCC, necessitating further investigation. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin for the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced ESCC. A retrospective analysis of clinical and pathological data was performed on 70 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy followed by radical esophagectomy at Banan Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University from February 2021 to August 2023. Patients were divided into two groups based on treatment received: A control group (35 patients; neoadjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel + cisplatin) and an observation group (35 patients; camrelizumab + paclitaxel + cisplatin). Short-term efficacy, treatment-related adverse reactions (graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0), and postoperative pathological complete remission (pCR) rate were compared. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The observation group had a significantly higher pCR rate compared with the control group (40.0 vs. 8.57%; P=0.002). All patients in the observation group achieved R0 resection, versus 32 (91.4%) in the control group. No grade ≥4 adverse events (AEs) occurred.

However, molecular regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in GC remain unclear. The present study aimed to identify key ferroptosis-related genes associated with GC development. Ferroptosis-related genes were collected from FerrDb, a database that collects data on genes and substances that regulate ferroptosis, and the top survival-related genes (including progression-free and overall survival), and differentially expressed genes were identified using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) samples. Following intersection analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis was performed on 140 screened important genes, and 14 key ferroptosis-related genes in STAD were obtained using Cox regression models. By reviewing the expression of these genes through the Gene Set Cancer Analysis tool and their correlation with survival, the present study analyzed their overall role in STAD. Tumor immunity analysis was performed to identify potential microRNAs (miRs) and drugs targeting key carcinogenic ferroptosis genes in STAD. NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4, NOX5, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C2, RNA binding motif single stranded interacting protein 1 (RBMS1), GABA type A receptor associated protein like 2 (GABARAPL2), gap junction protein α1 (GJA1), transferrin and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 were notable risk genes. Additionally, by examining the association between these genes and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, it was discovered that GABARAPL2, GJA1, NOX4 and RBMS1 may influence the immune microenvironment. In total, five miRs [<i>Homo sapiens</i> (hsa)-miR-6795-5p, hsa-miR-6758-5p, hsa-miR-501-5p, hsa-miR-505-5p and hsa-miR-484] with potential therapeutic implications for STAD were identified as targeting carcinogenic genes.

        "abstract": "Resistance to poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) presents a considerable obstacle in the treatment of ovarian cancer. F-box and tryptophan-aspartic (WD) repeat domain containing 11 (FBXW11) modulates the ubiquitination of growth-and invasion-related factors in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and osteosarcoma. The function of FBXW11 in PARPi therapy is still ambiguous. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that <i>FBXW11</i> expression was raised in ovarian cancer cells that had been treated with PARPi. FBXW11 was abnormally expressed at low levels in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) tissues, and low levels of FBXW11 were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in HGSOC patients. Overexpressing FBXW11 made ovarian cancer more sensitive to PARPi, while knocking down FBXW11 made it less sensitive. The four-dimensional (4D) label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that FBXW11 targeted S100 calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11) and promoted its degradation through ubiquitination. The increased degradation of S100A11 led to less efficient DNA damage repair, which in turn contributed to increased PARPi-induced DNA damage. The role of FBXW11 in promoting PARPi sensitivity was also confirmed in xenograft mouse models. In summary, our study confirms that FBXW11 promotes the susceptibility of ovarian cancer cells to PARPi via affecting S100A11-mediated DNA damage repair.",

HERITAGE, associated with a nationwide follow-up survey by the Japan Liver Cancer Association, included cases where first-line systemic therapy commenced between April 2015 and December 2022. We collected data on treatment regimens, patient demographics, effectiveness, and duration and assessed changes in regimens, trends in patient characteristics, efficacy per regimen, and cross-resistance in combinations of first- and second-line treatments. The study enrolled over 8,000 treatment lines from 5,525 cases. Chronological analysis revealed a progression in first-line treatments from sorafenib to lenvatinib and then to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. These regimens were frequently reused in second and subsequent lines. There was an increase in older patients and those with nonviral etiologies and robust liver function. Treatments were generally initiated at earlier disease stages. Cross-resistance studies indicated that responses to second-line treatments were significantly influenced by the efficacy of first-line therapies, particularly in tyrosine kinase inhibitor sequences. Through establishing a comprehensive registry, this study unveiled evolving patterns in treatment regimens and shifts in patient demographics for systemic HCC therapy in Japan.",

        "abstract": "Particle therapy (PT) for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is expected to provide good local control. However, it is difficult to compare PT with the current standard treatment modalities, surgery, and chemotherapy. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature to compare PT with surgery and drug therapy. A meta-analysis was performed using studies from 2010 to 2024 in which PT or surgery or drug therapy was performed for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. 40 articles (7 PT, 13 surgery, 19 drug therapy, one surgery, and drug therapy) were selected based on used of radial surgery or first-line drug therapy. PT was basically for unresectable cases, and 80% of drug therapy cases had distant metastases. Forty selected articles found 1-3-year OS rates (PT vs. surgery vs. drug therapy) of 70.7% (95% CI: 64.2-76.1%) vs. 78.6% (74.2-82.3%) (<i>p</i> = 0.1198) vs. 49.0% (43.4-54.4%) (<i>p</i> = 0.0001); 47.1% (40.9-53.0%) vs. 56.3% (48.8-63.1%) (<i>p</i> = 0.1265) vs. 25.3% (19.7-31.3%) (<i>p</i> = 0.0011); and 36.6% (27.0-46.3%) vs. 46.8% (41.7-51.6%) (<i>p</i> = 0.1213) vs. 14.7% (8.3-22.7%) (<i>p</i> = 0.0021), respectively. And the 1-3-year local control rates for PT were 89.4% (95% CI: 81.3-94.1%), 74.6% (63.0-83.1%) and 67.1% (51.4-78.7%), respectively. Meta-regression analysis was performed using modality (PT vs. surgery vs. drug therapy), male: female ratio, and median age as risk factors. The results showed no significant difference between surgery and PT, but drug therapy showed significantly lower 1- and 2-year OS rates and median survival time, and a trend toward lower 3-year OS. The results of this analysis suggest that PT for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma may be one of the standard treatments in unresectable cases and in combination with drug therapy.",

        "abstract": "The gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in regulating host immunity, metabolism, and overall health. Disruptions to this microbial ecosystem, known as dysbiosis, have been implicated in various conditions such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and metabolic syndromes. Although probiotics are widely used to restore microbial balance, their efficacy is often inconsistent due to variable colonization and concerns over antimicrobial resistance gene transfer. This review explores the growing body of literature surrounding postbiotics-bioactive metabolites produced by probiotics-as a promising alternative to live microbial therapy. We focus on key classes of postbiotics including exopolysaccharides, cell-free supernatants, short-chain fatty acids, and bacteriocins, summarizing their reported immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. We also highlight recent developments in formulation techniques, such as encapsulation, which enhance their stability and bioavailability. While current findings are promising, limitations persist, including variability in postbiotic composition and a lack of standardized clinical evaluations. Future research should aim to clarify their mechanisms of action, define optimal delivery strategies, and assess long-term safety. Overall, postbiotics present a sustainable, non-viable, and functionally rich alternative to probiotics, aligning with global health goals-Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)-by offering safer, scalable, and effective therapeutic solutions.",

        "abstract": "Delayed genitourinary (GU) toxicity is reported following definitive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer in 15% to 30% of patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a relationship between radiation dose to the bladder and urethra and GU toxicity grade ≥ 2 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 4.0) in patients treated with SBRT. PROstate Multicenter External beam radioTHErapy Using Stereotactic boost was a phase 2 multicenter trial exploring an SBRT boost of 19 to 20 Gy in 2 fractions to the prostate combined with fractionated external beam radiation therapy as a virtual high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost for patients with prostate cancer. Several bladder and urethral constraints were mandated prospectively. Bladder and the urethral planning organ at risk volume (PRV) dosimetry was correlated with physician-reported GU toxicity for patients ≥ 6 months following SBRT. An association between prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and urinary toxicity was also examined. Univariant and multivariate analyses were performed. Of the 151 patients, 87 had complete dosimetric data, and these patients were included in this analysis. In this cohort, 19.5% experienced grade ≥ 2 GU toxicity more than 6 months after stereotactic radiation therapy. On univariate analysis, prostatic urethral length, urethral PRV volume, bladder D2 cc, D5 cc, D10 cc, D15 cc, and bladder V8 were predictive of GU toxicity (all <i>P</i> < .05). In the 14 patients who had prior TURP, 6 (43%) experienced GU toxicity compared with 15% for those without prior TURP (<i>P</i> = .015). Multivariate analysis showed that prostatic urethral length, urethral PRV volume, bladder 10 cc, and bladder 15 cc remained statistically significant factors predicting GU toxicity. Prostate SBRT delivered as a virtual high-dose-rate boost is well tolerated overall. However, delayed GU toxicity is experienced by a significant minority of patients. Additional bladder constraints including D10 cc < 17 Gy and D15 cc < 15 Gy may further reduce the risk of delayed GU toxicity. Prior TURP may be a plausible additional risk factor.",

        "abstract": "Immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer treatment; however, the heterogeneous and dynamic tumor microenvironment (TME) imposes critical constraints on therapeutic outcomes. Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), often dysregulated in malignant tissues, plays a pivotal role in shaping an immunosuppressive milieu by depleting tryptophan, thereby hindering anti-tumor immune response. To counteract this immune evasion mechanism, we designed a novel indole-coordinated ruthenium(ii) arene complex (In-Ru), aimed at bolstering tumor immunotherapy and thwarting immune evasion by targeting TDO expression. Our findings reveal that In-Ru exerts markedly potent anti-proliferative effects against HepG2 cells. It achieves this by specifically localizing to the cell nucleus, inducing DNA damage, and initiating a cascade of necroptosis as well as immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby potentially enhancing the immune system's capacity to recognize and attack cancer cells. RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis indicate that In-Ru modulates pathways linked to tryptophan metabolism and immune reprogramming, with specific degradation of TDO protein and reversal of tryptophan-mediated immunosuppression. Furthermore, TDO inhibition boosts ROS production and induces necroptosis <i>via</i> mitochondrial damage, triggering a strong immune response. The tumor vaccine experiment revealed that In-Ru significantly reduced TDO levels and triggered ICD effect in liver cancer animal models. By reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, In-Ru facilitated the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and promoted T-cell infiltration, thereby achieving robust anti-tumor efficacy and long-lasting immune protection. This study represents the first report of a metal-arene complex with dual functions of TDO inhibition and ICD induction. It not only enhances anti-tumor immunogenicity but also effectively mitigates the risk of immune overactivation, offering a precise regulatory paradigm for the development of metal-based complexes in tumor immunotherapy.",

This study aimed to develop an interpretable and generalizable machine learning (ML) model for early prediction of mortality risk in cancer patients with delirium. A retrospective cohort study design was employed, utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Five ML models were subsequently constructed and evaluated. A total of 1893 cancer patients with delirium were included in the analysis, of whom 685 (36.2%) died within 28 days who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2022. The Category Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm outperformed other ML models, achieving the highest area under the curve (AUC) on both training and validation datasets. Its robustness was supported by a bias-corrected performance curve closely aligned with the ideal line and the greatest net benefit in decision curve analysis across all threshold probabilities (0-1). The top five predictors of 28-day mortality were high Glasgow Coma Scale and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, use of antibiotics, propofol, and vasopressors. This study developed an optimal and explainable ML model for predicting 28-day mortality in cancer patients with delirium. The CatBoost algorithm demonstrated stable and robust performance, and interpretability analysis highlighted key predictors.

Additionally, we sought to identify key factors influencing quality of life and propose targeted clinical interventions. This cross-sectional study involved 300 patients with breast cancer receiving AET in China from March 2023 to March 2024. Participants completed a survey that included a general information questionnaire, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) for assessing life quality in patients with breast cancer, the Chinese Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ), and the Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire (BMQ)-Specific. Multiple linear regression analysis was utilized to identify factors influencing the quality of life among these patients. Pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the relationships among quality of life, medication burden, and medication beliefs in this population. AMOS 29.0 was utilized for structural equation modeling (SEM) to assess the mediating effect of medication beliefs on the relationship between medication burden and quality of life. The mean FACT-B score among participants was 83.02 ​± ​19.08, the LMQ score was 109.93 ​± ​19.67, and the BMQ-Specific score was 1.41 ​± ​5.73. Quality of life demonstrated a negative correlation with medication burden (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.752, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01) and specific concerns (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.653, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01) while showing a positive correlation with medication beliefs (<i>r</i> ​= ​0.717, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01) and specific necessity (<i>r</i> ​= ​0.475, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01). Structural equation modeling revealed that medication burden and medication beliefs were directly predicted by quality of life, with respective effects of -0.567, 0.254, and -0.217, respectively (all <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01). Moreover, the medication burden was found to indirectly affect the quality of life through specific necessity (<i>β</i> ​= ​-0.078, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01), and it was also an indirect predictor of quality of life via the mediation of specific concerns (<i>β</i> ​= ​-0.152, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01). The quality of life in patients with breast cancer receiving AET is notably affected by medication burden and beliefs. Medication burden directly affects the quality of life and indirectly influences it through medication beliefs. Therefore, tailored interventions are crucial for patients with breast cancer undergoing AET who face high medication burden, reduced belief in medication necessity, or increased concerns about their medication.",

Risk factors for persistent overt bleeding post systemic therapy (POBPST) were explored. Among the 52 individuals included, 19 (36.5%) experienced active OB within one month prior to initiating anti-cancer therapy, while 33 (63.5%) did not. Hemostasis was achieved via endoscopic intervention in 2 patients and conservative medical management in 17. A total of 5 patients received immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, and 47 received chemotherapy-based systemic therapy, with 70.2% (33/47) requiring a 25% dose reduction. Among those with active OB, 73.7% (14/19) received intravenous therapy, with a median interval of 16 days (range: 3-25) from hemostasis to treatment initiation. The overall objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 42.3% and 90.4%, respectively.

Rac family small GTPase 3 (RAC3), a tumorigenic GTPase understudied in HCC, drives recurrence <i>via</i> E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1)-mediated transcriptional activation. This study integrates multiomics and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening to delineate RAC3's roles. RAC3 overexpression correlates with advanced HCC and patient age, while its knockout suppresses proliferation. Mechanistically, RAC3 dysregulates cell-cycle checkpoints through E2F1 binding. Pharmacological RAC3 inhibition disrupts tumor growth and synergizes with chemotherapy to overcome resistance. To explore RAC3's expression, clinical links, and HCC mechanisms <i>via</i> multiomics and functional genomics. Multiomic integration of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus, and Genotype-Tissue Expression datasets was performed to analyze RAC3 mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry quantified RAC3 protein in 108 HCC/adjacent tissue pairs. Kaplan-Meier/Cox regression assessed prognostic significance using TCGA data. CRISPR screening validated RAC3's necessity for HCC proliferation. Functional enrichment identified associated pathways; hTFtarget/JASPAR predicted transcription factors, validated <i>via</i> chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). RAC3 exhibited significant mRNA and protein overexpression in HCC tissues, which was correlated with advanced tumor stages and reduced overall survival rates (hazard ratio = 1.82, 95%CI: 1.31-2.53). Genetic ablation of RAC3 suppressed HCC cell proliferation across 16 cell lines. Pathway analysis revealed RAC3's predominant involvement in cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Mechanistic investigations identified E2F1 as a pivotal upstream transcriptional regulator, and ChIP-seq analysis validated its direct binding to the RAC3 promoter region. These findings suggest that RAC3 drives HCC progression through E2F1-mediated cell-cycle dysregulation. This study identified RAC3 as a key HCC oncogenic driver; its overexpression links to poor prognosis/resistance.

Notably, complex <b>2c</b> exhibited more potent cytotoxic activity than cisplatin in prostate cancer cell lines, with lower IC<sub>50</sub> values after 72 h exposure in DU-145 (7.1 µM vs. 8.2 µM) and PC-3 cells (8.6 µM vs. 21.9 µM), while showing reduced toxicity in normal MRC-5 cells (42.3 µM vs. 24.4 µM). Apoptosis was confirmed as the primary cytotoxic mechanism, involving the activation of Bcl-2 and caspases. Docking studies revealed that complex <b>2c</b> had the strongest binding affinity to AR and apoptotic proteins, mediated by hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. DNA and HSA binding supported their biological relevance. Complex <b>2c</b> exhibits potent anticancer activity through the induction of apoptosis and dual targeting of the AR and apoptotic pathways, making it a promising candidate for further development of anticancer drugs.",

We report two elderly patients with a history of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who presented with pancytopenia years after initial treatment. Bone marrow biopsy revealed HER2-low metastatic relapse. Treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) led to unexpectedly rapid and complete hematologic recovery after only two cycles, with both patients remaining stable and free of marrow disease for over two years. These cases demonstrate the remarkable efficacy and tolerability of T-DXd in this uncommon and challenging clinical scenario, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic option in HER2-low breast cancer with BMI.",

        "abstract": "Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) with neuroendocrine features is classified as a favorable subset, and treatment is recommended based on the grade of the neuroendocrine tumor (NET). Although rare, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can present as CUP with neuroendocrine features and should be carefully considered as a crucial differential diagnosis in such cases. A 65-year-old man with no relevant medical history presented with a gradually enlarging left cervical mass. Laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated multiple lymphadenopathies, hepatic masses, and bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities. A biopsy of a cervical lymph node revealed a neuroendocrine tumor grade 2 (NET G2), but the primary tumor was undetectable on imaging. Elevated serum calcitonin and thyroid ultrasound identified a small left thyroid nodule, fine-needle aspiration, and calcitonin immunostaining on the lesion pathologically revealed MTC. Given the rapidly progressive disease, vandetanib was initiated while awaiting molecular testing for rearranged during transfection (RET)-alteration. Following the detection of the RET M918T mutation, treatment was switched to selpercatinib, and rapid tumor response and endocrine symptom resolution were observed. This case highlights the importance of evaluating serum calcitonin, specifically in patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary, where MTC should be considered as a critical differential diagnosis. Thyroid ultrasound should be performed to identify even small lesions of medullary thyroid carcinoma (micro-MTC). Identification of MTC not only leads to targeted therapies that may improve prognosis, but also allows for genetic risk assessment and early intervention in family members when multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is suspected.",

        "abstract": "Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice. The differential diagnosis is vast and requires a methodical approach to determining the cause. Hypotonic hyponatremia is the commonest form and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a typical cause, especially in patients who have cancer. On the other hand, hyponatremia with elevated serum osmolality (hypertonic hyponatremia) is not common, and as such, clinicians are less familiar with this clinical scenario. Clinicians are even less familiar with the use of calculated osmolality and the osmolar gap in such scenarios. Therefore, it is easy to misdiagnose a patient with SIADH in the presence of cancer if a thorough biochemical analysis is not performed. We describe the case of a 56-year-old man who presented with episodes of dizziness and was demonstrated to have chronic hypertonic hyponatremia. Because of a previous diagnosis of mild SIADH several months prior, the presence of severe hyponatremia on a background of cancer, and relatively elevated urine osmolality, the elevated serum osmolality was not appreciated and the serum osmolar gap was not calculated. This resulted in a misdiagnosis of chronic SIADH. It was only after the osmolar gap was calculated and found to be significantly elevated that the markedly elevated serum ethanol level was discovered, and a diagnosis of alcohol-related hypertonic hyponatremia was made. On reassessment, the patient admitted to drinking large quantities of high alcohol-containing drinks for over the preceding three months. On gradual alcohol cessation, his blood results returned to normal. This case report highlights the importance of thorough assessment and the use of osmolar gap when navigating through the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis is a common gynecological condition that usually affects women during their reproductive years. The main goal of this narrative review is to understand the role of the innate and adaptive immune system in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and to explore ways to diagnose and treat endometriosis effectively. Methodology: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Scopus. Full-text articles in English published between January 2019 and January 2025 were included in this review. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts using preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as relevant keywords related to endometriosis, immune responses, and chronic pain. Of 6,728 initially identified studies, 53 met the inclusion criteria after applying exclusion parameters. Recent papers shed light on the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The dysregulation of immune system cells, such as macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells, contributes to the pathogenesis of endometriosis by enhancing the development and progression of endometriosis lesions, thereby creating an inflammatory environment. The presence of the inflammatory environment not only supports the survival and growth of the ectopic endometrial lesion but also plays a vital role in the pain associated with it. Endometriosis is a disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is believed that this ectopic endometrial tissue is a result of an interplay between hormonal, immune, and environmental factors. To this day, the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is through laparoscopic surgery, and there is no long-lasting effective medical treatment.",

This can eventually lead to hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure. To emphasize that colorectal carcinoma is an uncommon cause of bilateral obstructive uropathy, we present this case of post-renal acute kidney injury to draw attention to and familiarize clinicians with its uncommon presentation. An 81-year-old male patient with a past medical history of recurrent colorectal cancer presented with fatigue and low urine output for two days in the emergency department. His examination was unremarkable. His blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, and AKI (warning stage 3). A computed tomography (CT) scan showed new bilateral renal pelvicalyceal dilatation and ureteric obstruction. He was admitted to the intensive treatment unit (ITU) with a diagnosis of AKI secondary to bilateral ureteric obstruction due to relapse of his colorectal cancer.

        "title": "Metabolic Risk Factors at the Time of Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Background Cancer is a growing public health burden and a leading cause of death and disability globally. An estimated 30-50% of cancer deaths are preventable through the modification of behavioral and metabolic risk factors. Primary care offers an essential platform for population-level cancer prevention and early detection, especially by leveraging existing screening and chronic disease monitoring infrastructure. This study, conducted in a single primary care clinic in Poland, evaluates metabolic markers routinely collected in this setting to assess their potential role in identifying cancer risk. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study analyzing 347 adult patients diagnosed with cancer (ICD-10 codes: C00-C14, C15-C26, C30-C39, C43-C44, C50, C51-C58, C60-C63, C64-C68, C69-C72, C73-C75, C76-C80, C81-C96, D00-D48) between 2017 and 2022 in a single primary care clinic in Poland. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and body mass index (BMI) were selected because they are routinely measured in primary care settings and frequently associated with metabolic risk and cancer development. These parameters were analyzed in relation to cancer type using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analyses. Results Elevated fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL) was significantly associated with cancer type (p = 0.0238). This abnormality was observed in 83.6% (N = 290) of all patients. Although BMI, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were not significantly associated with cancer type, metabolic abnormalities were highly prevalent in the entire sample. A total of 89.1% (N = 309) of patients were overweight or obese, and nearly one-third (N = 110) presented with all four metabolic abnormalities concurrently. Only 2.3% (N = 8) of the patients had none of the measured metabolic risk factors. The vast majority, 97.7% (N = 339), had at least one metabolic abnormality. Given the high prevalence of metabolic disturbances, the possibility of selection bias should be considered, as individuals visiting primary care may be more likely to have pre-existing chronic conditions or risk factors under surveillance. Conclusions Routine, low-cost metabolic tests performed in primary care may offer useful insights into cancer risk patterns and could inform opportunistic risk stratification efforts. However, given the cross-sectional design of this study, the findings do not support causal inference. Integrating routinely collected metabolic data into public health frameworks may enhance early detection strategies and support timely diagnostic referrals. These results highlight the potential for scalable, population-based interventions within primary care to contribute to reducing the cancer burden, morbidity, and disability-adjusted life years.",

        "abstract": "Albumin encapsulation is a powerful strategy for drug delivery, yet its potential has not been fully explored for photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents. Cl-containing near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dyes are intrinsically PDT agents and tend to covalently bind with albumin; however, their PDT efficiency in tumors is largely compromised due to limited accumulation of the complex (size less than 10 nm) to the tumor site. To maximize their PDT effect while retaining sufficient NIR brightness for imaging-guided PDT, we developed a DTT-promoted encapsulation strategy to enhance singlet oxygen release for Cl-containing dyes. By disrupting disulfide bonds in albumin, the protein shell is loosened, increasing size while maintaining singlet oxygen release, partial brightness, and photostability. In vivo experiments reveal the rapid tumor accumulation of IR-6B3@DTT-HSA, enabling flexible treatment timing. This strategy enhances targeted delivery and PDT efficacy, paving the way for broader applications in cancer therapy.",

For this purpose, the present study enrolled 68 patients, divided equally into two study arms. The patients were followed-up for 24 weeks post-intervention. The primary endpoint was the efficacy of RT in inducing OA, assessed through amenorrhea and hormone levels [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol]. Toxicities were evaluated using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, and post-menopausal symptoms were assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale. The results revealed that there was no significant difference between the two study arms (A vs. B) in the rate of amenorrhea development and persistence (85.7 vs. 89.5%), and in the achievement of postmenopausal estradiol (91.2 vs. 94.1%) and FSH levels (79.4 vs. 88.2%). Both regimens led to a significant reduction in estradiol levels and an increase in FSH levels compared to baseline levels. No grade ≥3 toxicity was observed. Common postmenopausal symptoms included hot flushes and irritability, with no significant differences between the groups. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that both RT regimens are effective and safe for OA in patients with metastatic breast cancer, with no significant differences in efficacy or toxicity. The findings are particularly relevant in resource-limited settings, underscoring the potential for flexible and shorter treatment regimens in such environment.",

        "abstract": "Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive disease typically treated with radical cystectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However, the presence of hydronephrosis - a significant marker of advanced disease - can impair renal function, potentially precluding patients from receiving cisplatin-based NAC. The present study aimed to assess the role of urinary diversion in patients with MIBC, specifically in reversing renal function impairment and enabling eligibility for cisplatin-based therapy. A retrospective study was performed by evaluating a database of patients treated for urothelial MIBC from 2018 to 2021. Case notes were reviewed to identify patients with hydronephrosis who underwent urinary diversion. The types of urinary diversion recorded included percutaneous nephrostomy, ureteral stenting, or surgical obstruction release. Renal function was assessed retrospectively using the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated from creatinine clearance. Records of a total of 72 patients were evaluated. The mean GFR before urinary diversion was 44.1 ± 26.4 mL/min, which improved to 59.1 ± 31.9 mL/min post-diversion, resulting in a mean GFR improvement of 15.0 ± 20.0 mL/min. Forty-four patients had an initial GFR below 50 mL/min, with 75% of them achieving a GFR >50 mL/min after urinary diversion. More than half of these patients (<i>n</i> = 25, 56%) experienced an improvement to a GFR exceeding 60 mL/min. The time to reach the best GFR varied widely (mean: 59 ± 33 days, range 9 - 165 days). Logistic regression analysis identified initial GFR as a significant predictor of GFR recovery (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.02 - 1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.012). Urinary diversion can benefit patients with upper tract obstruction secondary to MIBC by improving renal function, thereby enabling eligibility for cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Unfortunately, approximately 5 - 10% of treated patients suffer from long-term complications, such as radiation cystitis. While radiation cystitis initially causes urinary symptoms, it can progress to chronic late effects over time. This treatment may have significant physical and psychological implications for cancer survivors. This prospective, observational multicenter study was conducted in Denmark from 2020 to 2023. Male patients undergoing radiation treatment for BC were included and stratified into two groups based on radiation strategy: 64 Gy/32 fractions versus 36 Gy/6 fractions. Patients completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires assessing lower urinary tract symptoms and quality of life (QoL). A total of 26 patients were enrolled into the study, with three patients withdrawing consent. Eleven patients were assigned to the 64 Gy/32 fraction group and 12 to the 36 Gy/6 fraction group. At baseline, patients receiving 64 Gy/32 fraction reported a lower impact on QoL, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) score of 2 (24) compared to 20 (27) in the 36 Gy/6 fraction group. At the 4-month follow-up, the median (IQR) total QoL score was 25 (27) in the 64 Gy 32 fraction group and 6 (14) in the 36 Gy/6 fraction group. At 12 months, the scores were 16 (35) and 3 (3), respectively. These findings suggest that the total radiation dose has a greater impact on urinary symptoms and QoL than the fractionation strategy.

Monitoring these data is vital for informed decision-making. The objective of the study was to understand the trends in surgical procedures for BC within the Brazilian public health system. Data were collected from the Brazilian Data Center for the Public Health System, focusing on hospital admissions related to bladder surgeries from 2013 to 2023. Information was categorized in terms of procedure urgency, hospitalization duration, costs, and mortality rates. A total of 123,434 BC-related surgical procedures were performed, the majority of which were elective (73.4%) and bladder-preserving (BP, 96.2%). There were 1,710 reported mortalities, with a consistent procedure-specific mortality rate (PSMR) across the 11-year period for all procedures. The average hospitalization duration for elective BP (β = -0.12, <i>p</i> < 0.001), elective non-BP (β = -0.46, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and urgent non-BP procedures (β = -0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.012) steadily decreased. Elective and urgent BPs showed the lowest annual PSMRs (0.66% and 4.25%, respectively), compared to elective and urgent non-BPs (6.93% and 10.72%). The northern and northeastern regions reported significantly fewer cases but higher mortality rates after 2018, despite reduced average hospital stays. While hospital costs for these procedures increased, the standalone costs of surgical interventions remained stable over the 11-year period.

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer poses a significant threat to human health. In recent years, genetic circuit therapy has emerged as a novel alternative for precision tumor treatment, demonstrating promising potential for clinical application. Compared to traditional drugs, genetic circuits - typically carried by plasmids - offer advantages such as modularity, druggability, and shorter drug development cycles. These circuits can identify multiple molecular signals from tumors and integrate them through logic gates to specifically target tumor cells. Furthermore, by assembling effector modules, they can induce specific forms of cell death in tumor cells or alter malignant phenotypes, thereby reshaping the immune microenvironment to produce efficient, durable, and controllable antitumor effects. The urinary system serves as an ideal model for this new therapy due to its accessibility from the outside. Several genetic circuits have already been validated for the treatment of bladder cancer. This review outlined the effectiveness and potential value of genetic circuits in bladder cancer therapy. This review focused on the design principles of genetic circuits, their ability to recognize and convert signals, their therapeutic signal output, and the associated delivery vehicles. We also discussed the challenges and future prospects of genetic circuits as a novel form of \"intelligent biotherapy.\" The gene circuit can identify multiple signals, processing complex information, and generating multiple effects, thus providing a new approach for personalized treatment of tumors.",

Traditional treatments like excision, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy often fail due to their invasiveness, toxicity, and poor drug delivery efficiency caused by skin barriers. Microneedles (MNs) offer a minimally invasive alternative, directly penetrating the skin to deliver drugs to tumor sites while minimizing side effects. However, their penetration depth is limited, and they do not address metastatic lesions. This study developed a gas motor-driven multi-responsive microneedle patch that significantly enhances subcutaneous drug penetration through a gas propulsion mechanism, greatly expanding the drug's diffusion range. Combined with photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy, this approach rapidly kills melanoma cells locally, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD), and uses anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD-1) targeting immune checkpoints to enhance efficacy, overcome tumor immune escape, and activate systemic immune responses, achieving remote tumor suppression through local treatment only.",

The present study presents a lipid metabolism-based risk model for PCa and explores the role of succinyl-CoA ligase GDP-forming subunit beta (SUCLG2), a potential marker and therapeutic target in PCa involved in lipid metabolism and cancer progression, from the perspective of developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. High-throughput RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing were used to investigate the expression and functional relevance of SUCLG2 in PCa. We analyzed 497 PCa samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, including univariate Cox proportional hazards regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and gene set enrichment analysis. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence assays were performed to validate SUCLG2 expression in clinical samples and the prostate carcinoma epithelial cell line 22Rv1. Our findings revealed that lipid metabolism-related genes, including SUCLG2, have significant prognostic value, based on a 16-gene risk model constructed that accurately predicted PCa prognosis. In particular, SUCLG2 was significantly enriched in luminal and basal/intermediate cell subsets, highlighting its potential role in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that SUCLG2 expression is correlated with the efficacy of several chemotherapeutic agents, based on which strategies for personalized therapy in PCa treatment could be devised. SUCLG2 plays a pivotal role in the metabolic reprogramming of PCa, thus offering new insights into its progression and potential therapeutic targets. Our study underscores the importance of metabolic pathways in PCa pathogenesis and paves the way for the development of targeted therapies, thus contributing to personalized medicine in PCa management.",

        "abstract": "Solitary adrenal metastasis from a primary esophageal malignancy is relatively rare. While there are case reports of aggressive treatment with esophagectomy and adrenalectomy providing long-term survival, the treatment paradigm is not well defined. Complications from esophageal adenocarcinoma and its treatment can significantly impact the patient's quality of life and prognosis. Our patient was treated with systemic therapy and, although he initially had a complete response, he later experienced local disease progression along with the development of additional metastatic sites. The patient began FOLFOX, a standard chemotherapy regimen for esophageal/gastric cancer. He experienced side effects such as fever, malaise, and constipation, which were symptomatically managed. Given these side effects, the patient's FOLFOX regimen underwent a 25% dose reduction of the 5FU bolus. A PET/CT scan after three months showed a marked response to chemotherapy, with complete resolution of detectable disease. The patient reported fatigue, bone pain managed with Neulasta, nausea controlled with antiemetics, and neuropathy in his feet. The patient then began a new chemotherapy regimen with Taxol/Ramucirumab with dose modifications in response to side effects. Continued adjustments to the treatment and dosages were made for progressive side effects and the patient elected to receive palliative radiation to the esophagus, along with holistic supportive care. The treatment plan shifted to palliative care, focusing on quality of life, rather than curative, due to the complexities of his cancer. While aggressive treatments may offer hope for a cure in select patients with isolated adrenal metastasis from esophageal cancer, the general approach should remain cautious, with systemic therapy as the first line of defense. This case highlights the need for careful selection to identify patients who may benefit from aggressive surgical treatment. Ongoing research and clinical trials are needed to better define treatment protocols and improve outcomes for this challenging patient group.",

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a powerful approach for treating cancers through light-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; however, its efficacy is often constrained by limitations in photosensitivity, ROS yield, and tumor microenvironment adaptation. Addressing these challenges requires highly engineered photosensitizers capable of enhanced light absorption, stable catalytic performance, and selective redox modulation. Herein, we introduce a structurally and functionally single-molecule enzyme-like photocatalyst (superphane <b>1</b>), a supramolecular photosensitizer based singzyme designed through a \"super cage effect\" or \"superphane effect\" that promotes enhanced photosensitivity, superior ROS generation, photocatalytic oxidation and multi-enzyme mimetic activities. Its unique structure, featuring precisely and densely arranged phenothiazine units, maximizes light absorption and optimizes electron transfer dynamics, resulting in an excellent singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) yield of 70% under 450 nm irradiation, significantly surpassing the yields of 42% for cage <b>2</b>, 39% for macrocycle <b>3</b>, and 24% for monomer <b>4</b>. Functionally, singzyme <b>1</b> exhibits excellent catalytic efficiency to NADH (<i>K</i> <sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> = 2.43 × 10<sup>4</sup> L mol<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) and catalyzes oxidation of NADH and GSH, mimicking NADH oxidase and GSH oxidase activity. This selectively depletes NADH and GSH, inducing an intracellular \"oxygen burst\" effect. This redox imbalance inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), reduces ATP production, and promotes apoptosis and ferroptosis pathways. With stable activity across acidic and neutral pH environments typical of tumors, singzyme <b>1</b> provides a versatile, biocompatible platform for precision cancer therapy. This study establishes a superphane-based singzyme with precise structure and multi-enzyme mimetic functionality, paving the way for single-molecule enzyme mimicry.",

Here, we report a programmable DNA origami delivery platformthe DNA Soccer Framework (DSF)cofunctionalized with fluorocarbon chains and sgc8 aptamers to enhance cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape for effective siRNA delivery. Fluorocarbon moieties of tunable lengths and densities were grafted onto DSF to facilitate lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, which favors cytosolic entry by bypassing lysosomal degradation. Concurrently, aptamer comodification enabled selective targeting of cancer cells. Systematic optimization revealed that a surface modification ratio of 3:1 (fluorocarbon to aptamer) among the 90 available sites yielded synergistic improvements in internalization and cytosolic release, significantly enhancing siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Upon loading with siRNA targeting Bcl2L12, the optimized DSF variant induced highest apoptosis in two cancer cell lines, while maintaining minimal cytotoxicity.

Anthraquinone-fused enediyne (AFE) natural products, such as tiancimycins (TNMs), are emerging payload candidates with exceptional potency and a validated DNA-damaging mechanism of action. In this study, we describe the translation of semisynthetically functionalized TNMs, incorporating various linker chemistries, into ADCs featuring dual variable domain monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibodies (DVD IgG1s). DVD IgG1s enable site-specific conjugation and modular antigen-targeting specificity. As a proof-of-principle, keto-TNM A-anti-CD79b DVD IgG1-based ADCs were constructed on the basis of the significance of CD79b as a clinical target, with only one FDA-approved ADC available. Inspired by the structure-activity relationship data, a chemical strategy to synthesize keto-TNM A was developed, which exhibited the highest potency among the TNMs we have examined to date. Keto-TNM A was elaborated to a panel of anti-CD79b DVD IgG1-based ADCs featuring varying linker chemistries. The optimized ADC exhibited potent and selective activity across multiple CD79b-expressing cell lines and, most significantly, patient-derived primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. This study provides an efficient approach to access functionalized AFEs at scale and speed and exploit their utility as payloads for ADCs targeting CD79b and beyond as the next generation immunotherapies.",

Sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains suggested epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity as major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes, we comprehensively mapped CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins using samples from convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by emerging mutations. Conservation analysis across human coronaviruses and <i>in silico</i> alanine scanning highlighted the functional importance of mutationally constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that may enhance immune surveillance against emerging variants and inform next-generation vaccine designs providing broader and more durable protection.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and its impact on postoperative survival in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent conversion therapy. The therapeutic regimen consisted of interventional procedures (hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy [HAIC] and/or transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). A retrospective analysis was performed at a single institution involving 91 patients <i>who had</i> initially unresectable HCC linked to the hepatitis B virus. These patients achieved resectability following conversion therapy and subsequently underwent surgical tumor removal. Logistic regression identified risk factors for HBV reactivation (HBVr). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests assessed survival differences. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In our cohort, HBVr occurred in 17 patients (18.7%), all of whom received antiviral therapy. The incidence of HBVr was 16.7% (14/84) in patients with detectable baseline HBV DNA and 42.9% (3/7) in those with undetectable levels. Baseline HBV DNA ≥2000 IU/ml was identified as an independent protective factor against HBVr (OR 0.090, 95% CI 0.015-0.532; P = 0.008). The median PFS was significantly shorter in the reactivation group than in the non-reactivation group (12.1 months [95% CI 5.5-18.7] <i>vs</i>. 29.2 months [95% CI 23.6-34.7]; P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in median OS between the two groups (not reached <i>vs</i>. 45.6 months [95% CI 41.7-49.5]; P = 0.117). HBVr represents a potential complication in subjects receiving hepatectomy for hepatitis B virus associated HCC following conversion therapy involving interventional therapies combined with TKIs and ICIs. Patients experiencing HBVr exhibited significantly shorter progression-free survival compared to those without reactivation. Therefore, prophylactic antiviral therapy and meticulous HBV DNA monitoring are warranted during both conversion therapy and the perioperative period.",

However, they negatively impact the efficacy of immunotherapy. We collected data from 62 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases who received immunotherapy combined with intracranial radiotherapy within 28 days of each other. The overall doses of GCs for each patient were expressed as the cumulative total dose of dexamethasone equivalents during the baseline period of immunotherapy. These patients were categorized based on their baseline GCs usage (28 days before and after the first immunotherapy) into three groups: low GCs use (< 30 mg), medium GCs use (30-100 mg), and high GCs use (≥ 100 mg). Among the three groups of included patients in our study, the median intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS) was significantly shorter in the high GCs use group compared to the medium and low GCs use groups (5.23 months vs. 12.70 months vs. 16.43 months, <i>P</i> < .001). No significant difference in median iPFS was observed between the medium and low GCs use groups.

No significant differences in intracranial objective response rate (iORR) and objective response rate (ORR) were found among the three groups. Standard propensity score matching (PSM) confirmed that the high GCs use group (≥ 100 mg) still had significantly shorter median iPFS, PFS, and OS compared to the other groups.

Moreover, having therapies targeting these different B-ALL antigens has helped address challenges associated with both intra- and inter-patient variability in targeted antigen expression levels and antigen loss as mechanisms of therapy resistances. To further expand the range of targetable antigens in B-ALL therapy, we developed a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets the VpreB1 (CD179a) component of the surrogate light chain. VpreB1 is expressed across most B-ALL molecular subtypes but otherwise has expression limited to precursor B cells, but not mature B cells. Our VpreB1 antibody demonstrated high affinity for its target protein and when conjugated to the toxin calicheamicin (VpreB1-ADC) exhibited significant in vitro toxicity against B-ALL cells harboring a range of genomic alterations. In vivo, the VpreB1-ADC was well tolerated in mice, with modest weight loss and decreased white blood cell counts. When tested against a B-ALL cell line and multiple B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models, the VpreB1-ADC significantly reduced leukemia burden, prolonged survival, and cured a subset of mice. These promising results support further investigation of the VpreB1 component of the surrogate light chain as a therapeutic target, including the VpreB1-ADC in preclinical and clinical trials, with the goal of expanding the arsenal of immunoconjugates available for the treatment of B-ALL.",

A 64-year-old man presented with vague epigastric pain, weight loss, and iron deficiency anemia. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple splenic lesions suggestive of hydatid cysts. Hydatid serology was negative. Chest CT was unremarkable. Abdominal and pelvic CT showed splenomegaly with cystic lesions, including a calcified cyst in segment VI of the liver. Numerous hypodense peritoneal nodules were identified, particularly in the mid-omentum and supraumbilical region. Differential diagnoses included hydatid disease, primary peritoneal neoplasms, and peritoneal metastases. Due to anemia, weight loss, and the suspicion of peritoneal carcinomatosis, hydatid disease alone could not fully account for the findings, prompting further diagnostic evaluation. Endoscopy and colonoscopy were unremarkable. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy, along with partial omentectomy where hydatid involvement was suspected. Postoperatively, he was treated with albendazole 800 mg daily and discharged on postoperative day three. At 3- and 6-month follow-ups, the patient reported resolution of abdominal pain, and physical examinations were normal.

        "abstract": "Our study was mainly aimed at identifying the cause, clinical course of the disease, its most dreaded complication pseudomyxoma peritonei and spread to adjacent structures. We have used IHC techniques to know the origin of the tumor where both appendix and ovary were involved. We have listed out and discussed in detail 5 cases, each of which have a different clinical course and variation in staging, grading and prognosis. One of the cases had mucin deposit in the ovary for which IHC was done to confirm the origin of the tumor. Some of the findings were incidental and in others presence of mucin content in the appendix lumen raised clinical suspicion of spread to peritoneum and adjacent structures. Grading and staging is of prime importance as it determines the prognosis and management of the patient respectively. A ruptured or perforated appendix must warrant for an immediate suspicion of pseudomyxoma peritonei which when untreated can lead to mucinous neoplasms in adjacent organs like ovary and colon. Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP) with simultaneous appendix and ovarian neoplasm should be treated as primary appendiceal tumour. Grading and staging of mucinous neoplasm of appendix and Pseudomyxoma Peritoneii needs a unified approach for standardized diagnostic reporting.",

        "abstract": "Cancer remains a major global health burden, with rising incidence and mortality linked to aging populations and increased exposure to genotoxic agents. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in cancer development, progression, and resistance to therapy. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway is central to maintaining redox balance by regulating the expression of antioxidant and detoxification genes. Under physiological conditions, this pathway protects cells from oxidative damage, however, sustained activation of NRF2 in cancer, often due to mutations in KEAP1, supports tumor cell survival, drug resistance, and metabolic reprogramming. Recent studies demonstrate that NRF2 enhances glutathione (GSH) synthesis, induces detoxifying enzymes, and upregulates drug efflux transporters, collectively contributing to resistance against chemotherapy and targeted therapies. The inhibition of NRF2 using small molecules or dietary phytochemicals has shown promise in restoring drug sensitivity in preclinical cancer models. This review highlights the dual role of NRF2 in redox regulation and cancer therapy, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target. While targeting NRF2 offers a novel approach to overcoming treatment resistance, further research is needed to enhance specificity and facilitate clinical translation.",

Despite its significant clinical impact, this entity lacks standardized diagnostic criteria in current WHO classifications. We performed a retrospective analysis of 55 PBM-DLBCL cases from our institutional database and published literature (2001-2022) to characterize disease features and identify prognostic factors, with particular focus on assessing how different treatment regimens influence therapeutic efficacy and long-term outcomes. The data suggested a potential link between international prognostic index (IPI) scores and poorer survival, albeit without conclusive statistical evidence (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Treatment response emerged as a significant prognostic factor, and patients with complete response (CR) demonstrating superior survival in Cox univariate and multivariate analysis (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Intensive therapeutic regimens were associated with improved clinical outcomes compared to conventional therapies. While incorporating rituximab into conventional chemotherapy regimens has demonstrated superior clinical outcomes compared to chemotherapy alone in PBM-DLBCL patients.

        "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) have a very poor prognosis. Intrathecal pemetrexed (IP) has shown moderate efficacy in treating patients with NSCLC-LM. Myelosuppression is the most common adverse effect following IP administration. Despite this trend, the specific risk factors contributing to IP-related myelosuppression remain unclear. This study conducted a retrospective analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with LM who received IP treatment at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from April 2017 to April 2024. Risk factors for myelosuppression were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Non-linear relationships and determined the inflection points were subsequently determined using smooth curve fitting and threshold effect analysis. A total of 95 patients were identified, among whom 64 (68.42%) experienced myelosuppression, with 43 (45.26%) cases classified as severe myelosuppression. Leukopenia emerged as the most prevalent form of myelosuppression. Age was established as an independent risk factor for both myelosuppression and its severe form. A nonlinear relationship between age and severe myelosuppression was observed. The risk of developing severe myelosuppression increased significantly with age, beyond the turning point of 58 years old (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.52; <i>p</i> = 0.0042). Advanced age is associated with the occurrence of myelosuppression and severe myelosuppression. The probability of developing severe myelosuppression increases significantly in individuals aged 58 years or older.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a representative malignancy of the female reproductive system, with a poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) crucially affect tumor development. This study aimed to identify lncRNAs that potentially participated in OC. LncRNA expression in cells and tissues was quantified using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, while fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization determined their cellular localization. Various <i>in vitro</i> assays, together with a mouse xenograft model, were employed to elucidate the function of CYMP antisense RNA 1 (CYMP-AS1) in OC. The molecular mechanisms underlying CYMP-AS1 regulation were investigated through RNA pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, immunofluorescence staining, western blotting, and mRNA stability assays. This study identified a previously unreported lncRNA, CYMP-AS1, which exhibits increased expression in the cytoplasm of OC tissues and cells. Knockout of CYMP-AS1 reduced the OC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CYMP-AS1 directly interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM), inducing its intracellular translocation and reducing the stability of Axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2) mRNA. This process ultimately elevated the expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins. This study confirms CYMP-AS1 as a novel biomarker in OC progression and suggests that the CYMP-AS1/hnRNPM/AXIN2 axis may offer an innovative strategy for OC treatment.",

This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of nigericin, a polyether ionophore derived from <i>Streptomyces</i> DASNCL-29, as a mitochondrial-targeted agent for AML treatment. Nigericin was isolated from <i>Streptomyces</i> DASNCL-29 and characterized via chromatography and NMR. Its cytotoxicity was tested in MOLM13 (sensitive and venetoclax-resistant) and HL60 (sensitive and cytarabine-resistant) cells using the MTT assay. Mitochondrial dysfunction was assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and mitochondrial mass. Apoptosis was evaluated with Annexin V/PI assays and immunoblotting, while proteomic analysis was conducted using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify differentially regulated proteins. Nigericin demonstrated potent cytotoxicity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 57.02 nM in MOLM13-sensitive, 35.29 nM in MOLM13-resistant, 20.49 nM in HL60-sensitive, and 1.197 nM in HL60-cytarabine-resistant cells. Apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V/PI staining and caspase-3/PARP cleavage, along with MCL-1 downregulation. Mitochondrial dysfunction was evident from increased ROS, reduced Δψm, and decreased mitochondrial mass. Proteomic profiling identified 264 dysregulated proteins, including a 3.8-fold upregulation of Succinate Dehydrogenase [Ubiquinone] Flavoprotein Subunit A (SDHA). Nigericin induces apoptosis in AML cells by disrupting mitochondrial function and enhancing oxidative stress.

        "abstract": "VPS37A (VPS37A subunit of ESCRT-I), a component of the ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for transport I) complex, mediates vesicular trafficking through sorting endocytic ubiquitinated cargos into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Although accumulating evidence indicates that VPS37A deficiency occurs in numerous malignancies and exerts tumor-suppressive effects during cancer progression, its functional significance in colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. Therefore, this study aims to further investigate the functional and molecular mechanisms by which VPS37A downregulation contributes to malignant biological phenotypes in CRC, with a specific focus on how its dysregulation affects cell death pathways. Multi-omics analysis of TCGA, GEO, and CPTAC cohorts identified VPS37A as a downregulated tumor suppressor gene in CRC. The prognostic relevance of VPS37A was validated in two clinical cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2) using immunohistochemistry. Functional assays in VPS37A-overexpressing CRC cells and xenografts assessed proliferation, cell cycle progression, and stress-induced cell death. RNA sequencing, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) luciferase reporter assays, and lysosomal inhibition experiments elucidated the mechanisms underlying tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) degradation. VPS37A is significantly downregulated in advanced-stage CRC and independently predicts poor survival. Functionally, VPS37A overexpression suppresses proliferation and induces G2/M arrest <i>in vitro</i>, while reducing xenograft growth. Under metabolic stress (glucose deprivation/galactose adaptation), VPS37A triggers cell death via apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. Mechanistically, VPS37A redirects TNFR1 to lysosomal degradation, suppressing NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. VPS37A deficiency drives CRC progression by sustaining TNFR1/NF-κB signaling under metabolic stress. Restoring VPS37A activity promotes TNFR1 degradation, offering a therapeutic strategy to counteract NF-κB-mediated treatment resistance in CRC.",

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, and immunocytochemistry (ICC) were performed to examine the level of ABCB5 in OSCC (CAL27 and HSC-3) and human oral keratinocyte (HOK). ABCB5 was knocked down in CAL27 cells using ABCB5-specific small interfering RNA (ABCB5 siRNA), and its contribution to migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells lose their tight junction and acquire an increased migratory and invasive phenotype resembling that of mesenchymal cells, were evaluated by three-dimension and transwell migration and invasion assays, qRT-PCR and ICC.

The dysfunction of the Golgi apparatus (GA) contributes to the development of various cancers. This study aimed to utilize GA-related genes (GARGs) to forecast the prognosis and immune profile of TNBC. <b>Methods:</b> The data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, including 175 TNBC and 99 healthy samples. The differentially expressed GARGs (DEGARGs) were analyzed using the TCGA biolinks package. The patients with TNBC were classified into two clusters utilizing the ConsensusClusterPlus package according to prognosis-related DEGARGs, followed by comparing the differences in prognosis and immune infiltration between the two clusters. Next, LASSO and stepwise Cox regression were applied to establish a GARGs signature to forecast the TNBC prognosis. The association of the GARGs signature with immune infiltrates and drug sensitivity was further explored. <b>Results:</b> In total, 430 DEGARGs were identified between TNBC and healthy samples, among which 20 were related to TNBC prognosis. Two GARG-related molecular clusters associated with different survival times and immune heterogeneity were identified. A risk model for TNBC was established based on six GARGs, and the high-risk (HR) group exhibited a poor prognosis. The HR group demonstrated a distinctly high M2 macrophage infiltration and low M1 macrophage infiltration, which contributed to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and thus led to poor prognosis of the HR group. Immune dysfunction scores and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression were substantially elevated in the HR group. The HR group showed increased sensitivity to anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that GARGs are involved in the pathogenesis of TNBC and provide new insights into prognostic prediction. The identified clusters and GARGs signatures have the potential to guide individualized therapy.",

Although the tumor microenvironment (TME) and epigenetic modifiers are recognized to play a pivotal role in aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in OSCC, the available evidence is fragmentary and a comprehensive analysis is warranted. This review evaluates the intricate mechanisms by which various components of the TME facilitate proliferation, apoptosis evasion, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, metastasis, as well as therapy resistance in OSCC through activation of PI3K/AKT signalling. The review has also analysed how epigenetic modifiers such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs that have emerged as key players in orchestrating OSCC development and progression influence the PI3K/AKT pathway. Preclinical studies and clinical trials on the efficacy of PI3K/AKT inhibitors as viable options for OSCC treatment are discussed. Overall, this review supports the tenet that the PI3K/AKT pathway, which functions as a central hub through crosstalk with several oncogenic signaling pathways and overarching impact on all the hallmark traits of cancer, offers immense potential as a biomarker and oncotherapeutic target for OSCC.",

        "abstract": "Precision medicine is an emerging approach for treating pediatric cancer due to its ability to target tumor-specific genetic drivers rather than provide broad and aggressive treatments. The study aimed to outline the establishment and impact of a Precision Medicine Clinic (PMC) in the setting of pediatric oncology, with the objective of offering targeted treatment options within the institution and creating a scalable model for adoption by other healthcare systems to achieve a wider impact. Recognizing this need for an individualized approach to treating patients, Cook Children's Medical Center (CCMC) established a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board in 2019, followed by the launch of an official PMC in 2021. Before this, there was no dedicated place to discuss and evaluate genetic sequencing results. In 2022 and 2023, the PMC discussed 69 patients with a wide variety of oncologic diagnoses. Through the clinic's efforts, 133 genetic variants across 101 genes have been identified, spanning oncogenic pathways related to cell cycling, DNA processing, and cell signaling. Of the sequenced patients, four have received targeted therapy according to recommendations from the PMC. While the PMC continues to evaluate patients and their long-term outcomes, the continually growing PMC at CCMC represents the beginning of the advancement of treating pediatric oncology patients through the interpretation of genetic sequencing results, making actionable targeted treatment recommendations, and continuing to follow the patient's course of care over time. This additionally provides a framework for starting a PMC that can be adapted for specific clinical needs and implemented broadly.",

In the present work, we aimed to describe the effects on migration, proliferation, and metabolism in the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia-derived cell line Jurkat. Based on previous evidence, we analyzed metabolic changes exerted by GDF11 and its relationship with the aggressive phenotype. We found a profound impact on mitochondrial metabolism and reactive oxygen species content; these were related to a decrement in the expression of the transcription factor forkhead-box-protein P3 (FOXP3), which is highly involved in aggressiveness in leukemia cells; this was verified by a decrement in invasion capacity exhibited by the Jurkat cells under the GDF11 treatment. The results position the GDF11 response as a good alternative in the search for new therapeutic options for these diseases.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers all over the world. The progression of CRC is associated with inflammation and disruptions in intestinal flora. 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) has been noted for its potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of AKBA on colon cancer caused by inflammation and its mechanism are not unclear. The study is to explore the effect of AKBA on CRC and its mechanism. Cell proliferation, (5-ethynyl-2<sup>'</sup>-deoxyuridine, EdU)-DNA synthesis assay and colony formation were used to assess the effect of AKBA on the proliferation of CRC cells. Flow cytometry was employed to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis rate of cells treated with AKBA. RNA sequencing was done to explore the underlying mechanisms of AKBA. Western blot was used to assess the expression of key proteins in the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway after the treatment of AKBA. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays were employed to check the anti-inflammation effects of AKBA on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells and LPS-induced mouse model. Additionally, the Azoxymethane/Dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS)-induced colitis-associated CRC model was used to evaluate the anti-CRC effect of AKBA. Gut microbiota profiling of fecal samples from CRC mice, both with and without AKBA treatment, was conducted through metagenomic sequencing analysis. Our results showed that AKBA reduced the proliferation of HCT116 and SW620 cells, increased apoptosis of cells, and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Results from RNA-seq showed that AKBA inhibited CRC by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway and reducing cellular inflammation. Furthermore, AKBA reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), Interleukin-IL-12p70 (IL-12p70), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in both the spleen and serum of LPS-induced acute inflammation mice. Additionally, AKBA inhibited the development of AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colon cancer in mice and positively influenced gut microbiota. This study highlights the inhibitory effect of AKBA on colitis-associated CRC and reveals a novel aspect of its role in the remodeling of gut microbiota. These findings suggest that AKBA may be used as a potential therapeutic agent for CRC.",

        "abstract": "Standard of care (SOC) treatments for International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) good prognosis stage II germ cell tumours (GCT) involve primary orchidectomy followed by combination chemotherapy for both seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT). Alternatively, external beam radiotherapy may be used for seminoma and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) for NSGCT. While these treatments achieve high cure rates, they are associated with significant toxicities. De-escalation strategies including three cycles of Carboplatin AUC10 or robotic RPLND with or without adjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated potential to reduce treatment-related toxicity in stage II seminoma while preserving oncological efficacy. However, these approaches are not widely adopted due to limited prospective comparative trials. The THERATEST trial is a prospective multicentre observational feasibility study evaluating participants receiving SOC treatments for good prognosis stage II seminoma and NSGCT or de-escalated treatments for stage II seminoma. The primary endpoints are to assess feasibility of recruitment and retention. Secondary endpoints include assessing health-related quality of life (HRQOL), sexual function and satisfaction, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety and treatment-related complications. Thirty participants with good prognosis stage II seminoma or NSGCTs will be recruited over 18 months into two cohorts: de-escalation arm and SOC arm. The de-escalation cohort will receive either Carboplatin AUC10 or robotic RPLND with or without adjuvant therapy depending on institutional SOC. Participants who decline or are ineligible for de-escalation will receive SOC treatment: combination chemotherapy or radiotherapy for seminoma and combination chemotherapy for NSGCT. All participants will be followed for two years post-treatment or until withdrawal. Data collection includes recruitment and retention rates, disease status, surgical outcomes, adverse events and patient-reported outcomes using validated questionnaire: EORTC QLQ-TC26, EORTC QLQ-C30, Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMSFI) and additional enquiries on anejaculation.

Here, we identified a novel small-molecule inhibitor, (E)-1,9-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)non-3-en-5-one (SC), targeting RhoA through molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) validation. SPR kinetics revealed high-affinity binding (KD = 1.588 μM) with rapid association (ka = 2.769 × 10<sup>3</sup> 1/Ms) and slow dissociation (kd = 4.398 × 10<sup>-3</sup> 1/s), achieving stable SC-RhoA complex formation. In vitro, SC suppressed RhoA expression, in turn upregulating E-cadherin, downregulating N-cadherin and Vimentin, and inhibiting cell migration (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed pseudopodia retraction and cytoskeletal collapse. Remarkably, oral administration of SC (50 mg/kg/day) attenuated tumor growth in a xenograft model.

        "abstract": "Currently, radiotherapy remains the standard treatment for human cervical cancer (CC), while approximately 30 % of patients are still non-responsive to radiotherapy, leading to radioresistance. Therefore, it is urgent to discover a novel therapeutic target/biomarker for the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer, and it will be beneficial to clinical guiding significance for individualized treatment of cervical cancer. Herein, the correlation of miR-21-5p and clinicopathological features, clinical efficacy, radiotherapy sensitivity and survival were investigated, and our results showed that miR-21-5p is positively correlated to radio-sensitivity in patients with CC. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of miR-21-5p significantly suppressed the growth of HeLa and SiHa cells, and induced early apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-21-5p inhibitor caused an arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase. Of note, the miR-21-5p inhibitor significantly enhanced the efficacy of radiation in a dose and timing-dependent manner in human cervical cancer cells. Mechanistically, our results demonstrated that miR-21-5p inhibitior directly up-regulated CPEB3 and further suppressed CDK1/cyclin B pathway. The blockage of CDK1/cyclin B is responsible to the suppression of miR-21-5p and arresting cell cycle at G2/M. Taken together, miR-21-5p can serve as a potential predictor/biomarker for radioresistance and poor prognosis of CC patients. Our results suggested that miR-21-5p inhibitor effectively restored the radio-sensitivity of CC cells through blocking CPEB3-mediated CDK1/Cyclin B pathway.",

        "abstract": "Liver transplantation is increasingly being explored as a treatment option for select patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Historically, transplantation for mCRC was abandoned due to poor long-term outcomes and high recurrence rates. However, recent advancements in patient selection, immunosuppressive strategies, and donor organ availability have led to a renewed interest in this approach. Studies have demonstrated that highly selected patients undergoing liver transplantation can achieve significantly improved survival rates compared to those receiving standard systemic therapies. The implementation of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception points, improved donor preservation techniques such as machine perfusion, and the growing role of living donor liver transplantation have further supported its feasibility. As research continues, liver transplantation may emerge as a crucial component of a multidisciplinary strategy for treating colorectal liver metastases, offering a select group of patients a chance at prolonged survival and improved quality of life.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been used as both a screening tool and a marker for treatment response for advanced prostate cancer. With the introduction of androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI)-based treatment for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), there is a need to understand the impact that early treatment response, as measured by PSA, has on long-term clinical outcomes. <b>Objectives:</b> To assess whether long-term indicators of treatment success differ among ARPI-naïve patients with mCSPC who did or did not attain ≥90% reduction in PSA levels within 6 months of treatment initiation. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with mCSPC initiating a first ARPI (ie, apalutamide, enzalutamide, abiraterone acetate, darolutamide) were identified using electronic medical record data linked to insurance claims in the United States (1/1/2016-9/30/2022). Eligible patients were classified based on whether they achieved ≥90% reduction in PSA measured between pre-treatment and a window of 30 to 180 days after ARPI initiation. Cohorts were balanced using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Weighted Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare overall survival and castration-resistance-free survival by 36 months post-index between those with and without ≥90% PSA reduction. <b>Results:</b> Weighted cohorts included 1192 patients with early PSA reduction ≥90% and 699 without. By 36 months, significantly better overall survival was observed in those with early PSA reduction ≥90% than in those without (71.5% vs 54.7%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31, 0.50; <i>P</i><.001). Similarly, significantly better castration-resistance-free survival was observed in those with early PSA reduction ≥90% than in those without (53.3% vs 36.8%; HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.60; <i>P</i>< .001). <b>Discussion:</b> Early reduction of PSA levels by ≥90% within 6 months of ARPI initiation among patients with mCSPC in the real world is a robust indicator of treatment success, with improved long-term clinical outcomes, including survival and reduction in disease progression. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings corroborate those of clinical trials and highlight the long-term benefits of an early and deep PSA response to ARPIs among real-world patients with mCSPC in the United States.",

A hallmark of NEPC is its independence from the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, evidenced by diminished or absent AR expression-a key barrier to effective clinical management. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of NEPC pathogenesis and progression is essential, as it facilitates the identification of potential therapeutic targets and the development of more effective therapies. In this review, we summarize the typical characteristics of NEPC and describe its clinical diagnosis, relevant imaging modalities, current treatment strategies, and associated therapeutic difficulties. We also highlight the core events driving NEPC formation. Furthermore, we discuss potential therapeutic targets for the disease and review pharmacological agents that have demonstrated efficacy against NEPC, aiming to offer innovative perspectives and potential research directions for future NEPC treatment.",

A colonoscopy revealed rectal adenocarcinoma with surrounding varices. Given the patient's preserved hepatic function, we performed laparoscopic low anterior resection without preoperative variceal interventions. To minimize intraoperative bleeding, early ligation of the inferior mesenteric vein, ligation of the proximal mesenteric vein supplying the varices, and clipping and division of all visible mesenteric veins within the mesorectum were carried out. Postoperatively, portal hypertension was effectively managed with diuretics, and the patient recovered without complications or recurrent bleeding.
