        "abstract": "Tart cherry (TC; <i>Prunus cerasus</i>) has high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials due to its rich bioactive components like anthocyanins, polyphenols, vitamins, beta-carotene, ellagic acid, and chlorogenic acid. Oxidative damage and inflammation are underlying reasons to chronic disease pathogenesis. Oxidative stress usually caused by the imbalance between antioxidants and pro-oxidants. Additionally, a chronic inflammatory state is typically modulated by oxidative stress. Inflammation plays a critical role in chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, insulin resistance, arthritis and cancer. Numerous studies indicate that there is a strong relationship between TC and the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative damage by regulating different epigenetic and metabolic pathways. In this review, the recent developments of TC components and their metabolites on inflammatory and oxidative damages will be discussed, and the challenges and limitations to better support future research, including clinical trials to confirm these findings.",

        "title": "The Angiography Pattern of Buerger's Disease: Challenges and Recommendations.",
        "abstract": "In 2023, the VAS international working group on Buerger's Disease (BD) recommended two diagnostic criteria based on a prior Delphi study: \"definitive\" and \"suspected\". The \"definitive\" criteria are history of smoking, typical angiography, and typical histopathological features. All three features are mandatory to confirm a \"definitive\" diagnosis of BD. The conundrum is-what features should be considered typical of BD angiography? According to this review, segmental occlusion of infrapopliteal arteries, corkscrew collaterals that appear to continue the occluded arterial segment (Martorell's sign) or bypass the segmental occlusion, absence of atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm could differentiate BD from ASO. Hence, for \"typical\" BD angiography, these manifestations should certainly be considered. However, data for differentiating angiography patterns of BD from the small- and medium-sized vasculitis including Behcet's disease, scleroderma, hepatitis associated vasculitis, and anti-phospholipid syndrome are limited. Further studies for investigating the angiography pattern in BD patients in early and late presentation of BD, particularly in the patients with long-term follow up, are highly recommended.",

        "abstract": "Current strategies to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes focus primary prevention in high-risk groups and secondary prevention in people with known cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine the proportion of events occurring in lower-risk groups globally. We included people aged 40 years to younger than 75 years who were enrolled in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which is an ongoing, international, prospective, population-based cohort study that started recruiting adults from households selected to be broadly representative of the sociodemographic composition of their communities. We prospectively documented fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or any other fatal cardiovascular event stratified by history of cardiovascular disease and by the 10-year predicted disease risk scores based on WHO 2019 laboratory risk tables (<10% [low], 10% to <20% [intermediate], and ≥20% [high]) in people without previous cardiovascular disease from 26 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Outcome event rates were standardised for the cohort's age and sex distribution. Between July 11, 2000, and May 6, 2019, 128 973 participants were included from 26 countries (mean age 53·6 years [SD 8·2]; 75 858 [58·8%] were female and 53 115 [41·2%] were male). We observed 11 483 outcome events affecting 8·9% of the cohort during a median follow-up of 12·3 years (IQR 9·8-14·6). Among participants, 89 508 (69·4%) had a low cardiovascular disease risk, 22 363 (17·3%) had an intermediate cardiovascular disease risk, and 5529 (4·3%) had a high cardiovascular disease risk, while 11 573 (9·0%) had known cardiovascular disease. The age-standardised and sex-standardised cardiovascular disease incidence rates per 1000 person-years was 4·1 (95% CI 4·0-4·2) in the low-risk group, 17·7 (15·2-20·2) in the intermediate-risk group, and 40·8 (25·1-56·4) in the high-risk group. Overall, 41% of outcome events occurred in cardiovascular disease-naive participants at low risk. The proportion of adverse cardiovascular outcomes occurring in this low-risk group was inversely related to country income level (32% in high-income, 38% in middle-income, and 54% in low-income countries) and was higher in women (51%) than in men (32%). To achieve a substantial population-level reduction in cardiovascular disease, a fundamental change is needed, so that preventive strategies for cardiovascular disease extend beyond those at high or even intermediate predicted risk to include those at considered to be at low risk.

        "abstract": "The early detection and accurate prediction of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are critical to reduce global severe morbidity and mortality. Machine learning (ML) methods, operated by Transformers have proved its efficiency in interpreting complex data interactions. One prime example would be its notable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with its multi-headed self-attention mechanism to disentangle the complex interactions within high-dimensional spaces. However, the relationships between various features within biological systems remain ambiguous in these spaces, making it difficult to apply transformers in clinical datasets. We introduce CardioTabNet, a transformer-driven framework designed precisely for clinical cardiovascular data. It leverages the strength of the tab transformer architecture to effectively extract meaningful insights from clinical data. As a result, downstream classical models' performance significantly showed outstanding results. We utilized an open-source cardiovascular dataset with 1190 instances and 11 features. These features are categorized into numerical (age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, old peak, weight, and fasting blood sugar) and categorical (resting Electrocardiograms, exercise angina, and ST slope) variables. Tab transformer was used to extract significant features and rank them using a Random Forest (RF) feature ranking algorithm which highlighted the important clinical predictors. We used ten classical machine-learning models trained on these transformer extracted-features. An optimized ExtraTree classifier achieved an average accuracy of 94.1% and area under curve (AUC) of 95%. Furthermore, we performed nomogram analysis to draw out cardiovascular risk assessment to demonstrate clinical interpretability. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methodologies affirmed the superior predictive capability of our CardioTabNet framework, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for clinical decision support in cardiovascular disease prediction and early detection. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was carried out to provide insights into feature contributions and enhance model interpretability.

        "abstract": "Identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for dementia prevention, a global health concern. Depression is considered a risk factor for dementia, but the temporal dynamics across the life course remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess the relationship between the timing of depression assessment and risk of all-cause late-life dementia. We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis to assess incident dementia in individuals with non-current history of depression. PubMed and Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched from inception up to February 17, 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between depression and incident late-life dementia were included. From eligible reviews, we also extracted data from studies reporting dementia risk as hazard ratios (HRs), analysing the timing of depression measurement using random-effects models for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021249706. Of the 7763 records identified, nine reviews were eligible for inclusion of the umbrella review. One review was judged to be of moderate quality, while the others were either low (<i>n</i> = 3) or critically low (<i>n</i> = 5). For our meta-analyses, 18 studies reporting depression onset in later life (<i>n</i> = 901,762 participants, <i>n</i> = 7595 incident dementia cases) and seven studies on depression assessed during midlife (<i>n</i> ≥ 2,501,269 participants, <i>n</i> ≥ 276,929 incident dementia cases) were included. All studies in the meta-analyses were deemed to be of good quality, with no strong evidence of publication bias. Pooled HRs indicated depression present in late-life (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68-2.26; <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 77.5%) and midlife (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12-2.18; <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 97.5%) significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia. The findings suggest that depression across the life course may increase dementia risk; however, substantial heterogeneity and review quality should be considered when interpreting the strength of this evidence. A life course approach to the treatment and prevention of depression may help reduce the burden of dementia, but this will require scaling up access to effective mental health care for vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to clarify if the stronger late-life association reflects depression as an immediate risk factor or an early manifestation of neurodegenerative processes.

        "abstract": "The high burden of blood pressure-related cardiovascular diseases in Bangladesh is potentially caused by excessive dietary sodium and insufficient potassium intake. Our objective is to estimate dietary salt and potassium intake among Bangladesh rural and urban adults from urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. We conducted a cross-sectional study between December 2017 and June 2018, including participants aged 30-59 years from three urban and three rural sites in Bangladesh. Data included urinary excretion of sodium and potassium estimated from one 24-hr urine collection and blood pressure measurements. Among 840 enrolled participants, complete data was available in 509 individuals. Mean age was 43.0 (SD ±7.9) years; 20.9% had hypertension, 50.9% were women, and 50.9% resided in urban areas. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 118.6 (SD ± 16.6) mmHg and 76.3 (SD ± 11.3) mmHg, respectively. Overall, the mean urinary sodium excretion was 3.9 g/day (95% CI = 3.8 to 4.0), corresponding to a mean salt intake of 9.7 g/day (95% CI = 9.4-10.1). Mean urinary potassium excretion was 1.4 g/day (95% CI = 1.3-1.4), corresponding to an estimated mean dietary potassium intake of 2.0 g/day. Men and urban residents had slightly but non-significantly higher sodium and potassium excretion than women and rural residents. In Bangladesh, salt intake exceeded WHO's recommended <5g/day limit, while potassium intake was substantially lower than the recommended intake of ≥ 3.5g/day for adults. Promoting low-sodium and potassium-rich diets through nationwide campaigns and policies, including advocating for accessible low-sodium and potassium-enriched salt substitutes, is recommended to mitigate cardiovascular disease risks.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4.

Between January 2010 and December 2023 patients with non-acute elective PAAs undergoing endovascular exclusion with the Viabahn stent-graft were included in a multicenter retrospective cohort study (40 sites from 10 countries). A cut-off of 15 procedures was used to define a participating center as \"high-volume\" (>15) or \"low-volume\" (<15). During the 14-year studied period, 326 patients were treated who met inclusion criteria for the present study. Patients were predominantly male (304, 93.3%) with a mean age of 74.6 ± 9.2 years. Most of patients were asymptomatic (221, 67.8%), whilst 56 (17.2%) had intermittent claudication, and 49 (15%) CLTI. Acute technical success was not obtained in 2 cases (0.6%), due to residual type Ia endoleak (1 case), and residual type Ib endoleak (1 case), Of these, one patient received an open conversion, whereas the other one was followed up because unfit for any type of reintervention. At 30 days, 2 patients died with an overall 30-day mortality rate of 0.6%. Both were not cardiovascular deaths related to interventions. In addition, 30-day rates of MACE, graft occlusion, and procedure-related reinterventions were 1.2%, 3.7%, and 5.2%, respectively. No patient underwent early major amputation. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency, secondary patency, freedom from reinterventions(s), and amputation-free survival were 65.8% (95% CI: 61.7% to 71.9%), 84.9% (95% CI: 78.7% to 89.1%), 70.5% (95% CI: 66.2% to 74.8%), and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4% to 99.6%), respectively. Amputation-free survival was adversely affected by active smoking (p = .011), chronic kidney disease (p < .001), poor run-off status (p = .042), and low number of cases for each center (<15) (p = .011). Multivariate analysis reported an approaching significance for active smoking (HR 3.460, 95% CI 2.6 to 6.1, p = .051), and confirmed the association with chronic kidney disease (HR 7.413, 95% CI 5.4 to 9.3, p = .006). The findings from this study show that endovascular repair using the Viabahn stent-graft may provide a feasible technical option for elective treatment of PAA.

This study addresses the challenges of imbalanced data in SAH severity classification by employing the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) within a three-stage classification framework. We utilize a three-stage approach to effectively categorize SAH severity. In the first stage, we performed binary classification, grouping SAH severity into \"Good Outcome\" (class 0), which includes MRS levels 0, 1, 2, and 3, and \"Poor Outcome\" (class 1), encompassing levels 4, 5, and 6. Feature selection was done using a Random Forest algorithm to identify the top 20 features for the SAH severity prediction. We evaluated thirteen machine learning models at each stage, selecting the top-performing classifiers to optimize results. The dataset comprised 535 samples across seven MRS severity levels and was validated using 5-fold cross-validation and diverse subgroups to ensure robust model performance across various scenarios. Binary classification in the first stage achieved approximately 90% accuracy with Extra Trees. In the second stage, targeting the \"Good Outcome\" group, the Random Forest model reached 88% accuracy, while in the third stage, it achieved 86% accuracy for the \"Poor Outcome\" group. By increasing accuracy across unbalanced classes and emphasizing its potential for practical use, the multi-stage technique presents a promising solution for predicting the severity of SAH. Future research will concentrate on additional tuning to improve the model's efficacy in actual healthcare environments.",

The dataset included 11,815 individuals, and the prevalence of hypertension was 38.40%. The average age of individuals was 52.76 years (SD: 12.97), and 6826 (58.77%) were male. The Random forest model achieved 93% accuracy, with evaluation f1-scores of 95% for non-hypertension and 91% for hypertension, and identified older age, female gender, urban residency, workers, wealthier, self-awareness, and excessive body weight as key predictors of hypertension. The individual conditional expectation and SHAP plots reveal that age, and body mass index (BMI) are nonlinear relation with hypertension. The crude OR between excessive body weight and hypertension was 2.24 (95%CI: 2.07 - 2.42). Adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and self-awareness, the OR was 1.97 (95%CI: 1.79 - 2.17), and using de-biased method, it was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17 - 1.43). The study highlights important predictors of hypertension, including age, sex, residency, and socioeconomic status (SES), self-awareness and body weight. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting hypertension. The de-biased methods provided a more refined risk estimate. Age and excessive body weight were found to significantly contributed to hypertension, demonstrating complex interactions and varying marginal effects across different levels of these factors. Awareness programs and targeted interventions are vital to effectively reduce excessive body weight and prevent hypertension.",

Natural antioxidants, such as those found in green tea leaves, are beneficial in preventing these diseases. This study evaluated the protective effects of green tea leaves powder against isoprenaline (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Four groups of male Long Evans rats were used: Control, Control + green tea leaves powder, ISO, and ISO + green tea leaves powder. Organ and blood plasma samples were collected to measure oxidative stress biomarkers, biochemical parameters, and gene expressions. Furthermore, tissue sections were prepared and stained histologically. ISO-induced rats showed decreased cellular antioxidants (catalase activity and glutathione concentration) and elevated oxidative stress markers. Notable inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis were observed in the heart and kidneys of ISO-induced rats. Supplementation with green tea leaves powder significantly restored catalase activity and glutathione concentration (p < 0.05) in plasma and tissues. It also considerably reduced lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and advanced oxidation protein products (p < 0.05) in ISO-administered rats. Furthermore, green tea leaves powder supplementation halted inflammatory gene expression (p < 0.05), restored antioxidant genes (p < 0.05) such as Nrf-2-HO-1, and prevented cardiac fibrosis in ISO-administered rats. Green tea leaves powder supplementation may reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in ISO-administered rats, potentially through the Nrf-2-HO-1-mediated restoration of antioxidant enzymes and prevention of heart inflammation.",

The progression of Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) has been established as a strong predictor of future vascular events recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between CIMT and acute ischemic stroke. This cross sectional comparative study was conducted in the Department of Neurology and Medicine, at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from January 2019 to September 2020. Total 120 patients (60 cases of acute ischemic stroke and 60 age and sex matched apparently healthy controls) were included in the study. Participants were studied for the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors and CIMT by high resolution ultrasonography. Mean age of the patients with acute ischemic stroke was 62.85±9.30 years and 70.0% were male. No significant difference was noted between cases and controls in terms of age, sex, occupation, education and socioeconomic class. The mean right CIMT in the patient group was 0.94±0.24mm and it was 0.66±0.19mm in the control group (p<0.001). The mean left CIMT in the patient group was 0.97±0.30mm and it was 0.63±0.18mm in the control group (p<0.001). The average CIMT in the patient group was 0.96±0.23mm and it was 0.65±0.17mm in the control group (p<0.001). CIMT was found to be higher among acute ischemic stroke patients who were smoker and hypertensive than that of nonsmoker and normotensive stroke patients. On multivariate analysis, CIMT remained associated with ischemic stroke as compared to other variables {OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.57-13.05), p<0.01}. CIMT measurements are independent markers of acute ischemic stroke.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning approach that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for robust cardiac arrhythmia detection. Unlike conventional methods, our approach constructs cycle graphs from ECG signals, leveraging graph signal processing to enhance data representation and improve classification accuracy. The proposed model processes raw ECG signals using a TCN-based feature extractor, followed by spectral graph convolutions via a GCN. We evaluate our model using the Chapman and Shaoxing 12-lead ECG database, consolidating 11 rhythm classes into four superclasses for improved classification reliability. Our model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.5%, surpassing standard GCNs and other deep learning architectures while significantly reducing graph construction complexity. These results demonstrate the potential of graph-based deep learning for efficient and accurate ECG analysis in resource-constrained medical settings.",

These arteries are used for blood circulation and the delivery of essential nutrients and oxygen to various bodily parts. Heart disease accounts for approximately 31% of global deaths, amounting to over 17.9 million lives lost annually. This staggering global death toll due to cardiovascular disease underscores the critical imperative for comprehensive research and innovative solutions. In response to this urgent need, this study employs a multifaceted approach to address the detection of cardiovascular disease, leveraging a combination of advanced techniques. Specifically, it integrates machine learning models for disease prediction, a robust encryption algorithm for data security, and a private blockchain framework for ensuring tamper-proof storage, transparency, and data integrity. Together, these components form a comprehensive system designed to accurately detect cardiovascular conditions and safeguard sensitive medical information. Here, a voting ensemble technique and an array of machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and neural networks, were used and achieved an accuracy of 89.2%. As a consequence, this study presents an enhanced approach aimed at mitigating the profound impact of cardiovascular disease.

To ensure sustained productivity and a thriving workforce, workplace hazards like heat must be acknowledged, assessed and managed. This paper explores heat impacts on health and productivity of production-line workers in two RMG factories of Bangladesh. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with the workers of two RMG factories in Dhaka in 2022 to identify perceived heat-related health and productivity impacts and explore barriers to workers accessing heat-related medical care. Key informant interviews were conducted with factory officials, onsite health professionals, government officials, the RMG peak body, and non-government organisation professionals with expertise in industry and workplace issues. Workers and health professionals attributed symptoms like headaches, dizziness, fatigue and nausea to heat. Factory health professionals observed changes in cardiovascular strain (eg, altered blood pressure responses) in workers during summer. Other key informants identified higher absenteeism across summer. Heat was identified as an impediment to overall productivity by workers themselves and others working across the sector. This qualitative study identified how heat exposure in indoor work environments of RMG in Bangladesh influences health of workers and how productivity is influenced directly by heat but also indirectly via necessary cooling measures to reduce heat strain that take workers away from the production line. Despite knowledge of access to hydration as an important heat health risk mitigation strategy, quota pressures inherent in these factories restrict the use of this vital measure.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the leading cause of death globally, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Traditional risk factors alone fail to explain the individual variability in disease susceptibility and progression. Recent advances in genomics and epigenomics have revealed key molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiovascular function, highlighting the importance of gene network dynamics and epigenetic regulation. This review systematically analyzes peer-reviewed literature from the past decade sourced from electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. It compiles the multifaceted roles of DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNAs in regulating cardiovascular gene expression, cellular phenotypes, and disease pathogenesis. DNA methylation influences the transcriptional activity of gene expression associated with atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and hypertension, while histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling regulate cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and regeneration. Noncoding RNAs further act as critical regulators of angiogenesis, inflammation, and myocardial remodeling. Therapeutically, these findings have facilitated the development of epigenetic drugs and gene-editing technologies targeting specific molecular pathways involved in CVD progression. Emerging technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9, RNA-based therapies, and small-molecule inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes hold potential for correct abnormal gene expression patterns. Moreover, integrative multi-omics and systems biology approaches are advancing personalized treatment strategies, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of cardiovascular interventions. Collectively, unraveling the complex molecular interactions among gene networks, epigenetic alterations, and targeted therapeutic mapping aims to combat CVD with better precision and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, hypertension is more prevalent among men aged 30 and older, but a national survey from Bangladesh shows a different trend. This paper explores the differences in hypertension by sex and age among the Bangladeshi adult population throughout their life span. We conducted the secondary analysis using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. This nationally representative survey involved a two-stage stratified sample of 675 households in urban (250) and rural (425) enumeration areas (EAs). The analytical sample comprised 12 476 individuals aged 18 or older (6955 women and 5521 men). We performed univariate and bivariate tests to investigate variations in hypertension across sex, age, and other factors. We applied multivariable logistic regression models and logit-based marginal probabilities to explore age and sex differences as well as their interactions in hypertension while estimating the marginal effects of sex for each age group to assess the significance of sex differentials in hypertension throughout the life course. Our study revealed a noteworthy trend: Women have a hypertension prevalence that is five percentage points lower than that of men in their early twenties. However, this trend reverses in their early thirties, with women exhibiting a five-percentage point higher prevalence than men. After adjusting for confounders and age-sex interactions in women, the odds of hypertension were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.6) in the 35-39-year-old age group, which may contribute to a combined burden of chronic and reproductive morbidity. With rising hypertension and stagnant maternal health in Bangladesh, women of reproductive age face higher risks of chronic and reproductive complications. The complex health system in Bangladesh, which starts at the community level, primarily focuses on maternal and child health; however, some recent initiatives show a shift in focus to address significant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through public health facilities. Considering that more women seek health care from public facilities, recognising common factors contributing to early hypertension in Bangladeshi women enables targeted interventions, model testing, and strategic adjustments to the primary health care-focused national non-communicable disease management pathway.",

        "abstract": "Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) are three common forms of altitude sickness. These conditions can be life-threatening, with symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. Ascending to high elevations increases the likelihood of developing these conditions, with some individuals adapting quickly while others need to descend. Early acclimatization is beneficial for avoiding AMS and HACE, but it takes weeks to months to improve job performance and performance at high altitudes. HAPE is a leading cause of mortality from altitude sickness, characterized by foamy mucus, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Treatment is most effective when it is administered quickly, with mild cases resolving with additional time spent at altitude. Oxygen therapy and chemicals such as acetazolamide, spironolactone, and dexamethasone are used to restore fluid balance and prevent complications. Genes and environmental factors influence genetic reactions to low oxygen levels at high altitudes. This review explores pharmacological interventions currently used or under investigation, such as acetazolamide, dexamethasone, and novel HIF stabilizers. By integrating molecular insights with pharmacological data, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of altitude-related illnesses. Studying altitude sickness is highly relevant not only for climbers and high-altitude workers but also for broader medical contexts like hypoxia-related diseases. This manuscript aims to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical practice, facilitating improved strategies for management and prevention of high-altitude disorders.",

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a powerful technology to map spatially variable molecular mechanisms, yet suitable analytical methods have been lacking. We introduce spatially resolved pathology score (SPaSE), an optimal transport-based algorithm to compare ST data from diseased and control tissues. SPaSE computes a \"pathology score\" for each spot in the diseased sample, quantifying the pathological impact at that spot. In post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) mouse hearts, these scores delineated zones that matched independent expert annotations. Modeling pathology scores from gene expression revealed signatures predictive of varying pathological severity. The scoring model learned from mouse data showed accurate predictions on human post-MI data. We also demonstrated SPaSE's efficacy on additional simulated and real ST data from traumatic brain injury and Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models.

        "abstract": "Left main (LM) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains a major interventional challenge, with outcomes influenced by various patient- and procedure-related factors. To analyze procedural characteristics and outcomes of patients who underwent LM PCI over a 15-year period in a single center. We retrospectively analyzed data from all consecutive patients who underwent LM PCI between 2006 and 2022. Procedural details, with a focus on stenting technique, were collected. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year. In total 3494 patients were included. The majority (67%) presented with chronic coronary syndrome. Seventy-seven percent of all patients (n = 2690) underwent PCI by single stent (SS) strategy and 23% (n = 804) by double stent (DS) strategy. One-year mortality was significantly lower in SS cases compared to DS (3.5% vs. 5.1%, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.96). Intravascular imaging was used in 17% of the cases but showed no significant difference in one-year mortality compared to angio-guided PCI (4.8% vs. 3.7%; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71-1.73). In real-world LM PCI practice, patients for whom a provisional single-stent strategy was feasible had better outcomes than those requiring a double-stent approach.",

        "abstract": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have informed guideline recommendations for the management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the real-world impact of contemporary guidelines and trials on practising physicians in the Asia-Pacific region remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices among cardiovascular physicians in the region regarding stable CAD management. An anonymised cross-sectional electronic survey was administered to cardiovascular practitioners from the Asia Pacific, assessing 3 domains: 1) baseline knowledge on recent trials and society guideline, 2) attitudes towards stable CAD, and 3) case scenarios reflecting management preferences. Correlations among knowledge, attitudes and practice scores were assessed between physicians from developed and developing countries using Pearson correlation. Overall, 713 respondents from 21 countries completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 2.90±1.18 (out of 4), with 37.3% of respondents answering all questions correctly, while 74.6% noted that guidelines have significant impact on their practice. Despite guidelines recommending optimal medical therapy, majority chose revascularisation (range 53.4- 90.6%) as the preferred strategy for the case scenarios. Practitioners from developed regions had higher knowledge scores and lower attitude scores compared to developing regions, while practice scores were similar in both groups. Weakly positive correlations were noted between knowledge, attitude and practice scores. Variations exist in knowledge and attitudes towards guideline recommendations and correspondingly actual clinical practice in the Asia Pacific, with most practitioners choosing an upfront invasive strategy for the treatment of stable CAD. These differences reflect real-world disparities in guideline interpretation and clinical adoption.",

        "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant and avoidable complication that may occur after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Various mechanical and chemical prophylactic measures may mitigate this elevated risk of death and functional impairment. Consequently, early prevention of VTE is essential via the identification of related risk factors. A search was performed using the databases of PubMed, ScienceDirect, PEDro, and Cochrane Library to get papers from 2004 to 2024 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English that included at least one group undergoing intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) treatment as a prophylactic intervention after total hip arthroplasty (THA) were included. This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO. The quality evaluation of the included studies was conducted using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk of bias instrument. We selected 12 studies from a total of 733 based on predetermined criteria. A total of 2,352 patients of both genders underwent total hip arthroplasty, comprising 1,294 patients in the experimental group and 1,058 patients in the control group across the included studies. The results indicate that the combination of IPC and pharmaceutical agents was the most effective treatment for reducing VTE risk in patients who underwent THA. IPC therapy is very effective in avoiding VTE, particularly when used in combination with pharmacological therapies after THA surgery. The best ways to lower the risk of VTE are to use both IPC and anticoagulants together. However, IPC alone may lower the risk of VTE compared to not using any prevention at all. In general, IPC is a crucial component of comprehensive VTE prevention strategies in THA.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally regarded as a vestigial organ, the appendix is now being reevaluated for its significant function in health and nutrition of humans. Serving as a \"safe house\" for beneficial, desired gut bacteria, the appendix is protected by resilient biofilms that create a secure environment. This makes the appendix a\"basin\" for gut microbiota (GM), replenishing the microbial population following disruptions from infections, antibiotic use, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Beyond simply hosting bacteria, the appendix has an active role in functions of the immune system. Disruption of the Appendix Microbiome (AM), such as through appendectomy, was found to result in lowered diversity of gut microorganisms and an increased risk of various diseases. The potential therapeutic applications of the AM are a particularly promising area of research. The appendix's unique microbial environment and its impact on immunity open new avenues for treatments. These include modulating GM to improve cancer treatment outcomes, mitigating IBD, regulating metabolic pathways in obesity and diabetes, influencing neurotransmitter production in neurological disorders, and addressing cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. This review highlights the appendix's transformation from a misunderstood organ to a critical component of gut health and immunity. It explores the function of the human appendix as a resilient reservoir for desired microorganisms, and its role in disease progression. Furthermore, it examines the potential therapeutic applications of AM, presenting exciting opportunities for future research and treatment innovations.",

However, whether multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention is superior to culprit vessel percutaneous coronary intervention is unknown. A meta-analysis was conducted including studies that compared multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (MV-PCI) and culprit vessel percutaneous coronary intervention among non-ST elevation myocardial infarction patients. Relative risk (RR) for mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), repeat revascularization and procedural complications was calculated using a random effects model. Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was no difference in short-term outcomes for mortality (RR 0.917, 95% CI 0.613-1.371, P = .672), MI (RR 0.960, 95% CI 0.612-1.507, P = .861), and stent thrombosis (RR 1.338, 95% CI 0.655-2.733, P = .424).

        "abstract": "The built environment around schools that are regularly accessed by young people is determined by governments, national and regional policies in each country or region. Zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol sales are expected to restrict availability and access by young people. This study aimed to examine (non) compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations around schools in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a representative sample of geographic locations in Bangladesh, India North (Delhi) and India South (Chennai), Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the built environment was mapped by systematically walking all streets within the site boundary to collect data on different types of tobacco and alcohol retailers and schools. Data was collected on KoboToolBox, and the maps indicating zoning compliance were created using ArcGIS. Descriptive analysis of outlet compliance to the zoning laws was conducted at the national and school levels, with heterogeneity analyses done by school type, income level and outlet type for tobacco and alcohol. The zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol differed among the settings ranging from 50 to 100 m for tobacco and absolute bans to 500 m for on-premise alcohol. Among the five different settings within the four countries, 441 areas were studied, including 3615 schools. Non-compliance with the zoning laws is evident in all jurisdictions for both tobacco and alcohol. Within restricted zones around schools (location non-compliant with zoning laws), 12-38% of outlets selling tobacco and 16% to 100% of outlets selling alcohol were identified. For supply non-compliance, 3-70% of shops within the school buffer zones were selling tobacco, while only 0.2-1% of shops were selling alcohol. Non-compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations has been observed around schools in Bangladesh, India (North and South), Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Within each country, there was a higher percentage of alcohol outlets that were location non-compliant than for tobacco, except for South India. In India and Sri Lanka, there was a higher percentage of supply non-compliance for tobacco than alcohol. This study calls for governments to strictly enforce existing zoning regulations that are expected to restrict access to tobacco and alcohol for young people.",

        "abstract": "Health education could be an effective way to increase knowledge regarding behavioral changes to prevent the recurrence of stroke; however, the evidence is ambiguous. A lack of both knowledge and compliance with treatment to control modifiable risk factors and unhealthy lifestyles increases the risk of stroke recurrence. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a health education program among patients with stroke postdischarge and their family caregivers in a tertiary specialized hospital in Bangladesh to reduce stroke recurrence by controlling modifiable risk factors. A parallel (1:1), open-label, prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in Bangladesh. A total of 432 patients with first-time stroke, aged ≥18 years and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-4, were randomly enrolled at the National Institute of Neuroscience & Hospital. We stratified the patients by age and type of stroke and randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). We collected sociodemographic and clinical data by using a structured questionnaire. The IG received (self) management education, including monitoring blood pressure (BP), medication, diet, and exercise for 12 months, and the CG received usual care. The outcomes were (1) recurrence after 28 days of stroke and (2) all adverse events related to stroke after 12-month follow-up. Of 432 patients (n=216, 50%, in each group), stroke recurrence was observed 14 (6.5%) patients in the IG and 8 (3.7%) patients in the CG, and the difference was not significant (P=.19). Death was lower in the IG (n=39, 18.1%, vs n=56, 25.9%) compared to the CG. In Cox regression analysis, the unadjusted model showed death was significant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.531, 95% CI 1.017-2.304; P=.04); however, the difference was not significant after adjusting the mRS score at baseline (HR 0.818, 95% CI 0.540-1.238; P=.34). Patients' medication adherence significantly improved at 6-month (P<.001) and 12-month (P=.002) follow-up after the intervention. This study failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of health education in reducing recurrence, death, and stroke-related adverse events. However, health education enhanced medication adherence. Some causes of death could not be diagnosed due to inadequate health care systems. Further research with diagnostic facilities and a long observation period is necessary to explore the underlying cause of recurrence. The results suggest the importance of structuring acute care management for patients with stroke into the health care system of Bangladesh.

Cardiomyopathy detection and early diagnosis are crucial in reducing negative health effects. Thus, this study aims to use single cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis to uncover dendritic cell-specific biomarkers, gene ontology, pathways, regulatory interaction networks, and protein-chemical compounds related to the molecular mechanism of cardiomyopathy progression. Two RNAseq datasets GSE65446 and GSE155495 also were evaluated to identify significant biomarkers in cardiomyopathy, and 123 mutual DEGs appeared between scRNAseq and RNAseq datasets. In addition, the DAVID online platform and FunRich software were utilized to detect cell communication in innate immune responses, type 1 IFN, antigen processing and presentation, allograft rejection and viral infection significant gene ontology and metabolic pathways in cardiomyopathy. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network revealed five key hub proteins (ITGAX, IRF7, MX1, HLA-B, and IRF1). Following that, several transcription factors (GATA2, FOXC1, SREBF1, STAT3, and NFKB1) as well as microRNA (hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-129-2-3p, etc.) were predicted. Prospective chemical substances such as tretinoin, valproic acid, and arsenic trioxide have been predicted to be linked to cardiomyopathy treatment. The acceptable value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that biomarkers play critical roles in cardiomyopathy. This study identifies molecular indicators at the RNA and protein levels that may be useful in improving understanding of molecular causes, early diagnosis, and devising favorable cardiomyopathy treatment.

        "abstract": "Food hydrocolloids, derived from natural sources such as plants, algae, and microbes, possess bioactive properties that significantly contribute to cardiovascular health. This review focuses on six key hydrocolloids: alginate, astragalus polysaccharides, carrageenan, fucoidan, lunasin, and psyllium, while also considering other important natural hydrocoloids such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), plant-derived food hydrocolloids, plant-derived gums, plant-derived mucilages, pectin, modified citrus pectin, inulin, naringenin, chia seeds, gelatine, whey protein, casein, microbial exopolysaccharides and gums, ulvan, and laminarin. Alginate, from brown seaweed, aids in cardiac tissue regeneration and repair. Astragalus polysaccharides, from the Astragalus plant, provide antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory benefits. Carrageenan, sourced from red seaweed, supports lipid profile balance and heart health. Fucoidan, another brown seaweed derivative, offers antihypertensive and lipid-lowering effects. Lunasin, a peptide found in soybeans, oats, and barley, is known for its cholesterol-lowering properties and anti-inflammatory effects. Psyllium, rich in soluble fiber, helps lower LDL cholesterol and improve overall cardiovascular function. These hydrocolloids, along with other mentioned compounds, are utilized in drug formulations, cosmetics, processed foods, and dietary supplements, enhancing food texture and stability while delivering health benefits. Upon consumption, they can be absorbed into the bloodstream or metabolized by gut microbiota into bioactive metabolites. This review examines their effects on cardiovascular function, highlighting their mechanisms in regulating vascular tone, blood pressure, vascular inflammation, and cardiac function. It consolidates current research, emphasizing the potential of these hydrocolloids and related compounds in the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).",

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "abstract": "Adherence to antihypertensive medication is a key management strategy for hypertension, which gives rise to the necessity to get a clear picture of medication adherence among patients with hypertension in Bangladesh. This study aims to determine the prevalence of antihypertensive medication adherence and its associated factors among patients with hypertension receiving treatments at a Hypertension Center in Bangladesh. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 352 adult patients with hypertension registered in the Rangpur Hypertension and Research Center. The outcome variable for the study was medication adherence to the antihypertensive drug, which was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Descriptive analysis was conducted to show the distribution of the study participants, Pearson's chi-square test was applied to explore associations between categorical response and explanatory variables, and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore factors associated with medication adherence. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 17.0. The prevalence of good medication adherence among patients with hypertension in the HRC, R was 54.83%. Among various reasons for taking the medicine irregularly, forgetfulness (20.29%) was the most common cause reported by the participants, followed by a busy work schedule (7.71%). Among the study participants, married patients were found to have higher medicine adherence (AOR= 3.81; 95% CI: 1.34-10.89) than unmarried patients. Compared to patients who had hypertension for less than or equal to 5 years, patients suffering from hypertension for 6-10 years had 68% (AOR= 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11-0.95) and patients suffering for more than 10 years had 72% (AOR= 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09-0.84) lower odds of medicine adherence, respectively. Patients who were diagnosed by non-professionals had 81% (AOR= 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.61) lower odds of medicine adherence compared to the patients who were diagnosed by health professionals. This study observed low medication adherence among patients with hypertension, where forgetfulness and a busy work schedule were reported to be the primary reasons for such non-adherence. Patients who are not married, who have been suffering for a long, and who have not been diagnosed by a health professional manifested as significant influencing factors for non-adherence.",

        "abstract": "Cancer and cardiovascular disease are two of the most significant health challenges worldwide. These diseases are responsible for morbidity and mortality, leading to a substantial burden on healthcare systems and economic resources. Numerous innovative therapies have been proposed for combating cancer and cardiovascular disease like thrombosis; however, many of these treatments involve synthetic drugs that may have undesirable side effects. Consequently, the current research aimed to explore the medicinal properties of phytochemicals derived from Magnolia champaca L. This investigation utilized both in vitro and in silico approaches. The identification of phytocompounds were employed by using ATR-FTIR and GC-MS. Thrombolytic activity was assayed using human venous blood and cytotoxicity was assessed through lethality test using nauplii of Artemia salina and finally the molecular docking analysis was performed using a docking software named AutoDock Vina to clearly understand about the interactions of GC-MS identified secondary metabolites with target proteins. The ATR-FTIR spectrum of Magnolia champaca specifies the presence of some alkaloids, polysaccharides, flavonoids as well as glycosidic phytocompounds and GC-MS data identified 23 compounds from crude methanolic extract and among them 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol; 3-Ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one; Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester; Di-n-octyl phthalate were prominent. The in vitro thrombolytic assay demonstrated that Trans-Syringin and CHF resulted in significant blood clot lysis, achieving 59.39 ± 1.79 % and 45.66 ± 3.63 % respectively comparing 75.75 ± 2.96 % with standard streptokinase. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated moderate to strong toxicological effect. Specifically, Trans-Syringin and the ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) demonstrated considerable cytotoxicity, showing the net values of LC<sub>50</sub> were 22.39 µg/ml and 61.78 µg/ml, respectively contrary to 11.45 µg/ml of vincristine sulfate (standard). Molecular docking analysis were conducted to explore the synergistic effects of the compounds identified through GC-MS analysis on tissue plasminogen activator and human topoisomerase-II. The compounds 3-Ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one; Cadina-1(10),4-diene and 1,1,7-Trimethyl-4-methylenedecahydro-1H-cyclopropa[e]azulen-7-ol-, (1aR-(1a.alpha.,4a.alpha.,7.beta.,7a.beta.,7b.alpha.))- demonstrated high binding affinities of -7.7, -7.3, and -7.1 kcal/mol, respectively, for tissue plasminogen activator where streptokinase (standard) had -6.5 kcal/mol. For human topoisomerase-II, 3-Ethyl-3-hydroxyandrostan-17-one; Caryophyllene-(I1) and Cadina-1(10),4-diene exhibited binding affinities of -8.0, -7.9 as well as -7.8 kcal/mol correspondingly, while standard vincristine had -8.1 kcal/mol. These findings suggest that Magnolia champaca contains active phytochemicals with significant potentials for diverse pharmacological applications.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "Poorer health literacy leads to limited knowledge of diseases and lower adherence to medication. Several tools are available for measuring health literacy, including the HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire using Rasch measurement theory to assess general health literacy among adults in rural Bangladesh. Baseline data was collected through a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) in the Narail district of Bangladesh from 1 December 2020 to 31 January 2021, involving 307 adults aged 30-75 with hypertension. The HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire, which has 12 items, was validated using the Rasch measurement model and analyzed using RUMM2030. The analysis was focused on differential item functioning (DIF) across gender and age, targeting, multidimensionality, response dependency, and item categorization. The sample consisted of almost equal proportions of females (50.2%) and males (49.8%), and control (50.8%) and intervention participants (49.2%). Initial examination indicated that the tool had a poor overall fit with the Rasch model, shown by a significant item-trait interaction (χ2 = 100.5 df = 48, p < 0.001). The reliability, measured by person separation index (PSI), was 0.746, which was considered satisfactory. The overall item fit residual (IFR) (M = 0.236, SD = 1.318) and the person fit residuals (PFR) (M = -0.186, SD = 1.03) were within the acceptable range of SD ± 1.4. All items were found to have ordered thresholds, suggesting that respondents had no difficulty differentiating between response options on the 4-point Likert-type scale. Only item 12 (\"Join a sports club or exercise class if you want to\") had a fit residual value outside the acceptable range. Removing item 12 resulted in a good overall fit (χ2 = 60.35 df = 44, p = 0.05) and a slight improvement to the PSI (0.746 for 12 items vs.0.756 for 11 items). None of the items showed significant DIF for age and gender. Only two items showed residual correlation coefficient 0.20, indicating possible redundancy. The analysis demonstrated the scale's unidimensionality, as shown by the lower bound of a binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed proportion (5.2%) being within the 95% confidence limit. The study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the HLS-EU-Q12 as a tool for assessing health literacy among adults in Bangladesh. However, further study is needed to evaluate the tool across different populations, including an in-depth investigation of item 12 to determine its inclusion or removal.

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

This case report describes the unique physiotherapy management of a 47-year-old male with non-cardiac angina resulting from cervical disc herniation at C5-6-7. It highlights effective treatment strategies and aims to increase awareness of physiotherapy's role in managing non-cardiac chest pain. The patient was initially misdiagnosed with post-COVD complications, the patient presented with persistent neck and chest pain, later confirmed as cervicogenic angina through MRI and clinical assessment. His treatment involved a targeted physiotherapy program including postural education, McKenzie exercises, cervical traction, and ergonomic adjustments. Sessions were conducted twice weekly over four weeks. Assessment of the cervical range of motion (ROM) showed improvements. Following this intervention, the patient experienced symptom relief, with no recurrence at a three-month follow-up. The patient reported significant improvement in the Visual analogue scale (VAS), Manual muscle strength (MMT) and the Neck disability index (NDI). This case highlights the potential for cervical disc herniation to mimic cardiac-related chest pain and underscores the importance of physiotherapy in managing such cases. The findings contribute to the limited literature on physiotherapy's role in treating cervicogenic angina, providing insights for practitioners in manual medicine.",

        "abstract": "Serum uric acid (SUA) has been suggested to be associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension. However, whether uric acid is independently associated with the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), a major type of cardiovascular disease (CVD), remains debatable, especially across different populations. This study aims to examine the relationship between SUA levels and MI in an adult population group in Bangladesh. The study included 392 participants: 188 with a history of MI in the CVD group and 204 healthy individuals without CVD in the control group. Anthropometric, blood pressure, SUA, and other biochemical parameters were measured. A multivariate regression model was used to assess the relationship between elevated SUA levels and the risk of CVD. The mean level of SUA was significantly higher in the CVD group (7.6 ± 4.5 mg/dL) compared to the non-CVD group (5.3 ± 1.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.001). The prevalence of hyperuricemia was also observed to be higher in the CVD group (46.3%) compared to the non-CVD group (18.2%) (p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed in the levels of blood glucose and lipid profile between the CVD and non-CVD groups (p < 0.001 for all cases). No significant differences were observed in the mean level of SUA or the prevalence of hyperuricemia between the gender groups. When SUA was divided into four quartiles, a significant difference was observed for systolic blood pressure across the quartile groups. After adjusting for potential confounders in the regression models, SUA was found to have a significant association with CVD. Elevated levels of SUA were associated with increased odds of CVD among the study participants. Managing SUA levels and implementing intervention strategies could be effective in preventing and controlling cardiovascular events.",

        "title": "Mental Health Sequelae of Cardiac Events: A Comprehensive Review of Biological Mechanisms, Prevalence, and Interdisciplinary Care Approaches.",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, with postcardiac events such as myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and sudden cardiac arrest causing significant physiological trauma and psychological effects. This study explores the complex interplay between cardiac events and mental health disorders, focusing on the biological and psychological pathways that connect these conditions in at-risk populations. The acute stress response following a cardiac event involves the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to the release of stress hormones and inflammatory cytokines. Prolonged activation of these systems can result in neurotransmitter imbalances, neuroinflammation, and epigenetic modifications, increasing the susceptibility to mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Women exhibit a higher vulnerability to these conditions due to hormonal fluctuations and a more pronounced stress response. The prevalence of mental health disorders following cardiac events is substantial, with PTSD rates being particularly high among survivors of myocardial infarction and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These psychological conditions are associated with poor physical recovery, reduced quality of life, and an increased risk of recurrent cardiac events and mortality. Resilience and adaptive coping mechanisms serve as protective factors, highlighting the importance of integrating mental health care within cardiac rehabilitation programs. This study emphasizes the need for early detection, targeted interventions, and an interdisciplinary approach to improve mental health outcomes in patients recovering from cardiac incidents. Understanding the psychiatric sequelae of cardiac events is crucial for cardiologists, particularly in the management of postmyocardial infarction patients, ischemic attack survivors, and individuals undergoing open-heart surgery. Early detection and interdisciplinary interventions can improve long-term outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most common factors contributing to cardiac remodeling that links to changes in both heart and kidney functions. Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) in reducing oxidative stress due to its antioxidant properties. However, the cardioprotective and nephroprotective roles of CoQ<sub>10</sub> against the toxicity induced by fludrocortisone acetate (FCA) have yet to be investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the CoQ<sub>10</sub> effects on FCA-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in a rat model (FCA-Salt). We analyzed various oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzyme activities using biochemical assays. In addition, we examined inflammatory and fibrosis via histological staining of heart and kidney tissues. CoQ<sub>10</sub> significantly reduced lipid peroxidation product-malondialdehyde (MDA) while increased nitric oxide (NO) in the FCA-Salt rats. Antioxidant enzyme activities were also enhanced by CoQ<sub>10</sub> in these rats. Histopathological examination detected tissue damage and fibrosis in the FCA-Salt group, which was significantly reduced by CoQ<sub>10</sub>. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated the activation of Transforming growth factor-β1/Tumor necrosis factor-α (TGF-β1/TNF-α) by CoQ<sub>10</sub>. Consequently, our study suggests that CoQ<sub>10</sub> can effectively protect heart and kidney health against cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in FCA-Salt hypertensive rats via TGF-β1/TNF-α pathway.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic (As) is an environmental pollutant that causes endocrine disruption. Diabetes increases the risk of Blackfoot disease, which is a peripheral artery disease caused by chronic exposure to As through drinking water in Taiwan and Bangladesh; however, the mechanism underlying this increased risk remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying vascular damage in hyperglycemic conditions caused by As exposure using in vivo and in vitro studies. We utilized an animal model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes that was exposed to As through drinking water for 8 weeks. Subsequently, blood and organ samples of the animals were collected for follow-up analysis. Further, we cultured endothelial cells that were treated with As treatment in glucose condition and detected their biomarkers. The findings revealed that both the diabetes and diabetes + As groups exhibited insulin resistance, weight gain, and increased plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. The diabetes + As group had lower antioxidant activity, which caused the arteries to exhibit prominent luminal narrowing with increased thickness. In vivo study revealed that glucose + As group-induced cell cycle arrest, a 98.80% increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and decreased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). However, in glucose + As group, treatment with SP600125 and U10126 treatment decreased ROS production by 80.5% and 84%, respectively, and restored MMP and cell viability. The glucose-regulated protein 78 level increased in the As as well as glucose + As groups. Our findings demonstrate that As exacerbates vascular damage in individuals with diabetes and its associated complications through the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease caused by inflammation in the blood vessel wall, which leads to plaque formation in the endothelial lining. Preexisting atherosclerosis contributes to various cardiovascular problems, including myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndrome, all of which are associated with higher postoperative mortality and morbidity. Rupturing of atherosclerosis poses a significant health concern as triggering a heart attack. Therefore, it is essential to identify atherosclerosis early to prevent health complications and their subsequent consequences. Atherosclerosis is typically diagnosed by angiograms, computerized tomography scans and stress tests. Additionally, various biomarkers are released by inflammatory cells in the surrounding tissue and artery walls during the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Quantifying these biomarkers can aid in diagnosing and determining the severity of atherosclerosis in relation to cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the recent advancements in understanding the formation of atherosclerosis and the implementation of biomarkers in nano biosensors.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between knowledge of healthy lifestyles and the age of hypertension diagnosis among hypertensive individuals within Bangladeshi rural population. This cross-section study was conducted among hypertensive adults (18-80 years) in a rural population. We obtained data from 3600 adults with hypertension from 40 randomly selected community pharmacies. We gathered data on demographics, health knowledge, and measured vital signs, including hypertension diagnosis year. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the lifestyle and knowledge factors about hypertension with the age of diagnosis of hypertension. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis was 45.84 years. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis of male participants was higher than female (48.1 vs 44.4 years). Our study found that males and individuals with primary education are more likely to receive a later hypertension diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-3.10 and odds ratio = 5.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.09-11.48 respectively) for those aged ≥65. The poorest and those lacking physical exercise faced higher odds of later diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.15 and odds ratio = 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.78-3.17 respectively). Conversely, a family history of hypertension reduces the odds (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.55). Increased knowledge of healthy lifestyle factors and engagement with health-related media correlate with later diagnosis, highlighting the influence of education and awareness on hypertension detection age. Our study reveals that knowledge of a healthy lifestyle is associated with the age of hypertension diagnosis. Targeting specific age groups based on health education programs may reduce hypertension-related complications.",

Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), provides a novel, long-acting approach to improve hyperlipidemia. This meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 5 out of 185 studies screened met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was a reduction in the LDL-C level compared to control group. Statistical analysis used a random-effect model to calculate the mean difference (MD) for with 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 5 randomized controlled trials comprised 4,072 patients, divided into the Inclisiran arm (n = 2,129) and the Control arm (n = 1,943). Compared with control, this study showed Inclisiran substantially reduces LDL-C (MD, -51.25%; 95% CI, [-56.58 to -45.92], p <0.00001), total cholesterol (MD, -27.75%; 95% CI, [-30.39 to -25.10], p <0.00001), apolipoprotein B (MD, -36.65%; 95% CI, [-45.93 to -27.37], p = 0.00039), triglycerides (MD, -12.39%; 95% CI, [-21.49 to -3.28], p = 0.02275), PCSK9 level (MD, -77.00%; 95% CI, [-86.89 to -67.11], p = 0.00014), and lipoprotein (a) (MD, -21.77%; 95% CI, [-24.29 to -19.24], p = 0.000018). Inclisiran also significantly increases HDL-C levels by a mean difference of +5.86% (MD, 95% CI, [+4.77 to +6.95], p = 0.0001). This meta-analysis demonstrates that Inclisiran significantly improves lipid profiles in hyperlipidemia, reducing LDL-C, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, PCSK9, and lipoprotein (a), while increasing HDL-C levels. Its innovative mechanism and twice-yearly dosing enhance efficacy, safety, and patient adherence.",

To examine associations of childhood PAH exposure with cardiometabolic risk indicators in childhood and adolescence along with differences by sex. Urinary PAH metabolites [Σ1,2,3-hydroxyphenanthrene (Σ1,2,3-OH Phe), 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OH Pyr), and Σ2,3-hydroxyfluorene (Σ2,3-OH Flu)] were measured in 9-year-olds from the MINIMat cohort in Bangladesh (n = 196), using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Cardiometabolic indicators [lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin resistance (HOMA2 IR), blood pressure, anthropometry, and a composite cardiometabolic risk score (CMRS)] were assessed at 9 and 15 years. Associations of PAH metabolites (log<sub>2</sub>-transformed) with cardiometabolic indicators were assessed using multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression models. In all children, urinary 1-OH Pyr (median: 1.6 ng/mL) was positively associated with body mass index z-score at 9 and 15 years, and with triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol/HDL ratios, waist circumference, CMRS, and CRP at 15 years. After sex stratification, consistent associations were mainly observed in girls, especially with outcomes at age 15, where both urinary 1-OH Pyr and Σ1,2,3-OH Phe concentrations were inversely associated with HDL, and positively associated with the cholesterol/HDL ratio and CMRS. Urinary 1-OH Pyr was also positively associated with girls' triglyceride/HDL ratio, HOMA2 IR, waist circumference, and CRP. Our associations of childhood PAH exposure with cardiometabolic indicators in childhood and adolescence differed by sex. In girls, increased adiposity, indications of altered lipid profile and metabolic function were detected while boys seemed incongruently affected.",

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021, we estimated age-standardized incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs for four major NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases from 2010 to 2021. Gender and age-specific estimations were conducted across all NCDs, with 95% uncertainty intervals and a decomposition analysis was employed to estimate change in death and DALYs attributable to NCDs. The burden of NCDs in South Asia increased by 3.00% in incidence from 2010 to 2021, while overall prevalence decreased by 1.00%, yet the age-standardized prevalence rate remains above the global rate (91,570 per 100,000 population). Incidences of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases declined by 3.00% and 13.00%, respectively, whereas diabetes and cancer rose by 21.00% and 13.00% in South Asia. Nepal faced the highest environmental impact (23.4% of DALYs), Bangladesh the greatest metabolic impact (25.62%), and India the highest from behavioural factors (23.95%). Population growth and aging were primary drivers of changes in deaths and DALYs across the region. This finding emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions addressing environmental, metabolic, and behavioral risks for NCDs in South Asia, alongside strategies to support healthy aging and effective disease management across diverse demographic groups.",

This study addresses this challenge by developing a novel metamaterial-based sensor for real-time monitoring of air bubbles in IV channels. The sensor employs a Single Negative Complementary Split Square Resonator (CSSR) coupled with a polymer-based microfluidic channel (PMC) to detect dielectric changes caused by air bubbles in flowing saline. Unlike traditional optical or ultrasonic methods, the proposed sensor offers a compact, cost-effective, and fabrication-friendly solution while maintaining high sensitivity of 78% and precision. Experimental validation demonstrated its capability to detect even small air bubbles, with resonant frequency shifts observed between 6.6 GHz and 6.9 GHz. This innovation provides a robust tool for enhancing patient safety by preventing air embolisms, with potential applications in broader biomedical sensing scenarios. By addressing a critical medical need through advanced metamaterial technology, this work contributes significantly to both healthcare monitoring and sensor design.",

        "title": "Efficacy and safety of dexamethasone versus intravitreal aflibercept implants for macular edema: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Macular edema (ME) is a prevalent complication of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) that contributes significantly to vision impairment worldwide. This condition is primarily driven by elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the use of anti-VEGF agents such as aflibercept and corticosteroids such as dexamethasone implants. However, evidence comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of these two modalities remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injections and dexamethasone implants in ME associated with DR and RVO. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024577212). A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was performed until August 30, 2024. Nine studies, involving 572 eyes, were included in the analysis. Key outcomes assessed included Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Central Retinal Thickness (CRT), and Intraocular Pressure (IOP). A random-effects model was applied to the pooled effect size calculations, and heterogeneity was addressed using sensitivity analyses. Both treatments showed comparable efficacy in improving BCVA and reducing CRT across follow-up intervals. At 3 months, dexamethasone implants demonstrated statistically significant superiority in BCVA improvement (MD = 1.18, 95% CI [0.89, 1.47], P < 0.001) and CRT reduction (MD =  - 62.45 µm, 95% CI [- 85.67, - 39.22], P < 0.001) compared to aflibercept. Similarly, at 12 months, dexamethasone implants maintained greater efficacy in CRT reduction (MD =  - 58.73 µm, 95% CI [- 78.12, - 39.34], P < 0.001). However, dexamethasone implants were associated with an increased IOP at 3 and 6 months (MD = 1.04 mmHg, 95% CI [0.56, 1.52], P < 0.001). No significant differences in IOP were observed between treatments at 12 months. Intravitreal aflibercept injections and dexamethasone implants are effective modalities for the management of ME, with each presenting distinct advantages. Dexamethasone implants minimize the frequency of treatment, while achieving superior outcomes in terms of BCVA and CRT. However, they are also associated with a heightened risk of IOP elevation and cataract formation. Conversely, aflibercept requires more frequent administration, which may result in logistical and financial challenges for patients and health care providers. Therefore, personalized treatment strategies should consider disease severity, comorbidities, and individual preferences. Future research should prioritize patient-centered outcomes, emphasizing quality of life and treatment costs while also investigating condition-specific responses to these therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, exacerbated by the protective mechanisms of biofilms formed by drug-resistant bacteria. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in biofilms serve as a formidable shield, impeding the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Here, we investigated the potential of vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) to disrupt biofilm formation in drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and studied the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of vitamin C on these bacteria. Out of 117 study isolates, primarily identified as Escherichia coli (n = 52), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 19), and Klebsiella spp. (n = 46), 80 isolates exhibited a Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance (MAR) index greater than 0.2, classifying them as multi-drug resistant (MDR) superbugs. Among these, 58 isolates demonstrated moderate to strong biofilm-forming abilities and were selected for further experiments with vitamin C. The effective concentration of vitamin C inhibiting the growth of most E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates (90%) was estimated at 1.25 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml respectively, while for allStaphylococcus spp. isolates, it was 0.325 mg/ml. Vitamin C exhibited a notable anti-biofilm effect against the studied isolates, with biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of 0.625, 1.25, and 0.16 mg/ml for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. isolates respectively. Furthermore, when combined with oxacillin or amoxicillin - drugs that were found ineffective, vitamin C significantly reduced the ability of MDR isolates to form biofilms, rendering them susceptible to the drugs' effects and restoring their efficacy. The expression of the recA gene, an early and quantifiable marker for the onset of the SOS response and biofilm production was downregulated after treatment of E. coli with vitamin C. Relative gene expression analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin-induced recA expression was significantly inhibited when MDR isolates of E. coli were treated with vitamin C at a concentration of 0.625 mg/ml, the BPC of vitamin C. Our findings reveal that vitamin C, alone or in combination with ineffective antibiotics, attenuates biofilm formation and restores the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates to antimicrobial agents. This study underscores the promise of vitamin C as a non-lethal disruptor of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance. Not applicable.",

Risk factors such as diabetes contribute to a worse prognosis if not treated with appropriate antibiotics during the course of management. This case report describes a diabetic melioidosis case with a rare presentation of venous thrombosis of the lower limb and a successful course of treatment. The patient was a 48-year-old Bangladeshi male who was admitted with gradually increasing left knee pain and intermittent high-grade fever for 7 days. On examination, he had a palpable spleen, high body temperature (102 °F), and pitting edema in the left lower limb during admission. He was treated with empiric meropenem on admission considering his serious illness. Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb revealed superficial venous thrombosis and thrombophlebitis involving the long saphenous vein and superficial veins of saphenous territory below the knee. The patient was enrolled as an eligible case in a research study called the Acute Febrile Illness study. Blood culture confirmed the diagnosis as melioidosis. Doxycycline was added to his treatment regimen when the research study team informed the treating physician at the hospital about the diagnosis of melioidosis. He was discharged with cotrimoxazole, which was advised to be taken for 3 months. This case report shows us the lack of diagnostics to detect melioidosis in hospital settings in Bangladesh. The successful treatment outcome proved the importance of routine surveillance for rare or unusual diseases, in addition to endemic pathogens. In addition, training is essential to improve knowledge and raise awareness among clinicians about the clinical diagnosis and management of melioidosis.",

This study explores the associations between education and ideal cardiovascular health score (CVHS), as well as seven CVH metrics. This cross-sectional study extracted data from the STEPwise approach to surveillance surveys in 36 LMICs between 2010 and 2020. We assessed CVHS using the sum score in seven metrics defined by American Heart Association: (1) ≥ 150 min/week of moderate, or 75 min/week of vigorous activity, or an equivalent combination; (2) BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for non-Asians (< 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for Asians); (3) fruit and vegetable intake ≥ 4.5 servings per day; (4) nonsmoking; (5) blood pressure < 120/80 mmHg (untreated); (6) total cholesterol < 200 mg/dL (untreated); and (7) fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dL (untreated). The ideal CVHS score ranged from 5 to 7. We disaggregated prevalence of ideal CVHS and seven metrics by education, and constructed Poisson regression models to adjust for other socioeconomic factors. Among 81,327 adult participants, the overall ideal CVHS prevalence for the studied countries was highest among individuals with primary education (52.9%, 95% CI: 51.0-54.9), surpassing those of other education levels - 48.0% (95% CI: 44.6-51.3, P = 0.003) for those with no education and 39.1% (95% CI: 36.5-41.8, P < 0.001) for those with tertiary education. Five (ideal physical activity, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose) in seven CVH metrics peaked among participants with primary or secondary education. For instance, the prevalence of ideal blood pressure among individuals with primary education was 34.4% (95% CI: 32.7-36.1), higher than the prevalence in other education levels, ranging from 28.6% to 32.3%. These patterns were concentrated in low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries, while in upper-middle-income countries, the prevalence of ideal CVHS increased with higher education levels, ranging from 15.4% for individuals with no education to 33.1% for those with tertiary education. In LMICs, the association between education and ideal CVHS, along with several CVH metrics, exhibited un inverted U-shape, which may be closely related to the different stages of epidemiologic transition.",

        "abstract": "A heart arrhythmia refers to a set of conditions characterized by irregular heart- beats, with an increasing mortality rate in recent years. Regular monitoring is essential for effective management, as early detection and timely treatment greatly improve survival outcomes. The electrocardiogram (ECG) remains the standard method for detecting arrhythmias, traditionally analyzed by cardiolo- gists and clinical experts. However, the incorporation of automated technology and computer-assisted systems offers substantial support in the accurate diagno- sis of heart arrhythmias. This research focused on developing a hybrid model with stack classifiers, which are state-of-the-art ensemble machine-learning techniques to accurately classify heart arrhythmias from ECG signals, eliminating the need for extensive human intervention. Other conventional machine-learning, bagging, and boosting ensemble algorithms were also explored along with the proposed stack classifiers. The classifiers were trained with a different number of features (50, 65, 80, 95) selected by feature engineering techniques (PCA, Chi-Square, RFE) from a dataset as the most important ones. As an outcome, the stack clas- sifier with XGBoost as the meta-classifier, trained with 65 important features determined by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, achieved the best performance among all the models. The proposed classifier achieved a perfor- mance of 99.58% accuracy, 99.57% precision, 99.58% recall, and 99.57% f1-score and can be promising for arrhythmia diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy in individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension, especially when undiagnosed, untreated, or uncontrolled, can result in severe consequences, including maternal and child mortality. Contraception is crucial for the management of pregnancy in individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension. However, the decision-making and experiences related to contraception use among this population in low- and middle-income countries are poorly understood. This study aims to explore the barriers to contraception use among sexually active men and women living with diabetes and/or hypertension. We conducted a qualitative study using the empirical phenomenological approach. We interviewed participants diagnosed with diabetes and/or hypertension, as well as stakeholders involved in providing care to individuals living with at least one of these two conditions and family planning service providers. Semi-structured interview guides were used, and data were collected through four focus group discussions, four in-depth interviews, and ten key informant interviews. All interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically. People living with diabetes and/or hypertension encounter misunderstandings and various barriers when it comes to using contraception. These experiences were categorised into four main themes and nine sub-themes. The themes identified were: (i) lack of awareness/inadequate knowledge and misunderstanding, (ii) social and religious beliefs, (iii) barriers to available and affordable contraceptives, and (iv) lack of coordination between facilities providing family planning services and treatment and management for diabetes and/or hypertension. Findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and considerations involved in contraceptive use-related decision-making among individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension. These findings can be used in policymaking and programme development to promote contraceptive use and improve the reproductive health outcomes of this population.",

Little is known about their effectiveness in improving hypertension outcomes. We conducted a narrative literature review to document features of select supply-side (pay-for-performance, capitation) and demand-side [conditional cash transfers (CCT), vouchers] financing interventions focused on improving hypertension outcomes in primary care settings. Our review confirmed the paucity of studies, especially from LMICs. Pay-for-performance and capitation had small effects on screening, prescription practices, and blood pressure (BP) control. CCTs had mixed effects on screening and modest effects on BP control. Information on causal pathways, unintended consequences, and the use of vouchers was sparse. We then developed a conceptual model identifying pathways through which financing interventions influence hypertension outcomes. Based on this model, simulations in the context of Bangladesh indicated that pay-for-performance demands substantial financial resources but could become more favorable with increased treatment coverage.",

        "abstract": "The global prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is increasing despite optimal management of traditional risk factors such as hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. This study examines the influence of cardiorenal risk factors, socioeconomic status, and ethnic and cardiovascular comorbidities on ESKD outcomes in the general population. This cross-sectional study analysed data from 502,408 UK Biobank study participants recruited between 2006 and 2010. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to assess risk factors for ESKD, with results presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 1191 (0.2%) of the study participants reported ESKD. Diabetes increased ESKD risk by 62% [1.62 (1.36-1.93)], with early-onset diabetes (before age 40) conferring higher odds compared to later-onset (after age 40) [2.26 (1.57-3.24)]. Similarly, early-onset hypertension (before age 40), compared to later onset (after age 40), increased ESKD odds by 73% [1.73 (1.21-2.44)]. Cardiovascular comorbidities, including stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction and angina, were strongly associated with ESKD [5.97 (3.99-8.72), 5.35 (4.38-6.56), 4.94 (3.56-6.78), and 4.89 (3.47-6.81)], respectively. Males were at 22% higher risk of ESKD than females [1.22 (1.04-1.43)]. Each additional year of diabetes duration increased ESKD odds by 2% [1.02 (1.01-1.03)]. Non-white ethnicity, compared to white and socioeconomically most deprived, compared to the least deprived quintiles, were at 70% and 83% higher odds of ESKD. Each unit of HbA1c rise increased the odds of ESKD by 2%. Compared to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria increased the odds of ESKD by almost 10-fold [9.47 (7.95-11.27)] while normoalbuminuria reduced the odds by 73% [0.27 (0.22-0.32)]. Early onset of diabetes and hypertension, male sex, non-white ethnicity, deprivation, poor glycaemic control, and prolonged hyperglycaemia are significant risk factors for ESKD. These findings highlight the complexity of ESKD and the need for multifactorial targeted interventions in high-risk populations. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical transcription factor involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. While STAT3 plays an essential role in homeostasis, its persistent activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly cancer, bone-related diseases, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions. The interleukin-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 signaling axis is central to STAT3 activation, influencing tumor microenvironment remodeling, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying dysregulated STAT3 signaling in disease progression remain incompletely understood, and no United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)-approved direct STAT3 inhibitors currently exist. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of STAT3's role in health and disease, emphasizing its involvement in cancer stem cell maintenance, metastasis, inflammation, and drug resistance. We systematically discuss therapeutic strategies, including JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), Src Homology 2 domain inhibitors (S3I-201, STATTIC), antisense oligonucleotides (AZD9150), and nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems, which enhance specificity and bioavailability while reducing toxicity. By integrating molecular mechanisms, disease pathology, and emerging therapeutic interventions, this review fills a critical knowledge gap in STAT3-targeted therapy. Our insights into STAT3 signaling crosstalk, epigenetic regulation, and resistance mechanisms offer a foundation for developing next-generation STAT3 inhibitors with greater clinical efficacy and translational potential.",

        "abstract": "Being women is an independent predictor of adverse events during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Whether newer anticoagulant bivalirudin is safe and effective in female acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing PCI, as compared with conventional heparin, is less well defined in Bangladeshi population. Our aim was to evaluate safety and efficacy of Bivalirudin in female ACS patients undergoing PCI. One hundred (100) female ACS patients were enrolled in this randomized controlled study, which underwent PCI from May to November, 2019 at BSMMU. Among them 35 patients were randomly assigned to receive bivalirudin and 65 patients were in control group to receive heparin with or without eptifibatide (GPI, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor). The outcome measures were incidence of 30-day hemorrhagic complications, stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCEs). Bivalirudin treatment was associated with significantly lower incidences of 30-day net adverse clinical events (NACEs) (5.7% vs. 27.6%, p=0.009) and bleeding (2.8% vs. 16.9%, p=0.03) compared with the control regimen. The incidence of MACCEs (2.8% vs. 15.4%, p=0.05) and stent thrombosis (0.0% vs. 3.1%, p=0.295) were comparable between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that bivalirudin (OR: 0.264, 95% CI: 0.071-0.977, p=0.04), trans-radial access (OR: 0.056, 95% CI: 0.003-0.967, p=0.04) and statin (OR: 0.009, 95% CI: 0.0005-0.168, p=0.001) were independent protective factors for 30-day NACEs. Bivalirudin is safe and effective in female ACS patients undergoing PCI as it reduces hemorrhagic complications without increase ischemic events (MACCEs) as compared with conventional heparin.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) following adult cardiac surgery procedures under Cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) is linked to a higher risk of morbidity and death. As a novel biomarker for renal failure, serum Cystatin C (CysC) is of prognostic value; however, a wide range of its predictive accuracy has been reported. The study aimed to evaluate whether early postoperative serum CysC measurement improves the prediction of AKI following adult cardiac surgery and determine the relationship between the measurement of early postoperative serum CysC level and post-operative early outcomes. In a single-center, prospective study of 70 patients was conducted at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), Dhaka, Bangladesh from July 2018 to December 2019 who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery. The study participants were chosen specifically because they had normal renal function and had had elective scheduled heart surgery under CPB. The blood samples were tested at six measurements time points (T1 preoperative, T2 at 6 hours after commencement of CPB, T3 at 12 hours after commencement of CPB, T4 at 24 hours after commencement of CPB, T5 at 36 hours after commencement of CPB and T6 at 48 hours after commencement of CPB). Serum cystatin C was significantly higher 12 hours after the commencement of CPB during operation (T3) and onwards when the earliest significant predictive AUCs were found (T3: AUC 0.983; p<0.0001; 95% CI, 0.960 to 1.000; T4-6: AUC 1.000; p<0.0001; 95% CI, 1.000). In summary, this study found that serum CysC is a useful early biomarker of AKI in adults following cardiac surgery, and the extent of this marker correlates with the severity of AKI.",

Cervical spondylosis (CS) patients presenting with typical chest pain may have underlying myocardial ischemia (MI) which often remain unexplored. This cross-sectional analytical study was carried out in the University Cardiac Centre (UCC), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from September 2017 to March 2018. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of inducible myocardial ischemia among the patients with cervical spondylosis and typical chest pain. A total of 54 adult CS patients presenting with typical chest pain was included. All of them underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography using standard protocol. Informed written consent was taken before inclusion. Ethical measures were taken in compliance with the declaration of Helsinki. The participants had a mean age ±SD of 44.87.6 years and a higher proportion of female (64.8%). Of all, 13(24.1%) patients had inducible myocardial ischemia on dobutamine stress echocardiography. ECG findings suggestive of MI were noted in 7 out of 13 patients (53.8%) with inducible myocardial ischemia and in 1 out of 41 patients (2.4%) without inducible myocardial ischemia. Out of 13 patients with myocardial ischemia 7(53.8%) had an abnormal ECG and out of 41 patients without inducible ischemia 1(2.4%) had abnormal ECG. Single vessel involvement was the predominant finding (92.3%) and respectively, 53.8% and 38.5% had involvement of left anterior descending and right coronary artery territory. The independent predictors of myocardial ischemia were age (Adjusted OR [AOR] 1.17, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.01 - 1.35), male sex (AOR 20.75, 95% CI 1.11 - 353.19) and diabetes mellitus (AOR 83.73, 95% 1.72 - 4067.56).

The prevalence of anomalous aorto ostial origin among 2000 study population was 0.5%. Among 10 patients, males were predominant 8(80.0%) with a mean age of 51.0±3.0 years. The coronary artery anomalies were more common in the right coronary artery (RCA) than the left coronary artery. Out of 10 patients, RCA arouse from the left coronary sinus (3) and the separate origin of left anterior descending and left circumflex artery (3) were equal. The next common anomaly was the left coronary artery arising from the right coronary sinus (2) followed by the left circumflex artery arising from the right coronary sinus (1) and double right coronary artery (1). Twenty percent (20.0%) of the patients were asymptomatic and diagnosed during coronary angiogram for other surgery. Thirty percent (30.0%) of the cases presented with chronic stable angina and 50.0% of the total cases presented with acute coronary syndrome. Anomalous origin of coronary arteries may present as an isolated defect or as a part of complex congenital heart disease. Presentation and prognosis varies widely from asymptomatic to sudden cardiac death according to the type of various anomalies. So, congenital coronary artery anomalies pattern should be sorted out for risk stratification and proper management.",

This study aims to investigate the association between obesity and waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and serum TSH levels in adult obese females age ranged 18-59 years in comparison to adult healthy non-obese female of same age. The goal is to identify strategies to mitigate obesity-related complications and advocate better health outcomes among them. This cross-sectional type of analytical study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2023 to June 2024. A total mumber of 200 female subjects age ranged from 18-59 years were included in this study. Among them one hundred (100) adult healthy non-obese females were taken as control group (Group I) and one hundred (100) adult obese female were taken as study group (Group II). The results were calculated and analyzed by using SPSS. Anthropometric measurements such as height (m), weight (kg), BMI (Kg/m²), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) were measured. Laboratory analysis of serum TSH was determined by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA method). In this study there was significantly increased mean waist circumference (102.08±5.12 cm) (p<0.01), waist to hip ratio (0.94±0.03) (p<0.01) and serum TSH (03.73±1.99μIU/ml) (p<0.01) in adult obese female than in adult healthy non-obese female. Changes in these parameters are linked to secondary conditions like HTN, type 2 DM, cardiovascular diseases and hypothyroidism etc., which significantly impact on mortality and morbidity rate. So, routine monitoring of serum TSH levels is recommended to prevent obesity related complications to promote a healthy life.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy and dryness of the eye are the most common complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. With the progression of diabetes mellitus, patients seldom report symptoms of ocular surface problems due to lack of correlation between symptoms and signs of dry eye. This study was designed to find out the proportion of dry eye among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy. This cross sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Ophthalmology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh, from February 2021 to September 2022. Total 224 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy were selected considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the patients underwent routine ophthalmic examinations like visual acuity, slit lamp examination and fundus examination by 90D volk lens (Condensing lens) and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Dry eye status was assessed by performing Tear film break up time test, Schirmer I and II tests. Color fundus photograph and HbA1c was performed in all the patients. This study examined 224 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also had diabetic retinopathy. Out of these, 100 patients were diagnosed with dry eye. Of these patients, 2.0% had mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 39.0% had moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 23.0% had severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and 36.0% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this study 44.6% of the patients had dry eyes among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy. Significant association was found between dry eye status and grading of diabetic retinopathy (p=0.001), gender of the patients (p=0.036), duration of diabetes mellitus (p=0.002) and HbA1c (p=0.001). No correlation was found between ages of the patients with dryness status.",

So, optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction, treatment of albuminuria, avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and adjustments to drug dosing. Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hypocalcemia, hyper-kalemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic acidosis, hyper-phosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyper-parathyroidism and anaemia. This cross-sectional study was executed in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2022 to June 2023. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. A sum of 120 subjects was included in this study. Out of them, 60 were selected as case of CKD patients and another 60 apparently normal healthy persons were selected as control. In this study, serum lipid profile was measured for analytical study. All the values were showed as mean±SD and these were serum TC were 149.85±38.84 in Group I and 178.92±41.85mg/dl in Group II; Serum TG were 122.77±36.88 in Group I and 175.93±63.50mg/dl in Group II; Serum LDL-C were 95.13±24.43 in Group I and 115.60±45.62 mg/dl in Group II and Serum HDL-C were 48.62±8.70 and 41.55±2.79mg/dl in Group I and Group II respectively.

        "abstract": "Obesity is a significant global health concern and WHO points out that 1 in 3 people globally are clinically obese. Obesity is a condition of having an excessive amount of body fat and is linked with several health disorders that include metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases as well as liver diseases. Serum albumin and bilirubin are some of the biochemical markers used to diagnose and treat various health-related conditions. Hence, the relationship between obesity and these serum markers has not been well established and can be described as complex. Although obesity affects the liver, it is important to examine the effect of obesity on serum albumin and bilirubin status compared to non-obese subjects. This study aims to assess serum albumin and bilirubin concentrations in obese and non-obese adults and to compare them with non-obese adults. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology and Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2023 to June 2024. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. A total of 200 participants took part in this study. Out of them, 100 were selected as case (obese adults) and another 100 non-obese adults were selected as control. In this study, serum albumin and bilirubin levels were measured for analytical study. All the values were expressed as mean±SD. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Windows package version 26.0. The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control was calculated using Student's unpaired 't' test. Pearson's correlation is used to determine the level of significance and to see the correlation of BMI with these parameters. After careful evaluation, the mean±SD values of serum albumin were 3.51±0.59 g/dl and 4.12±0.48 g/dl in case and control groups respectively and mean±SD values of serum bilirubin were 0.38±0.18 mg/dl and 0.57±0.16 mg/dl in case and control group respectively. This study revealed that mean serum albumin and bilirubin levels were significantly decreased in obese adults. There is a significant negative correlation found between BMI with serum albumin and bilirubin levels. Analyzing the findings of this cross-sectional study, significant alterations in serum albumin and bilirubin levels were observed among obese adults.",

        "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a primary contributor to tissue damage in multiple organs, including the heart and kidneys. In this study, we explored the protective roles of L-arginine in a mineralocorticoid-induced rat model of hypertension. To induce hypertension and subsequent organ damage, rats were nephrectomized unilaterally and fed with the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone acetate and dietary salt (FCA-Salt). These rats were treated with L-arginine for 28 days, and subsequent tests were performed. Biochemical analysis revealed the increased level of inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in the plasma, heart, and kidney of the FCA-salt-treated rats. L-arginine treatment decreased the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) by 18 %, 22 %, and 18 % in the heart, kidney, and plasma, respectively. L-arginine also attenuated the advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased by 62 %, 45 %, and 16 % in the heart, kidney, and plasma, respectively, in the L-arginine-treated animals compared to the FCA-Salt group. Significant augmentation was also revealed for the nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH). The plasma levels of the kidney function biomarkers uric acid and creatinine were significantly improved after L-arginine treatment. Furthermore, L-arginine remarkably reduced the elevated plasma cytokines IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 in FCA-salt-induced hypertensive rats. Histopathological data showed a reduction in fibrosis and tissue damage by L-arginine in the FCA-salt-treated group. We propose that L-arginine could be an effective agent in preventing cardiac and renal dysfunction in hypertensive rats.",

        "title": "Optimizing stability of heart disease prediction across imbalanced learning with interpretable Grow Network.",
        "abstract": "Heart disease prediction models often face stability challenges when applied to public datasets due to significant class imbalances, unlike the more balanced benchmark datasets. These imbalances can adversely affect various stages of prediction, including feature selection, sampling, and modeling, leading to skewed performance, with one class often being favored over another. To enhance stability, this study proposes a Grow Network (GrowNet) architecture, which dynamically configures itself based on the data's characteristics. To enhance GrowNet's stability, this study proposes the use of TriDyn Dependence feature selection and Adaptive Refinement sampling, which ensure the selection of relevant features across imbalanced data and effectively manage class imbalance during training. When evaluated on the benchmark UCI heart disease dataset, GrowNet has outperformed other models, achieving a specificity of 92%, sensitivity of 88%, precision of 90%, and F1 score of 90%. Further evaluation on three public datasets from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), where heart disease cases constitute only about 6% of the data, has demonstrated GrowNet's ability to maintain balanced performance, with an average specificity, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC of 77.67%, 81.67%, and 89.67%, respectively, while other models have exhibited instability. This represents a 22.8% improvement in handling class imbalance compared to prior studies. Additional tests on two public datasets from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) have confirmed GrowNet's robustness and generalizability, with an average specificity, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC of 80.5%, 82.5%, and 90%, respectively, while other models have continued to demonstrate instability. To enhance transparency, this study incorporates SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, enabling healthcare professionals to understand the decision-making process and identify key risk factors for heart disease, such as bronchitis in midlife, renal dysfunction in the elderly, and depressive disorders in individuals aged 35-44. This study presents a robust, interpretable model to assist healthcare professionals in cost-effective, early heart disease detection by focusing on key risk factors, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension among adolescents in Asia is an emerging public health concern that is directly associated with early onset cardiovascular risks. As such, it can also lead to further health issues and challenges for health care in the future. As existing studies have predominantly focussed on adult populations, we sought to provide targeted insights into adolescent hypertension across Asia, elucidating the impact of rapid lifestyle and environmental changes on this younger population. Therefore, in this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and trends of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension among adolescents aged 10-19 years across Asia, address gaps in region-specific data, and determine any demographic risk factors. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus for cross-sectional studies on adolescent hypertension/elevated BP in Asia published from January 2019 to June 2024, after which we narratively synthesised their findings. Of the 2634 retrieved studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, covering over 200 000 adolescents in Asia. The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 0.7% in urban Bangladesh to 24.5% in urban Malaysia, with urban areas generally showing higher rates than rural areas (e.g. India: 8.4% urban vs. 5.7% rural). By region, East Asia has the highest overall prevalence (14.25%), followed by West Asia (14.14%), South Asia (13.77%), Southeast Asia (13.16%), and Central Asia (12.37%). Males had higher prevalence rates (for example, 22.3% in Chinese males vs. 20% in females). The increasing prevalence of adolescent hypertension in urban Asia is a significant public health concern. Although extensive research has been conducted in East and South Asia, there is a dearth of studies in Western, Southeast, and Central Asia, emphasising a need for future research. Standardised diagnostic criteria and targeted interventions are crucial for addressing regional disparities and reducing long-term cardiovascular risks.",

        "abstract": "The high prevalence of hypertension in coastal regions poses a significant public health challenge due to factors such as high salt intake, air pollution, poor diets, limited healthcare access, and increased stress levels. However, disparities in diagnosed hypertension between coastal and non-coastal areas in Bangladesh remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate and address the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension among adults in both regions. In 2020-2021, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to assess hypertension prevalence in coastal and non-coastal regions. The study included 3917 adults from six districts, including non-coastal and coastal regions. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were determined using a modified Poisson regression model, to quantify the relationship between hypertension prevalence in the two regions. The study finds that 438 (11.2%) of the 3917 respondents [446 females [11.7%]; mean age 44.73 years] had been diagnosed with hypertension. Notably, adults residing in coastal areas had a higher prevalence of hypertension (13.4%, 95% confidence interval: 11.8%-15.0%) than their non-coastal counterparts (9.5%, 95% CI: 8.3%-10.7%). In coastal areas, the prevalence ranged from 7.8% in the 18-24 age group to 16.4% in the 55 + age group. In non-coastal areas, the prevalence ranged from 2.9% in the 18-24 age group to 15.8% in the 55 + age group. The results of the multivariable analysis revealed that adults from coastal areas were 29% more likely to have hypertension than those in non-coastal areas (aPR:1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.56). Moreover, age, physical activity, occupation, and body mass index (BMI) were identified as factors associated with the development of hypertension within these regions. Hypertension is a major health issue across Bangladesh, with coastal regions facing added challenges from high salinity in drinking water. While both coastal and non-coastal areas experience high rates of undiagnosed hypertension, environmental factors unique to coastal areas may intensify the issue. Targeted interventions that account for environmental and socioeconomic factors are essential to addressing this growing health concern in both regions.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization recommends fixed-dose combination (FDC) pills for treating hypertension. Antihypertensive FDC pills often contain a renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RASI) or diuretic. Thus, screening and monitoring for dyskalemia (hypokalemia or hyperkalemia) before and after starting these classes of medications are recommended, a significant barrier for implementation in resource-limited settings. However, the need for blood tests may be overemphasized if the prevalence of dyskalemia in patients with hypertension is uncommon and the incidence of dyskalemia is rare after initiation of FDC. We conducted a community-based blood pressure (BP) screening program in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and determined the prevalence of dyskalemia, as defined by K < 3.0 or K > 5.5 mmol/L, in untreated adults with SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg. Among those with a baseline serum K of ≥3.0 or ≤5.0 mmol/L and creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min, we determined the incidence of dyskalemia 2 months after initiation of a daily FDC of telmisartan 40 mg and amlodipine 5 mg. Secondary outcomes were BP change, medication adherence, and symptoms. In 2022-2023, we recruited 1,073 adults with SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg. The mean age was 54 years, with 71% men and mean baseline BP 157/94 (SD 12/9.3) mmHg. The prevalence of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia was 1.6% and 0.2%, respectively. FDC was initiated in 1,017 eligible patients, and 864 completed the 2-month follow-up visit. Incident hypokalemia occurred in 1.5% of patients, but there was no case of incident hyperkalemia. The mean change in serum potassium after initiating FDC was -0.05 (0.53) mmol/L. At follow-up, 92% had BP <140/90 mmHg with a mean SBP change of -29.8 mmHg. 1% self-reported mild symptoms (e.g., leg swelling), and there was one death of undetermined cause. Given low prevalence and incidence of hyperkalemia and evident reduction in BP, our study suggests initiating FDC with telmisartan and amlodipine may be a practical and safe option for newly diagnosed hypertension, especially in resource-constrained settings where blood tests cannot be easily obtained.",

        "abstract": "The green pit viper (Trimeresurus gramineus) is a venomous snake commonly encountered in South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, and responsible for many snakebite incidents. Management of its envenoming is challenging due to the lack of a specific antivenom, requiring symptomatic and supportive care to address complications. The following case report represents the complexities in managing such envenomation with associated renal and venous thrombotic complications. A 35-year-old female was admitted with left lower-limb swelling and ecchymosis following a snakebite. She was transferred from a primary-level hospital with acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 4.0 mg/dL) and venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC) (high levels of d-dimer (15 mg/L), prothrombin time (28 seconds) and activated partial thromboplastin time (>120 sec). Duplex ultrasound confirmed presence of femoral vein thrombosis. The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma along with other supportive measures. His renal function improved, with creatinine levels normalizing in days. The management of green pit viper envenomation requires close monitoring of coagulation parameters and renal function, along with supportive care. The occurrence of unusual complications, such as deep vein thrombosis, necessitates a conservative and individualized approach to treatment. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and improve the therapeutic strategies for managing the sequelae of such envenomations.",

        "title": "Dietary Phytochemicals in Health and Disease: Mechanisms, Clinical Evidence, and Applications-A Comprehensive Review.",
        "abstract": "Phytochemicals are bioactive compounds found in plants that play a key role in promoting health and preventing diseases. Present in fruits, vegetables, grains, and seed oils, these compounds are considered safe for consumption due to the co-evolution and adaptation between mammals and plants. Due to their wide-ranging biological effects, they have attracted considerable research interest. This comprehensive review explores the mechanisms of action, health benefits, and applications of dietary phytochemicals, with a particular focus on key groups such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids. Research shows that dietary phytochemicals interact with nuclear and membrane receptors, influence metabolic pathways, and affect epigenetic modifications. Our review highlights the broad range of biological activities of these compounds, including antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anticancer effects, all of which contribute to their health-promoting properties. Clinical evidence supports their role in the prevention and management of diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, metabolic conditions, and cancer, with diets rich in phytochemicals being linked to a lower risk of disease. Phytochemicals are also at the cutting edge of applications in food preservation, dietary supplements, and emerging medical treatments. Additionally, we identified advancements in extraction and identification techniques, particularly in metabolomics, which further enhance their applications in these areas. Despite their promising benefits, challenges such as bioavailability, regulatory barriers, and the need for robust clinical trials persist. However, innovative delivery systems like nanoparticles, liposomes, and encapsulation offer potential solutions to enhance bioavailability by improving absorption and stability. The review concludes by emphasizing the potential of personalized nutrition and combination therapies to enhance the health benefits of dietary phytochemicals while stressing the need for advancements in extraction methods, clinical trials, and bioavailability.",

        "title": "Solid Lipid Nanoparticles for the Management of Hypertension: Advancements and Challenges.",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a global health challenge, with hypertension emerging as a leading risk factor. Hypertension, characterized by elevated arterial blood pressure (BP), significantly increases the risk of stroke and other CVDs. Despite advancements in antihypertensive medication, the effectiveness of hypertension treatment is often hindered by poor bioavailability and limited drug efficacy. In this quest, nanoparticles (NPs) offer a promising avenue for addressing the limitations associated with conventional antihypertensive drugs in hypertension treatment. Among several NPs, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as a potential candidate, presenting a multifaceted approach to revolutionize drug delivery within this domain. SLNs, characterized by a lipophilic matrix and stabilized by surfactants, offer scalability and compatibility with biological systems compared to several polymer-based nanosystems. By encapsulating antihypertensive drugs, SLNs enhance drug solubility and bioavailability and provide sustained release, thereby improving treatment efficacy. In this context, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of hypertension and the role of SLNs in drug delivery. Various preparation techniques of SLNs are discussed, highlighting their versatility and potential in pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, the role of SLNs in the management of hypertension is thoroughly examined, with a focus on enhancing the physicochemical properties of antihypertensive drugs. Overall, SLNs represent a promising strategy for optimizing hypertension treatment by addressing the limitations of conventional drug delivery systems. By enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and efficacy, SLNs offer new possibilities for improving patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to contribute to the ongoing research and development of innovative therapies for hypertension management.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), specifically diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), among adults in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income country. Given the rising prevalence of DM and HTN and their significant public health burden, this research aims to identify key socioeconomic, demographic and lifestyle-related determinants to inform targeted interventions. The study used nationally representative cross-sectional data extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2017-2018. Bangladesh. The study included 8013 women and 6691 men aged 18 and older who were eligible for blood pressure and blood glucose measurements. Type 2 DM, HTN. HTN was significantly associated with higher odds of diabetes (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.28, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.43), while diabetes was associated with increased odds of HTN (AOR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.39). Individuals aged 40 years and older had 74.8% higher odds of diabetes (AOR=1.748, 95% CI: 1.58 to 1.993) and were 3.21 times more likely to have HTN (AOR=4.208, 95% CI: 3.781 to 4.685). Overweight individuals had 2.15 times higher odds of HTN compared with those with normal weight (AOR=2.154, 95% CI: 1.98 to 2.34). Wealthier individuals also showed significantly higher odds of both DM and HTN. This study highlights the strong association between DM and HTN and identifies age, overweight status and higher socioeconomic class as key risk factors. These findings underscore the need for integrated public health strategies targeting NCD prevention and management in Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension prevalence is rising among individuals with abdominal obesity in Southeast Asia, including India, but the relationship between abdominal obesity, body mass index (BMI), and hypertension remains underexplored. This study examines the association between these factors in a nationally representative Indian population aged 20-54 years (males: N = 78 832; females: N = 559 059). We analyzed data from the National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5). Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or use of blood pressure-lowering medication. Abdominal obesity was defined by waist-hip ratio (>0.90 for men, >0.85 for women). BMI categories were underweight (<18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal (18.5-<25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25.0-<30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and obese (≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors was used to assess the link between BMI, abdominal obesity, and hypertension. Individuals with both obesity and abdominal obesity had significantly higher odds of hypertension, with males having 3.3 times (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-3.7) and females 2.8 times (95% CI: 2.6-2.9) odds compared to those with normal BMI and no abdominal obesity. Both genders showed increased SBP and DBP by 3.0-5.0 mm Hg when abdominal obesity was present, regardless of BMI. Indian health programs should emphasize the risks of high BMI and abdominal obesity to reduce hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale randomized trials have established the efficacy and safety of statin therapy in preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among individuals at increased risk (i.e., primary prevention) or those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (i.e., secondary prevention). Consequently, recent international guidelines, including those from the WHO and ACC/AHA, have expanded the eligibility criteria for statin therapy. To assess the current burden of statin-eligible populations in Bangladesh, evaluate the current state of statin use, and identify factors associated with non-use of statins. We analysed data from 3,140 adults aged 40 to 69 years from the nationally representative WHO-STEPS Bangladesh 2018 survey. Statin therapy eligibility for primary prevention was assessed using the WHO-2019 and the ACC/AHA-2018 guidelines separately. Individuals with a previous history of CVD were eligible for secondary prevention under both guidelines. Modified Poisson regression models identified factors associated with statin use. All analyses were conducted using appropriate survey weights. Among the participants, 443 (14.1%) reported a previous history of CVD. Of those without CVD, 11.2% (95% CI: 9.7-12.9) and 32.3% (95% CI: 30.0-34.6) were eligible for statin use for primary prevention according to the WHO-2019 and the ACC/AHA-2018 guidelines, respectively. Among adults eligible according to WHO-2019 guideline, 6.9% (95% CI: 4.1-11.5) were using statins, while among those eligible according to ACC/AHA-2018 guideline, 3.3% (95% CI: 2.1-5.1) were using statins. For secondary prevention, 23.5% (95% CI: 16.9-31.6) of adults with prior CVD were using statins. Non-use was higher among younger adults, those without regular health visits or cholesterol measurements, and those from the Mymensingh or Rajshahi divisions. In Bangladesh, approximately one in twenty eligible individuals uses statins for primary prevention of CVD, and one in five individuals for secondary prevention. Appropriate population health interventions are needed to scale up statin use to mitigate the burden of CVD.",

        "abstract": "Maternal hypertensive disorders (HDP) remain a major contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in South Asia, where healthcare disparities persist. This study aims to analyze trends in maternal hypertensive disorders across South Asia from 1990 to 2021, leveraging data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and provide actionable recommendations. We conducted a retrospective analysis using GBD 2021 data for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Health trends such as prevalence, incidence, and maternal mortality ratios (MMR) were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Join point regression. This approach allowed us to identify significant changes and trends over the studied period. The study revealed significant declines in the prevalence and MMR associated with maternal hypertensive disorders across the region. Notable reductions were observed in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal, while Pakistan showed minimal improvement, indicating ongoing healthcare challenges. The analysis underscores substantial regional disparities, particularly in Pakistan, which reported higher prevalence rates and MMR across all age groups. The findings suggest that targeted healthcare interventions can effectively reduce the burden of maternal hypertensive disorders in South Asia. However, persistent disparities in Pakistan highlight the need for region-specific strategies to address gaps in healthcare access and quality. Strengthening healthcare policies and improving intervention coverage could further mitigate the burden of HDP in South Asia.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "abstract": "Undiagnosed hypertension (UHTN) remains a significant public health concern in Bangladesh, leading to severe complications due to delayed diagnosis and management. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the prevalence of UHTN among adults aged 18 years and older, using data from studies conducted in Bangladesh and published between 2010 and 2024. A comprehensive search of major databases yielded 1028 records, from which nine relevant studies, encompassing a total of 28949 participants, were selected and evaluated for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, providing valuable insights into the prevalence of UHTN within the Bangladeshi population. The pooled prevalence of UHTN was 11% (95% CI: 6%-19%) based on a random-effects model, with substantial heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 99.5%, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses revealed higher prevalence in rural areas (13%; 95% CI: 4%-35%) compared to urban areas (12%; 95% CI: 1%-54%) and elevated occupational risk among bankers (17%; 95% CI: 0%-94%). While funnel plot asymmetry was noted, Egger's test (p = 0.3113) indicated no significant publication bias. Sensitivity analyses, including Leave-One-Out Analysis, affirmed the robustness of the pooled estimate. The findings underscore notable geographic, occupational, and sociodemographic disparities in UHTN prevalence, highlighting the need for nationwide screening programs and targeted community awareness campaigns, particularly in underserved rural areas. Further research is imperative to explore causal factors and inform effective prevention and management strategies.",

        "title": "Chronic activation of β-adrenergic receptors leads to tissue water and electrolyte retention.",
        "abstract": "β-Adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) are expressed on the membranes of various cell types, and their activation affects body water balance by modulating renal sodium and water excretion, cardiovascular function, and metabolic processes. However, β-AR-associated body fluid imbalance has not been well characterized. In the present study, we hypothesized that chronic β-AR stimulation increases electrolyte and water content at the tissue level. We evaluated the effects of isoproterenol, a nonselective β-AR agonist, on electrolyte and water balance at the tissue level. Continuous isoproterenol administration for 14 days induced cardiac hypertrophy, associated with sodium-driven water retention in the heart; increased the total body sodium, potassium, and water contents at the tissue level; and increased the water intake and blood pressure of mice. There was greater urine output in response to the isoproterenol-induced body water retention. These isoproterenol-induced changes were reduced by propranolol, a nonselective β receptor inhibitor. Isoproterenol-treated mice, even without excessive water intake, had higher total body electrolyte and water contents, and this tissue water retention was associated with lower dry body mass, suggesting that β-AR stimulation in the absence of excess water intake induces catabolism and water retention. These findings suggest that β-AR activation induces tissue sodium and potassium retention, leading to body fluid retention, with or without excess water intake. This characterization of β-AR-induced electrolyte and fluid abnormalities improves our understanding of the pharmacological effects of β-AR inhibitors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study has shown that chronic β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation causes cardiac hypertrophy associated with sodium-driven water retention in the heart and increases the accumulation of body sodium, potassium, and water at the tissue level. This characterization of the β-AR-induced abnormalities in electrolyte and water balance at the tissue level improves our understanding of the roles of β-AR in physiology and pathophysiology and the pharmacological effects of β-AR inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Assessing the prevalence of hypertension and associated determinants in riverine island populations is crucial due to their unique socio-environmental characteristics and restricted healthcare access, which increase sensitivity to hypertension-related problems and should lead targeted interventions. So, this study investigates the concerning issue of hypertension, focusing on its prevalence and influential factors among adults in Sirajganj's Riverine Island. By employing a cross-sectional approach, the research utilized a structured questionnaire. A total of 309 people took part in this study via face-to-face interviews by following convenience sampling technique. The investigators performed frequency analysis for getting prevalence of HTN and other variable's percentage and binary logistic regression analysis for getting associated determinants. Analysis was conducted by using a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25. The prevalence of hypertension was 41% among all individuals. People who were illiterate were 1.23 times more hypertensive. Some key risk factors were discovered, including smoking (<i>p</i> = 0.04), adding salt to meals (<i>p</i> < 0.001), eating fatty or fat-type foods (<i>p</i> < 0.001), sleeping late (<i>p</i> < 0.001), worrying about their lifestyle and future (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and not exercising (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Males were 1.43 times more hypertensive (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-2.0, <i>p</i> = 0.002) than females. Smokers were 4.21 times more hypertensive (AOR = 4.21, 95% CI: 1.12-17.13, <i>p</i> = 0.04) than nonsmokers. Consumers oil/fat with food were 2.18 times more hypertensive (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.78-2.54, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than others. Respondents who were worried about their lifestyle and future were 3.38 times more hypertensive (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.27-6.01, <i>p</i> = 0.001) than others. People should consume a healthy diet and refrain from smoking. Regular physical activity and going to bed early are recommended. Medical camps and workshops should be held on riverine islands to promote a healthy lifestyle and prevent hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, infections, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders continue to have a major global impact on mortality and morbidity. Medicinal plants have been used since ancient times in ethnomedicine (e.g., Ayurveda, Unani, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and European Traditional Medicine) for the treatment of a wide range of disorders. Plants are a rich source of diverse phytoconstituents with antidiabetic, anticancer, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antioxidant, antihyperlipidemic, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and/or anti-inflammatory activities. This review focuses on the 35 plants most commonly reported for the treatment of these major disorders, with a particular emphasis on their traditional uses, phytoconstituent contents, pharmacological properties, and modes of action. Active phytomolecules with therapeutic potential include cucurbitane triterpenoids, diosgenin, and limonoids (azadiradione and gedunin), which exhibit antidiabetic properties, with cucurbitane triterpenoids specifically activating Glucose Transporter Type 4 (GLUT4) translocation. Capsaicin and curcumin demonstrate anticancer activity by deactivating NF-κB and arresting the cell cycle in the G2 phase. Antimicrobial activities have been observed for piperine, reserpine, berberine, dictamnine, chelerythrine, and allitridin, with the latter two triggering bacterial cell lysis. Quercetin, catechin, and genistein exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, with genistein specifically suppressing CD8+ cytotoxic T cell function. Ginsenoside Rg1 and ginsenoside Rg3 demonstrate potential for treating cardiovascular diseases, with ginsenoside Rg1 activating PPARα promoter, and the PI3K/Akt pathway. In contrast, ternatin, tannins, and quercitrin exhibit potential in gastrointestinal disorders, with quercitrin regulating arachidonic acid metabolism by suppressing cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase activity. Further studies are warranted to fully investigate the clinical therapeutic benefits of these plants and their phytoconstituents, as well as to elucidate their underlying molecular mechanisms of action.",

This study aimed to consolidate its findings based on updated database reports. Findings suggest that LUP and some of its derivatives have promising biological roles, including anticancer effects. Notably, LUP induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in cancer cells while sparing normal cells, highlighting its selective cytotoxicity. By modifying pathways such as NF-κB and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, LUP demonstrates anticancer activity, reducing LDL oxidation by 34.4% and causing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis while leaving healthy cells unaffected. Moreover, it has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; thus, it may act against conditions like arthritis, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases. It has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities and can be used as an alternative to conventional antibiotics. LUP and its nanoformulations (PEGylated liposomes) improved biopharmaceutical profiles in test systems. It also showed neuroprotective effects, particularly against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Taken together, LUP has multi-target therapeutic approaches against various diseases and pathological conditions, advocating for its inclusion in future clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) requires precise and efficient diagnostic tools. The manual analysis of Electrocardiograms (ECGs) is labor-intensive, necessitating the development of automated methods to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This research aimed to develop an automated ECG classification using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), and transform 1D ECG signals into 2D spectrograms using CWT and train a DCNN to accurately detect abnormalities associated with CVD. The DCNN is trained on datasets from PhysioNet and the MIT-BIH and the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. The integrated CWT and DCNN enable simultaneous classification of multiple ECG abnormalities alongside normal signals. This analytical observational research employed CWT to generate spectrograms from 1D ECG signals, as input to a DCNN trained on diverse datasets. The model is evaluated using performance metrics, such as precision, specificity, recall, overall accuracy, and F1-score. The proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable performance metrics with a precision of 100% for normal signals, an average specificity of 100%, an average recall of 97.65%, an average overall accuracy of 98.67%, and an average F1-score of 98.81%. This model achieves an approximate average overall accuracy of 98.67%, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting CVD. The integration of CWT and DCNN in ECG classification improves accuracy and classification capabilities, addressing the challenges with manual analysis. This algorithm can reduce misdiagnoses in primary care and enhance efficiency in larger medical institutions. By contributing to automated diagnostic tools for cardiovascular disorders, it can significantly improve healthcare practices in the field of CVD detection.",

This study compared the clinical outcomes in CAD patients inheriting CYP2C19 LoF alleles undergoing PCI and treated with clopidogrel against alternative antagonists of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor. A thorough literature search was performed across multiple scientific databases following the PRISMA guidelines and PICO model. Setting the statistical significance at p < 0.05 and RevMan software was used to calculate the risk ratios (RRs). Estimation of the pooled analysis revealed a significant 62% increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in CAD patients inheriting CYP2C19 LoF alleles and treated with clopidogrel against those treated with alternative P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonists such as prasugrel or ticagrelor (RR 1.62; 95% CI 1.42-1.86; p < 0.00001). In addition, Asian CAD patients were found at a significantly higher risk of MACE (RR 1.93; 95% CI: 1.49-2.49; p < 0.00001) juxtaposed to CAD patients of other ethnicities (RR 1.51; 95% CI: 1.29-1.78; p < 0.00001). Conversely, between these two treatment groups, taking clopidogrel against prasugrel/ticagrelor, who possess CYP2C19 LoF alleles, no significant differences in bleeding events were observed (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.79-1.11; p = 0.47).

        "abstract": "Arsenic exposure is associated with obesity- or excess adiposity-related disorders, including cardiometabolic diseases. Previously, many human studies attempted to establish the association of arsenic exposure with obesity, mainly through body mass index (BMI) but failed to provide any concrete evidence. Our study aimed to investigate the arsenic-related adiposity and its relationship with cardiometabolic diseases. Of the 524 participants, 126 and 398, respectively, were chosen from low- and high-arsenic exposure areas in Bangladesh. Obesity or body fat (adiposity) of the participants was measured by anthropometric measures [BMI, waist circumference (WC), and triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT)] and a serum biomarker, leptin. Sarcopenic characteristics were assessed by lean body mass (LBM) and serum creatinine levels. Insulin resistance, as measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), hypertension, and hyperglycemia, were considered as the risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. There were significant positive associations between drinking water, hair, and nail arsenic concentrations and the levels of WC and TSFT after adjusting for potential confounders. However, there were no significant associations with BMI. Increased arsenic exposure levels were associated with increased leptin levels [(Regression coefficient (β) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53, 1.46) for water, (β = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.42, 2.46) for hair, and (β = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.32, 2.61) for nail arsenic]. Notably, leptin levels had inverse associations with LBM (β = -7.87, 95% CI: -13.30, -2.45) and creatinine levels (β = -15.65, 95% CI: -21.50, -9.81). Furthermore, the elevated leptin levels associated with arsenic exposure were connected to higher HOMA-IR levels (β = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.24), higher odds of hypertension [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.53], and hyperglycemia (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.47). Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated a unique association between arsenic exposure and adiposity, which could promote arsenic-induced cardiometabolic disorders by mirroring the distinctive characteristics of age-associated sarcopenic obesity.",

Assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among hypertensive patients in Bangladesh can highlight the broad impacts of the condition on morbidity and mortality. Such insights are essential for developing targeted healthcare and prevention strategies to reduce complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. In this cross-sectional study, 5,086 hypertensive patients aged between 18 and 80 were recruited from 75 pharmacies in Bangladesh. We assessed the participants' health using the EQ-5D-5 L descriptive system and the EQ-VAS. Utility scores were calculated using the Indian EQ-5D-5 L value set. Regression models were employed to identify factors associated with overall HRQoL and individual health dimensions. Study participants were mean aged 52 years old, with average systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 140.79 mmHg and 85.98 mmHg, respectively. The average EQ-index and EQ-VAS score were 0.83 and 67.47, respectively. 39% reported difficulties with self-care, 43.5% had mobility problems, 80.6% had pain, and 61.2% had anxiety. HRQoL scores decreased significantly with age, according to the multilevel model. Higher education levels, however, were associated with better HRQoL scores. Male respondents reported fewer problems with mobility, self-care, activity, pain, and anxiety. A decrease in HRQoL scores was observed among older individuals, those without formal education, those in lower quintiles, those unemployed, and those with poor blood pressure control, obesity, or fasting glucose.

This study across 17 high-, middle- and low-income countries described variations in secondary CVD prevention medication use over a median follow-up of 12 years. In the multinational PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) cohort study, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis to examine temporal variations in the use of secondary prevention medications in participants with CVD. In participants with coronary artery disease, we focused on antiplatelet agents, statins, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, and β-blockers. In participants with stroke, we focused on antiplatelet agents, statins, RAS inhibitors, and other blood pressure-lowering drugs. Medications were collected at baseline and on 4 subsequent follow-up visits. The analysis included 7,409 participants with a diagnosis of CVD at the baseline visit, 8,792 at the second visit, 9,236 at the third visit, 11,082 at the fourth visit, and 11,677 at the last visit. The median age at baseline was 58.0 years, and 52.9% of the participants were female. The median follow-up was 12 years, with the median year of the baseline visit in 2007 and the fifth visit in 2019. Over this period, use of 1 or more classes of medications for secondary CVD prevention was 41.3% (95% CI: 40.2%-42.4%) at baseline, peaked at 43.1% (95% CI: 42.0%-44.1%), and then decreased to 31.3% (95% CI: 30.4%-32.1%) by the last study visit. In high-income countries, this use decreased from 88.8% (95% CI: 86.6%-91.0%) to 77.3% (95% CI: 74.9%-79.6%). In upper-middle-income countries, this use increased from 55.0% (95% CI: 52.8%-57.3%) to 61.1% (95% CI: 59.1%-63.1%). In lower-middle-income countries, use of at least 1 class of medications was 29.5% (95% CI: 28.1%-30.9%) at baseline, peaked at 31.7% (95% CI: 30.4%-33.1%), and then decreased to 13.4% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.2%) by the last visit. In low-income countries, use of at least 1 class of medications was 20.8% (95% CI: 18.1%-23.5%) at baseline, peaked at 47.3% (95% CI: 44.8%-49.9%), and then decreased to 27.5% (95% CI: 25.2%-29.9%) by the last study visit. Globally and in most country income-level groups, the use of medications for secondary CVD prevention has been low, with little improvement over time.",

        "title": "Rheumatoid-like hand deformities and aortic valve disease in a 13-year-old girl with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: a case report.",
        "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and an increased risk of atherosclerotic heart disease. Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia at an early age is crucial owing to its potential to lead to severe cardiovascular complications, including coronary heart disease and aortic valve disease. Early detection allows timely intervention, such as lifestyle modifications and pharmacological treatments, which can significantly reduce these risks. In this case report, we present a case of familial hypercholesterolemia in a 13-year-old Bangladeshi girl residing in Faridpur, Bangladesh. The patient presented with a distinctive clinical profile, including the presence of tendon xanthoma in the hands and cutaneous xanthoma in the elbow, knee, and buttocks, as well as recent development of aortic valvular diseases. In addition, she experienced joint deformity in both hands, mimicking rheumatoid arthritis, which is uncommon. The patient was diagnosed and underwent treatment through both lifestyle changes and medication. Moreover, her family received genetic counseling, and she was scheduled for regular follow-up. This case underscores the significance of identifying important physical signs in the diagnosis and management of familial hypercholesterolemia, particularly in settings where genetic testing may be limited. Moreover, the unique coexistence of familial hypercholesterolemia with hand joint deformity and aortic valvular heart disease serves as a clinical clue that can facilitate diagnosis and appropriate therapeutic interventions. A high index of suspicion is essential for timely diagnosis and tailored management, thus reducing the burden of atherosclerotic heart disease in affected individuals.",

        "title": "The Role of Pomegranate (<i>Punica granatum</i>) in Cancer Prevention and Treatment: Modulating Signaling Pathways From Inflammation to Metastasis.",
        "abstract": "<i>Punica granatum</i>, commonly known as pomegranate, is a traditional medicinal agent owing to its antiquity. The scientific literature has shown that pomegranate extracts exhibit favorable modulation of diverse signaling pathways. These pathways encompass those implicated in inflammation, angiogenesis, hyperproliferation, cellular transformation, tumorigenesis initiation, and ultimately, a reduction in advanced metastasis and tumorigenesis. Pomegranate extracts in this context can be attributed to their high polyphenol content, which has been observed to possess inhibitory properties toward specific signaling pathways associated with cancer. As a formidable pathology, cancer is the most significant cause of death worldwide after cardiovascular disease. The annual incidence of cancer-related mortality has increased progressively. Modifying one's dietary patterns, engaging in regular physical exercise, and maintaining an optimal body mass index are three straightforward measures that an individual may undertake to mitigate their susceptibility to cancer. Incorporating diverse vegetables and fruits into one's dietary regimen exhibits promising potential for preventing a minimum of 20% cancer incidence and approximately 200,000 cancer-related mortalities annually. Vegetables and fruits contain high levels of minerals and phytochemicals, which help alleviate and prevent the harmful effects of cancer. These substances are safe and exhibit minimal toxicity in biological systems. Furthermore, they exhibit antioxidant properties and have garnered extensive approval for their use as nutritional supplements. Pomegranates are used in ancient cultures to prevent and treat various diseases. Extensive research on pomegranate extract, fruit, oil, and juice has revealed promising findings regarding their potential anti-proliferative, anti-tumorigenic, and anti-inflammatory properties through the modification of various signaling pathways related to cancer, thus demonstrating their potential as drugs to prevent and treat cancer. Emerging research indicates that pomegranate can potentially prevent and treat different cancers, including prostate, bladder, breast, skin, lung, and colon cancer.",
