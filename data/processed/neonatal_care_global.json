        "abstract": "Periviability represents a complex threshold where there is a triangulation of medical capabilities, ethical judgement and the right of the infant to live. In India, with its disproportionate burden of preterm births, the management of infants born at the margins of viability (typically <28 weeks of gestation) remains fraught with legal and ethical challenges. We critically explore the legal contours surrounding the care of periviable neonates from an Indian medico-legal perspective in this article. Despite lacking a uniform national consensus on viability thresholds, Indian jurisprudence confers personhood to neonates at birth, irrespective of gestational age, thereby guaranteeing constitutional protection under Article 21. However, in the absence of explicit guidelines and robust systemic infrastructure, physicians and families must navigate resuscitation decisions amid legal uncertainty, cost constraints and moral complexity. Judicial precedents have mandated life-saving interventions for viable neonates born alive post medical termination attempts, reinforcing the right to care. We discuss the limitations of legal doctrines such as parental autonomy, leave against medical advice and advance directives when applied to neonates who cannot consent for obvious reasons. We also highlight challenges arising from evolving tort liability, procedural lapses and resource inequity in neonatal care.",

        "abstract": "To assess the incidence and risk factors of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in Cyprus and evaluate the validity of United Kingdom-based screening criteria on the population. The findings aimed to optimize ROP screening guidelines for improved neonatal care. This was a retrospective study of 183 children undergoing ROP screening from January to December 2023 in the only tertiary neonatal intensive care unit in Cyprus. A total of 33 infants developed ROP (18%) and 11 of these had vision-threatening ROP. Nine infants received treatment and two died prior to treatment. The youngest infant with ROP was born at 24 weeks of gestation and the oldest was born at 32 weeks. Gestational age, birth weight, sepsis, and long oxygen duration have a strong association with ROP, whereas race, multiple births, blood transfusion, and other operations in the neonatal age are not associated with ROP. Every week of increase in gestational age is correlated with reduction in ROP incidence. The severe prematurity group born at 24 to 28 weeks had the highest risk of vision-threatening disease. Based on the analysis of a cohort of 183 preterm infants who underwent ROP screening over 1 year in the only tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit in Cyprus, the authors concluded that the 2008 United Kingdom ROP screening criteria are appropriate and valid for this population because no cases of treatment-requiring ROP were missed. The findings indicate that the severity of prematurity is the primary determinant of ROP risk, whereas other independent risk factors appear to have a comparatively lesser impact on the development of ROP. Importantly, this represents the first epidemiological study of ROP in Cyprus, providing a nationally representative assessment of ROP incidence and screening effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 7-9% of pregnancies worldwide and is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Nutritional therapy is a key component of GDM management. However, inconsistencies exist across international and national guidelines regarding macronutrient distribution, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation. This systematic review aims to compare updated nutritional recommendations for GDM across major health organizations and identify areas of consensus, divergence, and evidence gaps. <b>Methods:</b> This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251026194). A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (concluding March 2025), along with manual searches of official websites of professional health organizations (e.g., ADA, WHO, NICE, IDF). Guidelines published within the last 10 years (or the most relevant national guideline if slightly older), available in English or with access to translation, and including explicit nutritional recommendations for GDM were included. Data were extracted on macronutrient composition, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation, with evaluation of the supporting evidence and regional context, incorporating findings from recent key guideline updates. <b>Results:</b> In total, 12 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. While all guidelines emphasized carbohydrate moderation and adequate fiber intake, significant discrepancies were found in carbohydrate quality recommendations (e.g., low-glycemic index focus vs. total carbohydrate restriction), postprandial glucose targets (e.g., 1-h vs. 2-h measurements and varying thresholds like <120 vs. <140 mg/dL), and the use of non-routine micronutrients such as chromium, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids (generally lacking endorsement). Recent updates from key bodies like ADA, Diabetes Canada, and KDA largely maintain these core stances but show increasing emphasis on dietary patterns and acknowledgement of CGM technology, without resolving key discrepancies. Cultural adaptability and behavioral counselling strategies were minimally addressed across most guidelines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite general agreement on the principal recommendations of nutritional management in GDM, substantial variation persists in specific recommendations, even considering recent updates. Consistent, evidence-based, and culturally adaptable guidelines incorporating implementation strategies are needed to optimize care and reduce disparities in GDM management across regions.",

        "abstract": "The families of the preterm infants face a multitude of challenges during their infants' hospitalization at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in the Ghanaian context. In their vulnerable state, these families require significant support to help them cope. This study aims to explore support systems available to families of preterm infants hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at a public referral hospital in the capital city of Ghana, Accra. The study adopted a qualitative approach to explore the phenemenon. The inclusion criteria considered all parents above the age of 18 years who were medically fit and emotionally stable to participate in the study. The language barrier was mainly an exclusion criterion. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with purposively selected participants, and a semi-structured interview guide guided the interviews. Data collection and recruitment of participants stopped once data saturation was reached. Sixteen participants whose infants were hospitalized at the NICU were interviewed. Three themes were identified: a. Healthcare worker support, b.Social support, and c. Financial support systems. Based on the nature and sources of support identified, ten subthemes were further developed from thematic areas. The study highlights the comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to support systems available to families at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the hospitalization of preterm babies. While healthcare workers are essential in providing medical and emotional care, contributions from families, peers, and philanthropic groups can help parents cope during difficult times. We recommend that hospitals in Ghana consider developing policies and practice guidelines such as the Child and Family Centred Care (CFCC) that prioritize communication to ensure that families receive regular updates about the infant's condition and medical care plans regardless of the medical background of the communicator.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the leading cause of congenital and acquired viral infections in newborns. While acquired infections are often asymptomatic, premature infants-especially those born before 30 weeks of gestation or with a very low birth weight (<1500 g)-are at an increased risk for severe infections. These can manifest as thrombocytopenia, liver failure, sepsis-like symptoms, and, in rare cases, death. HCMV is transmitted through various human secretions, including breast milk, which is the optimal feeding method for premature infants. <b>Methods:</b> We present five premature neonates, born between 23 and 26 weeks of gestation, each with a distinct clinical presentation of acquired HCMV infection. <b>Results:</b> All infants tested negative for congenital CMV infection via molecular urine testing within the first three weeks of life. Acquired infection was diagnosed between the second and third month of life, with symptoms such as septic shock, persistent thrombocytopenia, and signs of liver failure. Each infant received antiviral treatment along with regular viral load monitoring. Unfortunately, one patient died due to complications of prematurity. The remaining infants were discharged and continue to receive follow-up care in an outpatient clinic. <b>Conclusions:</b> These cases of postnatally acquired CMV infection aim to increase awareness of its highly heterogeneous and nonspecific clinical presentation, which may result in an incorrect, delayed, or concealed diagnosis. Currently, there are no clear guidelines on how to manage the presence of the virus in maternal breast milk, particularly for premature infants. It should be recommended to perform a molecular CMV test in all breast-fed preterm infants who present with sepsis-like symptoms, thrombocytopenia, liver failure, or other organ involvement. In case of a confirmed aCMV diagnosis, appropriate treatment should be introduced.",

        "abstract": "South Africa (SA) is amongst the countries that adopted the Global plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections amongst children and keeping their mothers alive, launched in June 2011 as well the global HIV strategies of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3 target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, including the strategy for measuring impact and progress made in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), now called Vertical Transmission Prevention (VTP) of HIV and communicable infections. All targets outlined in the Global Plan for elimination of Mother to child transmission (eMTCT) have almost been reached by the country, showing potential to achieve eMTCT by 2030.Successes are attributed to PMTCT policy of SA being amongst the best in the world. However, despite the well-established PMTCT programme, PMTCT implementation gaps still exist. This study ascertained identified gaps as follows: Of 163 accounted for pregnant women participants, 82(53.0%) booked before 20 weeks of gestational dates for their first ANC booking as advocated for by the PMTCT policy,81 were late bookers who had potential for not having their viral load suppressed, with high risk of MTCT.15 were missing and unaccounted for. 91 of 101 (89.11%) pregnant HIV positive women commenced ART on the day of their diagnosis, during their first ANC attendance. 67 were known HIV positive pregnant women already on ART who came for their first booking The remaining 10 pregnant HIV positive women did not begin ART early in their pregnancy and have the potential of not being virally suppressed Viral load was poorly monitored-25.0% had no viral load testing done at their first ANC booking,47% were tested at delivery and 49.0% tested at 6-months after delivery.150 of 164 HIV positive women who were eligible for a routine six-to-twelve-week post-partum were missed opportunities.100 of 178 (56.2%) HIV exposed babies were given NVP and AZT prophylaxis Baby Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) testing:Of 178 HIV exposed babies, 122 (69%) were tested at birth, 113 of 178(63%) were tested at 10 weeks There was 6 (3.5%) of babies who seroconverted after 103 of 178 (58%) were tested. at 6-months. To address identified gaps, inform future policy formulation and improve PMTCT practices, ascertaining the country to achieve eMTCT by 2030. To conduct file audit at selected facilities to assess and verify the existence of implementation gaps. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey of routinely collected clinic data. The survey was chosen to conduct clinical records audits of mother and baby pairs client records from 18 facilities rendering PMTCT services, representative of the rural and urban areas in all the nine provinces of SA Five (5) Mother and baby pairs client records, each containing specific tools used for measuring PMTCT programme progress amounting to 3 160 files were randomly selected. The investigator developed a checklist from all existing approved PMTCT M&E sampled tools, condensed into one document and used to collect data from all sampled client's records. STATA software was used for data analysis. The audit revealed several factors, related to non-compliance to interventions of the PMTCT policy, poor integration of mother and baby services; poor client management and poor documentation practices. The results indicate that, despite, the well-established PMTCT programme in place in the country, implementation gaps still exist as a result of non-compliance to the PMTCT policy. There is an urgent need to prioritise and support implementers to fully implement the PMTCT policy. The study ascertained PMTCT policy implementation gaps that still exist as a result of non- compliance to interventions advocated for by the PMTCT policy Poor adherence and non -adherence to PMTCT policy may have an impact on the ultimate objectives of the whole program and derail the country to achieve eMTCT by 2030.",

        "abstract": "Gestational weight gain-GWG is an important predictor of neonatal growth. However, there is dearth of literature from rural and urban India depicting longitudinal patterns and determinants of GWG. To address this gap, our objectives were to study longitudinal patterns and predictors of GWG in pregnant women residing in rural and urban areas in and around Pune city, Maharashtra, India and to compare them with pre-existing guidelines provided by IOM, 2009. This study enrolled 268(134-rural and 134-urban) healthy singleton pregnant women attending antenatal care centers in and around Pune, India between August 2020-September 2023. Participants were measured for anthropometry and interviewed for socioeconomic status, diet, physical activity, sleep quality, and prenatal distress once in each trimester. Pre-gestational weight status was calculated using WHO, Asian-Pacific, and South Asian BMI cut-points. GWG was estimated using IOM, 2009 guidelines. The observed mean GWG was 10.9 ± 4.2 kg(rural:9.9 ± 3.7, urban:11.9 ± 4.5). 61.2% of rural and 30% of urban underweight pregnant women did not gain adequate weight. 11.8% of rural and 57.3% of urban pregnant women with overweight or obese BMI exceeded recommended guideliness. Key predictors of inadequate GWG in second and third trimesters were low socio-economic status, parity, underweight pre-gestational BMI, prenatal distress, and poor sleep. The primary predictor of excessive GWG was overweight or obese pre-gestational BMI. These findings were consistent across all BMI classifications. Our findings indicate that urban underweight pregnant women gained significantly higher weight. There was health disparity between rural and urban pregnant women that needs to be addressed to improve health of pregnant women. We have identified important modifiable factors such as dietary intake, physical activity, etc. to ensure optimal GWG which can inform public health policies. Further research is needed to assess whether context-specific GWG recommendations would be beneficial as our study is based on single geographical location and timeframe.",

        "abstract": "Neural tube defects (NTDs) remain a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with persistently high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries including Turkey. Despite advances in prenatal screening and neurosurgical care, survival outcomes remain variable. This study aimed to assess national trends in survival duration, surgical intervention patterns, and regional disparities in neonatal NTD outcomes across Turkey over a 7-year period. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study of 7,606 liveborn neonates diagnosed with NTDs between 2015 and 2021. Data were extracted from hospital-based registries and included clinical, demographic, and regional variables. Primary outcomes were survival duration and rate of surgical intervention. Linear regression was used to assess temporal survival trends, and Kaplan-Meier analysis compared survival between surgical and non-surgical groups. The mean survival duration declined markedly from 705.2 days in 2015 to 123.0 days in 2021 (p < 0.001), with linear regression revealing a significant annual decrease of 82.2 days (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91). Surgical intervention was performed in 30.3% of cases overall, with notable regional variability. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly longer survival among neonates who underwent surgery (mean: 450.6 days) compared to those who did not (mean: 290.2 days; p < 0.0001). The Black Sea region exhibited the highest average survival despite low intervention rates, whereas Southeastern Anatolia had the highest surgery rate but the lowest survival duration. Despite incremental improvements in surgical access, neonatal survival among infants with NTDs in Turkey has declined over the past decade. Marked regional inequities and the limited effect of surgery on overall survival underscore the need for comprehensive strategies addressing prevention, early diagnosis, timely surgical care, and equitable neonatal intensive care delivery.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Trisomy 21 (T21), or Down syndrome, is frequently associated with congenital heart defects (CHDs). This study aims to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and para-clinical profile of CHDs in children with trisomy 21 while highlighting the specific challenges encountered in the Oriental region of Morocco. Methods This is a retrospective descriptive study conducted over a nine-year period (January 2015 to December 2023) at the Mohammed VI University Hospital Center (CHU Mohammed VI) in Oujda. It included 167 children with trisomy 21 who were referred for cardiologic evaluation, whether symptomatic or screened systematically. All patients underwent echocardiographic assessment performed by a pediatric cardiologist following the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE). Data were collected from medical records and the Hosix software (SIVSA, Vigo, Spain), an electronic health record system. Results Among the 167 children, 103 (61.6%) had confirmed congenital heart defects. The average age at diagnosis was 14 months, with the majority being diagnosed after 24 months. Trisomy 21 was confirmed by karyotyping. Most children were referred due to clinical symptoms (feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, cyanosis, sweating, and malaise), while others were referred after an incidental murmur or systematic screening. The most common defects were complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), followed by ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), isolated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), and transposition of the great vessels (TGV), along with rarer anomalies. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), assessed via echocardiographic criteria, was found in 17 patients, with six being deemed inoperable. Of the 103 children with CHDs, 28 underwent surgical correction, 63 received medical follow-up, and 12 were under palliative care. The low surgical intervention rate was due to various factors: late diagnosis, parental refusal, or limited access to specialized care. Postoperative follow-up was incomplete, limiting outcome evaluation. Conclusion This study highlights the challenges of the early diagnosis and optimal management of CHDs in children with trisomy 21 in a resource-limited region. It emphasizes the need to strengthen neonatal screening programs, unify evaluation protocols, and improve access to surgical care to enhance outcomes and long-term survival for these patients.",

The study collates pharmacogenomic data from multiple sources, including essential drugs listed by the World Health Organization (WHO), drugs used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), minimum sets of alleles recommended by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and catalogs the allele frequencies from the IndiGenomes database to address gaps in actionable PGx for the Indian population. Curated datasets were used to identify pharmacogenomic variants relevant to clinical practice. Overall, 24 prime genes are essential for the outcomes of 57 drugs. In adults, 18 genes influence the metabolism of 44 drugs whereas, in pediatric populations, genotypes of 18 genes significantly impact the metabolism of 18 drugs. Two over-the-counter drugs with actionable PGx variants were identified: ibuprofen and omeprazole. These findings emphasize the clinical relevance of PGx for commonly used drugs, underscoring the need for population-specific data. As the data of several Indian human genome projects become available, an overarching need exists to establish and regulate the dynamic actionable PGx in Indian clinical practice. This will facilitate the integration of pharmacogenomic data into healthcare, enabling effective and personalized drug therapies.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy in women with a Fontan circulation carries increased risk. Given the relative evidence void, pregnancy counseling requires considerable nuance and experience. This study aimed to identify risk factors for maternal and fetal complications and to contrast risk estimates obtained from existing risk stratification tools, including the modified WHO, CARPREG II, and ZAHARA risk scores. Pregnant women (>20 weeks of gestation) with a Fontan circulation were retrospectively included from 13 international centers. Univariate and multivariable analyses identified predictors of complications, and the performance of risk stratification tools was assessed. From 2006 to 2018, 84 women with Fontan physiology had 108 pregnancies, and form the basis of this investigation. Maternal cardiovascular complications occurred in 32 (30%) of all pregnancies including Fontan circulatory failure (17%), supraventricular tachycardia (7.4%), and thromboembolic events (3.7%). No maternal deaths occurred. Premature birth constituted 68% of neonatal complications, with a fetal and neonatal mortality of 13%. Multivariable analysis linked adverse maternal outcomes to pre-pregnancy oxygen saturation (adjusted OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.61-0.96; p=0.02). None of the risk models showed good discriminative ability. The modified WHO classification was the only risk model significantly associated with adverse fetal outcomes. Pregnancy in women with Fontan circulation poses a significant cardiovascular risk for the mother and a high burden of fetal and neonatal complications. The existing predictive risk stratification models do not discriminate hazard between well-functioning patients with Fontan from those with additional hemodynamic burden. This underscores the necessity for large-scale studies to refine risk stratification.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoglycemia is one of the most common reasons for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission in otherwise healthy late preterm and term newborns. Routine care requires frequent blood glucose (BG) measurements, typically via painful heel lances, to titrate intravenous (IV) dextrose during treatment. However, little is known about the care for these newborns including the burden of BG measurements. This was a retrospective medical record review (July 2018 to July 2024) of newborns at least 35 weeks gestational age who had hypoglycemia screening in a university-affiliated newborn nursery and subsequently required NICU admission for IV dextrose. IV dextrose was initiated if target glucose levels per national guidelines were not achieved with buccal dextrose gel with or without oral supplementation. BG measurements before feeds typically via heel lance and point-of-care glucometers continued until euglycemia was achieved with enteral feeds alone. Descriptive statistics of newborn characteristics, number of BG measurements, and length of stay were analyzed. Among 7823 newborns screened for hypoglycemia in the newborn nursery, 298 (3.8%) required IV dextrose and NICU admission. Newborns who received IV dextrose experienced a median 29 (IQR, 19-40) BG measurements while hospitalized. More than 25% of newborns had at least 40 BG measurements and almost half had at least 30 glucose measurements. The median length of stay was 6 (IQR, 4-9) days. Newborns with hypoglycemia requiring IV dextrose experience a high burden of BG measurements. Evidence-based practices along with noninvasive glucose monitoring approaches that may safely reduce the number of painful \"pokes\" during clinical care should be investigated.",

        "abstract": "Using chest radiographs to guide lung aeration during respiratory support in infants is common practice and recommended in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) guidelines, but this practice has never been validated. To describe the association between diaphragm position on chest radiograph in infants and aerated lung volume calculated from computed tomography (CT). This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary children's hospital, the Royal Children's Hospital, in Melbourne, Australia. Included were infants without congenital lung pathology who received a chest CT in the first 30 days after birth between July 9, 2012, to December 31, 2022; infant data were retrieved from the Royal Children's Hospital Medical Imaging database. Study data were analyzed from December 2022 to September 2023. Lung volume was calculated using CT semiautomated tissue segmentation and diaphragm position determined using a standardized definition. All investigators analyzing CTs were unaware of the chest radiograph measurements and vice versa. The primary outcome was the distribution and precision of total lung volume at each of the measured diaphragm positions (6th-11th posterior rib). The imaging data of 218 infants (median [IQR] age, 11 [3-20] days old; mean [SD] age, 37.9 [1.9] weeks' gestation at birth; 119 male [55%]) were analyzed. Infants had a mean (SD) weight of 3055 (584) g at scan, and 132 (61%) had a primary cardiac diagnosis. The number of posterior ribs representing diaphragm position ranged from 6 to 11. There was only a weak association between diaphragm position and lung volume (Kendall τ = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.16-0.31). A similar weak association was observed by hemithorax (left, Kendall τ = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.15-0.34; right, Kendall τ = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.10-0.31), degree of consolidation (Kendall τ = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21-0.38), apex-diaphragm distance (Kendall τ = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.51), and Hounsfield unit values (Kendall τ = -0.05; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.06). Results of this cross-sectional study suggest that despite long-standing acceptance in the NICU, the use of diaphragm position on chest radiograph lacked the precision required to assess aerated lung volume and guide clinical practice in infants.",

To investigate the correlation between blood pressure (BP), cardiac output (CO), and MCA Doppler indices in neonates, hypothesizing that BP alone is not a reliable measure of cerebral perfusion. A retrospective cohort study of neonates who underwent their first TNE in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The analysis focused on the relationship between BP components and MCA Doppler measures (i.e., resistive index and pulsatility index). The study included 194 neonates born at a mean gestational age and weight of 30.7 ± 6 weeks and 1744 ± 1246 g, respectively, classified into normotensive, hypotensive, and normotensive-treated groups. Weak correlations were observed between MCA Doppler measures and BP components across the entire cohort. Group comparisons found that neonates in the hypotensive group exhibited higher MCA-RI compared to both normotensive and normotensive-treated groups. Exploratory analyses revealed significant variation in MCA-RI that was explained by cardiac output after accounting for BP and gestational age. These findings suggest that BP alone is not a sufficient indicator of cerebral perfusion status. While the correlations were expected to be weak given the dynamic nature of cardiac output, the results highlight the need for comprehensive hemodynamic assessments in neonates with cardiovascular compromise to avoid reliance on oversimplified metrics such as BP versus Dopplers.",

Secondary analysis of data from the Korea Nurses' Health Study, a nationwide prospective cohort study. Online surveys distributed from 2014 to 2023 in Korea. Nurses (N = 296) who gave birth in the past year. We categorized GWG using guidelines from the Institute of Medicine and conducted bivariate and logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with inadequate and excessive GWG. Among participants, 40.2% had inadequate GWG, 36.1% had adequate GWG, and 23.7% had excessive GWG. We found significant differences in GWG based on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weekly overtime hours worked. As age increased, the odds of excessive GWG decreased (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.79, 0.99]), whereas higher levels of fatigue were associated with increased odds (OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.01, 1.15]) of excessive GWC. Our study suggests that health care providers should consider ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, overtime work hours, age, and fatigue levels when educating and caring for pregnant nurses. Although the findings reflect a specific maternal population of Korean nurses, they may inform care for similar working women. We recommend that information about GWG be incorporated into prenatal education, visits, checklists, and counseling for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is crucial for maternal and neonatal health, facilitating early complication management, health education, and promoting skilled birth assistance. Despite global ANC recommendations, implementation remains suboptimal in sub-Saharan Africa, where maternal and neonatal mortality rates remain high. Assessing ANC prevalence and its determinants can help address gaps and improve health outcomes. This study utilised data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2015 and 2022 across SSA countries, using a weighted sample of 196,459 women. ANC service use during pregnancy was classified as no ANC visits, one to three ANC visits, or four or more visits. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate explanatory variable effects, reported as relative risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Among participants, 11.2% received no ANC, 30.5% had one to three visits, and 58.4% attended four or more visits. ANC utilisation varied by region, with 54.7% of women in East Africa and 60.3% in West Africa receiving four or more visits. Having health insurance showed one of the strongest positive associations with ANC attendance for both one to three visits (RRR = 2.81, 95% CI: 2.37, 3.34; p < 0.001) and four or more visits (RRR = 2.95, 95% CI: 2.48, 3.51; p < 0.001). Women who did not consider obtaining permission to visit a health facility as a problem also had a higher likelihood of attending one-three visits (RRR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.53, 1.81; p < 0.001) or ≥ four visits (RRR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.77, 2.09; p < 0.001). Higher maternal education, longer preceding birth intervals, and an improved wealth index were significantly associated with a greater probability of attending ≥ four ANC visits (p < 0.001). In contrast, living in a rural area was associated with lower odds of attending ≥ four visits (RRR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.72; p < 0.001). This study highlights disparities in ANC utilisation in SSA, with many women receiving insufficient or no ANC visits. Individual, household, and community-level factors, such as education, health insurance, income, geographic access, and others, strongly influence ANC service use. Strengthening maternal health insurance schemes can alleviate financial barriers, and community-based outreach programs and educational campaigns can enhance access and awareness, and improve access and continuity of care, particularly in rural or remote areas. Integrating these strategies into broader health policies and fostering collaboration between healthcare providers, policymakers, and local communities allows for narrowing existing gaps in ANC utilisation and ultimately improving maternal and neonatal outcomes across the region.",

The aim of this study is to assess the resistance patterns of isolated uropathogens among children and adolescents hospitalized with UTIs in Lebanon; and determine the risk factors associated with MDRO-related UTIs over a 10-year period. A retrospective chart review was conducted at two tertiary medical centers in Beirut. Children and adolescents less than 18 years who were admitted, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021, with the following ICD-10 codes: \"urinary tract infection\", \"cystitis\" and/or \"pyelonephritis \" were included. A case was excluded if the urine culture was polymicrobial or did not meet the definition of UTI we used. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for MDRO infections. Among the 876 pediatric UTI cases included, 85% were above 2 months of age and 74.1% were females. 64.5% of 644 <i>Escherichia coli</i> and 61.9% of 114 <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. isolates met international MDR criteria. After a period of fluctuation, the proportion of MDROs began to steadily increase starting 2019 eventually surpassing the 2011 percentage by nearly 10% in 2021 (67.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.248). Only 2.1% of MDR <i>E. coli</i> and 2.9% of MDR <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. were resistant to carbapenems. However, aminoglycoside resistance was high ranging between 28.3% and 48.6%. Children aged ≥ 5 years were nearly twice as likely to present with an MDR uropathogen compared to those < 5 years of age (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Only a history of leukemia (<i>p</i> = 0.010, AOR = 4.248, 95% CI [1.412-12.778]) and antibiotic use in the preceding 30 days (<i>p</i> = 0.012, AOR = 2.045, 95% CI [1.167-3.582]) were found as independent risk factors for UTIs caused by MDROs in multivariable logistic regression. This study highlights the increasing threat of MDROs among pediatric UTIs. Recent antibiotic use was strongly associated with MDRO infections highlighting the urgent need for effective antimicrobial stewardship, re-evaluation of empiric treatment guidelines, and strict abidance by infection control measures.",

        "abstract": "In this review we sought to determine the clinical benefits and safety of a multiple micronutrient supplement/supplementation (MMS) throughout preconception, pregnancy, and lactation in the mother and their child. No guidelines for pregnancy specifically recommend supplementation with micronutrients other than folic acid and iron or continuing the use of MMS beyond the first trimester. Yet micronutrients are essential during all stages of pregnancy for healthy fetal growth and development and maternal health, with an increased intake of many micronutrients recommended during pregnancy and lactation. The MMS reviewed (Elevit, Bayer) is the most studied prenatal form of MMS, supported by 30 publications reporting studies conducted worldwide over 30 years and used by millions of women over a period of 40 years. Until now, the data have not yet been consolidated. We performed a literature search to identify published studies for trials that used MMS at any stage of the pregnancy journey. Outcomes reported in 30 trials suggested that MMS improves micronutrient status, leads to a healthier reproductive environment during preconception, and can significantly reduce neural tube defects and congenital abnormalities in early pregnancy above and beyond supplementation with folic acid alone. We also found that MMS can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes during the second and third trimesters, including miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anemia, preterm birth, and placental insufficiency, and improve docosahexaenoic acid status. In addition, MMS improves the quality of breastmilk and reduces postpartum depression. Using MMS containing 800 μg folic acid is more effective than supplementing with 400 μg folic acid alone. Very few adverse events were reported in infants, almost all of which were considered unrelated to MMS intake. In one cohort, periconceptual MMS in children was linked to higher rates of otitis media and atopic dermatitis than placebo, but these results may be partly attributed to multiple hypothesis testing and differences in family history, respectively. Improving micronutrient status with MMS in women who are trying to conceive, pregnant, or breastfeeding may have beneficial effects on fertility, the integrity of the embryonic environment, development of the embryonic brain and nervous system, and the growth, development, and long-term health of the child.",

        "abstract": "Preexisting diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for PDM. To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception.In individuals with T2DM, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.In pregnant individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition.In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (<175 g/day) or usual diet (>175 g/day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175 g/day.In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM.In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting <95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L).In individuals with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to 11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use of hybrid closed-loop pump technology.In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.",

Three reviewers independently screened records, selected relevant studies, and performed the data charting. Finally, discrepancies were resolved through consensus-based discussion and final adjudication by a third reviewer to ensure methodological transparency and minimize selection bias. 11 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. This scoping review observed a progressive decline in exclusive breastfeeding rates among preterm infants within one year postpartum, with challenges in the immediate postpartum period related to breastfeeding techniques and milk supply insufficiency. Factors such as maternal age, infant gestational age and health status, and hospital transfers also influence breastfeeding cessation at 6-12 months postpartum. This scoping review study provides the complex and evolving breastfeeding challenges faced by preterm infants, shaped by physiological, social, and psychological factors. Key findings underscore the need for longitudinal, adaptive lactation support strategies that align with infants' developmental trajectories and parental psychosocial needs. To address critical gaps, future research should prioritize multicenter trials evaluating stepped-care interventions through standardized CONSORT-compliant protocols, while integrating machine learning models to predict individualized lactation failure risks based on dynamic NICU biometrics.",

        "abstract": "Postpartum measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), and varicella vaccination is critical for nonimmune mothers to prevent severe maternal and neonatal complications. Despite recommendations, vaccination rates remain suboptimal, particularly in completing the two-dose series. This study evaluates the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR)-based intervention on postpartum MMR and varicella vaccination rates.A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two urban tertiary care centers. Nonimmune postpartum patients with public insurance who delivered between January 2021 and June 2022 and February 2023 and October 2024 were included in the pre- and postintervention groups, respectively. The intervention, implemented in April 2023, modified the mandated postpartum checklist in the EMR to include measles immunity status and emphasize the necessity of completing the two-dose series for MMR and varicella. The primary outcome was the completion rate of the two-dose series, with secondary outcomes assessing provider adherence and patient acceptance. Statistical analyses included chi-squared and <i>t</i>-tests to compare pre- and postintervention cohorts.A total of 468 patients were included (220 preintervention and 248 postintervention). MMR series completion significantly increased from 2.3 to 34.9% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Varicella series completion showed a nonsignificant upward trend from 27.0 to 36.5% (<i>p</i> = 0.112). Provider adherence improved, with fewer missed opportunities to offer the second dose at the postpartum visit (49.6 vs. 32.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.004 for MMR). Patient declination rates remained stable.Integrating vaccination reminders into the EMR significantly improved postpartum MMR series completion. While varicella rates showed a modest increase, persistent provider follow-up and patient education remain crucial. Future efforts should focus on addressing systemic barriers and enhancing patient outreach to further optimize postpartum vaccination completion. · EMR checklist improved MMR series completion rates.. · Varicella series completion showed modest improvement.. · Provider adherence to vaccine guidelines increased.. · Barriers to postpartum vaccine completion still exist..",

        "abstract": "This study assessed short- and long-term neonatal outcomes in nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies who underwent cerclage compared with those who did not. This nationwide retrospective cohort study included all singleton nulliparous women from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database with live births between January 2006 and December 2019. Women were categorized into three groups based on gestational age at cerclage placement: < 16 weeks, 16-24 weeks, and > 24 weeks. We compared short-term neonatal outcomes of preterm birth rates, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, and composite neonatal morbidity and long-term outcomes (including mortality and developmental problems) of the cerclage groups against those who did not undergo cerclage placement. A total of 2,896,271 women and their neonates were included in this study, with a median follow-up period of 10.4 years. The cerclage group had a higher rate of preterm birth compared with the control group (control: 2.9%, cerclage at < 16 weeks: 9.8%, 16-24 weeks: 18.2%, > 24 weeks: 36.4%). The cerclage group also showed higher rates of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and composite neonatal morbidities within 1 month and 1 year compared with the control group. The cerclage group had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with the control group (cerclage at < 16 weeks: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-2.52; at 16-24 weeks: HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.29-3.33; at > 24 weeks: HR, 15.85; 95% CI, 11.06-22.71). The rate of developmental problems, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay, was significantly greater in the cerclage group than in the control group. Cerclage placement after 24 weeks was associated with a higher risk of autism (adjusted HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.37-3.91), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.17-2.45), cerebral palsy (HR, 19.32; 95% CI, 14.63-25.53), and cognitive developmental delay (HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.25-2.62) after adjusting for confounders including neonatal birth weight. Cerclage placement in nulliparous women without a history of miscarriage or stillbirth can be associated with adverse short- and long-term developmental problems in offspring. This study underscores the importance of adhering to evidence-based guidelines when considering cerclage placement.",

        "title": "Trajectories of change in mothers' parenting confidence and relationship with baby: a 15-month qualitative longitudinal study.",
        "abstract": "Parents' experiences and their relationship to their baby undergo various changes over the course of the first year. This is particularly the case for mothers, who still tend to take on the primary caregiver role in most families in the UK. Better understanding the changes mothers experience in the first year is of importance given the impact of the parent-infant relationship for children's socio-emotional development. This qualitative longitudinal study explored first-time mothers' experience of parenting confidence and relationship with their baby from their third trimester of pregnancy to the end of their babies' first year of life. This study also examined trajectories of relevant consistent parenting factors: perceived social support, relationship with partner, expectations, and coping mechanisms. The sample consisted of ten first-time expectant mothers from a low-risk community urban sample, all White, the majority married or in committed relationships and with higher education. Participants were interviewed at four time periods (prenatal, 1-, 6-, and 12-months). The findings indicate that in this homogenous, low-risk sample, most mothers' parenting confidence improved with time, as did their relationship with their baby. However, most faced many changes in their experiences where, overall, the first six months after birth were the most challenging with many mothers feeling disconnected or having strong shifts in their views of relationship with their baby, feeling unsure about how to parent, having unmet prenatal expectations, and diminished partner support. This study demonstrates the complexity of change at multiple levels, both within individuals and within the 15 months of transitioning to motherhood. Consideration of these changes can help inform maternity services and mental health and social care professionals working with expectant parents and those in early parenthood to improve parenting confidence and mother-infant relationships.",

        "abstract": "Childhood obesity and physical inactivity are growing global concerns, particularly in developing countries. Traditional interventions have shown limited success in fostering sustained physical activity (PA) behaviors among children. Serious games and active video games offer an engaging alternative by integrating behavior change techniques within immersive digital environments. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Naji Iriano, a culturally adapted health video game, in improving motivation, self-efficacy, and PA prioritization among children in Bushehr, Iran. This randomized clinical trial included 128 primary school students aged 9-12 years, who were allocated to either an intervention group (Naji Iriano) or a control group (no intervention). Assessments were conducted at baseline, 6 weeks post-intervention onset (Post-test-1), and 6 weeks post-intervention completion (Post-test-2). Data collection tools included questionnaires measuring PA motivation, self-efficacy, prioritization, and the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20, employing chi-square tests, independent t-tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a significance level of 0.05. The adjusted ANCOVA analysis showed significant group differences. The intervention group showed significant improvements in PA self-efficacy (p < 0.001), PA prioritization (p < 0.001), and PA levels (p < 0.001) at both Post-test-1 and Post-test-2 compared to the control group. However, no significant changes were observed in body mass index (BMI) between the groups (p = 0.799). Although PA motivation increased at Post-test-1, this effect was not sustained at Post-test-2 after controlling for covariates (p = 0.968). Health video games such as Naji Iriano can effectively enhance psychological and behavioral determinants of PA in children, providing a scalable, engaging strategy for obesity prevention. Future research should explore long-term adherence, emphasizing the role of parental involvement and environmental support in sustaining behavior change. This trial was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) on 2019-01-02, registration number: IRCT20130317012830N33.",

This single-center, retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. It included data from 9,744 consecutive women-7,083 (72.7%) Turkish citizens and 2,661 (27.3%) migrants-who underwent singleton caesarean sections between March 2018 and March 2023. The primary outcome was the change in monthly utilization rates of neuraxial anaesthesia (NA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives included caesarean section urgency and neonatal outcomes. During the study period, there was an increasing trend in the number of caesarean sections performed using NA among Turkish citizens and migrants (relative ratio [RR] 1.003, P < 0.001 and RR 1.005, P < 0.01, respectively). Both groups showed a significant immediate increase in the usage rate of NA at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (RR 1.095, P < 0.001 and 1.134, P < 0.001, respectively). The introduction of vaccination had no effect on the use of NA (RR 0.970, P = 1.004, and RR 1.000, P = 0.99, respectively). The significant between-group difference in the pre-pandemic usage rate of NA diminished following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no significant between-group difference observed after vaccination (93.3% vs. 90.9%., P = 0.006, 98.4% vs. 97.1%, P = 0.0; 95.4% vs. 95.2%, P = 0.801, respectively). Category-1 caesarean section events increased throughout the study period (471(10.7%) before COVID-19, 321(17.0%) during the first year, and 700 (20.2%) after vaccination; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of composite adverse neonatal outcomes (stillbirths, Apgar 5-min score < 7) among the three time periods (89(2.0%), 41(2.2%), and 49(1.4%); P = 0.065). During the COVID-19 pandemic, our study revealed a continuation of the upward trend in the use of NA for caesarean sections.",

We aimed to investigate the impact of ACS exposure before 34 weeks on neonates of dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins born in the late preterm period. This retrospective cohort study included all DCDA twin gestations born at 34.0-36.6 weeks between January 2014 and December 2020 at a single tertiary medical center. Neonatal outcomes were compared between twin gestations treated with ACS before 34 weeks (ACS group) and those not treated with ACS (control group). A sub-analysis examined neonatal outcomes between those treated with ACS within 14 days of delivery and those treated more than 14 days before delivery. A total of 297 twin gestations were included, with 122 in the ACS group and 175 in the control group. Maternal age, BMI, hypertensive disorders and diabetes mellitus did not differ between the groups. ACS was given for suspected preterm birth (85.2%), fetal growth restriction (4.9%), preeclampsia (3.2%), placental abruption (2.4%), and placenta previa-related bleeding (2.4%). Gestational age (GA) at delivery was lower in the ACS group than in the control group (35.06 ± 0.8 weeks vs. 35.49 ± 0.69 weeks, p < 0.001). The ACS group had higher rates of neonatal admission to the 'neonatal intensive care unit' (NICU)-36.1% vs.16.6%, p < 0.001, and small for gestational age (SGA), 7.2% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.004. By multivariable logistic regression analysis ACS treatment was found to be independently associated with SGA birth (OR 1.997, 95% CI 1.225-3.257, p = 0.006). Within the ACS group, neonates who delivered within 14 days of ACS treatment had higher rates of NICU admission compared to those born > 14 days from ACS treatment (p < 0.004). Twin pregnancies that were born in the late-preterm period and were exposed to ACS before 34 weeks, showed increased rates of SGA and neonatal NICU admission. Caution is needed when administering ACS in twin gestations to avoid unnecessary exposure.",

A retrospective evaluation was conducted on the medical records of premature infants (n = 366) who underwent ROP screening between September 2021 and June 2024 and attended regular follow-up visits. Among these infants, 217 (59.28%) met the previously established ROP screening criteria. A comprehensive analysis was performed on a dataset of 149 (40.71%) additional screenable premature infants (gestational age > 32 weeks and birth weight > 1500 g) according to the revised criteria. A total of 149 patients were included in the study. Among these patients, 65 (43.6%) were female and 84 (56.4%) were male. The mean gestational age was 33.85 ± 1.17 weeks, and the mean birth weight was 2051.07 ± 399.63 g. During the follow-up period, 17 patients (11.4%) developed ROP, with four patients (2.7%) exhibiting treatment-requiring ROP. The mean gestational age at delivery for patients who developed ROP was 33.70 ± 1.24 weeks, and their mean birth weight was 2155.65 ± 368.75 g. No significant differences were observed between these patients and those who did not develop ROP (p = 0.627, p = 0.521, respectively).

        "abstract": "Scientists aim to create a system that can predict the likelihood of newborns being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by combining various statistical methods. This prediction could potentially reduce the negative health outcomes, deaths, and medical costs associated with NICU stays by detecting potential cases early on. This study utilized a retrospective cohort design. The primary outcome of the research focused on admissions to the NICU. The real-time data of pregnant women with a cephalic presentation who gave birth between January 2020 and December 2022 were extracted from the electronic health records of Khaleej-e-Fars Hospital in Bandar Abbas, Iran. The first step of the analysis involved comparing healthy babies to those admitted to the NICU. Variables that had a significant p-value (less than 0.05) were selected as features for the machine learning approach. The input data were utilized to train nine different machine learning models. In our assessment, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- score to evaluate the effectiveness. During the study period, the rate of NICU admission at our center was 477 out of 3,062 deliveries (15.5%). In comparison to other models, the random forest classification had the highest accuracy (0.87) and AUC (0.87) for predicting NICU admission. According to our findings, the most significant predictors of NICU admission among several maternal and clinical factors were gestational age, maternal age, parity, a history of neonatal death, onset of labor, multiple pregnancy, fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, method of childbirth, neonatal weight, and sex. We have identified several important factors that increase the likelihood of newborns being admitted to the NICU, which could assist in predicting the need for additional neonatal care during delivery and in advising women on the chances of NICU admission.",

        "abstract": "Although World Health Organization (WHO) policies aim to promote exclusive breastfeeding and replacement feeding for HIV-exposed infants, limited research explores the social and cultural barriers encountered by mothers living with HIV in rural health facilities in Ghana. This study investigates the challenges associated with exclusive breastfeeding and, where feasible, alternative replacement feeding among mothers living with HIV in rural areas, with a specific focus on how cultural beliefs influence adherence to recommended breastfeeding guidelines. This qualitative study was conducted in two rural community health facilities in Ghana, targeting mothers living with HIV who were actively seeking maternal and child health services. A purposive sampling technique was employed to ensure the inclusion of diverse experiences and perspectives, resulting in a sample of 32 respondents. Participants were selected based on their HIV status and engagement with maternal health services. Data collection involved in-depth interviews and interview guide as data collection tool designed to explore personal experiences and cultural influences on infant feeding practices. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Colaizzi's descriptive phenomenological approach, facilitated by NVivo 12 software to ensure systematic data management and theme identification. The study identified specific sociocultural barriers that hinder the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural communities. Key themes included breastfeeding as a deeply rooted cultural practice, the customary use of water for infant feeding, traditional roles of mothers-in-law in infant care decisions, and food security concerns. Sub-themes further elaborated on breastfeeding as a long-standing tradition, perceived health benefits of breastfeeding, and respect for elders' advice, among others. These cultural norms and beliefs were found to significantly influence adherence to exclusive breastfeeding and, where feasible, alternative replacement feeding guidelines among mothers living with HIV. This study provides valuable insights into the sociocultural barriers affecting efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ghana rural areas. It highlights the need for culturally adaptive health policies and the development of community-based breastfeeding intervention programmes that align with traditional values while promoting safe feeding practices.",

        "title": "A 10-year review of periconceptual folic acid supplementation in women with epilepsy taking antiseizure medications.",
        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have reported that women with epilepsy who are taking antiseizure medications have an increased risk of Neural Tube Defects. Periconceptual folic acid supplementation potentially prevents two-thirds of cases. International guidelines recommend that women at increased risk of a pregnancy complicated by a Neural Tube Defect who could become pregnant should start high-dose (5 mg daily) oral folic acid at least three months before conceiving. The purpose of the study was to examine supplementation in women taking antiseizure medications who delivered a baby weighing >499 g during the ten years 2013-2022 in a large maternity hospital. The hospital's computerized database contains standardized maternal clinical and sociodemographic details which were entered at the first antenatal visit in the obstetric records. The data on all women with epilepsy taking antiseizure medications was anonymized before coding. In the ten years, 75,869 women delivered a baby weighing >499 g. Of the deliveries, 632 (0.83%) were to women with epilepsy. Of these, 250 (0.33%) were taking antiseizure medications when they presented for antenatal care. The most frequently prescribed medications were lamotrigine <i>n</i> = 98 (33.8%) and levetiracetam <i>n</i> = 89 (30.7%). Monotherapy was prescribed in 211 (84.4%) women and polytherapy in 39 (15.6%). Three (1.2%) women took no folic acid before or after conception and 59 (23.6%) only took it after conception. Of the 188 (75.2%) who took folic acid before conception, 164 (65.6%) took high-dose 5 mg and 24 (9.6%) took low-dose 0.4 mg. No maternal characteristics were associated with taking high-dose folic acid before conception. Compliance with the national guidelines in the 16 women taking valproate was 30.8% compared with 76.0% for the other 234 women taking medications (<i>p</i> < 0.03). Compliance in the 211 women receiving monotherapy was 72.5% compared with 25.6% in the 39 women receiving polytherapy (<i>p</i> < 0.03). Two-thirds of women taking antiseizure medications complied with national guidelines on high-dose periconceptual folic acid supplementation. A particular concern is the suboptimal compliance in women prescribed valproate and polytherapy, which are two cohorts at higher risk of a neural tube defect. These findings need to be communicated to women with epilepsy in their reproductive years and their doctors. Of 75,869 women delivered over 10 years, 250 (0.33%) were on medications for epilepsy at presentation34.4% of women taking medications did not start high dose folic acid before conception23.6% of women did not start folic acid until after conceptionCompliance with recommendations was lowest in women prescribed valproate or polytherapyNo maternal characteristics were identified which were associated with suboptimal compliance.",

        "abstract": "The risk-benefit balance and safety of postnatal corticosteroid use for chronic lung disease (PNCSCLD) in preterm infants is a controversial matter. Our objective was to determine the trends in the use of PNCSCLD over eleven years and to analyze the neurodevelopmental consequences of PNCSCLD in preterm infants at 18-42 months of corrected age. The data for this retrospective population-based cohort study were obtained from ten tertiary neonatal intensive care units across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Preterm infants < 29<sup>+0</sup> weeks' gestation born between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017, who were alive at discharge, without any major congenital anomalies were included and analyzed based on their PNCSCLD status. Over eleven years, 611 (14.3%) out of 4258 infants received PNCSCLD. Among the 3386 eligible infants, 2636 (77.8%) underwent neurodevelopmental follow-up and were included in the final analysis. The rate of PNCSCLD use increased from 12.4% in 2007 to 19.6% in 2017. Similarly, the rate of moderate to severe functional disability (MSFD) increased from 8.8% in 2007 to 16.1% in 2017. Propensity-adjusted analysis revealed a greater odds ratio (OR) for MSFD in the PNCSCLD group than in the control group [average treatment effect: OR = 1.252, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.185-1.322, P ≤ 0.001; average treatment effect on the treated group: OR = 1.104, 95% CI = 1.031-1.184, P = 0.005]. PNCSCLD use was associated with a greater incidence of MSFD. Clinicians should exercise caution when using PNCSCLD.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Postnatal immunisation is critical for maternal and child health, particularly in low-income countries. Despite international efforts, maternal awareness and access to care remain limited. Understanding the drivers behind postnatal immunisation services is critical for improving neonatal and maternal healthcare interventions. <b>Methods:</b> A tertiary healthcare facility's postpartum mothers who were seeking immunisation services participated in a prospective cross-sectional electronic survey. Convenience sampling was used to select respondents, who then answered a structured electronic questionnaire intended to obtain information on immunisation practices. To evaluate important trends and correlations, data was analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. A factor analysis was performed using the principal component analysis method, eigenvalue criteria, communalities, and confirmatory factor analysis. The study adhered to the STROBE guidelines. <b>Results:</b> We found that postnatal mothers' good immunisation practices were influenced by their adherence to immunisation schedules (% variance: 56.407; Eigenvalue: 7.33), and significant satisfaction with communication (% variance: 8.338; Eigenvalue: 1.084); giving a cumulative variance explained of 64.745% of the total variance of variables under study. However, suboptimal practices include limited resource availability, poor record maintenance, insufficient support for side effects, a lack of support from healthcare providers, and a decline in immunisation recommendations, all of which had Eigenvalue <1 and insignificant percentage of variance contribution to the total variance explained. We developed a two-factor model of postnatal immunisation practices, focusing on adherence and effective communication. The model showed high loadings and adequate fit indices (χ<sup>2</sup>(34) = 91.333, <i>p</i> < 0.001; CFI = 0.945; TLI = 0.927; RMSEA = 0.071; SRMR = 0.042), good evidence of internal consistency (<i>α</i> = 0.823-0.877), and composite reliability (<i>ω</i> = 0.832-0.877). <b>Conclusions:</b> The study recommends a comprehensive approach to increasing newborn vaccine coverage, which includes health education, improved service delivery, and culturally sensitive communication strategies. Future research should focus on digital health interventions, community-based initiatives, and policy-driven postnatal care.",

        "title": "Women's health and maternal care services: seizing missed opportunities to prevent and manage preterm birth.",
        "abstract": "The past ten years have seen uneven developments in women's and adolescents' health and reproductive rights. Globally, reductions of maternal and neonatal mortality rates and adolescent birth rates have been achieved along with improvements in coverage of key reproductive and maternal health services. However, preterm birth rates have not changed significantly. There is still large variation in these rates across the world, with the highest rates occurring in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Effective interventions based on current clinical guidelines are available that can prevent preterm birth or reduce its negative impacts on newborns. These recommended interventions can be delivered as part of essential health service packages during the preconception, antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal phases. They encompass comprehensive family planning services that enable women and adolescent girls to determine the timing and number of children they have, and the provision of prevention and treatment-related interventions during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period that improve maternal and newborn health including reducing preterm births as well as stillbirths. Health system improvements are needed so that all women are reached with these services and that they are provided respectfully and according to standards. To better prevent and manage preterm births as part of broader goals of improving maternal and newborn health, health systems need to be strengthened so that all women are reached with essential packages of care before, during, and after pregnancy and childbirth. Achieving this and integrating these service packages into universal health coverage strategies requires collaboration across government leaders, civil society members, private sector actors, and development partners. Increasing coverage of antenatal care, institutional delivery, and postnatal care represents an opportunity to improve the quality of care provided during those service contacts including through the provision of interventions that address modifiable risk factors for preterm birth such as prevention and treatment of infections, poor nutritional status, and substance use. Other pivots to enhance the quality of care include using existing tools to optimize the management of preterm birth, such as appropriate use of antenatal corticosteroids, and providing respectful person-centred care for women, adolescents, and families.",

        "title": "Born Too Soon: Progress and priorities for respectful and rights-based preterm birth care.",
        "abstract": "Human rights related to preterm birth encompass access to respectful, evidence-based care; informed consent; protection from discrimination, detention, and unnecessary separation of mother and newborn; and broader social entitlements, such as parental leave and early disability support. Since the 2012 Born Too Soon report, global recognition of these rights has expanded through international treaties, global guidelines, national legal reforms, and social movements. Demand for respectful care, including respectful maternity care and family centred care, has led to its incorporation into global guidelines and policies and a greater evidence-base. However, persistent challenges, such as workforce shortages, discriminatory policies, and the erosion of sexual and reproductive rights, continue to threaten progress. Ensuring respectful and rights-based preterm birth care requires coordinated action across the continuum of care and across sectors, with the mother-baby dyad at the centre. Programmatic priorities at the individual level include implementing respectful maternity care and family-centred care. Ensuring high-quality, respectful care demands that providers themselves are supported, protected, and empowered to deliver such care. Their well-being is a critical enabler of the rights of patients and an essential component of effective, compassionate service delivery. At the facility-level, health systems must be purposefully designed to safeguard the fundamental human rights of the individuals with them, both care seekers and care providers. Implementing respectful, rights-based care relating to preterm birth requires structural and social changes, as well as robust data systems for accountability. Multi-stakeholder action requires strengthening accountability mechanisms at all levels and partnering with those affected by preterm birth-particularly women, families and healthcare providers-in policy processes, and the design, implementation and monitoring of care. At national-level, action requires the adoption, implementation and monitoring of international and regional human rights instruments, with multisectoral collaboration and social mobilization where violations continue. To operationalize respectful and rights-based care for preterm birth, four primary shifts are needed: scale up respectful care; empower and partner with women and families; address the shortage of healthcare providers and protect their rights; and strengthen policy action and accountability.",

        "abstract": "This paper is a narrative review that takes stock of the progress in addressing preterm birth over the past decade - notably on policies, national plans, innovation, evidence, social mobilisation, and community engagement - to inform future progress on preterm birth. At the global policy level, many countries have strongly supported collective initiatives and resolutions on maternal and newborn health relevant to preterm birth in multilateral fora, most recently through a World Health Assembly resolution calling for a revival amongst the global community on stalled progress for maternal, newborn and child health. Following the adoption of other global plans, like the Every Newborn Action Plan and Strategies for Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality, most countries set corresponding national mortality and coverage targets, and many have national and subnational policies and plans for integrated maternal and newborn health. Adequate financing remains a challenge, and sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls are being challenged globally. There have been significant advances in evidence-based interventions for preterm birth prevention and care, reflected in updated World Health Organization guidelines on antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care, and care for small and sick newborns. The past decade has also seen progress in social mobilisation and community engagement, particularly parent groups and healthcare professional organisations advocating on issues surrounding preterm birth. There are, however, significant challenges that continue to hamper progress on preterm birth. Polycrisis - the interplay of overlapping economic, geopolitical, and environmental crises - compounds existing inequities, especially in places where health systems are already weak. Distinct and overlapping threats from conflict, climate change and the cost-of-living crisis present life-or-death challenges to those already facing extreme vulnerability, particularly women and girls, and small and sick newborns. A MARKER OF MATERNAL AND NEONATAL HEALTH PROGRESS IN THE COMING DECADE: The detrimental impacts of preterm birth are felt along the life course and across generations. The success of countries and the global community in preventing preterm births and ensuring high-quality care for mothers and preterm babies serves as a critical measure of progress - or failure - in advancing global efforts to improve maternal and newborn health.",

        "abstract": "Medical innovations and advancements, such as orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) allow thousands of patients worldwide to live comfortably, despite previously life-threatening conditions. Procreation, one of the most powerful human instincts, drives the force behind the increasing popularity of pregnancies after OLT, with their numbers rising since the first documented case in 1976. Pregnancy post OLT remains a high-risk event, requiring careful management by a multidisciplinary team of hepatologists, obstetricians, transplant surgeons, and neonatologists. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on family planning, pregnancy management, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in women who have undergone OLT, based on studies indexed in PubMed up to December 2024. Due to ethical constraints, international registries of pregnancies after OLTs play a critical role in collecting observational data and establishing comprehensive guidelines for clinical practice. As the data indicated, OLT can help restore hormonal balance and menstrual cycle, enabling many women to conceive after OLT. However, adequate family planning is crucial, as women must be aware of the potential risks. Preconception counseling is essential to choose the right timing for pregnancy, assess graft function, and optimize immunosuppressive therapy, as some medications must be discontinued due to teratogenic risks. The risks associated with pregnancy in OLT recipients include gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Neonates are significantly more likely to experience prematurity and low birth weight. Post-partum management focuses on monitoring graft function, managing complications, and guiding breastfeeding. Available literature and observational studies consistently demonstrate that women post-OLT can achieve successful pregnancies and deliver healthy infants. However, due to the inherent risks described in this population, such patients require specialized care from a multidisciplinary team. Further research is essential to optimize birth control methods and clarify the mechanisms behind the higher prevalence of pregnancy complications. Establishing the long-term safety data for immunosuppressive therapies, particularly regarding breastfeeding, is also needed.",

        "abstract": "The concept of 'effective coverage' (EC) aims to combine the concept of coverage with the quality of care delivered and, ultimately, the health benefits received by the population in need. To date, systematic reviews of EC of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (MNCAH) have focused on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). No review has examined whether and how the concept has been applied in high-income countries (HICs). To address this gap, this systematic review investigated the application of EC measures in MNCAH care in HICs. This was a systematic review that followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. The search strategy was developed from previous EC reviews conducted in LMICs and further adapted to the HIC setting. Additional search terms were identified through discussion with experts from the Life Stage Quality of Care Metrics Technical Working Group subgroup on EC. We searched three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, over 10 years. We conducted additional searches in Google Scholar and by consulting members of the Life Stage Quality of Care Metrics Technical Working Group. We did not pose any language or type of article limits. The database search identified 18 976 studies for screening. Of these, 672 abstracts were screened, and none of the full texts considered met our inclusion criteria (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis c virus continuum of care cascade, intervention type, qualitative search-interviews/questionnaire type studies). Thirty-two articles were retrieved through the additional search strategies, and none were included because of LMIC-focused research. Therefore, examples of EC of MNCAH care applied in HICs were not identified. Further investigation should be conducted into the application of the EC concept for assessing MNCAH care in HICs. This research will help us understand how this concept can be used to support health system effectiveness, efficiency, and equity in HICs.

        "abstract": "To compare the demographic characteristics, maternal and perinatal outcomes and hemoglobin parameters according to stages diagnosed with placental abruption. Patients who underwent cesarean delivery due to clinical suspicion of placental abruption after the 20th week of gestation were included in the study. We eliminated patients with persistent hematological disorders, those on anticoagulant medications, and individuals with uterine deformities. Demographic information, body mass index, initial laboratory results, duration of hospitalization, fetal APGAR scores, and transfers to maternal and neonatal critical care units were all documented from the data system. Patients were categorized into categories based on the stages of placental abruption as outlined in the 2022 emergency obstetric care guide. Stage 0: Asymptomatic patient. Stage I: There is vaginal bleeding, clinical pain in abdomen, no signs of maternal shock or fetal distress. Stage II: There may be vaginal bleeding, no maternal shock. Fetal distress is present. Stage III: There may be maternal shock, intrauterine fetal demise is present. Presence of coagulopathy (30%). The patients were categorized as follows: Group 1 stage 0-I; Group 2 stage II; and Group 3 stage III, and the gathered data were compared among the groups. A total of 150 patients were involved, with 50 patients in group 1. Group 2 comprised 59 patients, whereas Group 3 had 41 patients. Abruptions were most prevalent in group 3. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was statistically significantly elevated in groups 2 and 3. The platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was statistically significantly reduced in group 1. Hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels were deemed statistically significantly reduced in group 3. In group 2, the Apgar scores at 1 min and 5 min were the lowest, and the demand for newborn intensive care was the highest. The analysis of hemogram parameters at the initial assessment may aid in the diagnosis of abruption, complementing ultrasonography, particularly in cases of early clinical suspicion. We believe that commonly conducted, cost-effective, and straightforward hemogram parameters, when augmented by artificial intelligence, can provide therapeutic support through the interpretation of data such as PLR and NLP in instances of ambiguous laboratory diagnoses, such as placental abruption.",

Between 2019 and 2023, 3,360 ART cycles were performed at the private IVF center MOMO' Fertilife (Bisceglie, Italy), including 1,035 first-time cycles. Of the 787 males tested for seminal HPV, 62 tested positive. A study group of 57 HPV-positive and a matched control group of 57 HPV-negative males were selected using our clinic management software. Exclusion criteria included female age ≥42, advanced endometriosis, and HPV positivity in both partners. Couples undergoing homologous ART with only the male partner testing HPV positive were included, while those with both partners positive were excluded. HPV-positive sperm was used without standard preparation, and all semen procedures followed WHO guidelines. All couples enrolled in the study provided written informed consent, which specified that spermatozoa from HPV-positive participants would be used without undergoing standard sperm preparation procedures. ICSI was the only ART procedure performed in all cycles included in this study. Semen samples were collected following 3-5 days of abstinence and analyzed within 60 min post-ejaculation. Sperm concentration, motility, and morphology were assessed using phase contrast microscopy. For ICSI procedures in both groups, a standardized \"horizontal swim-up\" technique developed in-house was employed, an alternative method of semen preparation for ICSI developed in our center. Following liquefaction, an aliquot of the semen sample was sent to the virology laboratory, while a duplicate was stored at -80°C. In cases of inconclusive results, reanalysis was conducted using the frozen sample. IVF laboratory personnel were blinded to HPV status. Sperm quality, the morphokinetics of 210 resulting embryos, and pregnancy outcomes were analyzed. Statistical tests included the Student's t test, Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The study found no statistically significant differences in embryo morphokinetics or ART outcomes between HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. Pregnancy rates (33.3% vs. 31.6%) and first-trimester miscarriage rates (1 case each) were comparable between the two treatment groups, which also presented similar blastocyst transfer timing and transfer of high-quality embryos. Sperm parameters showed no clinically relevant variation. The retrospective cohort design and limited sample size represent study limitations. Furthermore, the absence of data on potentially relevant confounders constrains the analysis. Specifically, abortion rate assessment was limited to the first trimester. The lack of extended follow-up data on long-term pregnancy and neonatal outcomes further restricts the conclusions. Male HPV infection did not adversely affect embryo development or ART success rates. These findings suggest that routine HPV screening in male partners undergoing ART may not be necessary.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis (NNS) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO's recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX's full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya's goal of Universal Health Coverage.",

        "title": "Impact of physical activity on maternal and neonatal outcomes among women with vaginal births-single center prospective cohort study.",
        "abstract": "Optimal levels of physical activity during pregnancy are associated with numerous health benefits for both the mother and fetus. Additionally, maternal exercise has been linked to improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced lower back pain, enhanced mental wellbeing and favorable neonatal outcomes, including a lower risk of macrosomia and improved placental function. However, both insufficient and excessive physical activity levels may have adverse effects, highlighting the need for a balanced approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of physical activity before and during pregnancy on maternal perinatal outcomes and neonatal condition. The hypothesis proposes that physical activity at the level recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) does not negatively affect maternal or neonatal outcomes. This single-center prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in northern Poland. Participants were recruited from antenatal outpatient clinics and classified based on their physical activity levels before and during pregnancy according to WHO as well as Canadian and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' guidelines. Data collection occurred in two stages: first, through a questionnaire including socio-demographic data and the Polish version of the Get Active Questionnaire for Pregnancy, and second, by analyzing biomedical data routinely collected during childbirth. A total of 115 cases were included in the final analysis. Statistical analyses comprised logistic and linear regression model implementation, as well as the Student's <i>t</i>-test, Welch's <i>t</i>-test and the Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test, with the level of statistical significance set at <i>p</i> < 0.001. No statistically significant effects of physical activity before or during pregnancy were observed on platelet count, hemoglobin levels, C-reactive protein concentrations, labor duration, BMI changes, anesthesia use, perineal trauma, or neonatal outcomes (including birth mass, length, head circumference, chest circumference, APGAR scores, and umbilical cord blood parameters). Physical activity before and during pregnancy does not negatively impact maternal or neonatal outcomes. These findings support current physical activity recommendations during pregnancy, emphasizing the need for further research on the mechanisms underlying hematological changes associated with exercise.",

        "abstract": "Prematurity is a significant global health challenge. Premature infants frequently need invasive mechanical ventilation until their lungs are fully developed. Due to the possible complications of ventilation, nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) must deliver specialized care to achieve the best outcomes for these infants. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of nurses' training in mechanical ventilation weaning on neonatal outcomes. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design was used with purposive sampling of 70 nurses and 64 newborn infants on invasive mechanical ventilation. The infants were divided into two groups: 32 weaned by trained nurses (study group) and 32 weaned by standard methods (control group). Data was collected using a structured questionnaire about the nurses and neonates. A well-designed training program, including theoretical and practical components, was conducted for the nurses to ensure proper weaning of neonates from mechanical ventilation. The study group demonstrated a significant reduction in the use of surfactant replacement therapy post-extubation compared to the control group (p = 0.003). Additionally, infants in the study group experienced a statistically significant decrease in NICU hospitalization duration, total weaning time, and total ventilation period compared to the control group (p = 0.003, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively). Complications were markedly lower in the study group, with two-thirds of infants experiencing no complications, compared to 15.6% in the control group (p = 0.001). Moreover, re-intubation rates were significantly reduced in the study group compared to the control group (p = 0.1026). These results highlight the effectiveness of the intervention in improving clinical outcomes for neonates, including reduced treatment needs, shorter hospital stays, and fewer complications.

        "abstract": "Advances in preventive strategies have reduced mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines on postnatal antiretroviral prophylaxis have evolved to reflect increasingly available evidence. We sought to provide data on postnatal prophylaxis in clinical practice. We performed a retrospective study using the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database (2009-2021). We identified antiretroviral use among infants and classified them into single-, double-, and triple-drug prophylactic, and therapeutic use. We also characterized new HIV infections in infants in terms of demographics and prophylaxis regimen. Among 3 147 318 infants included in the study, 2304 received postnatal prophylaxis, with 2123 receiving zidovudine alone. Although zidovudine monotherapy was the only prophylaxis used in 2009, the rate dropped to 71.7% by 2021 as combination prophylaxis became increasingly common (P for trend <.001). Triple-drug prophylaxis became more common than double-drug prophylaxis by 2018. Among 52 infants with HIV infection, 27 (51.9%) were diagnosed between 6 weeks and 1 year of life but had not received postnatal prophylaxis, a majority of which were Black (73.8%). Trends in postnatal HIV prophylaxis in clinical practice closely paralleled evolving HHS recommendations. Although the perinatal HIV infection rate was low, more than half of HIV infections by 1 year of life occurred in infants who had not received postnatal HIV prophylaxis, suggesting missed maternal infections, most frequently among Black individuals. Heightened awareness is essential for identifying HIV infection as early in pregnancy as possible to enable timely treatment and prevention.",

        "abstract": "Current BRUE guidelines focus on lower-risk infants (approximately 5%), leaving management strategies for the majority undefined. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield and accuracy of tests and subspecialist consultations among all infants with BRUE. In this retrospective cohort (2017-2021) across 11 Canadian hospitals, we included 1042 infants with BRUE. Records within 90 days of the index visit were reviewed to ascertain diagnostic testing and any newly identified underlying diagnoses. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by comparing test results to diagnoses confirmed or considered probable by care teams. Among 855 patients (82.1%) who underwent testing, 72 (8.4%) received explanatory diagnoses, and 554 (64.8%) had nonsignificant or incidental findings. Complete blood count (50.2%, N = 523) had low sensitivity (26.3%) and specificity (57.5%) for anemia and bacterial infections. Electrocardiograms (55.3%, N = 576) showed a sensitivity of 45.5% and specificity of 73.5%, while electroencephalograms (23.3%, N = 243) showed higher sensitivity (72.7%) and specificity (83.3%). Tests like liver enzymes, ammonia, lactic acid, blood cultures, and pertussis testing identified no diagnoses. Four laboratory tests showed a false positive rate (FPR) exceeding 50%: blood gas (57.6%), inborn errors of metabolism testing (51.7%), electrolytes (51.3%), and bilirubin (52.8%). Consultations were provided to 440 patients (42.2%), identifying explanatory diagnoses in 122 (27.7%) and incidental findings in 70 (15.9%). Diagnostic testing and consultations are prevalent but rarely yield significant results, often with high FPR. Consequently, the routine application of these diagnostic approaches should be reconsidered in the absence of targeted clinical indications.",

Here were present the results of an intensive pharmacokinetic sub-study nested within the CHAPAS-4 trial (ISRCTN22964075), to evaluate ATV/r exposure in children. Children aged 3 - 15 years, weighing 14 - 24.9 kg received 200/75 mg of ATV/r once daily; those weighing ≥25 kg received 300/100 mg of ATV/r once daily. ATV/r was used in combination with either emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide or standard-of-care backbone (abacavir/lamivudine or zidovudine/lamivudine). At steady state, blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after drug intake to construct pharmacokinetic curves. Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared to published values of approved ATV/r adult dosing. We enrolled 54 children. For ATV/r, the geometric mean (GM) area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-24h) was 44.3 h*mg/L (coefficient of variation [CV%], 47%), which is comparable to adults taking ATV/r 300/100 mg once daily). The GM trough concentration (Ctrough) was 0.48 mg/L (70%), which is 25% lower than the adults reference value of 0.64 mg/L (97%). Nonetheless, all individual Ctrough values were above the target of 0.14 mg/L. This nested pharmacokinetic sub-study shows that children weighing 14-24.9 kg and >25 kg taking ATV/r 200/75 mg and 300/100 mg respectively, achieve concentrations comparable to those that are safe and effective in adults.",

        "title": "Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology.",
        "abstract": "Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. Miscarriage is an early pregnancy loss. For women who have recurrent miscarriage, it has been suggested that a causative factor may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians sometimes use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. It is important to understand if this is beneficial or harmful. This is an update of the review, last published in 2019. Previous versions included two trials that have since been retracted. This update included an updated trial search and evaluation of all trials using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool. To assess the benefits and harms of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage. For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2024). We also searched reference lists from relevant articles, attempted to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works. We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in pregnant participants comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment, given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. We included trials of participants who were diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage (usually of unknown origin) and who began treatment with progestogens in the first trimester of pregnancy. We excluded trials treating participants with threatened miscarriage or who had conceived by in-vitro fertilization. The critical outcome was miscarriage. The main important outcomes were live birth rate and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation). Other important outcomes were neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birthweight (< 2500 g), maternal adverse events and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Other maternal outcomes of interest were severity of 'morning sickness', thromboembolic events, depression, admission to special care unit and subsequent fertility. Two review authors assessed the studies using the RoB 1 tool for selection, performance, detection, attrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We utilized a random-effects model to synthesize the results. Nine trials with 1426 randomized participants met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials included analyzable data for 1276 participants. Overall, the risk of bias was low for six trials, while three had areas of concern. Because few studies reported on important outcomes, imprecision was high for those outcomes, limiting the certainty of those analyses. Seven of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the other two compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Jordan, the UK, the Netherlands, and the USA. In three trials, participants had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in six trials, participants had two or more consecutive miscarriages. Route, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eight trials with 1276 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis suggests that there is probably little to no difference in the miscarriage rate for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.07; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 8 studies, 1276 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of participants with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. For women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology receiving progestogen, there was probably little to no difference in live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 5 trials, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth; there was probably little to no difference (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.41; 3 trials, 256 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other important outcomes, including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, or stillbirth. There was little or no data on other important outcomes of low birth weight, maternal adverse events, teratogenic effects, or admission to a special care unit. None of the trials reported on any other important maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility. For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, progestogen supplementation therapy probably results in little to no effect on outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.

        "title": "Post-abortion family planning use and its determinants among women who received abortion care in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Post-abortion family planning (PAFP) refers to the use of modern contraceptive methods, preferably immediately following an abortion and within 48 h of the abortion, or before fertility returns. It is highly recommended to delay pregnancy for at least 6 months following an induced or spontaneous abortion to reduce the occurrence of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a high burden of unsafe abortions and an unintended pregnancy rate. Additionally, there are inconsistent study findings that have been done to investigate the prevalence and determinant factors of post-abortion family planning use in the region. This systematic review followed standard methods and reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol for this study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with reference number CRD42024518297. The eligible publications were searched by PubMed, Research4Life, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The data were extracted using Microsoft Excel 2019 and analyzed using Stata software version 17. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Publication bias was assessed by using the funnel plot and Egger's test. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of post-abortion family planning. The I<sup>2</sup> test was performed to assess the statistical heterogeneity among the included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis included 80 eligible articles from 16 sub-Saharan African countries, with a total of 248,299 study participants. The pooled prevalence of post-abortion family planning use in sub-Saharan Africa was 60.67% (95% CI 55.61-65.73). In addition, the commonly adopted contraception methods after abortion were injectables, 34.98% (95% CI 27.59, 42.37), followed by 20.71% (95% CI 17.20, 24.22) of oral contraception pills, and 20.38% (95% CI 16.82, 23.94) utilized implants. Women aged 15-24 years (AOR = 3.40, 95% CI 2.12, 5.44), being married (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.68, 4.34), attaining secondary school (AOR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.62, 4.66) and college or above (AOR = 2.92, 95% CI 1.85, 4.62), unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 5.03, 95% CI 2.93, 8.61), having prior history of abortion (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.35, 2.62), having good knowledge about family planning (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI 2.37, 3.46), prior family planning use (AOR = 3.82, 95% CI 2.62, 5.58), positive attitude towards family planning methods (AOR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.81, 4.28), partner support (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.64, 3.30), and received post-abortion family planning counseling (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI 2.37, 3.46) were predictors that significantly associated with contraceptive utilization following abortion. This meta-analysis indicates that the pooled prevalence of post-abortion contraception use in sub-Saharan Africa remains low. Therefore, appropriate planning and implementation of effective strategies are crucial to scaling up post-abortion family planning use, including improving educational attainment, advocating for post-abortion contraceptive methods, and providing effective post-abortion family planning counseling.

        "title": "Perinatal outcomes for infants exposed to systemic cancer treatment during gestation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "The incidence of cancer diagnosed during pregnancy is increasing, but data relating to perinatal outcomes for infants exposed to systemic cancer treatment in utero remain limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise evidence from the available literature to investigate whether perinatal outcomes for babies born to women with gestational cancer differ based on whether they are exposed to systemic cancer treatment in utero. A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA-P guidelines. We extracted raw data from the eligible studies to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for perinatal outcomes reported in the included studies. A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases identified studies published between January 2001 and May 2025. Studies were eligible for inclusion in the review that reported on both a study group (women with gestational cancer who received systemic therapy during pregnancy) and a comparison group (women with gestational cancer who did not receive systemic therapy during pregnancy). Two independent reviewers extracted data. Perinatal outcomes included spontaneous abortion, pregnancy termination, intrauterine growth restrictions (IUGR), stillbirth, intrauterine foetal death, neonatal mortality, preterm birth (<37 weeks), Apgar score at 5 min, small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight, congenital anomalies, admission to neonatal intensive care (NICU) and long-term infant and child outcomes (cognitive skill and academic achievement) following systemic therapy. Raw data were extracted from the eligible studies to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for perinatal outcomes, and the ROBINS-I tool was used to assess bias. Five cohort studies (a total of 416 women and 427 neonates exposed to systemic therapy in utero) met the inclusion criteria. Across these studies, a higher rate of preterm birth was consistently observed among exposed neonates compared with those unexposed, with reported ORs ranging from 1.85 to 24.00. Although effect sizes varied and CIs were wide, the overall trend suggests a potential association between in utero exposure to systemic therapy and increased risk of preterm birth. No significant differences were observed in the rates of spontaneous abortion, congenital anomalies, stillbirth, IUGR or SGA births between exposed and non-exposed babies. Very few studies have compared outcomes of systemic therapy-exposed and non-exposed babies of women with gestational cancer. These studies are of limited quality. The available evidence suggests that while some studies indicate a possible association between systemic cancer therapy and increased risk of preterm birth, the overall findings should be interpreted cautiously given the small sample sizes, lack of adjusted analyses, and clinical heterogeneity among included studies. Further research is required to better understand the impact of systemic therapy exposure in utero on perinatal outcomes.",

        "title": "Optimizing pregnancy management of chronic hypertension: A case report of cerebrovascular accident in a pregnant woman and literature review.",
        "abstract": "The prevalence of chronic hypertension among pregnant women is steadily increasing worldwide. Besides chronic hypertension is a major risk factor for preeclampsia (PE). Therefore, the standardization of monitoring and management - focusing on early identification and the judicious use of antihypertensive medications to improve maternal and fetal outcomes - has become a critical concern for clinicians. A 31-year-old pregnant woman with chronic hypertension exhibited repeated blood pressure of 160/110 mm Hg or higher throughout her pregnancy, and there were no laboratory or clinical signs indicative of PE. Fluctuations in her blood pressure resulted in an acute cerebrovascular accident during the period of expectant management. Chronic hypertension with severe PE. The patient was admitted due to acute severe hypertension and received corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation. Expectant management was initially considered due to relatively stable condition during the first 3 days of hospitalization. However, on the 4th day, despite treatment with both oral and intravenous antihypertensive agents, blood pressure remained uncontrolled, even reaching 200/105 mm Hg or higher. Unfortunately, the persistent severe hypertension resulted in an acute stroke, necessitating emergency cesarean section and neurosurgical intervention at 31 + 5 weeks of gestation. The neonate was transferred to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and remained there for 38 days before discharge. The patient was discharged by postoperative day 19 and continued with rehabilitation treatment. At the latest follow-up, muscle strength in her left limb remained at grade 1, with no significant recovery observed. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension who present persistently elevated and uncontrollable blood pressure should be diagnosed with severe PE. Treatment regimens for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy typically involve oral antihypertensive medications, which should be administered judiciously based on clinical guidelines and trial evidence. For chronic maintenance treatment, labetalol and extended-release nifedipine are recommended as 1st-line agents by most international guidelines, with nifedipine being a viable initial option for severe hypertension. For women with severe PE, after corticosteroids have been administered for fetal lung maturation, an overall assessment of maternal and placental-fetal conditions should guide whether expectant management is feasible or if prompt delivery is required to minimize severe complications.",

        "abstract": "Fetal pulse oximetry may improve intrapartum fetal evaluation by providing a non-invasive measurement of fetal oxygen saturation (FSpo<sub>2</sub>). To assess the association between abnormal intrapartum FSpo<sub>2</sub> and perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, and to evaluate if the addition of the measurement of FSpo<sub>2</sub> to established forms of fetal monitoring, such as fetal heart rate monitoring, affects birth, perinatal, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP from database inception through February 2024, with no restrictions on date, geographic region, country income level, or language. Studies involving women in labor with a cephalic baby were included. Two interventions were reviewed: (1) low FSpo<sub>2</sub> (<30%), and (2) the use of fetal pulse oximetry during labor. Independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality using the Risk of Bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The approach evaluated evidence certainty. A random-effects meta-analysis followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Forty-seven studies with 13 071 mother-infant pairs were included. FSpo<sub>2</sub> <30% was associated with umbilical artery pH <7.15 (odds ratio [OR] 7.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.29-18.75, I<sup>2</sup> = 71%, P < 0.001), 5-min Apgar score less than 7 (OR 16.63, 95% CI 5.64-49.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 30%, P < 0.001) and NICU admission (OR 5.89, 95% CI 1.73-20.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, P < 0.005).

FSpo<sub>2</sub> monitoring combined with fetal heart rate monitoring may reduce unnecessary cesarean sections for suspected fetal distress without affecting short-term neonatal outcomes. The association between FSpo<sub>2</sub> <30% and adverse perinatal outcomes supports its potential as a valuable adjunct in intrapartum monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Maternal age, type of delivery, and newborn sex can influence the volume and composition of human milk (HM) expressed by mothers of premature infants. Initiating and maintaining breastfeeding in these mothers is a significant challenge, and records of milk volume expressed during the first few days are crucial for sustaining adequate production. To assess HM production in mothers of preterm infants during the first 15 days of life, examining the relationship between production, type of delivery, and maternal age. Additionally, we aim to analyze the macronutrient composition of HM based on various factors, such as the infant's sex, type of delivery, and maternal age. This is a prospective longitudinal study conducted over 2 years, evaluating HM production and macronutrient composition in 45 mothers of 52 premature infants born at ≤ 32 weeks of gestational age and/or weighing ≤ 1500 g, admitted to the NICU of the University Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, a Level III Q3+ facility. The study focused on the first 15 days of life, recording the volume of milk expressed and collecting milk samples on days 3, 7, and 15 for nutritional analysis of macronutrients. The study examined the influence of maternal age, type of delivery, and newborn sex on these factors. Vaginal deliveries and maternal age < 35 years were associated with a trend toward greater volumes of milk expressed compared to cesarean deliveries and maternal age ≥ 35 years. If the amount of HM expressed on day 4 was less than 140 mL/day, it significantly predicted a total expression of < 500 mL/day by day 15. We found that 64.3% of our sample expressed less than 140 mL/day on day 4, and 73.8% of these mothers did not reach 500 mL/day by day 15. Regarding macronutrients, HM contained more fat following vaginal delivery compared to cesarean delivery, with significant differences observed on day 3 of life. No differences were observed based on maternal age or newborn sex. In conclusion, HM production on day 4 is a good predictor of production by day 15; maternal age and cesarean delivery seem to negatively influence HM production; the composition of HM shows higher fat content in the colostrum of mothers who had vaginal deliveries.",

        "abstract": "Esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula is a resource-intensive neonatal surgical condition; however, the magnitude of the institutional cost burden is not well understood. In this study, we used a national database to measure resource use associated with the initial management of esophageal atresia at major children's hospitals nationwide. The Pediatric Health Information System database was queried for infants undergoing esophageal atresia repair at 1 of 47 children's hospitals in the United States between 2014 and 2021. Those undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery were excluded. The primary outcome measure was total adjusted cost (in US dollars) during the index hospitalization. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed (P < .05). Of 1,346 infants with esophageal atresia who were identified, 993 (73.8%) met inclusion criteria. The median cost per patient was $545,000 (interquartile range, $302,000-$1,130,000). Room charges (median $391,000; interquartile range, $219,000-$841,000) accounted for nearly three-quarters of total costs. There was no correlation between institutional surgical volume and hospital cost. Long-gap disease (β: 867.3, P < .0001) was the most significant preoperative factor associated with increased hospital cost. The major postoperative events associated with increased cost were mechanical ventilation days (β: 17.7, P < .0001), pneumonia (β: 168.6, P = .006), and anastomotic leak (β: 137.2, P = .003). In this multicenter cohort study, the median cost associated with the surgical management of a newborn with esophageal atresia exceeded a half a million dollars. The development of esophageal atresia-specific clinical practice guidelines aimed at reducing postoperative respiratory morbidity and anastomotic leak rates may be useful to minimize the resource burden associated with the care of these challenging patients.",

These disparities hinder progress toward equitable health care access and quality outcomes. To evaluate the availability and quality of health care workforce and service coverage for children younger than 5 years in public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to identify gaps in infrastructure, workforce distribution, and adherence to pediatric care standards. This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 13, 2023, to May 24, 2024. Data collection included facility assessments, structured questionnaires, and direct observations using World Health Organization (WHO)-adapted tools. The study covered both private and public hospitals across 6 subdistricts in Bangladesh, representing a mix of urban and rural populations. Senior hospital staff and administrators were surveyed. Inclusion criteria were general inpatient and outpatient pediatric care delivered in hospitals. Diagnostic centers and specialized facilities were excluded. Availability of pediatric infrastructure, workforce, essential medications, and adherence to clinical guidelines assessed against WHO standards. The primary outcomes included the presence of pediatric-specific departments, neonatal care facilities, and trained personnel and adherence to WHO care standards. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests to highlight disparities. The study sample included 102 private and 7 public hospitals. A significantly higher proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals had pediatric inpatient departments (100% vs 39.2%), newborn wards (100% vs 12.8%), and trained nurses (100% vs 32.4%). Only private hospitals in the sample had neonatal intensive care units (6.9% vs 0%). Pediatricians were available for extended consultations at a greater proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals (71.4% vs 26.5%). These findings show substantial disparities in the availability of pediatric health care services between public and private hospitals in Bangladesh. Addressing these disparities through workforce investment and infrastructure improvements is crucial for equitable child health care and better health outcomes.",

We describe current inequities in the access to, and delivery of, PnPC. Drawing on philosophical theory (the Capabilities Approach) we argue that palliative care represents a valuable capability for babies with life limiting illness and their families.

In this study, we determined the proportion of adverse perinatal outcomes and identified associated factors among pregnant mothers of advanced age who delivered at Kabale Regional Referral Hospital (KRRH) in Southwestern Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional study at KRRH's Maternity Ward from March to August 2023. We enrolled post-delivery mothers aged ≥ 35 years. We collected data on socio-demographic, obstetric, and medical characteristics, as well as fetal outcomes, using interviewer-administered structured questionnaires. We defined an adverse perinatal outcome as the occurrence of any of the following complications: early neonatal death, preterm birth, congenital anomalies, macrosomia, low APGAR score, or low birth weight, sustained by the fetus or neonate during pregnancy, delivery, or the immediate post-delivery period before discharge from the hospital. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. We enrolled 417 participants, of whom 206 (49.4%) were aged 35-37 years. The majority (n = 273; 65.5%) were multiparous (parity ≥ 5). Adverse perinatal outcomes occurred in 8.4% (n = 36; 95% CI: 6.1-11.5%) of participants, with early neonatal death being the most common (3.6%), followed by low birth weight (2.4%), congenital anomalies (2.6%), macrosomia (1.4%), low APGAR score (1.4%), and preterm birth (1.2%). Prolonged labor (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.71, 95% CI: 1.40-9.85) and a history of abortion (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.17-5.60) were significantly associated with adverse fetal outcomes. Approximately 1 out of every 10 advanced-aged mothers surveyed experienced a poor perinatal outcome, with mothers who had prolonged labor or history of abortions having increased odds of the poor perinatal outcomes. We recommend strengthening close monitoring of labour and timely interventions to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes including early neonatal deaths.",

Accordingly, the identification and early management of possible risk factors can diminish ASD incidence. To determine the prevalence and severity of idiopathic ASD in Egyptian children aged 12 months to 12 years, and to identify the epidemiological, sociodemographic, and environmental risk factors contributing to this disorder. This study comprised 41,640 children from the main eight geographic areas in Egypt. It was conducted through four phases: household screening, facility-based screening for high-risk children, diagnosis confirmation, and risk factor assessment. The prevalence of ASD as confirmed by the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was 1.1% (455 out of 41,640), with significant geographic variability. Urban areas had a significantly higher prevalence than rural areas. Children aged 3-6 years showed the highest prevalence at 1.5%. Boys were four times more affected than girls, with prevalence rates of 1.7% and 0.4%, respectively. Significant risk factors included: a history of convulsions (AOR = 4.7; 95% CI: 3.3-6.79), low birth weight (AOR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.54-2.79), prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) longer than two days (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.46-2.49) and maternal health problems during pregnancy (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI:1.36-1.95). Regarding severity, 45% of diagnosed children had moderate ASD, 39% had severe ASD, and 16% had mild ASD. Female gender and older age were significant predictors of greater ASD severity. ASD prevalence in Egypt is comparable to other Middle Eastern countries. Policymakers should utilize these findings to design targeted public health interventions aimed at early detection, management, and prevention of ASD progression.",

        "abstract": "Tackling malnutrition in infants aged under 6 months (u6m) is a major global priority yet evidence around this vulnerable group is weak. We aimed to support the rollout of new 2023 WHO guidelines by examining the burden of infant malnutrition and potential programme caseloads with new enrolment criteria. Secondary analysis of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets. We calculated the number of underweight (low weight-for-age), wasting (low weight-for-length), stunting (low length-for-age) and low birth weight (LBW) infants. We assessed data quality by recording extreme or missing values. We calculated the population-weighted prevalence of anthropometric deficit and extrapolated to all low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We regressed being underweight and wasti on infant, maternal and household characteristics using logistic regression. We analysed 56 DHS surveys. There were more extreme (flagged) values for length-based measures (7.5% flagged for weight-for-length, 3.8% for length-for-age) than for weight-for-age (0.6% flagged). Overall, 17.4% of infants (95% CI: 16.9 to 18.0) were underweight, 15.5% (15.0-16.0) were wasted, 19.9% (19.3-20.5) were stunted and 15.0% (14.5-15.5) were LBW. This corresponds to an estimated burden in LMICs of 10.3 million underweight infants (4.1 million severely underweight), 9.2 million wasted (4.0 million severely wasted), 11.8 million stunted (5.4 million severely stunted) and 8.9 million LBW infants. Overlap of the indicators varied markedly in different regions/countries. Numerous factors were associated with both underweight and wasting; associations tended to be stronger and have greater biological plausibility with being underweight. Malnutrition in infants u6m is a major problem in LMICs. Local epidemiology should inform case identification in contextualised care services across health and nutrition. Data quality and stronger associations with health and social characteristics support the use of underweight as a key enrolment criterion. Since vulnerability may be due to or exacerbated by multiple factors, management must go beyond feeding support to address wider infant, maternal and mental health and social circumstances through integrated, multidisciplinary care systems.",

To investigate current practices and knowledge among midwives and obstetricians regarding umbilical cord clamping for term infants and the influence of socio-demographic and professional factors. This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with 274 midwives and 51 obstetricians from 25 public hospitals that provide intrapartum care in Jordan. A paper-based questionnaire assessed current practices and knowledge regarding umbilical cord clamping. Most midwives and obstetricians (69.8 %) reported routinely performing early cord clamping for term infants (within < 1 minute of childbirth). Around 61 % of participants reported poor knowledge regarding the benefits of delayed cord clamping. While participants with Bachelor and higher degree level education achieved higher knowledge scores, age was inversely correlated. Participants aged over 30 years, with more than 5 years' experience, diploma level qualifications, obstetricians, and those with poor knowledge were more likely to perform early cord clamping. Around two-thirds of midwives and obstetricians reported poor knowledge regarding the benefits of delayed cord clamping and were more likely to perform early cord clamping. Results highlight the need for national guidelines in Jordan in conjunction with continued education and training regarding umbilical cord clamping.",

Patients for whom no source of infection is identified after a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are classified as having fever without source. Special considerations should be taken in the evaluation of neonates and neutropenic patients as they are at higher risk of serious bacterial infection. Patients with prolonged fever lasting >3 weeks who have no identifiable source of fever are classified with fever of unknown origin and represent an additional subset of febrile pediatric patients that also require special consideration. This document summarizes the relevant literature and provides expert recommendations for the selection of the initial imaging in four common clinical scenarios in pediatric patients with fever without source or unknown origin. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

        "abstract": "Worldwide, neonatal mortality is a major public health burden especially in the developing countries. Several factors are associated with neonatal mortality at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with neonatal mortality among neonates admitted to the NICU at St. Mary's Hospital Lacor in Northern Uganda. The study collected quantitative data through retrospective descriptive review of records of 423 systematically sampled neonates admitted to the NICU between January 1st 2023 and December 31st 2023. Socio demographics, pregnancy related and neonatal variables of mothers and the neonates admitted to the NICU were entered in a pre-tested data abstraction tool adapted and modified from a similar study. Neonatal mortality was described as a proportion of the total number of neonates who were admitted. Logistic regression analyses using odds ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the association between possible factors associated with neonatal mortality. An adjusted odds ratio (aOR), namely an odds ratio (OR) that has been adjusted to account for other predictor variables, is provided. Data was analysed using SPSS 27.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). There were 74 (17.49%) neonatal deaths. 70.27% of the neonatal deaths were early neonatal deaths. Preterm deaths contributed over 81.10% to the overall mortality. Preterm birth (aOR = 3.81, 95% CI 1.14 - 12.78), low APGAR at 5 min (aOR = 4.52, 95% CI 2.04 - 10.01), and late initiation of breastfeeding (OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.50 - 5.18) were significant factors associated with neonatal death. The neonatal mortality rate in NICU observed in this study was high. The majority of the deaths occurred in the early neonatal period. More than 80% of deaths recorded were due to prematurity. Preterm birth, low birth weight, low 5th minute APGAR score and late initiation of breastfeeding were significant risk factors for neonatal death. Efforts to address preterm birth, quality neonatal resuscitation and early initiation of breastfeeding are critical to achieving survival goals in newborns.",

Pain is common among patients with cancer, particularly in the advanced stages of the disease, where the prevalence is estimated to exceed 70%. In our setting, the prevalence of cancer pain is high (59.9%), which makes the study of cancer pain management essential in order to identify specific gaps in current practices. This research aimed to enhance the quality of pain management and to improve patient care and safety in accordance with the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) cancer pain management guidelines. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2 to August 1, 2024. All consecutive adult patients in the oncology ward during this period were included. Data were collected according to the ESMO guidelines through direct observations, chart reviews, and interviews. The data were then entered into EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Stata version 17 for analysis. The study included 171 patients, of whom 96 (56.14%) were women. The overall compliance rate for oncologic pain management according with the ESMO guidelines was 55.46%. The ages of the participants ranged from 23 to 85 years, with a mean age of 51.2 years. The pain severity and the treatment outcomes were assessed regularly and consistently using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for all 171 patients (100%). However, the subcutaneous route was considered as the first choice in only 2 (1.16%) patients who were unable to receive opioids via the oral route. In this study, the overall compliance with the adult oncologic pain management guidelines was found to be suboptimal.

A retrospective analysis was conducted with 416 pregnant women, divided into two groups: an observation group (n=210) who consistently took folic acid throughout pregnancy, and a control group (n=206) who only supplemented during early pregnancy. Key outcomes included plasma folate, HCY, and FOA levels, as well as pregnancy complications and neonatal outcomes. Plasma folate levels were significantly higher in the observation group (10.42±2.96 ng/mL) compared to the control group (7.51±1.58 ng/mL, P<0.001). HCY levels were lower in the observation group (6.54±1.51 mmol/L) versus the control group (10.58±1.27 mmol/L, P<0.001). FOA levels were also higher in the observation group (486.42±105.29 ng/mL) compared to the control (430.20±75.12 ng/mL, P<0.001). The observation group had reduced rates of cesarean section (26.19% vs. 36.41%, P=0.025), anemia (3.81% vs. 8.74%, P=0.038), and hypertension during pregnancy (5.24% vs. 11.65%, P=0.018). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between plasma folate and FOA (r=0.116, P<0.05) and negative correlations between plasma folate and HCY (r=-0.411, P<0.05) and between FOA and HCY (r=-0.286, P<0.05). The observation group had significantly lower FBG and P2BG levels and a reduced incidence of gestational anemia and HIP compared to the control group (P<0.05). Cesarean sections were also less frequent in the observation group. Newborns in the observation group had significantly greater height, weight, head circumference, and chest circumference than those in the control group (P<0.05). Consistent folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy significantly improves maternal folate status, decreases pregnancy-related complications, and enhances neonatal health outcomes. These findings underscore the need for continuous folic acid intake during pregnancy, which could inform clinical guidelines and public health policies to optimize maternal and neonatal health.",

        "abstract": "Most of the 2.3 million annual neonatal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis being the leading causes of neonatal mortality. Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines.",

        "abstract": "This study was undertaken to describe a cohort of pediatric patients with status epilepticus (SE) in Italy over the past decade, focusing on the variability of treatment protocols among centers, adherence to guidelines, and potential predictors of refractoriness. This is a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study including patients aged 1 month to 18 years who experienced convulsive SE (CSE) between January 2010 and June 2022. Variables analyzed included age at CSE onset, etiology, and treatment. We included 1374 CSE episodes in 1071 patients (median age = 3.3 years); 46% occurred in the first 3 years of life. The prominent etiology was remote symptomatic (32%). Resolution was obtained only with benzodiazepine administration in 19.2% of SE episodes. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and midazolam by infusion were the drugs most frequently used. Maximum therapeutic response occurred with low-dose (<.2 mg/kg/h) midazolam infusion administered at an early stage, following a single dose of benzodiazepine or an antiseizure medication (ASM; 59%). Midazolam effectiveness decreased to 37% when it was used after multiple ASMs, even at high doses. CSE was refractory in 39% of cases. Predictors of refractoriness included nonadherence to current guidelines, type of CSE, and etiology. This study emphasizes that low-dose midazolam infusion, not requiring endotracheal intubation and administered at an early phase, appears to be effective in permanently stopping seizure and preventing the evolution toward a refractory CSE. Given its proven efficacy and widespread use in many hospitals, early midazolam infusion could be considered in the management of pediatric CSE. Adherence to treatment protocols, specific etiologies, and type of CSE are correlated with refractoriness; thus, when facing SE in infants, these factors should guide treatment protocol selection, including medication choice and timing.",

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a noninvasive, real-time monitoring tool to assess tissue oxygenation and blood flow, potentially providing valuable insights into the impact of red blood cell transfusions in preterm infants with anemia. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of NIRS in assessing improvements in preterm infants after red blood cell transfusions. This study followed a systematic review and meta-analysis design, adhering to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and PRISMA guidelines. No geographic or temporal restrictions were imposed during the search. The final included studies spanned 2008-2017 and originated from four countries. A total of 214 articles were initially identified, and nine prospective observational studies were included in the final analysis. These studies focused on preterm infants diagnosed with anemia who required red blood cell transfusion therapy. The sample sizes in these studies ranged from 10 to 35 infants. The primary outcome was the changes in NIRS readings before and after transfusion. The secondary outcomes included changes in heart rate (HR), saturation of pulse oxygen (SPO<sub>2</sub>), and hemoglobin (Hb) pre- and post-transfusion. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant post-transfusion increases in CrSO<sub>2</sub> (mean difference [MD] = -8.51, 95% CI: -12.34 to -4.68) and SrSO<sub>2</sub> (MD = -15.68, 95% CI: -20.12 to -11.24). Subgroup analyses revealed greater improvements in CrSO<sub>2</sub> for infants with higher baseline anemia severity (MD = -14.76, 95% CI: -18.19 to -11.33) and in SrSO<sub>2</sub> (MD = -22.79, 95% CI: -26.96 to -18.62). Cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) and splanchnic fractional tissue oxygen extraction (sFTOE) also showed significant changes. Hemoglobin levels increased post-transfusion (MD = -2.89, 95% CI: -3.21 to -2.57), while heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO<sub>2</sub>) remained unchanged. The findings suggest that NIRS is a reliable tool for assessing the impact of red blood cell transfusions in preterm infants. PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024596069).",

The prevalence of overweight and obesity among our population was 27.9% and 6.5% respectively. The instances of normal vaginal delivery were significantly lower in overweight mothers than in those of normal weight. As the overweight score increased, the odds of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes increased by 2.148 and 1.319, respectively, while normal vaginal delivery experienced a decrease of 0.583. The likelihood of induced labor, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, vaginal delivery, and maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission was significantly different in obese mothers compared to those with normal weight. With each increase in the obesity score, the odds of induced labor, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and maternal ICU admission increased by 2.046, 3.079, 2.378, and 5.088 respectively. As the obesity score increased, the chances of a normal vaginal delivery decreased by 0.438. Overweight or obese mothers face the risks of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, labor induction, maternal ICU admission, and a reduced rate of normal vaginal deliveries. The likelihood of these conditions increases with a higher body mass index.",

        "abstract": "Maternal obesity and gestational weight gain (GWG) are important determinants of maternal and neonatal health outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of prepregnancy body mass index (PPBMI) and GWG on maternal and neonatal outcomes in Türkiye. This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a public hospital in Turkey between December 2021 and December 2022. A total of 1137 women between the ages of 19 and 45 who had singleton and live births and had complete medical records were included in the study using simple random sampling. Data were collected using medical records and a structured interview form. PPBMI and GWG were calculated from self-reported weight and height data. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, and binary logistic regression tests were used to analyze the data. Among the participants, 4.7% were underweight, 61% had a normal weight, 27.6% were overweight, and 9.9% were obese on the basis of PPBMI. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) GWG guidelines, 17.2% had insufficient GWG, 55.1% had adequate GWG, and 27.8% had excessive GWG. Overweight women had significantly increased odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.479, p = 0.024), genital tract infections (OR = 2.15, p = 0.000), urinary tract infections (OR = 2.42; p = 0.011), elective cesarean delivery (OR = 8.62, p = 0.035), macrosomia (OR = 9.15, p = 0.031), and low APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) scores (< 7 at 5 min) (OR = 0.20, p = 0.000). Obese women also showed higher odds of elective cesarean (OR = 9.56; p = 0.030) and macrosomia (OR = 8.27, p = 0.044). Underweight women had higher odds of neonatal hospital stay > 5 days. Insufficient GWG was associated with increased risks of low birth weight (OR = 0.46, p = 0.013), third-trimester bleeding (OR = 0.45, p = 0.016), and neonatal hospitalization > 5 days (OR = 0.44, p = 0.003), while macrosomia risk was lower (OR = 2.06, p = 0.001). PPBMI and GWG are significant predictors of maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Elevated PPBMI and inappropriate GWG are associated with increased risks of gestational diabetes, macrosomia, cesarean delivery, low APGAR scores, low birth weight, and prolonged neonatal hospitalization. These findings highlight the critical role of routine assessment and management of maternal weight status and weight gain during prenatal care in reducing preventable complications for both mothers and their newborns.",

        "abstract": "The first clinical experience in a hospital setting can be highly stressful for nursing students, often leading to significant anxiety. Addressing this issue requires effective interventions to help students transition smoothly into their clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational tour on preclinical anxiety among first-year nursing students. This quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2024 in Tehran. A total of 72 s-semester nursing students were selected through convenience sampling and assigned to either the control group (n = 37) or the intervention group (n = 35). Before the start of clinical training, the intervention group participated in an educational tour of the hospital, conducted by the researcher, while the control group received no intervention. Data were collected using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) one week before the clinical training and after its completion. After completing the clinical training, the mean trait anxiety score was 34.28 ± 7.89 in the control group and 31.30 ± 6.70 in the intervention group. However, an independent t-test revealed that the difference in post-intervention trait anxiety scores between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.089). In contrast, the mean state anxiety score after the intervention was 36.14 ± 7.38 in the control group and 31.21 ± 6.86 in the intervention group, demonstrating a significant reduction in anxiety levels among students who participated in the educational tour (p = 0.005). The findings suggest that an educational tour can effectively reduce preclinical anxiety among first-year nursing students, making it a valuable strategy for improving their transition into hospital-based clinical training.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. To improve the clinical outcomes of neonates with sepsis, treatment should be based on bacteriological identification and antibiotic susceptibility. This study aims to assess the proportion of culture-positive gram-negative bacteria (GNB), the antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and treatment outcomes of neonatal sepsis at two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Addis Ababa. A retrospective observational study was conducted among gram-negative sepsis suspected neonates admitted at Zewditu Memorial Hospital and Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital NICUs from January to December 2023. All neonates who were suspected of having sepsis were included in this study. Standard microbiological culture and biochemical tests were used to identify bacterial species and the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay using Mueller-Hinton agar was employed to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates as per Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with the treatment outcomes of neonatal sepsis. A p-value < 0.05 was set for statistical significance. A total of 933 neonates were diagnosed with sepsis during the study period, of which 166 neonates were enrolled in the study for gram-negative sepsis: 84 (51%) were female and 97 (58%) had early onset sepsis. The median length of hospital stay was nine days with interquartile range of 16 days. The predominant GNB identified was Klebsiella spp. (n = 89; 49%), followed by Acinetobacter spp. (n = 38; 21%) and Escherichia coli (n = 19; 11%). In both hospitals, Klebsiella spp. was resistant to most of the routinely prescribed antibiotics: (n = 68; 89%) were resistant to ceftriaxone, (n = 56, 89%) cefepime and (n = 60; 75%) to gentamicin. Lower rates of resistance were recorded for other antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (n = 12; 18%), ertapenem (n = 11; 16%), meropenem (n = 9; 13%), and amikacin (n = 3; 4%). A total of 92 (55%) neonates with the GNB isolated in the current study had multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms. The study found that newborns with MDR infections were five times more likely to experience poor treatment outcomes compared to those with non-resistant strains (AOR, 5.23 95% CI [2.59, 11.11]). In addition, newborns who stayed less than seven days, compared to those who spent seven or more days in the hospital was four times (AOR: 4.16, 95% CI (2.0-9.01) more likely to experience poor health outcomes. Klebsiella spp. was the most common GNB isolated from the NICUs. More than half neonatal sepsis was caused by MDR organisms and associated with significant poor treatment outcomes. high prevalence of MDR-gram-negative bacteremia is alarming and highlights the need for the implementation of routine surveillance and infection control measures to decrease morbidity and mortality and to combat the development of antimicrobial resistance.",

The study aimed to explore and describe home-based care for umbilical cords of neonates by family caregivers. The study was conducted at Waterval community, a village under Dr J.S Moroka local municipality in Nkangala district in the Mpumalanga province. A qualitative exploratory, descriptive research study design was used to explore home-based care for neonates' umbilical cords. The target population was family caregivers who had been caring for the umbilical cords of neonates at home. Non-probability and purposive sampling were done, and individual in-depth interviews were used for data collection. The sample size of 18 participants was determined by data saturation. Thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the data. The following main themes emerged during data analysis: substances applied on the umbilical cord, beliefs associated with umbilical cord care, the effectiveness of health education provided on discharge from the community health centre and the healing process. The findings of the study revealed that various harmful substances were applied to the umbilical cords of neonates, and these practices were influenced by cultural beliefs. The findings of the study brought to light that indeed, the application of substances that have not been recommended by the South African guidelines on neonates' umbilical cord does lead to delayed umbilical cord separation and healing and has the potential to cause neonatal infections.",

Our objective was to reduce growth impairment in these infants by 20% in a 12-month period and sustain over 12 months. Eight neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) participated in the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative-led multisite quality improvement (QI) project, comprising a baseline, active, and sustainability phase. Eligible infants underwent intestinal surgery in the NICU between January 2021 to June 2023. Outcome measure was infants leaving the NICU with a weight z-score decline exceeding (>)1.2 standard deviations from birthweight. Process measures included adherence to parenteral nutrition (PN) guidelines, nutrition rounds, and feeding guidelines. Balancing measures included necrotizing enterocolitis, metabolic acidosis, and feeding intolerance rates. Multisite learning sessions and meetings were held. Each NICU implemented local QI strategies. Measures were analyzed in control charts. 581 infants were included. During the active phase, growth impairment remained unchanged at 25%. Adherence to PN guidelines increased from 49% to 68%, nutrition rounds increased from 82% to 91%, and feeding guideline increased from 28% to 68%. In the sustainability phase, growth impairment worsened to 27%. Adherence to nutrition rounds decreased to 82%, PN guidelines increased to 95%, and feeding guidelines sustained at 68%. Balancing measures remained unchanged. Despite no change in growth impairment, multiple centers implemented strategies to optimize nutrition in infants who underwent surgery. Additional data on nutrient delivery, other anthropometrics, and nonnutrition factors should be considered in future studies.",

The rate of delivery prior to 37 weeks and several secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between patients with and without progesterone supplementation after cerclage. Multivariable regression, subgroup, and matched pairs analyses were performed in order to account for the formulation of progesterone, indication for cerclage, and other potential confounding variables. The study was powered a priori to detect a difference in our primary outcome.Among 451 patients, there were 163 history-, 135 ultrasound-, and 153 examination-indicated cerclages. Overall, 284 (63%) received adjuvant progesterone. Adjuvant progesterone was associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery before 37 weeks (45 vs. 34%, <i>p</i> = 0.03) with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.78 (95% confidence interval: 1.14 and 2.80) in our multivariable model. The median latency from cerclage placement to delivery was shorter when progesterone was used (119 vs. 139 days, <i>p</i> < 0.001). There was no benefit of adjuvant progesterone when analyzed by formulation of progesterone or indication for cerclage or when analyzing pairs matched based on propensity score matching. There were no differences in secondary outcomes for pregnant patients or their offspring.Adjuvant progesterone does not decrease the preterm delivery rate and may in fact cause harm by decreasing latency from cerclage to delivery. Maternal and neonatal outcomes do not vary with supplemental progesterone after cerclage.

To compare growth in children with a history of AKI compared to those without AKI. We hypothesized that children with AKI would have worse growth compared to those without AKI. A convenience sample of existing prospective and retrospective cohorts of children with AKI who had already collected or were able to collect data on growth parameters before and after an episode of AKI. There are < 5 studies in the published literature on growth in children with AKI. These investigators were contacted, and additional studies were added by contacting primary investigators of studies of childhood AKI in which data on growth parameters was able to be collected. Children from existing cohorts evaluating AKI (exposure) during childhood. Each included cohort had previously received local IRB approval per institutional guidelines. As our study was a meta-analysis and only used cohort-level data, no IRB approval was required for this report. Growth parameters (length and weight z-scores) before and after an episode of AKI were compared using a meta-means analysis. MOOSE guidelines were used. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Hedges g was calculated, and Higgins I<sup>2</sup> statistic was used to define variability due to between-cohort heterogeneity. We included 3,586 children from 17 existing cohorts of AKI in various populations, including infants, children with cardiac disease, solid organ transplant and critically ill children without cardiac disease with follow-up from 12 months to 11 years after AKI. At most distant follow-up, those with AKI had lower length z-score than those without AKI (mean difference -0.37 [95%CI -0.52, -0.22, p < 0.001]) and lower weight z-score (mean difference of -0.29 [95%CI -0.43, -0.15, p < 0.001]). This difference was most striking in infants, as those with AKI had impaired growth (both length z-score and weight z-score) after AKI compared to those without AKI. The analysis included only a convenience sample of observational cohorts of children, study selection could have been biased, and we did not evaluate the relationship between decreased kidney function (e.g., chronic kidney disease) after AKI in these cohorts and its relationship to poor growth. This meta-analysis found that children with AKI have impaired growth after AKI. These findings were most striking in infants.

        "abstract": "Rapidly increasing healthcare spending globally is significantly driven by high-need, high-cost (HNHC) patients, who account for the top 5% of annual healthcare costs but over half of total expenditures. The programs targeting existing HNHC patients have shown limited long-term impact, and research predicting HNHC pediatric patients in China is limited. There is an urgent need to establish a specific, valid, and reliable prediction model using machine-learning-based methods to identify potential HNHC pediatric patients and implement proactive interventions before high costs arise. This study used a 7-year retrospective cohort dataset from two administrative databases in Shanghai, covering pediatric patients under 18 years. The machine-learning-based models were developed to predict HNHC status using logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes. This study divided the data from 2021-2022 into 70:30 as a training set and a test set, with the internal class balancing approach of the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). A grid search strategy was employed with k-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters. Model performance was assessed by 5 metrics: Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The external validation from 2022-2023 data and the internal validation using different train-test ratios (80:20 and 90:10) were used to assess the robustness of the trained models. Among the 91,882 hospitalized children included in 2021, significant differences were found in socioeconomics, disease, healthcare service utilization, previous healthcare expenditure, and hospital characteristics between the HNHC and non-HNHC groups. The hospitalization costs for HNHC pediatric patients accounted for over 35% of total spending. The MLP model demonstrated the highest predictive performance (ROC-AUC: 0.872), followed by RF (0.869), KNN (0.836), and naive Bayes (0.828). The most important predictive factors included length of stay, number of hospitalizations, previous HNHC status, age, and presence of Top 20 HNHC diseases. MLP showed robustness as the most efficient model in external validation (ROC-AUC: 0.843) and internal validation using different train-test ratios (ROC-AUC: 0.826 in 80:20 ratio; 0.807 in 90:10 ratio). Machine learning models, particularly MLP, effectively predict HNHC pediatric patients, providing a basis for early identification of HNHC and proactive healthcare interventions into clinical practice. This approach can also assist policymakers and payers in optimizing healthcare resource allocation, controlling healthcare costs, and improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Emergency caesarean section (EMCS) is a life-saving procedure carried out with urgency appropriate to the risk posed to the safety of baby and/or the mother. A decision to delivery interval (DDI) is the time from making the decision for cesarean section to delivery of the neonate. Delayed DDI can result in adverse obstetric outcomes and is thus an indicator of poor quality obstetric care. This study aimed to determine the decision to delivery interval and predictors for delayed decision to delivery interval among women delivering by emergency caesarean section at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in South western Uganda. We conducted a prospective cohort study on women delivering by emergency caesarean section. Women with category I or II indications as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were consecutively enrolled from December 2023 to March 2024. Delayed DDI was defined as DDI interval > 75 min. We performed a modified Poisson regression analysis to determine predictors for delayed DDI. A total of 504 participants were enrolled. The mean age of the respondents was 26.4 (± 5.25) years. Majority 453 (89.9%) were married, 282 (56.0%) unemployed and 271 (53.8%) had been referred in. Overall median decision to delivery interval was 167.5 min. The proportion of women with delayed DDI was 77.2% (95% CI: 73.3-80.8). Predictors for delayed DDI were prior caesarean delivery (aRR 1.15, 95%CI:1.02-1.28), need for stabilisation before surgery (aRR 1.15, 95%CI: 1.01-1.39), need to buy sundries (aRR 1.76, 95%CI: 1.20-2.57), Lack of prior communication to the theatre team (aRR 1.14, 95%CI: 1.03-1.25), unavailability of theatre operating room (aRR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.14-1.32), unavailability of sterile linen (aRR 1.18, 95%CI: 1.03-1.35) and unavailability of anaesthesia provider (aRR 1.40, 95%CI: 1.26-1.55). Majority of the women at MRRH experience delayed DDI and it takes about 3 h to have an EMCS. Women with a prior caesarean section, those who require stabilization before surgery, the need to buy sundries, the lack of operating room, and lack of prior communication to the theatre team, sterile linen and anaesthesia provider are predictors for delayed DDI. We recommend mobilization of resources to address these health system gaps.",

        "title": "Knowledge and Awareness of Family Physicians as Key Stakeholders Regarding Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip and the Nationwide Screening Program.",
        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the knowledge levels and awareness of family physicians about Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) and the Nationwide Newborn Hip Screening Program in Turkey. This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2021, involving 401 family physicians working at Family Health Centers (FHC) in Istanbul. A face-to-face survey, developed based on the literature and validated by experts, assessed participants' knowledge, awareness, and practices regarding DDH and the nationwide screening program. The survey consisted of two sections: a Participant Information Form (14 socio-demographic and professional questions) and 30 knowledge-based questions (8 using a Likert scale). Among the 401 family physicians who participated in the study, 109 (27.2%) reported actively managing patients diagnosed with DDH. Over the past year, 20,124 babies were stated to be screened, with 2.98% identified as having pathological ultrasonography results. The overall knowledge and awareness score (for DDH, program details and practices) was 66.59 ± 8.4%, positively associated with following babies with DDH (p=0.042), attending congresses/symposiums (p=0.008), specialty training (p=0.022; r=0.156), receiving in-service training and online education on hip screening program (p=0.002; r=0.167), and screening a higher number of babies (p<0.001). 71.3% of participants recommended double diapering for babies with high risk factors, while 70.3% used provocative tests such as the Barlow-Ortolani. Knowledge awareness scores about the hip screening program were significantly higher in those who followed DDH patients (p<0.001), attended congress and symposiums (p=0.006), screened higher number of babies (r=0.216, p<0.001), had specialty training (p=0.005), female physicians (p=0.012), used multiple training resources (p=0.002), and considered themselves competent in DDH (p<0.001). Awareness of DDH risk factors and treatment remained relatively low (49.2% and 64.1%, respectively). Perception of self-competency scores were significantly higher in family medicine specialists (p=0.020), those with 10+ years of experience (p=0.003), and those managing DDH cases (p<0.001). Family physicians in Istanbul demonstrate adequate knowledge and awareness regarding DDH and the nationwide screening program, influenced by factors such as managing DDH cases, postgraduate training, access to educational resources, and participation in professional events. Female physicians have greater knowledge and awareness about the hip screening program. Higher perception of self-competency levels were observed in family medicine specialists, and those with over 10 years of experience or active involvement in DDH care. Addressing gaps in knowledge about risk factors, diagnostic methods, and treatments is critical. Targeted educational initiatives, periodic in-service training, and updated guidelines can enhance DDH management and screening practices, while correcting misconceptions such as the e!ectiveness of double diapering.

        "abstract": "Prolonged second stage of labour may lead to maternal and perinatal complications. Options for clinical management are augmentation with oxytocin, instrumental vaginal birth or second-stage caesarean section. We aimed to describe incidence, management and outcome of prolonged second stage of labour in a rural hospital in Malawi. Retrospective analysis of medical records and partographs of all women who gave birth in 2015-2016 in a rural mission hospital in Malawi, comparing labour tracings with management protocols. Primary outcomes were incidence of prolonged second stage, instrumental vaginal birth and caesarean section. Furthermore, management and outcomes were assessed. Women arriving in hospital in the second stage of labour were compared to women arriving in an earlier stage of labour. Of all 3,426 women giving birth in the study period, 566 (16.5%) presented while already in the second stage. Based on their partographs, 307 (9.0% of 3426) were diagnosed with prolonged second stage. Of these women, 22 (7.2%) had labour augmented with oxytocin, 31 (10.1%) gave birth by vacuum extraction and 64 (20.9%) by caesarean section. Spontaneous vaginal birth occurred in 212 (69.0%). Women with prolonged second stage had an increased risk of having any complication, postpartum haemorrhage being the commonest. There was no difference in neonatal outcomes between women with or without a documented prolonged second stage. Of the 566 women presenting in the second stage, 538 (95.1%) had spontaneous vaginal births and 38 (6.7%) ended up having prolonged second stage registered in their partographs. Prolonged second stage of labour was relatively common, and perhaps under-diagnosed due to a very sizeable proportion of women arriving whilst already in the second stage, of whom most gave birth spontaneously. Caesarean section occurred twice as often as vacuum extraction, suggesting a role for additional training and decision-making during childbirth to support the use of vacuum extraction.",

        "abstract": "Enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery protocols include evidence-based interventions designed to improve patient experience, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes while reducing healthcare-related costs. This is the first update of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines for antenatal and preoperative care before cesarean delivery after the original publication in 2018. Interventions were selected based on expert consensus using the Delphi method. An updated literature search was conducted in September 2024 using the Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Targeted searches were performed by a medical librarian to identify relevant articles published since the 2018 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines publication, which evaluated each antenatal and preoperative enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery intervention, focusing on randomized clinical trials and large observational studies (≥800 patients) to maximize search feasibility and relevance. Following a review of the evidence, a consensus was reached regarding the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for each proposed intervention according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The 6 recommended enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery interventions are (1) antenatal pathway patient education for scheduled caesarean delivery (evidence low to very low, recommendation strong); (2) multidisciplinary medical and surgical staff education regarding enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery support, intervention implementation, and measurement (evidence low, recommendation strong); (3) optimization of the medical care for pregnant patients with comorbid conditions, such as anemia, obesity, hypertension, prepregnancy and gestational diabetes, smoking (tobacco, cannabis, vaping), congenital heart disease, epilepsy, autoimmune disease, and asthma (evidence moderate, recommendation strong); (4) abdominal skin preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate impregnated cloth (evening before scheduled cesarean delivery) (evidence moderate; recommendation weak); (5) the duration of preoperative fasting based on the content intake (evidence low, recommendation weak); (6) the use of a preoperative, nonparticulate carbohydrate drink (evidence low-moderate, recommendation strong). The first 3 recommendations are for use in the antenatal period (10-38 weeks of gestation), which allow for the optimization of patient comorbidities, whereas the remaining 3 recommendations are for preoperative interventions (skin preparation, preoperative fasting directives, and preoperative carbohydrate supplementation). Educational tools for cesarean delivery with well-designed shared decision-making focus on comorbidity management should be developed. These management tasks are viewed as routine care; however, the measurable success and impact have clinical variance. The enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery goal for patients who are undergoing a scheduled caesarean delivery is to maximize the quality of the pregnant patient's recovery and the fetal-neonatal outcome.",

        "abstract": "To explore neonatal unit policy and practice, and neonatal healthcare workers' experiences, beliefs and perceptions of twin cobedding in Australia. A two-part convergent mixed methods design was used. Part 1 data were collected via an online survey of neonatal units. Part 2 data were collected by focus groups and interviews with healthcare workers. Findings were integrated to create final results. 21 neonatal units, and 17 healthcare workers participated in this study. Significant variations in twin cobedding practices were reported within and across neonatal units. Practice variation was influenced by several interlinked factors, captured in four themes: (1) Policy-Driven Practitioners in a Policy Vacuum; (2) Evidence, Knowledge and Education; (3) Personal Beliefs and Practice Observations; and (4) \"The Parent Owns that Baby\"-Being Family-Centred. Due to widespread practice and policy variations, and a lack of evidence-based education for staff, healthcare workers appear to be making individual decisions regarding cobedding practice, potentially creating confusion for twin families navigating care. Improvements to twin cobedding practice education are needed to enable clinicians to support twin families in their care. Separation of twins in neonatal units needs to be addressed, regardless of twin cobedding practice. Research identifying benefits and any potential risks of twin cobedding practice is required. Neonatal healthcare workers are policy-driven practitioners who value clear evidence and education to confidently support the families in their care. It is important that evidence-based guidelines for twin cobedding are developed to support them in family-centred clinical practice. MMAT guidelines were used to prepare this manuscript.

        "abstract": "Intestinal organoids provide physiologically relevant in vitro models that bridge the gap between conventional cell culture and animal studies. Although these systems have been developed for adult cattle, their use in neonatal calves-who are particularly vulnerable to enteric disease-has not been well established. Neonatal diarrhea remains a major health concern in modern agriculture, yet age-appropriate models for studying its pathogenesis are lacking. Given that host-pathogen interactions vary with developmental stage, there is a need for culture systems that reflect the distinct biology of the neonatal gut. In this study, we developed intestinal organoids and organoid-derived monolayers from 14-day-old dairy calves to enable research on early-life intestinal function and disease. Organoids were successfully established from five intestinal sections of 14-day-old dairy calves using customized growth media and characterized by immunofluorescence and gene expression analyses. They remained viable for over 300 days of cryopreservation and were serially passaged at least 15 times. Rectal organoid-derived monolayers were further assessed by electron microscopy and barrier function assays, demonstrating stable transepithelial electrical resistance and controlled paracellular permeability. Optimized methods for adult bovine intestinal organoids and rectal organoid-derived monolayers are applicable to neonatal intestinal epithelial stem cells. Organoids cultured from 14-day-old calves captured key aspects of the multicellularity and functionality of the native epithelium. Future work should focus on adapting monolayer culture methods for additional gut regions, particularly the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Neonatal rectal monolayers represent a promising platform for advancing veterinary research, agricultural innovation, and studies of zoonotic disease.",

        "abstract": "Progress in reducing neonatal mortality in low- and middle-income countries in Central Asia, such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, has been slow. We aimed to explore deficiencies in neonatal care quality, highlight areas for improvement, and propose evidence-based actions to promote further progress in both countries. In this mixed-methods study, we evaluated neonatal care quality before and after a two-year quality improvement (QI) project in nine maternity hospitals in Kyrgyzstan and ten in Tajikistan. Through service visits, medical record reviews, direct observations, and interviews with staff and mothers, a multidisciplinary team of national and international experts and local managers assessed care quality using a tool developed by the World Health Organization, with scores ranging from 0 to 3. The QI cycle included establishing a QI team, developing an action plan, building healthcare providers' capacity, providing supportive supervision, and initiating policy changes, with all initiatives reviewed during semi-annual collaborative QI meetings. At baseline, neonatal care quality was suboptimal (scores 1.0-1.9) across all assessed areas. By the project's conclusion, improvements were seen in routine care (Kyrgyzstan +0.4, Tajikistan +0.5), sick newborn care (+0.6 in both), hospital care accessibility (Kyrgyzstan +0.5, Tajikistan +0.8), and monitoring/follow-up (Kyrgyzstan +0.3, Tajikistan +0.9). Tajikistan also progressed in guidelines, training, audits (+0.8), and maternal/newborn rights (+0.5). However, hospital support services remained below good practice standards (<2.0) in both countries, and no significant improvements (<0.3) occurred in advanced newborn care or infection prevention. Comprehensive QI interventions have led to significant enhancements in neonatal care quality in both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, critical gaps persist in certain essential areas that must be addressed. Ongoing, evidence-based QI efforts, alongside close monitoring, nationwide expansion, and strong government support, are essential to guarantee continued progress in these countries.",

        "abstract": "To assess the relationship between perinatal factors, and echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) dimensions after delivery in infants who are large for gestational age (LGA). This prospective cohort study that was conducted between 2014 and 2018, and involved healthy LGA newborns born ≥ 35 weeks' gestation, delivered at New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, and a control group of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. Data were analyzed using multivariate linear regression in STATA. A total of 563 neonates were enrolled in this study. They were composed of 414 AGA infants as the control group and 149 LGA infants as the intervention group. Males were predominant in both groups. A larger proportion of neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in LGA infants (74.6%) as compared to the AGA infants (33.5%) (p < 0.001). Regression analysis identified birth weight (BW) as a key factor, positively correlating with increased LVmass, interventricular septum thickness, and LV posterior wall thickness in both LGA and AGA infants. Additionally, BW showed a positive correlation with left ventricular internal dimensions in diastole and systole. Higher maternal BMI was associated with an increase in fractional shortening in LGA infants, while maternal insulin use during pregnancy was positively associated with interventricular septum thickness. Notably, male infants exhibited significantly higher LV internal dimensions in both diastole and systole, while GA negatively impacted the left ventricular mass index. The study's findings underscore the significant influence of perinatal factors on neonatal cardiac morphology in both LGA and AGA infants. Certain perinatal variables were identified as key determinants affecting various aspects of LV structure. These insights highlight the importance of considering these perinatal factors in neonatal cardiac assessments for early detection and intervention.",

        "abstract": "Despite Ethiopia's adoption of the Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses (IMNCI) strategy, pneumonia continues to be the leading infectious cause of death among under-five children. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the proportion of under-five children who had received the accurate diagnostic classification and appropriate treatment for symptoms of pneumonia using the IMNCI guideline and to identify factors associated with guideline adherence. A cross-sectional study was conducted between March and July 2023 among sick under-five children who visited health centres in the South Gondar zone, northwest Ethiopia. We employed two-stage random sampling. Observation of healthcare providers' clinical assessment, diagnosis and treatment; re-assessing children; interviewing caregivers and healthcare providers; and facility audit were applied to collect the data. Both descriptive and multilevel binary logistic regression analyses were done. Only 35.6% (95% CI: 33.2, 38.0) of sick children with pneumonia symptoms received the correct classification and treatment. Factors associated with accurate diagnostic classification and appropriate treatment included being a young infant (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.4), absence of fever (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), longer consultation times (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9), receiving care from healthcare providers who referred to the chart booklet during diagnosis and treatment (AOR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.8, 5.4), taking the IMNCI training (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.7), lower patient caseloads (AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6) and having regular review meetings on health services quality (AOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.5). The proportion of correct classification and treatment of sick children with pneumonia symptoms was low, leading to poor treatment outcomes, irrational use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. Almost all cluster-level associated factors are modifiable. Strengthening accountability, mentoring and implementing tailored strategies are crucial to enhancing healthcare providers' adherence to the IMNCI guidelines.",

This scoping review explores emergency ambulance clinician involvement with OOHBs, and patient and clinician experiences with birthing in the out-of-hospital setting. Scoping review using the Joanna Briggs Institute framework and 'participant, concept, context' criteria. CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Web of Science and Wiley Online were searched until 20 February 2024. Articles discussing an unplanned OOHB, or a planned home birth with complications where an emergency ambulance was required, were included. Two reviewers independently determined inclusion using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. A data extraction tool summarised findings for descriptive synthesis. 63 articles were included. 36 articles involved retrospective research. 38 articles were published since 2015, with USA (n=17) and Australia (n=13) the highest contributors. Risk factors for OOHBs were varied, with maternal age or being multigravida/multiparous often cited. 99 complications were described, ranging from relatively minor ailments (ie, nausea and vomiting) to life-threatening situations such as maternal or neonatal cardiac arrest. Common management/interventions reported were assisting with birth, maternal intravenous cannulation and medication administration.Birth parents, partners and clinicians all describe OOHBs as anxiety-provoking but joyous when a healthy neonate is born. The OOHB experience is enhanced for patients when clinicians communicate well, while those who appeared inexperienced increased patient anxiety.OOHBs experience many challenges to optimal care, categorised as 'emergency ambulance clinicians desiring additional education and training', 'communication and collaboration difficulties', 'environmental issues', 'technology and aids' and 'other' limitations. OOHBs are rare events requiring expert assistance to optimise patient outcomes. There remain significant challenges to unplanned OOHBs; ongoing training and skill competency is required to improve patient safety and clinician confidence.

        "title": "Epidemiology and surgical management of obstetric brachial plexus injury: a national cohort study.",
        "abstract": "Obstetric brachial plexus injury (OBPI) is a serious and complex nerve injury in newborns. To date, large-scale studies and guidelines for managing OBPI are scarce, and there are major regional differences in its epidemiology and clinical management. The authors of this national cohort study aimed to report on OBPI's current epidemiology and surgical management strategies in Germany. Patients hospitalized in Germany between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2018, with OBPI as their primary diagnosis were identified using the ICD-10 codes P14.0 (Erb palsy), P14.1 (Klumpke palsy), and P14.3 (other brachial plexus birth injuries). Operation and Procedure Classification System codes were used to allow analysis of surgical management. A total of 2069 patients with OBPI who had been hospitalized within their 1st year of life were included in the study. Erb palsy was the most frequent OBPI subtype (66.60%). The total number of live births increased significantly from 685,795 in 2005 to 787,523 in 2018 (p < 0.001), resulting in an overall OBPI rate of 0.21 per 1000 births over the years. The incidence of OBPI per 1000 live births significantly decreased by 47.57%, from 0.28 in 2005 to 0.15 in 2018 (p < 0.001), representing a mean annual decrease of 0.010 ± 0.026. Subgroup analysis also showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in all three OBPI subtypes (ICD-10 codes P14.0, P14.1, and P14.3). Simultaneously, the rates of cesarean delivery significantly varied, ranging from 26.73% to 28.08% from 2005 to 2018 (p < 0.001). The most frequent risk factor for OBPI was being large for gestational age (13.83%), followed by instrumental delivery or cephalohematoma (6.30%). Total rates of surgical management ranged from 1.86% to 41.11% and had an increasing proportional trend over time (p = 0.002). Subanalysis of the different surgical treatment modalities demonstrated an increasing trend in surgical explorations and neurolyses (p = 0.001). Length of hospital stay among patients treated for OBPI remained relatively constant throughout the study period with a mean range of 3.57-4.93 days, indicating no significant change (p = 0.52). OBPI is a rare disease, with a decreasing incidence paralleled by an increase in cesarean birth delivery rates between 2005 and 2018 in Germany. Total surgical management rates rose with a significant trend toward increasing microsurgical explorations and neurolyses. Being large for gestational age was identified as the main infantile risk factor for OBPI.",

        "title": "Implementation of national guidelines on antenatal magnesium sulfate for neonatal neuroprotection: extended evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the National PReCePT Programme in England.",
        "abstract": "Since 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines have recommended antenatal magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) for mothers in preterm labour (<30 weeks' gestation) to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in the preterm baby. However, the implementation of this guideline in clinical practice was slow, and MgSO<sub>4</sub> use varied between maternity units. In 2018, the PRrevention of Cerebral palsy in PreTerm labour (PReCePT) programme, an evidence-based quality improvement (QI) intervention to improve use of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, was rolled out across England. Earlier evaluation found this programme to be effective and cost-effective over the first 12 months. We extended the original evaluation to determine the programme's longer-term impact over 4 years, its impact in later preterm births, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare MgSO<sub>4</sub> use in England (where PReCePT was implemented) to Scotland and Wales (where it was not). Quasi-experimental longitudinal study using data from the National Neonatal Research Database on babies born <30 weeks' gestation and admitted to a National Health Service neonatal unit. Primary outcome was the percentage of eligible mothers receiving MgSO<sub>4</sub>, aggregated to the national level. Impact of PReCePT on MgSO<sub>4</sub> use was estimated using multivariable linear regression. The net monetary benefit (NMB) of the programme was estimated. MgSO<sub>4</sub> administration rose from 65.8% in 2017 to 85.5% in 2022 in England. PReCePT was associated with a 5.8 percentage points improvement in uptake (95% CI 2.69 to 8.86, p<0.001). Improvement was greater when including older preterm births (<34 weeks' gestation, 8.67 percentage points, 95% CI 6.38 to 10.96, p<0.001). Most gains occurred in the first 2 years following implementation. PReCePT had a NMB of £597 000 with 89% probability of being cost-effective. Following implementation, English uptake appeared to accelerate compared with Scotland and Wales. There was some decline in use coinciding with the onset of the pandemic. The PReCePT QI programme cost-effectively improved use of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub>, with anticipated benefits to the babies who have been protected from CP.",

        "title": "Infant-level and child-level predictors of mortality in low-resource settings: the WHO Child Mortality Risk Stratification Multi-Country Pooled Cohort.",
        "abstract": "Despite impressive reductions in overall global child mortality, the rate of decline has slowed during the past decade. Current guidelines for the care of paediatric patients in low-resource settings mostly focus on broad clinical syndromes or undernutrition rather than children's individual contextualised risk. We aimed to identify readily assessable child-level characteristics that can predict mortality risk in a range of community and health-care settings in high-burden settings. The WHO Child Mortality Risk Stratification Multi-Country Pooled Cohort (WHO-CMRS) included pooled data from individual children enrolled in observational or randomised controlled trials in low-income and middle-income countries. The criteria for inclusion of a dataset were documentation of age, weight, vital status, and date of death, and at least two observations per participant younger than 60 months. To calculate odds ratios, we built generalised linear mixed effects regression (glmer) models with each child and each study as random intercepts and time interval as the offset. In all analyses, the outcome was defined as death within the respective observation period of the child. From the glmer models, we predicted absolute risk of death per child-month associated with risk exposures separately and combined with anthropometry according to the following age groups: 0-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-23 months, and 24-59 months. Studies were grouped according to population types studied: the general population, populations selected based on anthropometric criteria, and populations selected based on the presence of illness. We analysed pooled data from WHO-CMRS, including 75 287 children from 33 studies done in 17 countries between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2021. During a total of 69 085 child-years of follow-up, 2805 (3·7%) children died. Age younger than 24 months, low anthropometry, preterm birth, low birthweight, and absence of breastfeeding (either was breastfeeding not offered or an underlying illness interfered with breastfeeding practices) were each associated with increased mortality: risks declined with increasing age. The highest absolute mortality risk was among the youngest children (age 0-5 months), with a weight-for-age Z score of less than -3 (ie, a predicted absolute risk of 11·0 [95% CI 6·2-19·5] per 1000 child-months in general population studies). Risks were additive: underlying risk exposures such as low birthweight and preterm birth added to the mortality risks in children with anthropometric deficit. For example, children aged 0-5 months with a weight-for-age Z score of less than -3 and a history of preterm birth had a predicted absolute mortality risk of 40·1 (95% CI 22·0-72·1). However, overall mortality and the association between child-level characteristics and mortality differed according to the type of study population and child age. Risk assessments combining individual child-level characteristics including anthropometry can enable programmes to identify children at high and lower risk of mortality and, thereafter, differentiate care accordingly. Such a strategy could reduce mortality and optimise health system efficiency and effectiveness. US Agency for International Development.

        "title": "Guidance strategies for infantile asymmetry prevention: a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Infantile asymmetries of posture, movement and/or shape are common. Coincidence in the presentation of asymmetrical features can lead to a broad spectrum of descriptors. Published guidelines on prevention strategies are not currently available. The objective of this systematic review was to find, evaluate, and synthesise the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of prevention strategies for infantile asymmetries, specifically strategies involving paediatric screening and/or guidance to parents. This review has been reported based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the review protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework, ( https://osf.io/rgzev/ ). Searches were conducted on Ovid Medline, Ovid AMED, and PEDro. Inclusion criteria of articles were infants < 28 weeks old who had received either an early musculoskeletal screen and/or education to parents on home care guidance/exercises to prevent asymmetry development. Any primary research was included. There was no limit placed upon date of publication. Data were screened, extracted and appraised in duplicate by at least two blinded reviewers. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias available as part of Covidence was used by two reviewers independently. Of the 878 papers retrieved, 19 studies were included: 9 randomised controlled trials, 6 cohort studies and 4 non-randomised experimental studies. The presenting conditions included head shape asymmetry in 16/19 studies, cervical range of motion in 10 studies and positional preference in 3. Due to a lack of homogeneity between all the studies, it was not possible to pool the data and conduct meta-analysis. Guidance strategies show better outcomes in asymmetry prevention when provided early (< 3 months) and under supervision of a healthcare professional. The overall risk of bias for cohort and non-randomised experimental studies was considered to be 'low', and 'adequate' or 'low' for randomised controlled trials. The GRADE level of evidence was found to be 'very low'. Early parental guidance may prevent infantile asymmetry when supervised by a trained healthcare professional and with good adherence from parents. Further studies with a higher methodological rigour are needed to identify and perform comparative interventions. Not applicable. OSF NUMBER: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RGZEV .",

        "abstract": "The provision of quality intrapartum care increases women's utilization of skilled birth attendants in health facilities and improves maternal and newborn health. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the quality of intrapartum care using the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS). Secondary data from the 2022 KDHS of 11,863 participants, who were selected by multistage stratified sampling, was used. Based on literature and the availability of indicators within the 2022 KDHS, the quality of intrapartum care was operationalized as receiving all the three clinical components of intrapartum care including a mother having a facility-based delivery, receiving skilled assistance during childbirth, and placing the newborn on the mother's breast within one hour from birth by the skilled birth attendant. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the data using SPSS (version 20). Of the 11,863 women who had recently given birth, about 52.6% had received quality intrapartum care. As part of the intrapartum care, 88.2% gave birth in a health facility, 90.4% obtained assistance from skilled birth attendants, and 59.8% had their babies placed on the breast by a birth attendant within 1 h after birth. Women who had attained secondary education (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23-1.90), were working (aOR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.00-1.53), had 3-4 living children (aOR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.68), took 31-60 min to reach the health facility (aOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.41-1.95), were assisted during childbirth by doctors (aOR = 19.86, 95% CI: 2.89-136.43) and nurses/midwives/clinical officers (aOR = 23.09, 95% CI: 3.36-158.89) had higher odds of receiving quality intrapartum care compared with their counterparts. On the other hand, women in the richest wealth index (aOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.98), those who gave birth through cesarean section (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.20-0.36) and those whose current age of their child was ≥ 2years (AOR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.96) were less likely to receive quality intrapartum care compared with their counterparts. About half of the women received quality intrapartum care in Kenya, with demographic characteristics seeming to be the main drivers of quality intrapartum care. Although the Kenyan government abolished maternity services fees in all public facilities, there is still a need to empower women through increasing access to education and economic development initiatives for their economic independence. This will enable mothers to pay transport fares to health facilities for those in hard-to-reach rural settings and buy other hospital delivery requirements (e.g., surgical gloves) that may not be available in rural public health facilities, thus increasing access to skilled birth attendance and quality intrapartum care as a whole. Its also worth noting, since Kenya is moving towards provision of quality intrapartum care, more and proper indicators of clinical intrapartum care need to be captured in future DHS studies. This will enable comprehensive assessment of the quality of intrapartum in view of informing maternal health care policy in Kenya and other countries.",

        "abstract": "Pain assessment by the healthcare professional is essential in caring for newborns. However, it is unclear whether there is a difference in the assessment or pain management between different healthcare provider groups. In this study, we determined whether there is a difference in perceived neonatal procedural pain between physicians and nurses working at the same facility who care for the same patients. Furthermore, we assessed perceived compliance of healthcare providers with the Japanese guidelines for neonatal pain management. We performed a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire sent to hospitals in Japan with neonatal intensive care units. The questionnaire included responses from both physicians and nurses. For most procedures, nurses' perceptions of the degree of pain in newborns were higher than that of physicians. Thus, nurses were more likely to believe that newborns perceived more pain. For 5 of the 19 guideline recommendations, more than 80% of the hospitals reported that both physicians and nurses implement pain management, although there were some items on which physicians and nurses had divergent opinions. Our findings suggest that current pain management differs among healthcare professionals, including pain assessment and the actual pain management provided in the hospital wards. Establishing cooperation and having sufficient communication among the different healthcare professionals are required to improve care for newborn patients.",

        "abstract": "Caring for newborns with atypical genitalia presents significant challenges. With advancements in prenatal imaging and genetic testing, differences of sex development (DSD) diagnoses are increasingly made before birth through ultrasound and genetic testing, offering opportunities to optimally prepare parents for the birth of their child. Although guidelines recommend management in a specialized DSD center, most newborns who have a DSD are born in settings without immediate access to such expertise. Consequently, local healthcare professionals play a crucial role in the initial assessment, communication, and parental support. This document provides a structured approach to conduct a comprehensive physical examination, evaluate the external genitalia, and initiate appropriate biochemical, hormonal and genetic investigations. Clear, neutral, and supportive language is essential when communicating with parents and has been shown to improve outcomes. A structured clinical approach, early consultation with an expert DSD team, and clear, compassionate communication with the parents are key for the initial management of babies born with a DSD and their parents. • Differences in sex development (DSD) are rare, complex congenital conditions that often present with atypical genitalia in newborns, requiring early specialized care from a multidisciplinary team. • International and regional guidelines have been developed for the multidisciplinary management of DSD to improve the quality of care. • This article offers practical and structured guidance for pediatricians on the initial management of newborns suspected of having Disorders of Sex Development (DSD), both before and after birth. • It emphasizes the significance of a systematic clinical approach, early consultation with experts, and effective communication with parents.",

        "abstract": "Psychiatric care in Brazil is based on the National Mental Health Policy and is aligned with the guidelines of the Brazilian Unified Health System. It is based on the preeminence of care in the extra-hospital context over the hospital context. Hospital admissions should occur solely when extra-hospital resources prove insufficient for the proper management of the mental health condition. It refers to a time series investigation of a descriptive, ecological, and observational nature. We used publicly available hospital admissions data from the Brazilian Unified Health System's Department of Informatics. The study looked at information on diseases in ICD-10 group V that affected both men and women aged 0 to 80 or older, from 2012 to 2023. The information was analyzed using the statistical software SPSS 20.0, as well as Jointpoint, through permutation tests, with the aim of evaluating the temporal trend of hospitalization and mortality rates. The joinpoint regression model used a log-linear method to set up a series of connected lines on a logarithmic scale and the Monte Carlo permutation method to figure out the direction or statistical significance. A significance level of 5% was established for the execution of all statistical tests. Overall, a trend of reduction in psychiatric hospitalization rates was observed. However, these trends exhibited fluctuations when analyzed in isolation with respect to the type of disorder, gender, and age group. In contrast to the general trend, the number of hospitalizations for affective disorders and disorders linked to stress and somatization went up. This was especially true between 2021 and 2023, when the number of hospitalizations for other disorders went down more significantly. The predominance of hospitalizations in the male gender was significant. However, the trends of decrease were less pronounced in the male group, especially regarding hospitalizations associated with alcohol and other substance use, which draws attention to the hospitalization rates of the female sex. As it relates to dementias, the national picture shows that hospitalizations are going down, and most of the patients are women and older adults or people who are very old. However, an analysis of the state scenario showed that hospitalizations went up for adults, more than for the elderly combined, with more men than women. the results achieved in this research confirm the findings, both nationally and internationally. Studies have shown that investments made through the National Mental Health Policy and the effects of Covid-19 led to a drop in the number of people admitted to psychiatric hospitals. This was because of the restructuring of the care model, which meant that hospitalizations had to be prioritized to meet the needs of Covid-19, which hurt people with mental disorders.",
