        "title": "Exploring Practices for Implementing Smoking Cessation in Oncology Settings: A Rapid Systematic Review Update.",
        "abstract": "IntroductionSmoking cessation among individuals with cancer increases the effectiveness of cancer treatments and reduces the risks of death. However, individuals receiving cancer treatments in Ontario's 14 regional cancer centres are provided advice on the benefits of quitting smoking and referrals to smoking cessation treatments at different rates. This rapid systematic review was conducted, with funding from the Canadian Cancer Society, to update a published systematic review (Young et al, 2023) and to (1) identify implementation strategies and related implementation outcomes used in oncology settings; (2) describe the characteristics of these implementation strategies and implementation outcomes; and (3) determine whether specific implementation strategies are associated with increased smoking cessation efforts, referred to as the 3As (Ask, Advise, and Act) approach to smoking cessation.MethodsThis rapid systematic review was registered in The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42023491391). Three databases were searched for relevant studies: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The quality of included studies was assessed based on their study design and narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data extracted.Results3158 studies were found, and eighteen new studies met our inclusion criteria. All eighteen studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. The implementation strategies training and educating stakeholders, using evaluative and iterative strategies, providing interactive assistance, supporting clinicians, and developing stakeholder interrelationships were associated with increased asking, advising, and acting, although these associations do not imply causality. Only 5 studies measured implementation outcomes; however, heterogeneity in the measurement tools used prevented analysis.ConclusionAlthough abundant data on implementation strategies was found, implementation outcomes were sparse and connections between the implementation strategies and implementation outcomes could not be drawn. Future studies should pilot the implementation strategies associated with increased asking, advising, and acting, and measure their success, considering both implementation strategies and implementation outcomes, as this information is lacking in the current literature.",

        "title": "Can lifestyle changes significantly improve male fertility: A narrative review?",
        "abstract": "Male infertility is increasingly recognized as a significant global health concern, with lifestyle factors being critical contributors to declining male fertility rates. This narrative review comprehensively analyzes the impact of various lifestyle choices, including diet, physical activity, substance use, stress, sleep, weight management, sexual habits, and environmental and occupational exposures on male reproductive health. The review examines the biological and ecological mechanisms through which these lifestyle factors affect spermatogenesis and sperm quality. Furthermore, it discusses potential interventions, such as dietary modifications, weight management strategies, substance cessation programs, stress reduction techniques, and workplace policy changes to improve male fertility outcomes. Emphasis is placed on the role of oxidative stress, hormonal regulation, and DNA integrity in mediating the effects of these lifestyle factors. While lifestyle modifications can significantly enhance male reproductive health, the available evidence highlights the need for more rigorous research to establish solid guidelines and interventions for mitigating male infertility.",

        "abstract": "Background Given the increasing prevalence and integration of social media platforms into various aspects of life, it is essential for medical schools to establish clear guidelines for their educational application and appropriate personal use. This study aims to assess the policies developed by medical schools in the United States and its territories addressing the use of social media. Methods Between June and July 2024, investigators examined the websites of all medical schools in the United States and its territories to assess their social media policies. The search involved reviewing student handbooks, policy webpages, and related websites. Specific search terms included \"social media policy,\" \"social networking policy,\" \"social media,\" \"social network,\" \"social,\" and \"media.\" Descriptive statistics, chi-squared analysis, and Fisher's exact tests were utilized to describe and compare the categorical variables. Results Of the 199 U.S. medical schools, 166 (85%) had a social media policy (131 allopathic (M.D.) and 35 osteopathic (D.O.) schools). Among these policies, 98 (59%) were found in student handbooks, 45 (27%) on policy webpages, and 23 (14%) on other sites, typically related to technology and student affairs. Specifically, 131 (79%) policies were categorized as dedicated social media policies, while 35 (21%) were primarily included under student professionalism and technology policies. M.D. schools were more likely to have a social media policy than D.O. schools (p < 0.001). Schools in the South were also more likely to have social media policies (37% total policies, p < 0.001). Policy evaluation found that many policies mentioned platform names that are dated, such as Twitter instead of X, or failed to include the names of newer platforms, such as TikTok. Conclusions Most U.S. medical schools have social media policies; however, some need updates to reflect evolving platforms and current student use. Updating policies to address the evolving digital landscape will ensure that guidelines remain relevant and effective in promoting professionalism in medical education.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the nature of Indian digital news reporting on suicides and suicide attempts within the LGBTQ+ community. The objective is to analyse how these incidents are framed by the media by identifying the dominant narratives, demographic characteristics highlighted, and attributed causes presented in news coverage. Following PRISMA guidelines, this study identified and analysed 164 unique digital news reports published between 2001 and 2022. The analysis reveals that news coverage most frequently focuses on individuals identified as trans women or lesbians, who are in the 19-24 and 25-44 age brackets, and are reported to be in a relationship. The most common narratives constructed in these reports attribute the suicides to family non-acceptance of their relationship or identity and partner separation. Furthermore, hanging and drug/poison ingestion are the most frequently reported methods of suicide, and joint/couple suicides are a significant feature of the media coverage. These findings demonstrate that the portrayal of LGBTQ+ suicide in Indian digital media is a curated narrative, likely shaped by journalistic news values rather than being a direct reflection of population-level trends. This research provides critical insights into the construction of media discourse on a sensitive public health issue and its implications for public perception and policy.",

        "abstract": "Due to their comorbidities and frequent exposure to healthcare settings, patients undergoing dialysis are at a high risk of developing severe COVID - 19. However, there are no customized vaccination guidelines for this group in China. This study had two aims: to systematically evaluate the current status of COVID - 19 vaccination among Chinese dialysis patients and to offer a basis for policy - making and further research. This study was conducted across all provinces in mainland China using the stratified randomization method. Electronic questionnaires were distributed to patients undergoing dialysis. Conducted as a national cross - sectional study from May to July 2022, it involved 131,149 dialysis patients from 2,865 centers. The study examined vaccination coverage, the barriers to vaccination, and the safety of vaccines. Only 21.0% received ≥1 vaccine dose, predominantly inactivated vaccines (84.5%). Adverse reactions occurred in 19.0%, with higher rates for adenovirus vector vaccines (27.3%) than for recombinant protein (19.4%) and inactivated vaccines (18.5%, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Among unvaccinated patients, 53.5% faced institutional barriers (e.g., site refusal or lack of recommendations), while 88.7% had no contraindications. Older age (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.28-1.36), female gender (OR = 1.18, 1.14-1.22), and hemodialysis (OR = 1.12, 1.06-1.19) predicted non-vaccination. In general, this study highlights critical barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in dialysis patients: guideline gaps, patient hesitation, and non-specific vaccination settings. Recommendations include updating guidelines to prioritize this population, training non-specialized staff, and launching dialysis center-based vaccination programs. Future research should investigate vaccine immunogenicity in dialysis patients to refine booster strategies.",

        "abstract": "Children with complex communication needs (CCN), particularly those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), experience significant communication challenges. This scoping review analyses the existing literature on clinical interventions designed to enhance communication in these children. The aim was to describe which intervention models are being evaluated in studies, which treatments have shown positive effects and what the clinical profile of children and adolescents who benefit from these interventions is. The scoping review was conducted following the methodology for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The search strategy identified 797 records; eight records met all eligibility criteria and were included for review. The review found that multimodal interventions combining augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), naturalistic strategies and parent training were the most effective in improving both expressive and receptive communication. Despite the limited existing research, studies suggest that multimodal interventions can effectively enhance communication in children with CCN. This review highlights significant gaps in the literature, including the scarcity of studies with appropriate methodological rigour and the lack of standardised protocols for CCN interventions. There is a critical need for evidence-based guidelines, professional training and policy development to ensure equitable access to effective interventions.",

Most articles (78 percent) appeared in national news sections, with medical professionals cited in 36.3 percent of cases. Coverage primarily emphasized vaccine policy (36.3 percent) and health education (36.4 percent), with 83 percent of articles portraying HPV vaccination positively and 88 percent explicitly endorsing it. However, only 42 percent adhered to WHO's media communication guidelines, and headlines often misaligned with article content.

This review assessed clinical and functional outcomes of allograft use for MCL and PLC reconstruction. The PRISMA guidelines were followed. A systematic search of the literature was performed in PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane (CENTRAL), and Scopus databases to identify published articles on clinical studies relevant to MCL and LCL reconstruction with the use of allografts. The results of the eligible studies were analyzed in terms of stability and functional outcomes, Lysholm score, objective and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, Tegner activity scale, Cincinnati Knee Rating System, Marx score, complications, and graft failure. Nineteen studies with 547 patients undergoing LCL reconstructions using allografts were analyzed. The most common allograft used was the Achilles tendon. Mean lateral opening improved from 6.21 mm preoperatively to 1.88 mm postoperatively, with IKDC and Lysholm scores increasing significantly (44.02 to 74.78 and 53.44 to 85.68, respectively). The failure rate for LCL/PLC reconstructions was 11.13%, and complications occurred in 19.75%. For MCL reconstructions, 5 studies with 135 patients showed a reduction in medial opening from 9.7 mm to 2.33 mm, with increases in IKDC and Lysholm scores (49.8 to 75.92 and 69.3 to 85.46, respectively). The failure rate was 4.19%, with a 10.93% complication rate. The use of allografts for LCL and PLC reconstruction demonstrated satisfactory outcomes, with stable and functional knees, though there was a relatively high graft failure rate.

        "abstract": "The increase in the elderly population is associated with an increase in the demand for healthcare services (HCSs). It is, therefore, crucial to gain an in-depth insight into the geriatric healthcare services (GHCSs) provided for older adults in order to improve such services and tailor them to the needs of this age group. This study aimed to identify and assess the challenges of GHCS provision in Iran. This is a mixed-methods study conducted in 2024 in three phases: (1) a qualitative study to explore key challenges, (2) the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) to validate and prioritize the challenges identified in the qualitative phase, and (3) the fuzzy Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess the severity, occurrence, and detectability of these challenges. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The study population consisted of 22 geriatric healthcare experts, 10 elderly individuals, and 3 caregivers, selected through purposive and snowball sampling. Experts contributed to all three phases of the study, while elderly participants were included in the qualitative phase to provide firsthand experiences of GHCSs. Data were analyzed using latent content analysis, FDM, and FMEA approaches. The findings of the first phase were extracted using MAXQDA2020 software, while the second and third phases were analyzed using Excel 2016. Content analysis of interviews in the first phase led to the extraction of six main themes and 47 sub-themes, including: (1) educational challenges, (2) challenges related to facilities, infrastructure, and workforce capacity (3) financial challenges, (4) supervision-related challenges, (5) challenges related to the personal problems of the elderly, and (6) service-related challenges. Based on the findings of the FDM and FMEA phases, the most critical challenges include: limited insurance coverage, lack of coordination between the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the State Welfare Organization, inadequate budget allocation, workforce shortages and unequal distribution, insufficient facilities for geriatric care, lack of a practical model for primary healthcare, and non-implementation of the National Policy Document on Ageing, among others. The geriatric healthcare system in Iran is facing a wide range of interconnected and systemic challenges. This study provides an evidence-based prioritization of these challenges using FDM and FMEA, highlighting the area's most in need of reform. Policymakers should use these findings to design targeted strategies that address structural, financial, and operational deficiencies in elderly care services.",

        "abstract": "Low levels of physical activity (PA) and high levels of sedentary behavior (SB) are major modifiable risk factors for the prevention of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. However, there is insufficient information on the barriers and facilitators of PA and SB in Ethiopia, particularly at multiple socioecological levels, to inform behavior change interventions that promote active living among office-based working adults. This qualitative formative study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to increasing PA and reducing SB in Ethiopian office employees using the social-ecological model (SEM) as a conceptual framework. A total of twenty-six office workers (19 physically inactive/sedentary, 7 physically active) and seven key informants participated in in-depth interviews conducted between April and June 2023 in Hawassa, southern Ethiopia. The interviews were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, translated into English, and iteratively coded. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, and the barriers and facilitators generated were mapped onto the SEM categories. The findings were organized into thirteen themes that belong to the five levels of the SEM. Six themes were categorized to the intrapersonal level (sociodemographic and economic status; knowledge, experience and misperceptions; attitudes, beliefs and values; motivational challenges; sitting habit; and physical competence/skill); one theme belonged to the interpersonal level (social support); two themes were classified to the organizational level (work-related factors; organizational support); three themes were categorized to the environmental/community level (physical environment; social norm associated with walking; and PA promotional initiatives); and one theme belonged to the policy level (workplace health promotion policies). A complex interplay of multiple factors contributes to office workers' PA and SB engagement. Interventions should consider multi-component behavior change strategies that target barriers and facilitators at multiple levels, including individually tailored approaches, in order to effectively influence these physical behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Cambodia, a lower-middle-income country, confronts challenges related to childbirth safety. This study investigated the utilization of childbirth care across public and private health facilities, with a particular focus on the use of caesarean section (C-section). It also examined disparities in service utilization across urban and rural areas and among different socioeconomic statuses. This study used cross-sectional data from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Cambodia in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2021-22. Descriptive analyses were performed to elucidate changes in place of delivery and C-section rates by public and private health facilities. Logistic regressions were applied using data from 2010 to 2021 to identify factors associated with C-section. The facility-based delivery rate significantly increased to 96.5% by 2021, while the overall C-section rate rose to 15.5%. Within public facilities, the C-section rate grew from 5.1% in 2010 to 9.7% in 2021, consistently higher in urban areas compared to rural ones. Notably, C-section utilization in public facilities did not significantly vary among different wealth index groups. From 2010 to 2021, the C-section rates in private facilities surged from 11.0% to 48.1%, with urban and rural rates reaching 50.5% and 45.7%, respectively. In 2021, the richest and richer groups accounted for most C-section deliveries in private facilities, constituting 38.5% and 28.8%, respectively. C-section use was significantly higher in 2021 compared to 2010 (Adjusted OR 3.32, 95% CI [2.72, 4.07]). Women over 20 years old, living in Central Plain, from richer or richest households, had secondary and higher education level, with female household head and had only one child were more likely to undergo a C-section than other women. The private facilities have significantly driven the increase in C-sections, particularly among wealthier economic groups. Strengthening health system governance and promoting public-private partnerships are vital to curb C-section overuse and ensure equitable and effective childbirth care coverage.",

This systematic review seeks to identify and review existing safety measures that could be used for safety evaluation of virtual consultations in primary care. This has been conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and followed a published protocol. A systematic literature search was performed in Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases from 2014 to 2024. Studies comparing virtual consultations with face-to-face consultations in the primary care setting were included. An inductive thematic analysis was performed to systematically extract and group the safety measures into overarching themes, with a narrative synthesis to summarise the results. A total of 47 studies (31 experimental and 16 observational studies) were included (n=2 223 697 patients). All studies assessed the safety of virtual versus face-to-face consultations via one or both of the following domains: (1) factors that influence the safety of virtual consultations and (2) tangible outcomes of virtual care safety. The former were categorised into provider-related, patient-related and system-related factors. Tangible outcomes were evident through three subthemes-adverse events, health outcomes and patient perception of safety. This review provides a systematic synthesis of measures for the safety evaluation of virtual consultations. Further research into patient and physician perspectives is needed to identify aspects and indicators not captured in this study, followed by a consensus study to finalise safety metrics. Ultimately, having a robust methodology for safety evaluation of virtual consultations in place will enable safety monitoring, root cause analyses and safety improvement. PROSPERO CRD42023464878.",

        "title": "Association Between Social Media Use and Burnout Among Primary Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: Nationwide Cross-Sectional Survey.",
        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified health care worker burnout and increased their engagement with social media. However, it remains unclear whether social media is beneficial in mitigating burnout among primary health care workers (PHWs). This study aims to report the prevalence of burnout among Chinese PHWs and investigate the relationship between social media use, specifically WeChat Moments usage, and burnout, with a focus on urban-rural differences. Our nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between May and October 2022 and included 3769 PHWs. Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey, and WeChat Moments usage was self-evaluated. Weighted data were used to report the prevalence of burnout nationwide and in urban and rural areas. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were used to examine the association between burnout and WeChat Moments usage frequency, highlighting differences between urban and rural PHWs. Urban PHWs reported a higher prevalence of burnout compared with their rural counterparts (212/1200, 17.6% vs 351/2569, 13.7%; P=.004). Overall, the frequency of social media use was negatively associated with the prevalence of burnout. With the inclusion of covariates, those who sometimes used WeChat Moments experienced a statistically significant protective effect compared with those who never used WeChat Moments in the fully adjusted model (odds ratio 0.570, 95% CI 0.348-0.933; P=.03). The association between social media use and burnout was more statistically significant in urban settings than in rural settings (urban: all odds ratios and 95% CIs <1, and all P<.05; rural: all P>.05). Urban and rural differences in burnout prevalence were observed among PHWs, with urban practitioners experiencing significantly higher prevalence. This study also found that increased social media use was associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing burnout, but the association did not always exist. In terms of overall burnout, the relationship between social media use and burnout was statistically significant only in urban areas. Our findings underscore the urgent need for policy makers and health care institutions to prioritize interventions addressing burnout among PHWs, particularly in underresourced and high-stress settings. Local governments could pilot platforms with moderation, allowing PHWs to showcase their work progress to the communities they serve, thereby strengthening trust and reducing emotional exhaustion. Our research also suggests that social media interventions may be particularly effective in urban settings. These findings offer actionable insights for other low- and middle-income countries navigating similar challenges. International bodies (eg, the World Health Organization) should develop digital health guidelines specific to low- and middle-income countries to help policy makers balance the benefits and risks of social media.",

        "abstract": "This Policy Review provides recommendations for the use of PET imaging in patients with gliomas and represents a joint effort of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group for PET and the European Association for Neuro-Oncology. The initial guideline was published in 2016, and summarised the previously established clinical benefit of PET with radiolabelled glucose and amino acid tracers in patients with gliomas. Since then, numerous additional studies have been published on this topic, focusing on differential diagnosis, prediction of molecular information, and prognostication. Further studies evaluated PET for biopsy guidance and delineation of glioma extent for local therapy planning, including resection and radiotherapy. In patients undergoing treatment, PET was studied for the assessment of response to local and systemic treatments and PET-based standardised response criteria (PET RANO 1.0) were proposed. In this Policy Review, the updated recommendations are based on evidence generated from studies that validated PET findings by histomolecular findings or clinical course. This guideline further underscores the previously reported clinical value of PET imaging and the superiority of amino acid PET over glucose PET, providing a framework for the use of PET in the management of patients with gliomas. The guideline also underscores the scarcity of class 1 evidence showing that incorporating PET imaging into clinical workflows improves patient outcomes, highlighting priority areas for future clinical studies designed to address this gap.",

        "title": "Large Language Model Symptom Identification From Clinical Text: Multicenter Study.",
        "abstract": "Recognizing patient symptoms is fundamental to medicine, research, and public health. However, symptoms are often underreported in coded formats even though they are routinely documented in physician notes. Large language models (LLMs), noted for their generalizability, could help bridge this gap by mimicking the role of human expert chart reviewers for symptom identification. The primary objective of this multisite study was to measure the accurate identification of infectious respiratory disease symptoms using LLMs instructed to follow chart review guidelines. The secondary objective was to evaluate LLM generalizability in multisite settings without the need for site-specific training, fine-tuning, or customization. Four LLMs were evaluated: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama2 70B, and Mixtral 8×7B. LLM prompts were instructed to take on the role of chart reviewers and follow symptom annotation guidelines when assessing physician notes. Ground truth labels for each note were annotated by subject matter experts. Optimal LLM prompting strategies were selected using a development corpus of 103 notes from the emergency department at Boston Children's Hospital. The performance of each LLM was measured using a test corpus with 202 notes from Boston Children's Hospital. The performance of an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)-based method was also measured as a baseline. Generalizability of the most performant LLM was then measured in a validation corpus of 308 notes from 21 emergency departments in the Indiana Health Information Exchange. Symptom identification accuracy was superior for every LLM tested for each infectious disease symptom compared to an ICD-10-based method (F1-score=45.1%). GPT-4 was the highest scoring (F1-score=91.4%; P<.001) and was significantly better than the ICD-10-based method, followed by GPT-3.5 (F1-score=90.0%; P<.001), Llama2 (F1-score=81.7%; P<.001), and Mixtral (F1-score=83.5%; P<.001). For the validation corpus, performance of the ICD-10-based method decreased (F1-score=26.9%), while GPT-4 increased (F1-score=94.0%), demonstrating better generalizability using GPT-4 (P<.001). LLMs significantly outperformed an ICD-10-based method for respiratory symptom identification in emergency department electronic health records. GPT-4 demonstrated the highest accuracy and generalizability, suggesting that LLMs may augment or replace traditional approaches. LLMs can be instructed to mimic human chart reviewers with high accuracy. Future work should assess broader symptom types and health care settings.",

        "abstract": "Public health authorities and decision-makers need the tools, capacity, and information necessary for assessing health needs, choosing intervention strategies, and drafting policy guidelines. Inadequate information about the oral health of populations leads to ineffective policies. A total of 47,837 randomly selected individuals participated in the study: 19,760 from urban regions and 28,077 from rural regions. The study population was the World Health Organization-specified index age groups of 5, 12, 35-44, and 60 years and above, which was modified for the Indian population. Information was collected for demographic details, behavioral practices, available infrastructure, workforce, and public dental services provided in each district. Oral examinations were conducted at individual households for dental caries, periodontal disease, malocclusion, dental fluorosis, and oromucosal lesions. Risk factors for oral diseases were identified using regression analysis. A high prevalence of oral disease, extremely low utilization of dental care services, and a high dental prosthetic need were noted in the study population. Early childhood caries was noted among 46.9% and 53.6% of 5-year-old children in the urban and rural regions, respectively. The prevalence of dental fluorosis among 12-year-old rural and urban children was at 9.2% and 8.8%, respectively. Periodontal predicaments were noted among 50%, 75%, and 86% of the population in the target age groups of 12, 35-44, and 60 years and above, respectively. Malocclusion was noted among 20% and 25% of the study population in the 12 and 35-44 years' age group, respectively. The prevalence of complete edentulism among older adults was observed in 13% and 11.5% of populations in the rural and urban regions, respectively.

        "abstract": "Suboptimal child passenger safety practices in the United States persist despite national guidelines, state laws, and safety benefits of child passenger restraint systems (CRS). Child passenger safety practices have not been characterized in a national crash dataset since 2011 updates to American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. We sought to identify child, driver, vehicle, neighborhood, and policy-level factors associated with suboptimal child passenger safety practices in motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) with a fatality. We additionally present identified hotspots of suboptimal practices for intervention targeting. We conducted a cross-sectional study of children <13 years old in passenger cars and light trucks with known restraint status and seating location from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database, 2011-2021. Suboptimal practices defined as: 1) not using an age-appropriate CRS, 2) police reported misuse, or 3) front seat location. Child age, prior driver traffic violations, vehicle occupancy, driver's ZIP Code-level Child Opportunity Index 3.0 (COI), state-level CRS and seatbelt fines, and state CRS law score by year. Geospatial hotspot analysis was conducted to identify counties with greater concentrations of suboptimal practices. Of 52,318 passengers <13 years old, 38,372 (73.3%) had a known restraint [29.4% CRS, 50.7% seatbelt, 19.9% unrestrained] and seating position [15.2% in front seat]. Suboptimal practices were identified in 26,731 (69.7%) children with 4-7 and 8-12 year olds observed to have the highest proportion. The strongest predictors of suboptimal practices were child age 4-7 years (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.09-1.12) vs. <4 years and vehicle over capacity (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.11). There was a decrease in suboptimal child passenger safety practices with increasing vehicle model year, COI level, fines, and law scores. Seventy-five counties each were hotspots for overall suboptimal practices and for premature transitions, 45 were hotspots for riding unrestrained, and 64 were hotspots for traveling in the front seat. Our findings can inform targets for populations with higher need for efforts to promote child passenger safety including drivers of children 4-7 years old, traveling with more passengers than seating positions, or from low COI areas. Associations with fines and CRS law scores signal the positive impact of legislation to discourage suboptimal practices.",

        "title": "Supporting Communication Access of People With Communication Disabilities and Communication Differences in UNCRPD-Ratified Countries: An Integrative Review.",
        "abstract": "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) recognizes communication accessibility as a fundamental human right. Communication plays a key role in facilitating belonging, sharing and engaging with communities, allowing individuals to connect and forge relationships. Communication is fundamental to well-being and building a sense of self and identity, as well as establishing and maintaining social roles and vocation. Those with communication disabilities or differences can face many barriers to social participation, inclusion and potential financial implications. This integrative review explores policy, practices and guidelines that support communication access of adults with communication disabilities and differences in selected English-speaking countries with UNCRPD-ratified status and well-established speech and language therapy services. An integrative review of the literature was undertaken. A systematic search of the published, peer-reviewed literature was conducted for empirical research, and a manual search was undertaken to obtain policy, practice, or guidelines, to support communication access at a sectoral/service or community level. A multi-scalar approach situates the findings within several contexts: international law, national legislation and policy, professional guidelines and evidence from local/national projects. A multi-scalar map was developed that positions the findings on communication access within the included countries (Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), across local/national programmes and projects (n = 11), professional body and civil society guidance, regional/national legislation and policy specific to communication access and finally the international normative instrument of the UNCRPD. The findings indicate that communication accessibility is recognised as a fundamental human right, but signatory states are required to take appropriate measures to ensure access to information and communication for persons with disabilities. National legislation, policy and practice need further scrutiny in this regard. This review examines the complex phenomenon of communication access for people with communication disabilities and differences. The findings of this review can inform and shape practice with regard to communication accessibility as well as support advocacy efforts and future research in this area. What is already known on the subject Communication accessibility is a fundamental human right. It can be characterized by the respectful and responsive treatment of individuals with communication disabilities and differences, along with the implementation of strategies and resources and the adaptation of environments, process and systems to facilitate effective communication. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A multi-scalar map was developed that situates the findings on communication access within the included countries (Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), across local/national programmes and projects (n = 11), professional body and civil society guidance, regional/national legislation and policies specific to communication access, and finally the international normative instrument of the UNCRPD. There is a lack of a shared understanding of communication access within empirical research, policy and local and national guidelines across the included countries. In addition, the focus on the right to communication is addressed more explicitly in some groups (and country contexts) than others. What are the practical and clinical implications of this work? This review highlights how multimodal communication is important for accessible communication. Co-design can also be harnessed to enhance communication access. The review provides an integrated set of data (empirical research, policy and guidelines) that can be used in future research, practice development and advocacy.",

A more comprehensive understanding of the effects of THC on driving behaviour in frequent users is needed to guide drug driving policy and evidence-based advice for medicinal cannabis consumers. This study investigated the acute effects of orally ingested THC oil on medicinal cannabis users': (a) hazard perception skill performance; (b) driving-related risk-taking behaviours (speeding propensity, following distance, gap acceptance); (c) self-perceived hazard perception skill performance; and (d) self-perceptions of driving skills and safety. A within-subjects design was used to compare scores on validated video-based measures of hazard perception skill and risk-taking behaviours, along with self-report measures, between baseline (no THC) and post-consumption. Although participants' (N = 41) actual hazard perception skill performance did not significantly decline from baseline to post-consumption, their perceived performance did (with no significant correlation between the two in either condition). In the other video-based measures, participants selected significantly slower speeds and longer following distances post-consumption (but gap acceptance behaviour was unchanged). There was no significant change in self-perceptions of driving skills and safety after correction for multiple tests. While there was no evidence that oral ingestion of THC oils by medicinal cannabis users impacted hazard perception skill performance, they were unable to accurately self-assess their performance, regardless of whether they had consumed THC. Further, medicinal cannabis patients engage in compensatory strategies, specifically by reducing their speed and increasing their following distance following the consumption of THC.",

        "abstract": "Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder with high phenotypic heterogeneity. Disease-causing variants are primarily identified in Jagged1 (JAG1), with fewer reported in NOTCH2. JAG1 variants cause disease through a mechanism of haploinsufficiency, but the mechanism for NOTCH2 variants is not completely understood, making classification of variants more challenging. Using a large, international patient cohort acquired through the Global ALagille Alliance (GALA) study, we sought to improve classification of NOTCH2 variants and study phenotypic differences between NOTCH2- and JAG1-related disease. Clinical and molecular data from 952 individuals with ALGS in GALA were analysed and disease features compared between those with JAG1 (n = 902) and NOTCH2 (n = 34) variants. Previously reported and newly identified NOTCH2 variants were reinterpreted based on disease-specific modifications to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. The Kaplan-Meier method was utilised to assess native liver survival (NLS) and overall survival (OS) and gene comparisons were made with the log-rank test. Thirty NOTCH2 variants, including 18 novel variants, were identified and classified in our GALA cohort. Phenotypic analyses revealed a significantly lower incidence of characteristic facies, posterior embryotoxon, cardiac involvement and butterfly vertebrae in individuals with NOTCH2 variants compared to those with JAG1 variants (p < 0.001). No differences were identified in NLS or OS. Review of 61 previously reported NOTCH2 variants resulted in the re-classification of 19 likely pathogenic or pathogenic to VOUS (31.1%) with less than half retaining their originally published classification (34.4%; n = 21). We report on a large global study on NOTCH2 genetics and phenotype, which increases the number of reported NOTCH2 variants by 30%. All variants were reclassified using current guidelines, and comparison of the JAG1 and NOTCH2 cohorts demonstrates clear phenotypic divergence between these groups. These data suggest that reliance on classical clinical phenotyping may miss patients with NOTCH2-related disease and supports an inclusive approach to genetic testing.",

        "abstract": "Drug resistance compromises the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Resistance testing prior to initiating therapy is recommended in guidelines in many high-income countries, and it has been shown to improve outcomes after first-line ART regimen failure. There is limited evidence on its role in treatment-naïve individuals. We sought to investigate the association between resistance testing and viral suppression and mortality in people living with HIV initiating treatment in Ontario, Canada, where resistance testing became standard of care in 2014. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from 2005 to 2018 using Ontario health administrative databases linked to the Ontario HIV Treatment Network (OHTN) Cohort Study (OCS). Eligible cohort participants were those who had complete data within the follow-up time range. We used logistic regression to compare the odds of viral suppression (<200 copies/mL, at 6-18 months) and death between people living with HIV who had a record of resistance testing prior to treatment and those who did not. We adjusted for age, sex, year ART was started, race, sexual orientation, level of education, income, adherence, anchor drug, immigration status, injection drug use, viral load and baseline CD4 count. Of 1806 eligible participants, 716 were analysed for death, of which 3.7% had died at the end of follow-up. Six hundred and ninety-nine (699) were analysed for viral suppression, of which 94.6% achieved viral suppression. Resistance testing prior to ART initiation had no significant association with viral suppression (odds ratio [OR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-2.22) or death (OR 1.06 95% CI 0.49-2.28) in the covariate-adjusted models. Viral suppression was more likely in older age and in people who started treatment with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors compared to protease inhibitors, and in people with a higher baseline CD4 count. The odds of death were higher in individuals who were older. Resistance testing was not associated with viral suppression and death. Outcomes were associated with clinical and demographic factors, notably regimen, baseline CD4 count and age.",

        "abstract": "In the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare (AIH), understanding the entities and legal frameworks governing its research and development is crucial. This report delves into the intricacies of AIH in Malaysia, undertaking a comprehensive literature search on scientific databases, government portals, and news sources. Additionally, bibliometric analysis has been concurrently conducted to discern trends and developments in AIH over the years. Notably, the interest in AIH has seen a consistent rise since 2017, marked by a growing number of use cases (25 reported here) developed by both local and foreign innovators and applicators. Despite this surge in research and adoption, Malaysia lacks direct legislation specifically addressing AIH technologies, leaving them subject to 11 existing laws. This lack of clear oversight is compounded by the insufficient expertise within local regulatory and ethical bodies to effectively assess AIH research and deployment. The resultant challenges include bureaucratic hurdles for AIH innovators and applicators, raising ethical concerns related to patient autonomy, privacy, data management, AI robustness, and liability. To address these issues, this paper recommends: (1) adopting international ethical guidelines for AIH, (2) enhancing public awareness and education on AI technologies, and (3) promoting AIH research through clinical or silent trials to improve oversight and foster innovation.",

The analysis focused on key nutritional parameters, including energy value, macronutrient composition, and fiber content. PBM products exhibited a lower energy density, reduced saturated fat content, and significantly higher fiber levels than their meat counterparts. However, protein content remained lower in PBM products, while salt levels varied by category. Notably, products from Romania displayed inferior nutritional profiles compared to those from Germany and Ireland, with higher energy, fat, and salt content but lower fiber levels. These findings underscore the need for policy-driven improvements in PBM formulations and standardized nutritional guidelines across markets. The study contributes to the growing body of research on sustainable dietary transitions and their implications for public health.",

        "abstract": "According to the pyramid of evidence, systematic reviews hold the highest position among studies used in healthcare systems and policy-making. Avoiding systematic and methodological errors are demanding responsibility for authors. Clearly, erroneous studies can have irreparable consequences on health and treatment decisions. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential errors in systematic reviews within the field of health. To systematically identify potential errors in systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive literature search using keywords such as \"Bias,\" \"Error,\" and \"Systematic Reviews\" across databases like PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest without any time restrictions. This yielded 2333 articles and 11 books initially.After removing duplicates and unrelated sources based on predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria tailored for this study context (e.g., relevance to error identification in systematic reviews), we closely examined 88 relevant sources. Upon analyzing the full texts of these sources with strict adherence to our criteria, we identified 77 distinct types of errors that could occur either within or between studies. These findings highlight the complexity of maintaining accuracy in systematic review methodologies. Given the critical role systemic reviews play in informing clinical decisions and health policies, ensuring their quality is paramount. Accurate methodology ensures validity; biased studies risk leading to suboptimal patient care outcomes. By pinpointing error sources-such as selection bias or information bias-and implementing strategies to mitigate them through rigorous methodologies like robust search protocols or transparent reporting standards (e.g., PRISMA guidelines), researchers can enhance review quality significantly.",

        "title": "Improving Access to Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery: A Policy Statement From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.",
        "abstract": "Stroke rehabilitation is an integral component of comprehensive stroke care. Inequities in access to stroke rehabilitation can further widen the disability gap and disproportionately affect underinsured patients, patients living in rural areas, and patients from underrepresented races and ethnicities. However, even insured patients face obstacles to receiving stroke rehabilitation. The prior authorization process, peer-to-peer reviews, and subsequent appeals to health care insurers for the provision of postacute rehabilitation increase length of the acute care stay, placing pressure on health systems to expedite the transition of care, to the detriment of appropriate postacute rehabilitation placement. This policy statement focuses on (1) the provision of quality stroke rehabilitation to prevent complications, facilitate recovery, and limit disability, (2) the creation of evidence-based policies to improve equitable access, effectiveness, and efficiency of postacute care, (3) the development and use of performance measures that are aligned with the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guidelines for Adult Stroke Rehabilitation and Recovery to incentivize optimal patient care, and (4) identification of research priorities targeted to improve stroke rehabilitation access. This policy statement is a call for positive and sustained action. Stroke rehabilitation is the lifeline of hope for survivors, their caregivers, and their communities in the days, months, and years after stroke. It is imperative that governments and other funding agencies balance the support needed for acute stroke and stroke rehabilitation treatment, and that organizations, including the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association-an unrelenting advocate for improved brain health-advance the importance of stroke rehabilitation throughout the continuum of care.",

        "abstract": "Good oral health is integral to maintaining overall health. Yet little is known about the breadth of factors that affect dental visits. The objective of this study was to test for associations between reported dental visits and factors that may be related to dental visits: predisposing (demographics, educational attainment, marital status, employment and smoking status); enabling (income, insurance status, rurality, primary care and dental healthcare provider shortage areas (D-HPSA)) and need (overall health status and emotional wellbeing). Survey data were collected 2018-2020 for the Virginia Living Well (VALW) Registry, a convenience sample (n = 528) of largely rural (79.2%) panel of adult Virginians. Cross-sectional analyses included multilevel logistic regression models with the outcome of dental visits in the past 12 months that controlled for nesting of participants within geography. Overall, 65% reported dental visits in the last 12 months. Models showed smoking (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.29, 0.87), Medicaid coverage (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.14-0.58), living in an area with a higher DHPSA score (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.31-0.2) and lower overall health (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50-0.82) were associated with lower odds of having seen a dentist in the past 12 months. Health factors and healthcare provider shortages appeared to be associated with reported dental visits for Virginian participants of the VALW registry. Participants with Medicaid coverage and those living in a high D-HPSA coverage had lower reports of dental visits. More work is needed to improve equity in access to oral healthcare providers and coverage for dental care to align with recommended care guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Clinical guidelines for breast cancer management have evolved in the past decade. However, limited evidence exists regarding uptake of novel drug classes in management of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in the USA and whether disparities exist by race and ethnicity. Using SEER-Medicare databases, we identified 4404 women aged ≥66 years diagnosed with HR+ de novo MBC (dnMBC) between 2010 and 2019. Age-standardized rates for receipt of first-line treatment were calculated. Age-adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression to compare rates among non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic patients with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. Among patients with HR+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) dnMBC after 2015, 48.6% received first-line treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and 22.8% with AIs plus cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors. Rates for AIs + CDK4/6 inhibitors increased (per 1000 person-years: 262.2 in 2015; 452.8 in 2019). Compared with NHW, NHB (RR [95% CI%]: 0.87 [0.63-1.21]) and Hispanic patients (RR [95% CI%]: 0.74 [0.51-1.08]) were less likely to receive AIs + CDK4/6 inhibitors. For HR+/HER2+ dnMBC, 29.7% of patients received pertuzumab, 23.1% with AIs and 10.8% with AIs + trastuzumab. Rates for pertuzumab increased, while rates for trastuzumab monotherapy declined. Compared with NHW, NHB and Hispanic women were less likely to receive anti-HER therapy (RR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.35-0.73] and 0.58 [0.39-0.86]).

        "title": "Adaptation and validation of the Chinese version of the digital addiction scale for children (DASC).",
        "abstract": "With more than 90% penetration of personal digital devices, digital addiction in children has emerged as a significant concern in China. Environmental and socioeconomic stressors in China-a highly collectivist society-may contribute to a higher prevalence of digital addiction. However, there is a lack of culturally adapted tools to assess digital addiction among children in China. This study aimed to: (1) linguistically and culturally adapt the Digital Addiction Scale for Children (DASC) to the Chinese context; (2) examine its psychometric properties, including validity (i.e., construct and convergent validity) and reliability (i.e., internal consistency and test-retest reliability); and (3) establish a potential cut-off score for identifying children at risk of digital addiction. The DASC was translated into Chinese and adapted following forward translation, back translation, harmonization and pilot testing with 24 students in grades four to eight to ensure conceptual and semantic equivalence, clarity and cultural relevance. The final Chinese DASC consists of 24 items after excluding item 11. This study employed a cross-sectional design to validate the Chinese version of the DASC. Based on convenience sampling, Nanling County in Anhui Province, China was selected as the study site. Six schools were then chosen using a stratified randomised cluster sampling method, with three strata: urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Given the feasibility of completing questionnaires independently, students in grades five to eight (aged 12-16 years old) from primary and secondary schools were invited. One class of students in each grade in each selected school was randomly invited to participate. To assess the psychometric properties of the DASC, both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted using SPSS 30.0 and AMOS 28.0, respectively. Convergent validity was evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients between the DASC and Young's Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability over a two-week interval. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimal cut-off score, using the IAT as a reference criterion for identifying at-risk individuals. After forward translation, back translation, harmonization and pilot testing, the English version of the DASC was adapted into Chinese. In total, 592 students (age 12.8 ± 1.7 years; 285 girls and 307 boys) participated in the validation study. The 24-item Chinese version of DASC was validated, with item 11 excluded due to cross-loading. Two components (i.e., interpersonal and intrapersonal dimensions) were identified for the Chinese version of the DASC based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.94). The interpersonal dimension includes 19 items related to conflict, problems, displacement, deception, withdrawal and relapse. The intrapersonal dimension comprises 5 items related to mood modification and the perceived importance of digital devices. The DASC demonstrated acceptable convergent validity (r = 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80, 0.85], p < 0.001), internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.95; split-half reliability coefficient 0.885) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.71 (0.67, 0.75), p < 0.001). Using the IAT as the criterion, the suggested cut-off score for the risk of digital addiction was 53, yielding a sensitivity of 85.9% and specificity of 92.3%. The linguistically and culturally adapted Chinese version of the DASC is a reliable and valid instrument, with an established cut-off score for identifying at-risk individuals. However, the results are limited by the use of a single-county sample, the exclusion of younger children (grade 4 and below) and those with cognitive or reading difficulties, and reliance on self-reported data. When appropriately generalized, the Chinese version of the DASC has potential applications in routine school mental health screening, paediatric check-ups to identify at-risk children and national health surveys. Tracking and understanding digital addiction using the DASC enables the development of evidence-based interventions and supports policy recommendations to address digital addiction.",

        "abstract": "The study aimed to model the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in a multi-ethnic Asian population and evaluate the economic impact of a risk-stratified intervention for DKD management. Using the Singapore Diabetic Cohort (N=9660), multi-state Markov models were constructed to derive chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage-specific transition probabilities for disease progression based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. These were internally validated in 50% training and 50% testing datasets and further validated in national administrative datasets (N=73,256). A cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis for a hypothetical intervention of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) was conducted from a healthcare system perspective, across different time horizons, in low-risk (G0-G2) and high-risk individuals (G3-G4) based on eGFR-defined DKD risk stages. Annually, more than half of the participants (53.0-88.8%) stayed in the same DKD stage, with the probabilities of progressing or regressing to the next DKD stage being highest between stages G0 and G1. The SGLT2i intervention was cost-effective when given in low-risk, but not in high-risk, individuals with type 2 diabetes in both the short and the long term. Additionally, implementing the SGLT2i intervention would incur a 5 year cumulative cost increase of 41.5%, assuming an annual 5% increase in market uptake. We developed a robust model of DKD progression based on real-world data and demonstrated its value through economic modelling of risk-stratified interventions with known effectiveness. This model can aid policymakers and health professionals in evaluating population-level interventions for evidence-based policy decisions.",

        "abstract": "The global prevalence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) is increasing, challenging healthcare providers worldwide. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), healthcare professionals face additional obstacles in managing MLTCs due to the presence of disease-specific guidelines. This issue is exacerbated by the limited emphasis on both pre-service and in-service training of healthcare professionals on MLTCs within LMICs. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to synthesize the scientific evidence on training and educational initiatives on MLTCs for health professionals in LMICs. We conducted a search across PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL within the domains of 'multiple long-term conditions' and capacity-building and systematically reviewed the articles retrieved. The data were synthesized using a healthcare training framework that encompasses objectives, target audience, content and curriculum, training methodology, trainers and facilitators, logistics and implementation, participant engagement and satisfaction, and outcomes. Our findings were reported according to PRISMA guidelines. This systematic review was prospectively registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42022348483). Out of 15,981 initial records, 3614 duplicates were removed, leaving 12,367 for title and abstract screening. After full-text review of 204 articles, only four met the inclusion criteria-two from India, one from Ukraine, and one covering multiple African countries (South Africa, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Kenya) demonstrating a scarcity of literature in the field. These studies focused on increasing healthcare providers' capacity to manage multiple chronic conditions through knowledge, skills, and competency-based training. A 'train-the-trainer' approach was emphasized for broader impact in low-income settings. Training methods varied, incorporating interactive sessions and interdisciplinary modular programs. Key recommendations included integrating updated curricula into medical education and addressing logistical barriers. While participants reported improved skills, challenges included sustaining support and adapting programs to local contexts. MLTC-focused training in LMICs remains limited, with existing programs emphasizing competency-based learning and a 'train-the-trainer' approach. Key challenges include sustainability, logistical barriers, and local adaptation. Integrating structured, interdisciplinary training into medical education and professional development, alongside policy support and stakeholder collaboration, is important for future implementation.",

Proper reporting and handling of missing data are crucial in such studies to avoid loss of statistical power and precision and generate unbiased results. We aimed to assess the reporting and handling of missing data in published studies of co-morbid hypertension and diabetes among PLWH. We searched in PubMed for cross-sectional studies of co-morbid hypertension and diabetes among PLWH published worldwide between January 1990 and June 2023. We extracted data on reporting of missing data (quantity, type, where it occurred, and any bias assessment) and how it was handled. Of 2179 records identified, 154 studies were included among which 53 (34.4%) reported missing data, primarily within exposure variables such as CD4 count and viral load. Only 19 of these studies (37.7%) cited reasons for missingness, predominantly attributed to lack of documentation and non-response. Out of the 24 (45.5%) studies that detailed how they handled missing data, the majority (16 studies; 30.2%) used complete case analysis. Only 5/53 studies (9.43%) adopted multiple imputation methods. The potential biases introduced by missing data were acknowledged in only 12/53 (22.6%) studies. The reporting and handling of missing data in hypertension and diabetes studies among PLWH are currently suboptimal. Enhanced understanding of why data is missing and choosing appropriate methods to address it is paramount to reduce potential biases. Adopting and adhering to comprehensive guidelines for managing missing data is a pressing need and will ensure that more accurate results are better represented in PLWH population.",

However, few studies have evaluated the willingness to pay (WTP) for dental check-ups among those with a reduced number of teeth. We determined the WTP for dental check-ups and investigated the socioeconomic factors associated with high and low WTP among Japanese adults with < 20 remaining teeth, based on whether they have dental check-ups on a routine basis. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a web-based survey in March 2024. Overall, 830 study participants (men and women aged 50-74 years) with 1-19 remaining teeth were randomly sampled from the registrants of an online research company in Japan. The participants were categorized into two groups: those who had (DCR group, 445 participants) and those who had not undergone dental check-ups regularly (non-DCR group, 385 participants). After excluding protest zero responses, the WTP values for dental check-ups in each group were calculated and compared. A negative binomial regression model was used to evaluate the factors associated with high and low WTP values. The sample for analysis included 442 and 378 participants in the DCR and non-DCR groups, respectively. The median (mean) WTP values for dental check-ups were 3,000 (3,559) Japanese Yen (JPY) and 2,000 (2,778) JPY in the DCR and non-DCR groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that in the DCR group, living in the urban area (prevalence ratio [95% confidence intervals]: 1.23 [1.06-1.43]) statistically significantly positively predicted WTP values. For the non-DCR group, a household income of 2-4 (1.48 [1.09-2.00]), 6-8 (1.50 [1.03-2.20]), and > 8 million JPY (1.47 [1.00-2.16]) statistically significantly positively predicted WTP values. Those with a reduced number of remaining teeth and who did not undergo dental check-ups regularly expressed a lower WTP for dental check-ups. This factor was positively correlated with household income. To encourage dental service utilization among these individuals, policies that institutionalize regular dental check-ups with reduced co-payments will need to be implemented.",

General practitioners (GPs) play a critical role in addressing health behaviours, yet there's limited research on their perceptions and practices towards vaping in young people. This study aims to explore current perceptions and practices amongst GPs concerning vaping in young people. A quantitative approach was employed through an online, self-administered questionnaire. Respondents included both trainee and qualified GPs from across the UK. The questionnaire consisted of Likert-scale and free-text questions, covering screening, counselling, and demographic information. Participants were recruited through newsletters and social media, with 284 responses collected from March to August 2024. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess for significant differences based on respondents' region of work or level of experience. General practitioners rarely inquire about e-cigarette use (23.9%), despite 85.6% believing it's important to do so. Lack of time, relevance to the presenting complaint, and method for quantifying and documentation were cited as significant causes. Only 27.5% of GPs provide advice to e-cigarette users, likely due to low rates of confidence (12.3%). A lack of time, understanding of health effects, training, and availability of referral services were cited as causes. There were no significant variations in responses based on respondents' location or level of experience. GPs recognise the importance of youth vaping but face barriers to screening and counselling, indicating the need for change in guidelines and policy.",

        "abstract": "Periviability represents a complex threshold where there is a triangulation of medical capabilities, ethical judgement and the right of the infant to live. In India, with its disproportionate burden of preterm births, the management of infants born at the margins of viability (typically <28 weeks of gestation) remains fraught with legal and ethical challenges. We critically explore the legal contours surrounding the care of periviable neonates from an Indian medico-legal perspective in this article. Despite lacking a uniform national consensus on viability thresholds, Indian jurisprudence confers personhood to neonates at birth, irrespective of gestational age, thereby guaranteeing constitutional protection under Article 21. However, in the absence of explicit guidelines and robust systemic infrastructure, physicians and families must navigate resuscitation decisions amid legal uncertainty, cost constraints and moral complexity. Judicial precedents have mandated life-saving interventions for viable neonates born alive post medical termination attempts, reinforcing the right to care. We discuss the limitations of legal doctrines such as parental autonomy, leave against medical advice and advance directives when applied to neonates who cannot consent for obvious reasons.

        "abstract": "This study investigated adherence to Indonesia's Dietary Guidelines (IDG) among lactating women, examining related factors and association with nutrient intake adequacy, maternal and infant biomarkers, body mass index, and growth. Participants were lactating women (n = 220) from urban and rural West Java, Indonesia. Dietary intake (via 3-day weighed food records), anthropometry and blood samples were assessed. Adherence was evaluated using a scoring system tailored for IDG and adapted from the Healthy Eating Index to assess intake of food groups, sugar, salt, fat, water, coffee, and breakfast habits. Starchy staples intake exceeded recommendations by nearly double (median 7.1 vs. recommended 3-4 servings/day), while vegetable (0.5 servings/day), fruit (1.0), and water (1300 mL/day) intake fell notably short. Protein-rich food intake (3.5 servings/day) was closer to target. Only 1% of participants met three out of four food group targets. Adherence to the meal-based MyPlate framework showed similar imbalances, with 68% of the plate occupied by starchy staples versus the recommended 33%. Sociodemographic factors, including education, wealth, and family size, were associated with adherence to IDG components. For instance, women in the highest wealth quintile had higher adherence scores for starchy staple moderation (mean 4.3) than those in the lowest (mean 2.9). Adherence to IDG components correlated positively with nutrient intake adequacy (e.g. protein-rich food and overall adequacy: r = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06-0.32) but not consistently with maternal or infant biomarkers. These findings highlight the need to refine dietary guidelines with clearer portion guidance and consideration of factors beyond intake adequacy during lactation.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 7-9% of pregnancies worldwide and is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Nutritional therapy is a key component of GDM management. However, inconsistencies exist across international and national guidelines regarding macronutrient distribution, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation. This systematic review aims to compare updated nutritional recommendations for GDM across major health organizations and identify areas of consensus, divergence, and evidence gaps. <b>Methods:</b> This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251026194). A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (concluding March 2025), along with manual searches of official websites of professional health organizations (e.g., ADA, WHO, NICE, IDF). Guidelines published within the last 10 years (or the most relevant national guideline if slightly older), available in English or with access to translation, and including explicit nutritional recommendations for GDM were included. Data were extracted on macronutrient composition, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation, with evaluation of the supporting evidence and regional context, incorporating findings from recent key guideline updates. <b>Results:</b> In total, 12 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. While all guidelines emphasized carbohydrate moderation and adequate fiber intake, significant discrepancies were found in carbohydrate quality recommendations (e.g., low-glycemic index focus vs. total carbohydrate restriction), postprandial glucose targets (e.g., 1-h vs. 2-h measurements and varying thresholds like <120 vs. <140 mg/dL), and the use of non-routine micronutrients such as chromium, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids (generally lacking endorsement). Recent updates from key bodies like ADA, Diabetes Canada, and KDA largely maintain these core stances but show increasing emphasis on dietary patterns and acknowledgement of CGM technology, without resolving key discrepancies. Cultural adaptability and behavioral counselling strategies were minimally addressed across most guidelines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite general agreement on the principal recommendations of nutritional management in GDM, substantial variation persists in specific recommendations, even considering recent updates. Consistent, evidence-based, and culturally adaptable guidelines incorporating implementation strategies are needed to optimize care and reduce disparities in GDM management across regions.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Dietary assessment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is moving away from individual food and nutrient analyses and towards dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Western diet) and diet quality assessment that are increasingly implicated in IBD onset and course. However, an IBD-specific diet quality index (DQI) does not exist. This review aimed to identify current DQIs and assess their suitability for an IBD population. <b>Methods</b>: MEDLINE and EmCare databases were systematically searched for a-priori, food-based DQI reflecting current dietary guidelines and/or nutrition science. Data extracted were adapted from optimal DQI criteria, including quality measures of adequacy, moderation, variety and balance and DQI evaluation. <b>Results</b>: Twenty-four DQI were identified. No DQI included all optimal DQI criteria. The Dietary Guideline Index 2013 (DGI-2013) most closely met the criteria, followed by the Dutch Healthy Diet Index-2015 (DHD-Index 2015), Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) and Healthy Eating Index for Australian Adults-2013 (HEIFA-2013). Most DQI assessed adequacy (22/24, 92%) and moderation (21/24, 88%), half assessed balance (12/24) while few assessed variety (8/24, 33%). Application of other optimal DQI criteria varied. Food frequency questionnaire (13/24) and 24 h diet recall (12/24) were the most common dietary assessment methods used. Most DQI (17/24, 71%) were validated; however, not for an IBD population. Few were evaluated for reliability (6/24) or reproducibility (1/24). <b>Conclusions</b>: No DQI meets all optimal criteria for an IBD-specific DQI. The DGI-2013 met the most criteria, followed by the DHD Index-2015, PHDI and HEIFA-2013 and may be most appropriate for an IBD population. An IBD-specific DQI is lacking and needed.",

        "abstract": "Disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) represent a significant public health issue, with childhood maltreatment emerging as a potential contributing factor. However, the longitudinal impact of maltreatment on the progression of disordered eating behaviors from adolescence to adulthood remains inadequately understood. This study aims to explore how childhood maltreatment influences the trajectory of disordered eating behaviors, focusing on potential moderating factors such as sociodemographic variables, race, and sex. Data from Waves I-III of Add Health (ages 11-26) were used to assess DEB trajectories, with retrospective childhood maltreatment data collected in Wave IV. Repeated measures mixed-effects models accounted for intra-individual variability, adjusting for relevant covariates. Interaction effects between maltreatment subtypes and sociodemographic covariates (sex, race/ethnicity, income) were analyzed to examine how these intersections influenced DEB trajectories. Among the 15,363,384 participants, 49.2% experienced childhood maltreatment. Adjusted models indicated significant increases in DEBs over time, particularly between Waves II and III (β = 19.9, p < 0.001). Although physical abuse (β = 1.88, p = 0.1330), verbal abuse (β = -0.67, p = 0.4529), and sexual abuse by a parent (β = 1.59, p = 0.4204) were not significant predictors of worsening behaviors, stratified analyses revealed that low-income individuals exposed to non-familial sexual abuse demonstrated the steepest worsening of DEBs (β = 26.5, p = 0.0048). Interaction effects revealed that Asian or Pacific Islander participants experiencing verbal abuse, and low-income individuals exposed to non-familial sexual abuse demonstrated pronounced worsening of DEBs. We observed significant sex differences: males exhibited higher levels of worsening behaviors over time (β = -10.8, p < 0.0001). Our findings suggest that sociodemographic characteristics (sex, race, income) may moderate the persistence of DEBs, underscoring the need for trauma-informed and tailored interventions. Addressing childhood adversity through public health, policy, and clinical efforts can help support those at highest risk. Future research should examine these trajectories beyond early adulthood and explore protective factors that may buffer against long-term DEB risk.",

        "abstract": "Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) people, including but not limited to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people assigned female at birth (AFAB), experience a greater burden of cervical cancer relative to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. However, they face pronounced systemic barriers to regular cervical cancer screening. Although evidence-based clinical guidelines play an integral role in the implementation of preventive measures, existing United States (U.S.) cervical cancer screening guidelines do not consider the specific experiences, needs, and contexts of SGM AFAB people concerning cervical cancer outcomes nor cervical cancer screening. Thus, it is imperative to determine how cervical cancer screening guidelines can be revised to better address the unique and specific cervical cancer prevention needs of SGM AFAB people in the U.S. We conducted virtual key informant interviews to elicit recommendations for advancing SGM health equity in developing and implementing cervical cancer screening guidelines from healthcare equity leaders (N = 18), including half with expertise in SGM AFAB people's healthcare. Interviews were analyzed using a template-style thematic analysis approach to develop themes and sub-themes. Healthcare equity leaders provided three key recommendations for advancing SGM health equity in the development and implementation of U.S. cervical cancer screening guidelines. Healthcare equity leaders recommended prioritizing community and person-centered strategies, including engaging SGM communities in the development of the guidelines and using SGM-affirming approaches in their implementation. Revising language that (re)produces harmful normative and exclusionary assumptions about gender and sexuality in the context of cervical cancer screening guidelines was also recommended. Lastly, leaders recommended a range of strategies to mitigate systemic barriers to cervical cancer screening among SGM AFAB people, including collecting and utilizing representative data on SGM AFAB people's needs, experiences, and contexts to develop the guidelines and ensure cultural responsiveness in the delivery of cervical cancer screening to SGM AFAB people across healthcare systems. This study's findings can contribute to improving and advancing health equity in cervical cancer screening for SGM AFAB populations through the community-centered development of inclusive, evidence-based guidelines and their person-centered implementation in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant public health concern in Pakistan due to its subtropical climate and diverse array of vectors, which contribute to periodic outbreaks and challenges in disease control. Recent outbreaks-particularly in 2022-along with the rising incidence of Plasmodium falciparum and growing resistance of Anopheles mosquito vector to existing control methods, highlight a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of current malaria vector control strategies. This article is a scoping review of published literature on malaria prevention methods with a focus on World Health Organization (WHO) outlined interventions in the endemic region of the lower middle-income country, Pakistan. Relevant articles published in all languages before September 2023 were reviewed. All the articles were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase and Google Scholar. Four independent reviewers performed the selection and characterization of articles based on defined inclusion criteria. The data collected were extracted and analyzed by province, vector, and vector control methods according to WHO recommendations. A total of 46 articles reporting surveillance findings on vector control methods in Pakistan were found. Based on WHO recommendations, the reported strategies included insecticide-treated nets (ITN) (29.79%), indoor residual spraying (IRS) (29.79%), spatial spraying (12.77%), spatial/airborne repellents (4.26%), larval source management (4.26%) and house modifications (4.26%). In contrast to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which employs ITN (55%) as the primary vector control method, Punjab was found to use IRS as the main method of vector control (50%). This review highlights the current strategies for controlling malaria vectors and the strategies used in the past for outbreaks in Pakistan. This review identifies a notable increase in the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) over time and highlights differences in the implementation of vector control strategies across provinces in Pakistan. Current practices and their contrast to WHO guidelines are illustrated. It helps us understand the need for improved research and development with precise reporting. These findings can serve as a reference for guiding policy decisions and improving malaria control efforts in endemic regions.",

In the past decade, a growing body of researches has shown survival benefits of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in trauma patients who fail to respond to optimal damage control resuscitation (DCR), and there is an opportunity to formulate clinical practice guidelines to guide clinicians in implementing trauma ECMO at the bedside. The Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support (CSECLS) convened a domestic panel of interdisciplinary experts to develop this guideline, adhering to the principles of the World Health Organization (WHO) Manual for Guideline Development and the policy of conflict of interest. Clinical key questions pertaining to trauma ECMO use were informed from expert interviews and literature reviews, and formulated as PICO (Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome) format for literature retrieval of original studies supporting the question. Then, panelists were assigned to address specific clinical questions, synthesize evidence, formulate recommendations and determine their strength, following the Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The guideline steering committee and stakeholders approved the final document. Eleven recommendations regarding trauma ECMO use in adult patients were formulated, focusing on the following topics: (1) indications; (2) patient screening; (3) timing of initiation; (4) multidisciplinary approach; (5) trauma ECMO management; and (6) complication prevention. Supporting evidences are elaborated in detail, and expert opinions on clinical application and future research provided. Although the quality of the body of evidence is low to very-low, most researches have shown that ECMO improves the survival of adult trauma patients with varied injury mechanisms. However, decision-making should consider the individual characteristics, benefits and potential harms, patients' values and preferences, and long-term outcomes.",

Despite numerous aggregate meta-analyses showing uncertainty of benefit, IVF clinics globally continue to invest significant resources into this technology with little translation of evidence into guidelines or policy frameworks. This may be attributed to heterogeneity in participant populations and/or variations in the use of TLI, as highlighted in the aggregate meta-analyses. Our research proposal for evidence synthesis using individual participant data meta-analysis will provide greater power than aggregate meta-analysis to detect differential treatment effects for effectiveness (live birth, clinical pregnancy) and safety (pregnancy loss, multiple births, congenital malformations) outcomes across three comparisons (overall effect, undisturbed culture and morphokinetic parameters). We will also analyse if there are specific subgroups of women who may benefit from the intervention and if variations in use of the intervention show any benefits. We have incorporated the results of the literature search used for the latest Cochrane review (7 January 2019) into this review and will include all the trials included therein. We will further update the literature search to include new evidence by searching the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL from 07/01/2019 to date, outcomes for all ongoing trials reported in the 2019 Cochrane review, trial registers for newer ongoing/completed trials and the citation lists of all the newly identified trials for any relevant references. The search strategy will include a combination of subject headings and text words relating to or describing the participants and the intervention, with no language restrictions. Two authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts, and full text of articles retrieved from the search, to finalise a list of trials suitable for inclusion in the review. We will include randomised controlled trials that assess TLI systems for either undisturbed culture and/or use of morphokinetic parameters for embryo selection in women having IVF/ICSI treatment using their own oocytes. Ethical approval is not required for this study. We plan to disseminate the findings of the research to all stakeholders, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and other international guideline development groups, through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at conferences, newsletters, meetings and websites of the funders, fertility charities and patient support groups.

The emergence of this novel ownership model has prompted concerns regarding its effects on nursing home performance, especially quality. This systematic review examined the impact of PE ownership on U.S. nursing homes, focusing on quality of care and financial performance. The review was conceptually informed by agency theory and the structure-process-outcome (SPO) framework. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search across five databases identified 12 studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies examined the effects of PE ownership on nursing home quality or financial performance. Data were extracted and synthesized across these two dimensions. Across studies, PE ownership was linked to higher number of deficiencies, increased hospitalization rates, and higher mortality, although some improvements in care processes were noted. Financial outcomes showed initial financial gains but long-term challenges, primarily due to high debt loads. Findings suggest that PE strategies may prioritize short-term profitability, which may compromise quality of care in some instances. These findings highlight the need for financial transparency, and reimbursement models that incentivize long-term quality.",

A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify pertinent studies addressing the variability in norepinephrine salt formulations and labeling practices, the evolution of pharmacological understanding, and recent developments in proposed guidelines. The included investigations were then synthesized in a narrative fashion and subsequently organized chronologically to trace the progression of findings over time, thus highlighting the implications of dosing variability, and provide insight into strategies that may be used to attain global harmonization in norepinephrine dose reporting. National efforts-such as the United States Salt Policy and the French implementation model-offer a structured pathway toward harmonization.

        "abstract": "Shade is an essential environmental feature to prevent heat illnesses and skin cancer. Written policies related to shade were described in municipalities in four southwest and four northeast U.S. states. Municipal codes, planning documents, and manuals/guidelines from municipalities (<i>N</i> = 48) in eight U.S. states were coded for content related to shade by research assistants. They used a standardized protocol to assign numeric codes to each document to assess type of document, type of shade, location, resource allocation, accountability, and design standards. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. Three quarters of municipalities (75.0%) had a policy document that addressed shade, including municipal codes (54.2%), planning documents (29.2%), and manuals/guidelines (12.5%). Protecting from heat (31.3%) was mentioned in policies more than protecting from ultraviolet radiation (8.3%), as was natural shade (56.3%) rather than constructed shade (25.0%). Policies prescribed several design standards, most frequently shade material, proportion of area covered, and attractiveness. Half (50.0%) of municipalities mentioned accountability for shade in the policy, but only a third (35.4%) addressed resource allocation. Regional differences were seen in policy document type, shade type, locations, design standards, and resource allocation. Many municipalities had policies that mentioned shade, but only a minority of policies indicated that the purpose of the policy was protection from heat or ultraviolet radiation. In northeast municipalities, which can have local home rule traditions, policies on shade appeared almost entirely in municipal codes. Southwest municipalities often included policies in planning documents that may have less legal force than municipal codes.",

        "title": "Prevalence of Osteoporosis Among Patients Visiting Primary Health Clinics in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, From 2021 to 2024.",
        "abstract": "Background Osteoporosis, recognized as a debilitating condition, significantly affects skeletal health and overall quality of life by increasing the risk of fractures and functional impairments. This retrospective cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the prevalence of osteoporosis and explore associated demographic factors among individuals who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) screening between 2021 and 2024 in primary healthcare (PHC) centers in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at primary healthcare centers in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. The study used data from patients' medical records collected from 2021 to 2024. After obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Prince Saud Bin Jalawi Hospital, we collected data from the medical records, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and DEXA scan results. The inclusion criteria included all patients who underwent DEXA scans during the specified period, excluding those with incomplete data. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics to assess the osteoporosis prevalence and treatment rates. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare mean age and BMI between groups, while chi-square tests were used to evaluate associations between categorical variables, such as sex and osteoporosis diagnosis. Results A total of 5,768 valid and clean records were included in the final analysis. The cohort comprised 66.8% women (n=4,357) and 33.2% men (n=2,169). The mean age was 64.7±8.2 years (range: 40-104), and the mean BMI was 30.5±6.0 kg/m². Most participants were from the eastern sector (48.7%), followed by the middle (25.3%), southern (16.5%), and northern (9.6%) sectors. The highest sector with a T-score equal to -2.5 was the eastern sector, around 32.8%, followed by the northern, middle, and southern sectors, around 32.2%, 30.4%, and 28.7%, respectively. Among the study population, 31.54% had a T-score of less than or equal to -2.5, indicating osteoporosis. When analyzed by sex, the condition was present in 36.7% of women and 21.16% of men, reflecting the prevalence within each sex group. Compared with international benchmarks, the total treatment rate observed in our study (11.49%) was notably low. Patients with the most severe T-scores (equal to -2.5 or less) exhibited the lowest mean BMI, while those with higher T-scores (between -1.0 and -2.5 and equal to -1.0 or higher) had progressively higher mean BMI values. Conclusion The findings highlight significant disparities in osteoporosis prevalence and treatment uptake between sexes, with women showing a higher prevalence (36.7%) but equally low treatment rates compared to men (11.48% versus 11.53%). Regional variations were also observed, with the eastern sector having the highest proportion of individuals with osteoporosis. Emphasizing the need for targeted interventions may include strengthening community-based screening programs, clinician education on guideline-based treatment, and incorporating osteoporosis risk assessment into routine check-ups. Policy changes should prioritize expanding insurance coverage for DEXA scans and ensuring equitable access to pharmacologic therapy for at-risk populations.",

        "abstract": "Perceived economic burden and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with colorectal cancer after surgery are limited, which is benefit for understanding the health status of colorectal cancer patients, providing evidence for developing intervention measures, improving prognosis, and enhancing quality of life of patients. A questionnaire-based online investigation was used to collect data from patients with colorectal cancer after surgery between November 2023 and March 2024. The severity of colorectal cancer was categorized to phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 based on the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines 2022 Edition. HRQOL was measured using EQ-5D-5L Chinese version. We obtained the health utility value through the integral conversion system, which assigns weights to different levels of the five health dimensions in the EQ-5D-5L scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the associated factors of utility and VAS score. 227 patients were investigated and incorporated to the data analysis. The mean age of the patients was 63.55 ± 11.71 years old with the average personal annual income of 60000 RMB. As the cancer progresses, different dimensions of HRQOL showed a trend of deterioration. More patients had slight problems in the dimension of pain/discomfort, followed by anxiety/depression, usual activities, self-care and mobility. The EQ-VAS score among colorectal cancer was 87.99, 90.85, 77.04 and 78.28 in phases 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.000, X<sup>2</sup> = 63.036). The utility score among colorectal cancer was 0.9443, 0.9632, 0.8759 and 0.8494 in phases 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively (<i>P</i> = 0.000, X<sup>2</sup> = 44.668). Compared to the phase 1, phases 3 and 4 were significantly related to the lower utility and VAS score. Having commercial health insurance was statistically with higher VAS score (<i>P</i> = 0.029). Having a certain amount of pressure was statistically with lower VAS score (<i>P</i> = 0.033). We found that postoperative colorectal cancer patients have a relatively high HRQOL but have poorer levels of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. Moreover, as the disease progresses and perceived economic pressure increases, the HRQOL of colorectal cancer patients shows a downward trend. Therefore, in daily clinical work, primary health physicians should pay attention to patient health management and economic toxicity, to improve patients' quality of life and reduce their economic pressure.",

        "abstract": "People have contraceptive autonomy when they can obtain their preferred contraceptive method. Non-preferred method use may result from inappropriate medical contraindications, which occur when providers apply incorrect contraceptive eligibility criteria during consultations. Non-preferred method use and inappropriate medical contraindications are understudied in the Global South, partially due to measurement challenges. This study provides the first evidence in over two decades that inappropriate medical contraindications are still a barrier to preferred method use in the Global South and offer a new conceptual frame for a neglected medical barrier to contraceptive use. We collected qualitative data from 49 in-depth interviews and 17 focus group discussions (n = 146) with women of reproductive age (15-49) in an anonymized African country. We deductively identified instances of preferred method denial for medical reasons, then analyzed these episodes to determine whether the medical reasons for denial were evidence-based. We found that many women who reported preferred method denial described being offered medical reasons discordant with evidence-based guidelines, often resulting in what we determined to be contraceptive coercion. Specifically, we identified that (1) women experienced bi-directional contraceptive coercion with medical rationales, (2) women trusted providers' medical authority and felt unable to ask for more information, and finally, (3) women's personal reasons for their contraceptive preferences were rendered illegitimate by providers' use of biomedical language and (often incorrect) medical rationales. Consequentially, some women self-reported information indicating a legitimate contraindication to the non-preferred method their provider encouraged them to use. Inappropriate medical contraindications are an under-studied facility-level barrier to contraceptive access that can result in contraceptive coercion, negative health outcomes, discontinuation of wanted methods, and loss of reproductive autonomy. Addressing inappropriate medical contraindications will require solutions that negotiate both structural factors and individual provider behavior to improve the quality of contraceptive service provision.",

        "abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to assess the availability, diagnostic reliability, and out-of-pocket costs of endometriosis diagnostic tools available on the private healthcare market in Poland. <b>Methods:</b> A desk-based analysis was conducted from a patient perspective to identify commercially available diagnostic tests for endometriosis in Poland. Data were collected in September 2024 using relevant keywords to simulate a patient search process. Identified tests were evaluated for their compliance with the 2022 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guidelines. Key parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, and associated costs, were assessed based on the available literature. Out-of-pocket costs were compared between the private and public healthcare sectors. <b>Results:</b> Five diagnostic methods were identified in the private healthcare market: two imaging techniques (transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging) and three blood-based tests. None of the blood-based tests demonstrated sensitivity or specificity above 90%. Imaging techniques met this criterion. The cost of blood tests ranged from EUR 21.1 to EUR 467.77. The average private-sector cost for transvaginal ultrasound was EUR 111.64, representing a 482.6% increase compared to the public sector. Magnetic resonance imaging cost EUR 122.89 in the private sector, a 148.64% increase. <b>Conclusions:</b> The private Polish healthcare market lacks non-invasive diagnostic tests for endometriosis that achieve high reliability based on large study samples. Imaging tests, while reliable, pose significant financial barriers when accessed privately. Enhanced public access and clearer patient guidance are required to ensure timely and effective diagnosis.",

        "title": "Severe Paediatric Trauma in Australia: A 5-Year Retrospective Epidemiological Analysis of High-Severity Fractures in Rural New South Wales.",
        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Trauma-related injuries are among the most common reasons for paediatric hospital presentations and represent a substantial component of orthopaedic care. Their management poses unique challenges due to ongoing skeletal development in children. While most reported fractures occur at home or during sports, prior studies have primarily used data from urban European populations, limiting the relevance of their findings for rural and regional settings. Urban-centred research often informs public healthcare guidelines, treatment algorithms, and infrastructure planning, introducing a bias when findings are generalised outside of metropolitan populations. This study addresses that gap by analysing fracture data from two rural trauma centres in New South Wales, Australia. This study assesses paediatric fractures resulting from severe injury mechanisms in rural areas, identifying common fracture types, underlying mechanisms, and treatment approaches to highlight differences in demographics. These findings aim to cast a light on healthcare challenges that regional areas face and to improve the overall cultural safety of children who live and grow up outside of the metropolitan trauma networks. <b>Methods</b>: We analysed data from two major rural referral hospitals in New South Wales (NSW) for paediatric injuries presenting between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2022. This study included 150 patients presenting with fractures following severe mechanisms of injury, triaged into Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) categories 1 and 2 upon initial presentation. <b>Results</b>: A total of 150 severe fractures were identified, primarily affecting the upper and lower limbs. Males presented more frequently than females, and children aged 10-14 years old were most commonly affected. High-energy trauma from motorcycle (dirt bike) accidents was the leading mechanism of injury among all patients, and accounted for >50% of injuries among 10-14-year-old patients. The most common fractures sustained in these events were upper limb fractures, notably of the clavicle (n = 26, 17.3%) and combined radius/ulna fractures (n = 26, 17.3%). <b>Conclusions</b>: Paediatric trauma in regional Australia presents a unique and under-reported challenge, with high-energy injuries frequently linked to unregulated underage dirt bike use. Unlike urban centres where low-energy mechanisms dominate, rural areas require targeted prevention strategies. While most cases were appropriately managed locally, some were transferred to tertiary centres. These findings lay the groundwork for multi-centre research, and support the need for region-specific policy reform in the form of improved formal injury surveillance, injury prevention initiatives, and the regulation of under-aged off-road vehicular usage.",

However, its development in families of children with intellectual disabilities (IDs) remains underexplored. This study aimed to examine how families construct and sustain FSC, and to identify factors that shape its development across four domains: physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral. <b>Methods</b>: A qualitative study was conducted using an abductive approach, combining inductive thematic analysis with a deductively applied theoretical framework. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with nine families of children with ID in southern Portugal. The children ranged in age from 4 to 15 years, and the parents were aged between 29 and 53 years. The data was analyzed using Bardin's content analysis, supported by NVivo software, and organized according to the FSC framework. This study followed COREQ guidelines. <b>Results</b>: The families described a range of self-care strategies, including environmental adaptations, experiential learning, emotional regulation, and long-term planning. These practices were shaped by contextual factors such as access to healthcare, relationships with professionals, emotional support networks, and socioeconomic conditions. Four emergent conclusions illustrate how structural and relational dynamics influence FSC in daily caregiving. <b>Conclusions</b>: FSC is a dynamic, multidimensional process shaped by lived experience, family interactions, and systemic support.

        "abstract": "Air-quality standards (AQS) are key regulatory tools to protect public health by setting pollutant thresholds. However, most are based on sea-level data. High-altitude (HA) environments differ in atmospheric conditions, influencing pollutant behavior and human vulnerability. These differences have prompted proposals for altitude-specific AQS adjustments. This systematic review identifies models and criteria supporting such adaptations and examines regulatory air-quality frameworks in countries with substantial populations living at very high altitudes (VHA). This review follows PRISMA-P guidelines, focusing on studies examining AQS adjustment approaches based on altitude. The Population/Concept/Context (PCC) framework was used to define search terms: population (AQS), concept (air pollutants), and context (altitude), with equivalents. The literature was retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Gale OneFile: Environmental Studies and Policy. A total of 2974 articles were identified, with 2093 remaining after duplicate removal. Following title and abstract screening, 2081 papers were excluded, leaving 12 for full-text evaluation. Ultimately, six studies met the eligibility criteria. Three studies focused on adjustment models based on atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and pressure changes, while the other three examined human physiological responses, particularly the increased inhaled air volume. China, Peru, and Bolivia have the largest populations living above 3500 m a.s.l., yet none of these countries have specific air-quality regulations tailored to HA conditions. The review underscores the necessity for tailored AQS in HA environments, highlighting specific criteria related to both atmospheric conditions and human physiological responses.",

        "abstract": "Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are a leading cause of physical injury worldwide, but they also frequently result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This systematic review examines the prevalence, predictors, comorbidity, and treatment of PTSD among RTA survivors. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, and ProQuest) were searched following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Articles were included if reporting on the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of a road traffic accident in adults aged 18 years and older. Including peer-reviewed journal articles and awarded doctoral theses across all publication years, and written in English, Macedonian, Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, and Bulgarian, identified 259 articles, and using Literature Evaluation and Grading of Evidence (LEGEND) assessment of evidence 96 were included in the final review, involving 50,275 participants. Due to the heterogeneity of findings, quantitative data were synthesized thematically rather than through meta-analytic techniques. Findings are reported from Random Control Trial (RCT) and non-RCT studies. PTSD prevalence following RTAs ranged widely across studies, from 20% (using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, DSM-5 criteria) to over 45% (using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, ICD-10 criteria) within six weeks post-accident (non-RCT). One-year prevalence rates ranged from 17.9% to 29.8%, with persistence of PTSD symptoms found in more than half of those initially diagnosed up to three years post-RTA (non-RCTs). Mild or severe PTSD symptoms were reported by 40% of survivors one month after the event, and comorbid depression and anxiety were also frequently observed (non-RCTs). The review found that nearly half of RTA survivors experience PTSD within six weeks, with recovery occurring over 1 to 3 years (non-RCTs). Even minor traffic accidents lead to significant psychological impacts, with 25% of survivors avoiding vehicle use for up to four months (non-RCT). Evidence-supported treatments identified include Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (RCTs and non-RCTs), Virtual Reality (VR) treatment (RCTs and non-RCTs), and Memory Flexibility training (Mem-Flex) (pilot RCT), all of which demonstrated statistically significant reductions in PTSD symptoms across validated scales. There is evidence for policy actions including mandatory and regular psychological screening post RTAs using improved assessment tools, sharing health data to better align early and ongoing treatment with additional funding and access, and support and interventions for the family for RTA comorbidities. The findings underscore the importance of prioritizing research on the psychological impacts of RTAs, particularly in regions with high incident rates, to understand better and address the global burden of post-accident trauma.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death in infants aged 1-59 months. Concurrent with this, there is a need to prescribe antibiotics wisely in Vietnam due to concerns with rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Consequently, an urgent need has arisen to treat patients according to agreed guidelines. The aim of this study was to investigate the current management of infants under five years old with CAP in Vietnam as well as identify possible obstacles to adhering to national guidelines. <b>Methods</b>: A mixed-method approach was used incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data analysis in a leading hospital in Vietnam, which influences others. Data from 108 pediatric patient records were collected and analyzed. Subsequently, in-depth interviews were conducted with pediatric doctors treating these patients to ascertain possible reasons for non-adherence to guidelines. <b>Results</b>: The mean age of children diagnosed with CAP was 27.94 ± 12.99 months, with 82.4% having non-severe CAP, and 41.7% of children had previously used antibiotics before hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days. All children were prescribed antibiotics, 91.4% of children received these initially intravenously, with third-generation cephalosporins being the most (91.7%) commonly prescribed. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most frequently prescribed (48.2%) antibiotic. However, on 96.1% of occasions cefoperazone/sulbactam was given at higher doses than the label instructions. Overall, 73.3% of antibiotics prescribed were \"Watch\" antibiotics. In addition, the proportion of initial antibiotic regimens that were consistent with current national guidelines was only 4.63%. <b>Conclusions</b>: There were considerable concerns with low adherence rates to current guidelines alongside high rates of prescribing of injectable third-generation cephalosporins due to various internal and external barriers. Antimicrobial stewardship programs with updated national guidelines are urgently needed in Vietnamese hospitals to treat CAP in children as part of ongoing measures to reduce increasing AMR rates. Such activities should also help improve antibiotic use in the community following improved education of trainee ambulatory care physicians regarding appropriate management of children with CAP.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to public health, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where surveillance infrastructure is underdeveloped. Bihar, India's third most populous state and one of its least-resourced states, has remained largely absent from national AMR monitoring initiatives. <b>Methods:</b> This study aimed to characterize the AMR infection landscape across five public tertiary care hospitals in Bihar over three years (2022-2024) and to assess the feasibility of integrating digital workflows for real-time microbiological reporting. Standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed on >48,000 urine, pus, and blood samples using CLSI guidelines. Facility-level data were digitized into an open-source AMR reporting system, enabling automated antibiogram generation. <b>Results:</b> The findings revealed substantial resistance: high resistance to beta-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones across pathogens. For instance, <i>E. coli</i> sensitivity to nitrofurantoin varied from 86.5% at NMCH (Patna) to 44.7% at JLNMCH (Bhagalpur), while cephalosporin sensitivity in <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. dropped below 2% in several hospitals. MRSA prevalence exceeded 65% in two facilities, far above the national average of 47.8%. Digital integration led to a four-fold increase in culture testing in all facilities and improved data completeness and turnaround times. Spatial analysis and microbiology laboratory assessment revealed significant geographic disparities in diagnostic access, with facilities in remote districts facing delays of over four hours for basic testing. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study is the first study from India to create such a broad, facility-associated AMR picture over time at a state level. Policy implications include the need for a state-level AMR surveillance dashboard, alignment of procurement with facility-specific resistance patterns, and routine stewardship audits. Clinically, this study demonstrates the utility of localized antibiograms for guiding empirical therapy in resource-limited settings. This study provides a scalable framework for embedding AMR surveillance into routine health system workflows in LMICs.",

Obstetric hemorrhage and hypertension in pregnancy are leading causes of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. Maternal safety bundles, developed by the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, provide guidelines to improve maternal health outcomes. This study examined the implementation of obstetric hemorrhage and severe hypertension safety bundles in Arkansas hospitals, identifying factors associated with successful adoption. Safety bundle implementation data were collected from 37 hospitals in the third quarter of 2023. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association database. Implementation index scores were calculated as the percentage of recommended elements adopted, both overall and within specific domains. Descriptive statistics summarized hospital characteristics and implementation status. Implementation differences across domains were assessed using Friedman's test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while between-bundle comparisons were evaluated using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. A total of 23 hospitals (62%) were in the urban region, while 14 hospitals (38%) were located in rural areas. In the obstetrical hemorrhage bundle, Readiness domain had significantly higher implementation than Recognition and Prevention (p = 0.0005) and Reporting and Systems Learning domains (p < 0.0001). In the severe hypertension bundle, Readiness (p < 0.0001), Recognition and Prevention (p = 0.0035), and Response (p < 0.0001) domains all had higher scores than Reporting and Systems Learning domain. The Recognition and Prevention domain had significantly higher implementation in the severe hypertension bundle than in the obstetrical hemorrhage bundle (p = 0.0351). Urban hospitals had significantly higher obstetrical hemorrhage bundle implementation scores than rural hospitals (p = 0.0121). Hospitals with more full-time facility personnel and registered nurses demonstrated better implementation of both obstetrical hemorrhage (facility personnel: p = 0.0454; registered nurses: p = 0.0126) and severe hypertension (facility personnel: p = 0.0180; registered nurses: p = 0.0093) bundles. Readiness components were the most frequently implemented, while Reporting and Systems Learning elements had lower adoption rates. Urban hospitals had higher obstetric hemorrhage bundle implementation levels than rural hospitals. Hospitals with greater staffing resources, particularly full-time facility personnel and registered nurses, demonstrated better implementation of safety bundles. Findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to enhance maternal safety bundle adoption, especially in rural hospitals and under-implemented domains.",

        "abstract": "South Africa (SA) is amongst the countries that adopted the Global plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections amongst children and keeping their mothers alive, launched in June 2011 as well the global HIV strategies of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3 target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, including the strategy for measuring impact and progress made in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), now called Vertical Transmission Prevention (VTP) of HIV and communicable infections. All targets outlined in the Global Plan for elimination of Mother to child transmission (eMTCT) have almost been reached by the country, showing potential to achieve eMTCT by 2030.Successes are attributed to PMTCT policy of SA being amongst the best in the world. However, despite the well-established PMTCT programme, PMTCT implementation gaps still exist. This study ascertained identified gaps as follows: Of 163 accounted for pregnant women participants, 82(53.0%) booked before 20 weeks of gestational dates for their first ANC booking as advocated for by the PMTCT policy,81 were late bookers who had potential for not having their viral load suppressed, with high risk of MTCT.15 were missing and unaccounted for. 91 of 101 (89.11%) pregnant HIV positive women commenced ART on the day of their diagnosis, during their first ANC attendance. 67 were known HIV positive pregnant women already on ART who came for their first booking The remaining 10 pregnant HIV positive women did not begin ART early in their pregnancy and have the potential of not being virally suppressed Viral load was poorly monitored-25.0% had no viral load testing done at their first ANC booking,47% were tested at delivery and 49.0% tested at 6-months after delivery.150 of 164 HIV positive women who were eligible for a routine six-to-twelve-week post-partum were missed opportunities.100 of 178 (56.2%) HIV exposed babies were given NVP and AZT prophylaxis Baby Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) testing:Of 178 HIV exposed babies, 122 (69%) were tested at birth, 113 of 178(63%) were tested at 10 weeks There was 6 (3.5%) of babies who seroconverted after 103 of 178 (58%) were tested. at 6-months. To address identified gaps, inform future policy formulation and improve PMTCT practices, ascertaining the country to achieve eMTCT by 2030. To conduct file audit at selected facilities to assess and verify the existence of implementation gaps. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey of routinely collected clinic data. The survey was chosen to conduct clinical records audits of mother and baby pairs client records from 18 facilities rendering PMTCT services, representative of the rural and urban areas in all the nine provinces of SA Five (5) Mother and baby pairs client records, each containing specific tools used for measuring PMTCT programme progress amounting to 3 160 files were randomly selected. The investigator developed a checklist from all existing approved PMTCT M&E sampled tools, condensed into one document and used to collect data from all sampled client's records. STATA software was used for data analysis. The audit revealed several factors, related to non-compliance to interventions of the PMTCT policy, poor integration of mother and baby services; poor client management and poor documentation practices. The results indicate that, despite, the well-established PMTCT programme in place in the country, implementation gaps still exist as a result of non-compliance to the PMTCT policy. There is an urgent need to prioritise and support implementers to fully implement the PMTCT policy. The study ascertained PMTCT policy implementation gaps that still exist as a result of non- compliance to interventions advocated for by the PMTCT policy Poor adherence and non -adherence to PMTCT policy may have an impact on the ultimate objectives of the whole program and derail the country to achieve eMTCT by 2030.",

        "title": "Exploring perceived barriers and facilitators to using mobile phone technology for delivering HPV test results in malawi: a qualitative study with HPV-Screened women, healthcare providers, and health officials.",
        "abstract": "Cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer among women globally, disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, such as Malawi, which has the world's highest cervical cancer mortality rate. Efforts to implement human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for primary screening face challenges, including delays in delivering HPV results, hindering the retention of HPV-positive women in the care cascade. We conducted a study to identify the perceived barriers and facilitators to using mobile phones for delivering HPV results, aiming to improve the retention of HPV-positive women in care. We also explored the perspectives of women, health care providers, and health officials in Malawi's cervical cancer screening program to provide a comprehensive view of challenges and opportunities. This exploratory sub-study evaluated the perceived barriers and facilitators to delivering HPV screening results to women via mobile phones at four government-run health facilities in Lilongwe, Malawi. A trained research assistant conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with women who underwent HPV-based primary screening and received their HPV results, through a cluster randomized trial that compared two models of HPV-based screening. We also interviewed healthcare providers from these four health facilities and officials from the Lilongwe District Health Office (DHO). Data collected through the IDIs were recorded, transcribed, and translated. The transcripts were coded in NVivo 14 and analyzed using thematic analysis. Between January-March 2022, 35 participants completed the IDIs: 20 women who underwent HPV screening, 13 healthcare providers, and 2 DHO officials. The study findings revealed several critical factors influencing the implementation of HPV result delivery via mobile phone. Key challenges included low literacy and privacy concerns, which complicate the adoption of this method. Additionally, there was a perceived risk of unintended receipt of HPV results by partners or family members, in that many women do not own mobile phones and rely on shared handsets. However, incentives such as airtime, functional phones, and appropriate equipment could support healthcare providers in delivering effective communication and healthcare services. While mobile phone communication has the potential to enhance HPV result delivery, its success relies on overcoming perceived barriers such as low literacy, privacy concerns, inadequate resources, and the need for a supportive implementation environment.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveTraumatic pseudoaneurysms are a serious complication following blunt and penetrating trauma, carrying a significant risk of morbidity and mortality if ruptured. However, there is a lack of specific guidelines for their detection and surveillance. This study aimed to evaluate the detection and management of posttraumatic solid organ pseudoaneurysms.Materials and MethodsA prospectively maintained database was created at a Level 1 trauma center from January 2023 to June 2024. All patients aged 15 years and older who presented with a high-grade liver, kidney, or spleen injury were included in the study. Univariate data analyses was utilized with <i>P</i> < 0.05 considered statistically significant.ResultsTwo hundred and five patients were included in the study. Pseudoaneurysms were identified in 10.7% of patients (n = 22/205). Gunshot wounds (n = 8/22, 36.4%) and motor vehicle collisions (n = 7/22, 31.8%) were the most common mechanisms of injury. Pseudoaneurysms were identified in the liver (n = 10/22, 45.5%), spleen (n = 9/22, 40.9%), and kidney (n = 3/22, 13.6%). 90.9% (n = 20/22) of pseudoaneurysms were identified within 5 days of initial injury. Seventeen (n = 17/22, 77.3%) patients underwent endovascular embolization for pseudoaneurysm repair with an 88.2% success rate. Five (n = 5/22, 22.7%) patients with pseudoaneurysms were managed by observation alone with no intervention. Overall, 48.3% (n = 99/205) of patients had a follow-up abdominal CTA prior to discharge.ConclusionAbdominal CTAs provide adequate surveillance for post-traumatic abdominal pseudoaneurysms, allowing for timely repair to decrease the risk of mortality from pseudoaneurysm rupture. Future prospective multi-center studies are needed to establish evidence-based guidelines for pseudoaneurysm detection and management.",

We searched the following databases from inception to March 1, 2024: OVID Medline (1946-), EBSCO CINAHL Plus (1981-), OVID EMBASE (1974-), and OVID APA PsycINFO (1806-). Eligible studies were peer-reviewed and compared receipt of Pap tests in women with physical, hearing, vision, or intellectual/developmental disability versus those without disabilities. We extracted data using a standardized form; study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; and results were synthesized using random-effects meta-analyses, where possible. Findings that could not be meta-analyzed were summarized following Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation was used to assess the strength of evidence. Of 1946 unique studies screened, 43 were included in the review, and 21 were meta-analyzed. Studies were primarily cross-sectional (65.1 %), used survey data (76.7 %), and were conducted in the United States (60.5 %). Quality was rated high (30.2 %), medium (55.8 %), and low (14.0 %). Women with disabilities had a lower likelihood of receiving a Pap test (adjusted pooled OR 0.78, 95 % CI: 0.66-0.91). Disparities were more pronounced among those with physical (adjusted pooled OR 0.74, 95 % CI: 0.68-0.80) and intellectual/developmental disabilities (adjusted ORs ranging from 0.21 to 0.37). The overall strength of evidence was low. Women with disabilities could benefit from efforts to improve cervical cancer screening receipt.

        "abstract": "In a sociopolitical environment that challenges progress in addressing climate change, physicians should play a central role in accelerating activities related to climate action, environmental sustainability, and resilience. For instance, stewardship as a physician's professional responsibility should include proactive and consistent planetary health stewardship versus a solely reactive and intermittent response to the increasing intensity and frequency of climate-related catastrophic events. We define planetary health stewardship as optimizing physician decision-making to include considerations around the interdependent relationship between human health and the environment, recognizing the need for physicians and their professional societies to address social, economic, and environmental factors that impact human well-being. Its implementation requires physicians to be equipped with the knowledge, skills, and competencies of planetary health stewardship, a culture that enables more holistic consideration of health and its relationship to the natural environment, and supportive systems. Physicians should work with their professional societies to contextualize policies, guidelines, and recommendations within planetary health stewardship and help realize its associated co-benefits, such as higher quality of care, waste reduction, financial savings, efficiency, and improved outcomes. Because general internists often transcend the domains of comprehensive whole-person care, education, research, and policy, they are well-positioned to become active advocates and role models to accelerate the transformation of healthcare systems through planetary health stewardship.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into health care, including psychiatry and psychology. In educational contexts, AI offers new possibilities for enhancing clinical reasoning, personalizing content delivery, and supporting professional development. Despite this emerging interest, a comprehensive understanding of how AI is currently used in mental health education, and the challenges associated with its adoption, remains limited. This scoping review aimed to identify and characterize current applications of AI in the teaching and learning of psychiatry and psychology. It also sought to document reported facilitators of and barriers to the integration of AI within educational contexts. A systematic search was conducted across 6 electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, and Google Scholar) from inception to October 2024. The review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies were included if they focused on psychiatry or psychology, described the use of an AI tool, and discussed at least 1 facilitator of or barrier to its use in education. Data were extracted on study characteristics, population, AI application, educational outcomes, facilitators, and barriers. Study quality was appraised using several design-appropriate tools. From 6219 records, 10 (0.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight categories of AI applications were identified: clinical decision support, educational content creation, therapeutic tools and mental health monitoring, administrative and research assistance, natural language processing (NLP), program/policy development, students' study aid, and professional development. Key facilitators included the availability of AI tools, positive learner attitudes, digital infrastructure, and time-saving features. Barriers included limited AI training, ethical concerns, lack of digital literacy, algorithmic opacity, and insufficient curricular integration. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate to high. AI is being used across a range of educational functions in psychiatry and psychology, from clinical training to assessment and administrative support. Although the potential for enhancing learning outcomes is clear, its successful integration requires addressing ethical, technical, and pedagogical barriers. Future efforts should focus on AI literacy, faculty development, and institutional policies to guide responsible and effective use. This review underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure the safe, equitable, and meaningful adoption of AI in mental health education.",

        "abstract": "There is considerable variability in how older adults with cancer tolerate and recover from surgery and systemic treatments. A greater understanding of individual trajectories is crucial in guiding personalized treatment decisions. Frailty may explain these inter-individual differences. Despite emerging evidence on the association between perioperative frailty assessment and outcomes after noncardiac surgery, there is limited data in gynecologic oncology. A perioperative cardiovascular risk assessment, recommended by scientific guidelines, is widely adopted in noncardiac surgery, often as the only standardized perioperative risk stratification approach. While based on robust evidence on the association with cardiovascular complications and overall mortality, it might be insufficient to predict other essential surgical, oncologic and patient-important outcomes. The FARGO study is a multi-centre prospective cohort study targeting 280 patients aged 55 or older undergoing surgery, with or without chemotherapy, for a suspected or confirmed gynecologic malignancy. The primary objective is to evaluate the predictive value of the Frailty Phenotype measured preoperatively, compared with the currently used perioperative risk assessment (cardiovascular risk assessment based on the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, age, and occurrence of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery) in predicting the composite outcome of all-cause death or new disability at six months after surgery. Secondary objectives include comparing the predictive value of the Frailty Phenotype with that of the Clinical Frailty Scale; evaluating the performance of a preoperative frailty assessments on other postoperative complications, chemotherapy tolerance, and 1-year recurrence-free survival; exploring the added predictive value of a dynamic perioperative frailty assessment repeated 28 days after surgery; assessing the acceptability of frailty assessments by physicians and patients; and establishing a biobank to investigate frailty biomarkers. The findings could have important implications for risk stratification, planning and tailoring surgical and oncologic care for older adults with gynecologic malignancies.

        "abstract": "South Africa has one of the highest rates of child abuse. The skeletal survey (SS) is the radiological investigation for suspected paediatric non-accidental injury (NAI). Institutional policy is to perform the SS in accordance with The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) 2017 guidelines. However, the SS is technically challenging, requiring several views with meticulous attention to radiographic detail. The optimal study is thus not always achieved, resulting in decreased diagnostic accuracy. 1. Assess pre-intervention (Institution name) compliance with RCR 2017 SS guidelines for suspected NAI. 2. Assess post-intervention (Institution name) compliance with RCR 2017 SS guidelines for suspected NAI. A retrospective assessment of institutional percentage compliance with RCR 2017 SS guidelines for suspected paediatric NAI was followed by a 12-month educational intervention. Pre- and post-intervention compliance was compared utilizing the chi-square test. The percentage compliance with standard RCR 2017 SS views in the post intervention period (mean 21.6/25, 86%) was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the pre intervention period (mean 9/25, 36%). The most significant improvements were in the coned lateral joint and oblique chest views. The implementation of a simple institutional quality assurance program has the potential to improve imaging for NAI victims. The program described is broadly applicable to any healthcare or institutional setting. This study, based on the RCR 2017 guidelines, forms part of a very small body of work on non-accidental injury quality assurance and is the only such analysis from the African continent.",

        "abstract": "Neural tube defects (NTDs) remain a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with persistently high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries including Turkey. Despite advances in prenatal screening and neurosurgical care, survival outcomes remain variable. This study aimed to assess national trends in survival duration, surgical intervention patterns, and regional disparities in neonatal NTD outcomes across Turkey over a 7-year period. We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study of 7,606 liveborn neonates diagnosed with NTDs between 2015 and 2021. Data were extracted from hospital-based registries and included clinical, demographic, and regional variables. Primary outcomes were survival duration and rate of surgical intervention. Linear regression was used to assess temporal survival trends, and Kaplan-Meier analysis compared survival between surgical and non-surgical groups. The mean survival duration declined markedly from 705.2 days in 2015 to 123.0 days in 2021 (p < 0.001), with linear regression revealing a significant annual decrease of 82.2 days (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91). Surgical intervention was performed in 30.3% of cases overall, with notable regional variability. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly longer survival among neonates who underwent surgery (mean: 450.6 days) compared to those who did not (mean: 290.2 days; p < 0.0001). The Black Sea region exhibited the highest average survival despite low intervention rates, whereas Southeastern Anatolia had the highest surgery rate but the lowest survival duration. Despite incremental improvements in surgical access, neonatal survival among infants with NTDs in Turkey has declined over the past decade. Marked regional inequities and the limited effect of surgery on overall survival underscore the need for comprehensive strategies addressing prevention, early diagnosis, timely surgical care, and equitable neonatal intensive care delivery.",

Traditionally characterized by high-blood pressure and proteinuria, organ and placental dysfunction were later proposed in some clinical practice guidelines as additional components for its definition. Variability in diagnostic criteria across international guidelines could be a barrier to harmonized and equitable care in different settings. We reviewed current relevant clinical practice guidelines to identify similarities and differences in recommendations related to the definition and diagnosis of preeclampsia, and their supporting evidence. We also reviewed additional systematic reviews related to the diagnosis of preeclampsia. We searched different databases and websites of international and professional organizations for guidelines published or updated from 2014 to 2024. We searched databases to identify additional systematic reviews on preeclampsia diagnosis. Fifteen guidelines from 11 organizations were identified with 11 systematic reviews supporting evidence on the diagnosis of preeclampsia. We found 21 additional systematic reviews, not included in these guidelines. There is agreement for hypertension and proteinuria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, without a uniform consensus on methods and devices for their assessment. Organ dysfunction is considered in eight guidelines and placental dysfunction in four, with some disagreements on their usefulness, and the methods and tools for their measurement. Few guidelines support their recommendations on preeclampsia diagnosis with systematic reviews. Consensus in preeclampsia definition is needed to guide not only clinical practice but also future research and policy, particularly in global health contexts.",

        "abstract": "Health system reform initiatives have generated high-demand and created uncertain, complex practice environments, impacting the well-being, work conditions, and behavior of primary care professionals. Psychological safety is increasingly important to organizational success, particularly in highly complex work environments. Yet, few studies have examined its application among primary care professionals. To examine the impact of psychological safety on the well-being, work conditions and guideline adherence behavior of primary care physicians (PCPs) in Community Health Centres (CHCs) in urban China. A total of 224 PCPs from 38 CHCs in four Chinese cities were recruited using convenience sampling. Research assistants conducted questionnaire surveys. Well-being was assessed through measures of depression, work-family conflict and work exhaustion, work conditions were defined by measures of professional commitment and self-directed learning, and guideline adherence behavior was measured through compliance with clinical guidelines and the provision of preventive care. Two-level hierarchical linear models were developed to analyze the impact of psychological safety. Psychological safety was negatively associated with depression, work-family conflict, and work exhaustion. Psychological safety was positively associated with professional commitment and self-directed learning and also greater adherence to clinical guidelines and the increased provision of preventive care. This study in China confirms that a psychologically safe work environment in primary care is positively associated with improved PCPs' well-being, enhanced professional commitment, and better adherence to clinical guidelines and preventive care provision. Given that psychological safety may be embedded in national culture, further studies should develop context-based, culturally and organizationally appropriate interventions.",

To synthesize published evidence, including empirical studies and expert perspectives on the applications, benefits, and challenges of AI in nursing research. This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across five databases, including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest, for studies published between January 2015 and May 2025. Eligible articles included empirical studies that examined AI use in nursing research or were conducted by nurses. Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. Data were synthesized using JBI's convergent integrated approach. Fifteen studies were included in the review. Three overarching themes emerged: (1) applications of AI in nursing research; (2) challenges of AI implementation, ethical risks, and bias; and (3) benefits of AI. The AI techniques reported were diverse and included natural language processing and classical machine learning methods. Overall, methodological quality of the studies was high. AI offers transformative opportunities for nursing research. However, ethical implementation requires methodological rigor, active nurse involvement, and attention to sociotechnical risks. Policies should promote nurse engagement in AI development, support AI literacy in education, and ensure ethical, equitable integration of AI into nursing research.",

        "abstract": "The Iranian population faces a dual burden of overconsumption and nutrient insufficiency. Considering recent socioeconomic changes due to severe sanctions and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, this research aimed to assess the energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient intakes of Iranian adults (19-60 years) and elderly individuals (> 60 years), based on the Food and Drug Administration dietary intake recommendations, through a survey. This was a cross-sectional survey conducted from 2021 to 2022. The study included 1697 adults aged over18 years, selected from 11 geographical zones of Iran based on socio-economic and geographic similarities. All participants underwent dietary assessment using a validated 65-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Macronutrient and micronutrient intakes were compared with Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). The Dietary Quality Index- International (DQI-I) was also calculated. In the adults aged 19-60 years, the mean usual energy intake was 2,321.64 ± 33.16 kcal/day. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein constituted 50.4%, 38.3%, and 13.45% of total energy intake, respectively. About 64.0% of women and 78.0% of men consumed fiber in amounts lower than recommended. The percentage of insufficiency was approximately 100% for retinol and vitamin D in both genders. Insufficient folate intake was 90.1% in women and 89.9% in men (p = 0.038). Excess sodium intake was more prevalent in men (p = 0.003). In the elderly (> 60 years), the mean usual energy intake was 1,987 kcal/day. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein constituted 52.98%, 35.88%, and 13.9% of total energy intake, respectively. The percentage of insufficiency for vitamin D, retinol, folate, selenium, and potassium intake was high (more than 80%) in both genders. Zinc insufficiency and excess sodium intake were significantly more prevalent in men. This study indicated that carbohydrate and protein intakes were within the recommended ranges, while fat consumption was elevated in both adults and the elderly. Widespread micronutrient insufficiencies- especially in retinol, folate, vitamin D, potassium, and selenium- were evident across both genders and age groups. Excessive sodium consumption was more prevalent in men, along with a higher prevalence of zinc deficiency. These findings highlight the need for targeted dietary interventions to address nutritional gaps and promote healthier eating habits.",

        "abstract": "Internal displacement due to conflict or crises has led to millions, including children under five, residing in precarious internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. Malnutrition, predominantly undernutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa, is a significant concern in these contexts. This review aimed to assess the factors and determinants of malnutrition among under-five children in IDP Camps in Africa. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the research protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023460266). Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, CABI Abstracts, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched methodically. The AXIS Critical Appraisal of Cross-sectional Studies Tool was utilized to evaluate the quality and risk of bias of each included study. After screening full-text articles, eight studies meeting eligibility criteria were included in the review. Factors influencing nutritional status of under-five children were summarized into 11 themes: Age, Gender, Caregiver's Educational Status, Family Planning, Antenatal Care, Displacement Status, Access to Safe Water and Handwashing, Dietary Diversity, Disease History, Caregiver's Occupation, and Household Income. This review examined the factors contributing to malnutrition among under-five children in IDP camps in Africa, and sheds light on neglected crises. It adds to existing knowledge in this area. The findings underscore the need for future research to explore variations in malnutrition determinants across different IDP contexts and to focus on multi-sector collaboration for effective policy implementation in addressing malnutrition in African IDP camps.",

        "abstract": "The Rural Hospital Tax Credit program, legislated by the Georgia General Assembly, provides financial support to rural hospitals by allowing Georgia taxpayers to contribute to eligible rural hospitals, receiving a 100% tax credit for their donation. While the policy aims to improve hospital financial stability, little is known about public awareness of the program or factors influencing willingness to donate. This study examines community members’ awareness of the Georgia rural hospital tax credit program and their willingness to donate to it to better understand donor perspectives in underserved areas. The study analyzed secondary data obtained from surveys completed as a part of community health needs assessments conducted for six rural South Georgia hospitals. A total of 940 residents from hospital communities were surveyed. Logistic regression was used to assess correlations between individuals’ resources, their relationship to the community, their views of the hospital, and other demographic characteristics, and their awareness of and willingness to donate to their hospital through the rural hospital tax credit program. Awareness of the tax credit program was significantly associated with greater utilization of local hospital services (OR = 3.45; 95% CI: 1.63–7.30, e.g.) and longer tenure in the community (OR 2.21; 95% CI: 1.14–7.3, e.g.). Willingness to donate was significantly associated with higher household income (OR 5.99; 95% CI: 3.14,11.42, e.g.), higher educational attainment (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.29–2.78, e.g.), and high satisfaction with hospital quality (OR = 5.99; 95% CI: 1.60–22.48). In addition, individuals who were aware of the program were more likely to report willingness to donate (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01–2.03). In addition to individual resources, awareness of this hospital tax credit program and hospital quality also influence willingness to donate. These insights may inform outreach strategies aimed at increasing community contributions to rural hospitals through tax-incentivized giving. While this Georgia program is state-specific, similar strategies can be beneficial for hospitals elsewhere. Philanthropy provides an opportunity to improve the financial status of rural hospitals, many of which are struggling.

        "abstract": "Teenage pregnancy continues to be a significant public health concern that carries several health risks. This study assesses the trends of teenage pregnancy in Tanzania and identifies key individual and community factors influencing its occurrence. This study used a pooled weighted sample of 10,404 teenagers (aged 15-19) from four waves of the Tanzania Demographic and Health Surveys. Given the complex survey design, a multilevel logistics regression model was used to examine the trends and predictors of teenage pregnancy from 2004 to 2022. Both fixed and random effects were estimated. The overall pooled weighted prevalence of teenage pregnancy was 24.1% (95%CI: 22.9-25.3) across all survey waves. The trends showed that between the years 2004/05 and 2010, the prevalence decreased from 26.0 to 22.8%, increased again to 26.7% in 2015/16, and once more, declined to 21.1% in 2022. The individual factors associated with a high rate of teenage pregnancy were increased age (AOR = 2.36, 95%CI: 2.22-2.50) and working (AOR = 1.34, 95%CI: 1.14-1.56). However, primary education (AOR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.54-0.91), secondary or higher education (AOR = 0.13, 95%CI: 0.09-0.18), literate teenagers (AOR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.61-0.94) and socioeconomic status of richest quantile (AOR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.27-0.54) were less likely to experience teenage pregnancy. Regarding community-level factors, high literacy communities (AOR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.67-0.95) were less likely to experience teenage pregnancy, while rural settings (AOR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.02-1.31) exhibited higher odds. The interplay between education, employment, and access to reproductive health services, ongoing disparities, particularly in rural settings and socio-economic contexts, is associated with a persistent prevalence of teenage pregnancy. Thus, continued efforts are paramount to addressing teenage pregnancy with a multi-dimensional approach at the individual, community, and policy levels.",

        "abstract": "Oral health remains challenging in nursing home residents. The international Resident Assessment Instrument for Long-Term Care Facilities (interRAI LTCF) enables multidimensional geriatric assessment and care planning through Collaborative Action Points (CAPs), scales, and other outputs. The optimised oral health section for use within the interRAI instruments, OHS-interRAI, empowers non-dental caregivers to monitor and address oral health issues. This qualitative study explores caregivers' experiences with the OHS-interRAI to guide its further optimisation and implementation. Qualitative data were collected from non-dental caregivers (e.g., nurses, nurse aides) between February-November 2023 within a cluster randomised controlled trial comprising one control and two intervention groups. Focus groups, supplemented by observations, were conducted three months and one year after the training and implementation of the OHS-interRAI. Both intervention groups received e-learning. Additionally, intervention group 2 received on-site training. The control group continued using the existing oral health section. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) of the OHS-interRAI and its implementation were analysed and validated by the participants. Thirty-one caregivers were involved in six focus groups. The OHS-interRAI was valued for its comprehensive, accurate, and easy-to-perform assessment. CAPs were considered useful, though triggered frequently and not yet used in care planning. Implementation opportunities were mainly situated at policy and organisational levels. Threats included staffing-related issues, gaps in oral health knowledge and skills, team involvement and motivation, and dementia-related challenges. Nineteen caregivers were observed conducting 51 oral health assessments. All intervention group caregivers visually inspected residents' mouth, averaging 5 min 48 s (± 3 min) per assessment, including introductory and conclusive acts. Assessment skills were sufficient, though infection control needed attention. Control group assessments lacked visual inspection and were sometimes completed without residents' presence. The OHS-interRAI enables non-dental caregivers to assess and monitor oral health in a feasible manner. Broader implementation and use in care planning require integration of the OHS-interRAI into the interRAI LTCF instrument. Key prerequisites include user-friendly software, involving more staff, training, protocols and guidelines for oral care and improved access to dental care. Incorporating dental hygienists into multidisciplinary teams and engaging residents and families offer additional opportunities to enhance oral health outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels after statin initiation for primary prevention and their association with incident cardiovascular events. This was a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, among persons aged ≥66 years starting a statin for primary prevention between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019. We identified those with a lipid panel in the 1-year after starting a statin and categorized individuals based on LDL-C and non-HDL-C thresholds for intensification in the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society dyslipidemia guidelines. We stratified by diabetes/chronic kidney disease (CKD) status. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events, with follow-up to December 31, 2020. We used a Cox proportional hazards model for analysis. Our cohort comprised 125,013 people. The median follow-up was 2.5 years. Compared with those meeting both LDL-C and non-HDL-C thresholds, being above both thresholds was associated with an increased rate of the primary outcome for people without diabetes/CKD (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15) and for those with diabetes/CKD (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.09-1.23). Being below the LDL-C threshold but above non-HDL-C threshold was associated with an increased rate of the primary outcome for people with diabetes/CKD (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.30).

To understand factors influencing treatment decision-making (TDM) for and adherence to AS, we performed a systematic review. <b>Methods</b>: This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42024490427). A comprehensive search strategy from 1990 to 2024 was executed across multiple databases, including Medline and Embase. Studies were included if they examined factors influencing TDM for AS or active monitoring (AM) and adherence to AS/AM. <b>Results</b>: Of the 8316 articles identified, 223 articles were eligible for inclusion. The decision for AS was influenced by different factors, including comprehensive information about treatment options, social support, and wanting to avoid side-effects. Key reasons to choose AT over AS included a lack of information from healthcare professionals about AS and fear of disease progression. Reasons for adhering to the AS protocol included better quality of life and social support. While non-adherence to the AS protocol is prompted by, e.g., biopsy burden and uncertainty, AS discontinuation is generally a results of medical reasons (namely disease upgrading) or from anxiety and family pressure. <b>Conclusions</b>: Numerous factors influence men's treatment pathway choices. Involving family members in shared decision-making and ensuring that patients have detailed information about AS as a treatment option could help to improve AS uptake. Addressing psychosocial challenges through education and family involvement could improve AS adherence. These insights can help healthcare providers by addressing men's needs during TDM and AS.",

The integration of digital health in primary care, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has transformed nursing practices with a view to provide better support and services to patients. The World Health Organization defines \"digital health\" as the use of electronic technologies to improve health. Its 2020-2025 strategy seeks to integrate these technologies into health systems to facilitate communication between professionals, patients, and authorities. Tools such as telehealth, electronic records, artificial intelligence, and big data are transforming the role of nurses, who must become familiar with them for their performance. Qualitative studies on digital health in primary care nursing were reviewed following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) guidelines and using the Joanna Briggs Institute for Qualitative Research (JBI-QARI) criteria. Eleven articles were analyzed using thematic coding according to Thomas and Harden's approach, identifying three main themes: adaptation to digital health, nurses' perspective on digital health, and nurse-patient digital interaction. The integration of digital health has required nurses to adapt quickly. They have expressed both benefits and challenges, highlighting the importance of adequate training, personalization in the use of digital tools, information security, and optimization of technological infrastructure. It is essential to assess the current competencies of nurses in digital health in order to meet their needs. Health systems should incorporate new technologies into clinical practice guidelines and health programs to improve and update the continuity and quality of care in primary care.

This study investigates whether PICO can be predicted across EU member states using publicly available information. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles. Additionally, an extensive search of publicly available HTA documents, including reports, methodological guidelines, submission templates, and market access information was performed across 29 European countries. Relevant information for PICO anticipation was extracted. For many member states, a wealth of relevant information is publicly accessible: 66% have HTA reports publicly available, 79% have HTA methodological guidelines, 69% have dossier templates, and 100% have market access status lists. Between countries, the requirements for population and outcomes are largely aligned, making comparator the central element in PICO anticipation. PICO can be anticipated reliably based on public information. HTDs must be prepared to adjust their strategies as national procedures adapt, ensuring alignment with both current and emerging EU and national requirements.",

        "abstract": "Supportive supervision of community health workers (CHWs) is considered a promising intervention for optimizing efficiency and health systems outcomes. However, little is known about how supportive supervision is conceptualized and implemented across maternal and child health (MCH) programs in India. We examined the scope of supportive supervision in selected MCH programs. We analyzed 29 programmatic documents and implementation guidelines from seven programs, and identified and extracted data on several themes, such as conceptualization, operationalization, monitoring and evaluation, and quality assurance of supportive supervision according to a pre-determined domain-based template. We found notable differences in the scope and quality of supportive supervision offered under different programs. Many programs did not include supportive supervision as a supervisory modality. Programs which included supportive supervision did not define all the parameters of operationalization - responsible workforce, frequency of visits, procedure, training, logistic support, supervision formats/checklists, scope for and frequency of monitoring and evaluation, and quality assurance of supervisory visits. Even when some parameters were defined, there was considerable heterogeneity in implementation across programs. Such inconsistencies may adversely affect the quality and efficiency of supportive supervision, thereby minimizing its potential. Policymakers should prioritize the redesign of supportive supervision strategies to ensure greater clarity and consistency across key domains, thereby optimizing community health worker performance and strengthening public health program outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Aggressive care at end-of-life can harm quality of life without significantly improving survival. Despite best practice guidelines, research shows that oncologists continue to provide too much treatment to patients, especially at the end-of-life. Understanding the perceptions of oncologists regarding unnecessary care toward end-of-life can inform interventions and mitigate overuse. This study aimed to understand the perceptions and experiences of oncologists regarding why overuse of services is occurring for cancer patients at the end-of-life and elucidate factors which impede the implementation of best practices at the end-of-life in cancer. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with oncologists in Israel. The interview guide was based on the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify beliefs about practices in caring for patients at the end-of-life and transitioning to palliative care. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. Participants identified six major barriers and 12 major facilitators to reducing overuse at end-of-life. Barriers included patients seeking second opinions, patient and family fragility, pressure and demands from patients and families, a culture of valuing extending life, time constructs, and physicians' emotional regulation. Physicians reduce overuse by relying on experience, communication and relationship building skills, taking ownership over their roles, confidence in their abilities, belief and recognition of the importance of appropriate care, involving families and other healthcare professionals and easing into the process. Oncologist opinions vary based on role and geographical area of practice. Physicians can influence the rate of overuse as they guide patients at end-of-life. Findings can be utilized to help the health system in Israel reduce the overuse of unnecessary services at the end-of-life for cancer. Interventions such as palliative care referrals, multidisciplinary teams, and educational initiatives can help minimize overuse and improve quality of life for patients in their final days. Future research should incorporate views and perspectives of other stakeholders.",

        "abstract": "To test whether nursing informatics competency (NIC) and innovation ability predict nurses' willingness for \"Internet + nursing service\" in China's Greater Bay Area, and examine the role of innovation ability in this relationship. Cross-sectional study. Recruited registered nurses via quota sampling in China's Greater Bay Area. Participants completed validated scales assessing NIC, Innovation Behaviour, and Willingness for Internet + nursing service, testing a hypothesised mediation model where innovation ability links informatics competency to willingness. Data were collected from 544 registered nurses between January and March 2024. Nurses reported moderate levels of NIC, innovation ability, and willingness for Internet + nursing service. Higher informatics competency was associated with greater innovation ability and willingness. Furthermore, innovation ability appeared as a pathway linking informatics competency to willingness. Stronger NIC and innovation ability may boost nurses' readiness for Internet-enabled care in the Greater Bay Area. Targeted informatics and innovation training can enhance nurses' readiness for these digital services. Addressing the need for enhanced digital nursing ('Internet + nursing service') for the aging population in China's Greater Bay Area, this study found moderate nurse informatics competency, innovation ability, and willingness to engage in this service. Higher competency and innovation were linked to greater willingness, with informatics competency influencing willingness directly and through innovation ability. These findings impact nursing practice, education, and policy in the region, informing strategies to improve digital service readiness. This study adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. No patients or members of the public were involved in study design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination.",

        "abstract": "In California, USA, adult cannabis legalization (ACL) was passed in 2016, with implementation of legal sales commencing in 2018. This study examined whether these policy changes were associated with changes in alcohol use patterns and explored age-group differences. We examined monthly rates of positive alcohol screens in primary care patients in California from 2015 to 2019. Using an interrupted time series design and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, changes were evaluated in the overall sample and stratified by age groups (21-34, 35-64 and 65+) across two key intervention points for ACL: 9 November 2016 (ACL passage) and 1 January 2018 (ACL implementation). Time-varying confounders of seasonality and autocorrelation were controlled for. California, United States; Kaiser Permanente Northern California Healthcare System. Across the study period, n = 8 028 627 screenings were completed for  n= 3 525 493 unique patients aged 21+ . Aggregated monthly rates of patients exceeding daily limits, weekly limits, exceeding both daily and weekly limits and frequent heavy episodic drinking (HED), based on current US guidelines set by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Statistically significant, gradual declines in rates of both exceeding weekly alcohol limits [estimate (95% confidence interval [CI]) of slope change = -0.013(-0.019 to -0.008), P < 0.001] and frequent HED followed ACL passage [estimate (95% CI) of slope change = -0.015(-0.024 to -0.005), P = 0.003]. ACL implementation was generally not associated with further changes, suggesting changes after ACL passage were sustained over time. Age-group patterns varied: young adults (21-34) demonstrated an immediate increase, followed by a statistically significant gradual decline in rates of HED post-ACL passage [estimate (95% CI) of slope change = -0.096(-0.160, -0.033), P = 0.003], as well as an immediate decrease post ACL implementation; adults 35-49 showed consistent declines in step and slope in rates of frequent HED post ACL passage; adults 50-64 showed an immediate increase in rates of exceeding weekly limits [estimate (95% CI) of step change = 0.167(0.036-0.297), P = 0.012], with gradual declines in the other drinking limits; adults 65 + had small, gradual decreases. In addition, exploratory analyses in 18-20-year-olds showed gradual increases in rates of frequent HED post ACL passage, but the P value was not significant after Bonferroni correction. Cannabis policy changes in California, USA, appear to be linked to age-specific changes in alcohol use, with moderate reductions, particularly among middle-aged adults. Findings were associative in nature and causality could not be determined.",

        "abstract": "The neighborhood is a regular living and activity space for older adults. It is important to identify neighborhood environmental factors that can alleviate depression in the older adults to improve their health. However, existing literature does not consider the complex interdependencies among key neighborhood environmental factors. This study employs fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to explore how configurations of neighborhood environmental conditions alleviate depressive symptoms in Chinese older adults. The data is derived from the 2020 China Family Panel Study (CFPS), a nationally representative survey. The final sample consisted of 4,697 participants aged 60 and above. Condition variables included community facilities, the surrounding housing environment, neighborhood safety, neighborhood relations, and neighborhood assistance. The fsQCA procedure entailed operationalizing condition variables, calibrating variables, conducting necessity analysis to evaluate single conditions, performing sufficiency analysis to identify configurations of conditions, and interpreting the resulting configurations. The results show that three different neighborhood environment configurations can help reduce depressive symptoms in older Chinese individuals. The first configuration requires a combination of neighborhood safety, good neighborhood relations, and neighborhood assistance. The second configuration involves amalgamating optimal community facilities, high-quality neighborhood relations, and neighborhood assistance. These research results deepen the current understanding of neighborhood environment configurations to alleviate depressive symptoms in older adults, offer important implications for theory and practice, and set new directions for the construction of age-friendly neighborhoods.",

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) requires comprehensive management due to its complex nature. The Atrial Fibrillation Better Care (ABC) pathway, introduced in the 2020 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines, has demonstrated clinical benefits, yet adherence remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the impact of establishing an Atrial Fibrillation Centre (AFC) on ABC pathway adherence in a Chinese teaching hospital. This study employed an interrupted time series analysis to assess monthly ABC pathway adherence rates before and after AFC construction. The analysis focused on anticoagulation (A), better symptom control (B) and comorbidity management (C). Following AFC establishment, the hospital-wide ABC adherence rate increased by 11.82%, with a sustained monthly increase of 0.27%. Improvements were primarily observed in cardiology and internal medicine departments, whereas surgical departments showed minimal change. Anticoagulation and symptom control adherence improved significantly, while comorbidity management remained unchanged. The AFC improved ABC pathway adherence through standardised, multidisciplinary AF management. Significant gains in anticoagulation and symptom control were observed, but rhythm control and comorbidity management remained suboptimal. Barriers include limited ablation access and fragmented care. Future efforts should enhance interdisciplinary collaboration, expand procedural accessibility and integrate long-term cardiovascular risk management to optimise AF care. Establishing an AFC significantly improved ABC pathway adherence, which proved effective in both stroke prevention and symptom management, particularly in cardiology and internal medicine departments. Future efforts should focus on enhancing rhythm control strategies and optimising comorbidity management to further improve integrated AF care. MR-50-24-014759.",

        "abstract": "Globally, older adults are living longer but often in poorer health with multiple chronic conditions straining healthcare systems. Gerotherapeutics, which target the biological mechanisms of aging, could reduce this burden by extending healthspan. However, before therapies can be adopted, they must undergo rigorous study and regulatory approval; existing regulatory frameworks and the barriers to their development are unknown. We conducted a scoping review of geroscience regulatory frameworks and identified barriers to their development. A comprehensive government, academic, and grey literature search in the United States, Europe, Canada, and other regions including Medline and EMBASE (via OVID), Google Scholar, CINAHL, and CADTH Grey Matters was conducted. For inclusion of only recent literature, searches were limited to English-language publications from 2014 to 2024. In 3,780 publications screened for inclusion, no regulatory frameworks for gerotherapeutics were found. In the 34 included publications, 4 major barriers were identified: 1) lack of recognition of the biological processes of aging as targets for medical intervention; 2) absence of clear regulatory pathways to evaluate aging-focused therapies; 3) economic uncertainties, including high development costs and limited incentives due to unclear regulatory environments; and 4) insufficient public and policy engagement. We did not identify any geroscience specific regulatory frameworks but identified barriers to their development. For biological aging to advance as a therapeutic target, stakeholders must develop comprehensive regulatory guidelines, incentivize research and conduct public education. Global collaboration is crucial to harmonize regulatory efforts and ensure equitable adoption of therapies, ultimately enhancing healthspan worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Health inequalities remain one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary healthcare, with primary care serving as both a gateway to services and a potential source of disparities. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to address these inequities through enhanced diagnostic capabilities, improved access to care, and personalised interventions. This comprehensive narrative review aimed to synthesise current evidence on AI applications in primary care settings, specifically targeting health inequality reduction and identifying both opportunities and barriers for equitable implementation. Following PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we employed a systematic approach to literature identification, selection, and synthesis across seven electronic databases covering literature from 2020 to 2024. Of 1,247 initially identified studies, 89 met inclusion criteria with 52 providing sufficient data quality for evidence synthesis. The review identified promising applications such as AI-powered risk stratification algorithms that improved hypertension control in low-income populations, telemedicine platforms reducing geographic barriers in rural communities, and natural language processing tools facilitating care for non-native speakers. However, significant challenges persist, including algorithmic bias that may perpetuate existing inequities, the digital divide excluding vulnerable populations, and insufficient representation in training datasets. Current evidence suggests that whilst AI holds transformative potential for advancing health equity, successful implementation requires intentional co-design with affected communities, robust bias mitigation strategies, and comprehensive digital literacy programmes. Future research must prioritise equity-centred AI development, longitudinal outcome studies in diverse populations, and policy frameworks ensuring responsible deployment. However, careful consideration of unintended consequences, including potential overdiagnosis, erosion of human clinical judgement, and inadvertent exclusion of vulnerable populations, is essential to prevent AI from exacerbating existing health disparities. The paradigm shift towards equity-first AI design represents a critical opportunity to leverage technology for social justice in healthcare.",

We conducted purposeful and convenience sampling to identify researchers who published resistance training (RT) trials. We invited 80 research scientists to participate in a modified Delphi consensus process. Nineteen researchers from six countries (Canada, USA, UK, Australia, Greece, and Puerto Rico) agreed to participate. We drafted adapted AE-reporting recommendations informed by interviewing participants with common health conditions who experienced AEs after RT (n=12), and researchers who published RT trials (n=14). These recommendations were turned into a survey that was distributed electronically to the Delphi participants for rating. We conducted three rounds of voting until there was consensus (criterion: minimum 74% agreement) on each recommendation. All 19 participants responded to the three survey rounds (100% response rate). After each round, the recommendations were revised based on the participants' feedback. For the first round, ten of 24 recommendations did not meet the criterion for consensus. For the second round, one of 28 recommendations did not meet the criterion for consensus. For the final round, the remaining recommendation met the criterion for consensus. The agreed upon recommendations were used to develop the AERIES-RT toolkit including a checklist, template AE reporting form, and a decision tree. Our modified e-Delphi consensus process resulted in developing the AERIES-RT toolkit that researchers can use to improve the frequency and accuracy of AE reporting in RT trials.",

Increasingly diverse student populations, the legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic, and variations in policies and service provision across the 4 UK nations have highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of student mental health. Current literature remains fragmented, with limited synthesis comparing national contexts. This protocol outlines a scoping review to systematically map the evidence base, identify key research gaps, and inform future research priorities and interventions. The primary aim is to identify and map existing research on student mental health in UK HEIs. Specific objectives include exploring how student mental health is defined and measured, identifying risk factors, assessing support systems and interventions, and highlighting gaps in research across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This scoping review will follow Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and be reported in line with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Studies will be eligible for inclusion if they (1) were conducted in the United Kingdom; (2) involved students aged 16 years and older enrolled in HEIs; (3) addressed mental health-related outcomes, definitions, or interventions; and (4) were published in English from 2005 onwards. Excluded materials include gray literature not identified during database searching. A comprehensive 3-step search strategy will be used. Initially, APA PsycInfo and MEDLINE (Ovid) will be searched, followed by a broader search across Scopus, Web of Science (Core Collection), Child and Adolescent Development Studies, and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists of the included studies will be screened for additional sources. All citations will be managed using Covidence, and study selection will involve title/abstract screening and full-text review by independent reviewers. Data extraction will include information on study design, population characteristics, mental health outcomes, measures used, interventions, and key findings. Data will be presented in tabular and narrative forms and, where appropriate, descriptive content analysis will be used. As of April 2025, preliminary searches and pilot screenings have been completed. The full database search and data charting phase will commence in June 2025. The final synthesis, analysis, and stakeholder consultation are scheduled between September and November 2025. The full review will be completed by December 2025, with dissemination activities planned through early 2026. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of student mental health research within UK HEIs. It will highlight the key national differences, emerging themes, and underresearched areas, supporting more targeted, evidence-informed policy and practice. Limitations include language and gray literature exclusions. Nonetheless, the findings are expected to make a timely and meaningful contribution to research and intervention strategies in UK higher education. PRR1-10.2196/65594.",
