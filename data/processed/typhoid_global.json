        "abstract": "Hospitals provide essential health services, focusing on quality, safety, and patient-centered care. The rising prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases in Indonesia has led to increased National Health Insurance (NHI) costs, with communicable diseases representing a significant burden despite global progress in disease control. Tuberculosis remains a major global health concern, causing 1.25 million deaths in 2023, while Indonesia ranks second globally for tuberculosis burden, accounting for 10% of global TB cases with an estimated 969,000 cases annually. Despite efforts to improve quality, Haji and Labuang Baji Hospitals face challenges, including financial losses and suboptimal patient outcomes. This study aims to assess the impact of an Integrated Clinical Pathway (ICP)-based Professional Nursing Practice Model on clinical outcomes, hospital costs, and patient satisfaction at these hospitals. This study employed action research methodology by developing, implementing, and evaluating the clinical guidelines and ICP for 10 diseases that were categorized as high volume, high risk, and high cost based on secondary data analysis using the NHI databases. Data was collected through observation of the ICP implementation on 40 patients and interviews of Professional Care Providers (PCPs) and was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 28. A total of 40 patients from Haji Hospital (n = 20) and from Labuang Baji Hospital (n = 20) with diagnoses of pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, dyspepsia, typhoid fever, normal delivery, and COPD were included and analyzed. Compliance with ICPs in both hospitals was quite low: 50.02% in Haji Hospital and 44.46% in Labuang Baji Hospital. However, the length of patients' stays (LOS) generally complied with ICP standards, although some cases exceeded the benchmarks. Hospital costs varied across different disease diagnoses, impacting overall financial outcomes. Patient satisfaction improved across all diagnostic categories. The implementation of ICP at both hospitals showed that all indicators of patient clinical outcomes improved according to the time specified in ICP, resulting in patients' LOS being shorter than stipulated in ICP and an increase in patient satisfaction. ICP implementation has also led to hospitals earning different profits in almost all diagnoses.",

        "abstract": "To systematically review the literature on the epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance, and control strategies for typhoid fever, focusing on Southeast Asia, where the disease burden and emergence of drug-resistant strains are significant. A systematic review was used, and twenty-five manuscripts fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included. Only human studies affected by typhoid fever were included, including systematic reviews, narrative reviews, meta-analyses, cross-sectional studies, original studies, editorials, or Commentary. Manuscripts were searched and reviewed according to PRISMA guidelines. From 2006 to 2024, six reliable sources, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Embase, were evaluated. Typhoid fever remains a significant global health burden, particularly in regions with poor sanitation. In 2019, there were about 9.2 million cases and 110,000 deaths, with the highest rates in the Eastern Mediterranean, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Treatment options exist, and the emergence of drug-resistant strains, including those resistant to first-line antibiotics like azithromycin, poses a serious threat. The misuse of antibiotics primarily causes this resistance. Effective control strategies require improved sanitation and hygiene, widespread vaccination, prudent antibiotic use and stewardship programs, enhanced surveillance, and drug resistance monitoring. Typhoid, caused by Salmonella typhi, remains a health threat in Southeast Asia due to poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Addressing this requires improved sanitation, vaccination, careful antibiotic use, and intense surveillance to combat antibiotic-resistant strains.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, caused primarily by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi, stands as a significant global health concern, with complications extending beyond the typical gastrointestinal manifestations. This review systematically examines the intricate relationship between typhoid fever and hematologic complications, collectively referred to as typhoidal anemia. Hematological abnormalities, including changes in blood profiles and bone marrow responses, are scrutinized, providing a comprehensive understanding of the disease's impact on physiological systems. Specific populations, such as immunocompromised individuals, sickle cell anemia patients, and children in resource-limited settings, reveal varied susceptibilities and outcomes. Complications, such as psoas abscess and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, are explored, highlighting the multifaceted nature of the disease. The distinct contributions of Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi to anemia are elucidated, shedding light on the pathophysiological mechanisms involved. Global prevalence and epidemiological variations offer valuable perspectives, underscoring the importance of regional nuances in disease manifestation. Challenges in accurate diagnosis and treatment limitations are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for continued research to enhance diagnostic precision and therapeutic strategies. Insights into long-term effects, prognosis, and the influence of host factors contribute to a holistic understanding of typhoidal anemia. The review concludes by identifying critical gaps in knowledge, advocating for ongoing research initiatives and heightened awareness campaigns. The synthesis of diverse findings provides a comprehensive overview of typhoidal anemia, underscoring the imperative of continued research and awareness for improved patient care and global public health.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common infectious diseases and remain a heavy burden, especially in some low-income countries. Although the global burden has decreased over the past three decades, an analysis of the burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever will help inform public health strategies. This study is aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of typhoid and paratyphoid, and the temporal trends while exploring potential associations with socio-demographic development over three decades (1990-2021). Data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2021. For this analysis, we calculated to demonstrate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021. From 1990 to 2021, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever showed declining trends globally and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, including incidence, mortality, and DALYs. For typhoid fever worldwide, new cases decreased by 62.12%, with an EAPC of -3.92 (-4.14, -3.71); deaths decreased by 50.65%, EAPC - 2.83 (-2.99, -2.66), and DALYs decreased by 52.30%, EAPC - 2.82 (-3.00, -2.64). For paratyphoid fever, new cases decreased by 73.15%, with an EAPC of -4.77 (-5.29, -4.26); deaths decreased by 65.44%, EAPC - 3.74 (-4.24, -3.24), and DALYs decreased by 68.42%, EAPC - 3.87 (-4.42, -3.31). For both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, children had the highest morbidity and mortality rates; males had higher rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs than females. However, among older patients, the absolute number of new cases and DALYs was higher in women. The burden is concentrated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, with only South Asia suffering severely from paratyphoid fever. Regarding typhoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of incidence are Burkina Faso (328.48) (SDI: 0.285), Bangladesh (303.14) (SDI: 0.492), and Papua New Guinea (299.45) (SDI: 418) which are in Western Sub-Saharan, South Asia, and Oceania. The top three countries in terms of mortality and DALYs are Bhutan (5.61; 434.23) (SDI: 0.473), Bangladesh (5.06; 382.38), and Burkina Faso (4.64; 352.57). Regarding paratyphoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of mortality and DALYs are the same, including Pakistan (1.05; 72.66), India (0.75; 53.42), and Nepal (0.72; 50.65) (SDI: 0.433), all of which are located in South Asia.",

It was first published in the tenth year of the Tongzhi Period in the Qing Dynasty (1871). It was found that the existing version is only the engraved one in the tenth year of the Tongzhi Period (1871).

The one with the author's stamp, collected by the Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, is believed to be the most valuable version. Beyond that, the other two fragment books have been collected by the Medical Branch of Wuhan University Library and the library of Tianjin Medical College respectively. Its author Dai Yaochi annotated <i>Shang Han Lun</i> by revising, deleting, splitting and merging the content to minimise negligence and playing new tricks. He believed that \"typhoid fever is a process of identifying the six meridians. If the six meridians failed to be clarified, the clinical symptoms would not be treated reasonably\" after editing the complicated and messy provisions of the original texts. Therefore, he recompiled the style of <i>Shang Han Lun</i> in his book <i>Shang Han Zheng Jie,</i> reorganised his book with the Six Meridians, and reinterpreted <i>Shang Han Lun</i> based on his own understanding and other annotations of previous authors.",

It was widely believed that Dai Tianzhang was the author of the two books rather than Zheng Dianyi. This study examined the two authors' biography, diverse versions of authors notes and other relevant materials that remained, and the compatibility between the content and the book names. It was found that Zheng Dianyi was a physician with excellent medical skills and ability to compile the book, whereas Dai Tianzhang was a local celebrity and gentleman who had some medical skills with some medical experience. The author for various versions of <i>Wen Yi Ming Bian</i> was recorded as \"She Yi (the place where Zheng Dianyi lived) Zheng Dianyi\". The author for the versions related to Dai Tianzhang were normally shown as \"Revised by Dai Linjiao (the penname of Dai Tianzhang)\". In this sense, the author of <i>Wen Yi Ming Bian</i> can be argued to be Zheng Dianyi. Additionally, the name of <i>Wen Yi Ming Bian</i> is different from <i>Guang Wen Yi Lun</i> in meanings. <i>Bian</i> () in <i>Wen Yi Ming Bian</i> means to distinguish the right from the wrong, therefore, indicates to distinguish, for example, typhoid fever from warm epidemic, making <i>Guang</i> () in <i>Guang Wen Yi Lun</i> far away from it. Thus, the author of <i>Wen Yi Ming Bian</i> should be Zheng Dianyi. <i>Guang Wen Yi Lun</i> should be the different name when <i>Wen Yi Ming Bian</i> was hand copied. It can be concluded that Dai's grandsons statement \"the two books were written by Dai Tianzhang\" is subjective speculation, without sufficient evidence.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a serious infectious disease caused by <i>Salmonella typhi</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> <i>Paratyphi A.</i> Although there are several drugs available for the treatment of <i>Salmonella</i> infection, however, the rising cases of bacterial resistance against common drugs necessitate new drug discovery against <i>S.</i> <i>typhi.</i> So Typhoid fever can be managed in a better way. Therefore we carried out the phytochemical analysis of <i>Cotinus coggygria</i> by FTIR and GC-MS analysis followed by antibacterial activity against <i>S. typhi.</i> Moreover, We also conducted molecular docking to find out important phytochemicals; methanol (48 compounds) and ethyl acetate (66 compounds) and 6 molecular targets; glycosidehydrolase (PDB Id: 4hzm), OmpF (PDB Id; 4kra), DNA gyrase (PDB Id;5ZTJ), AvrA (PDB Id; 6BE0), RamR (PDB Id; 6IE9), and tryptophan Synthase (PDB Id; 7L03). Results show that the ethyl acetate extracts of <i>C. coggygria</i> have the highest antibacterial activity against <i>S. typhi</i>, with inhibition zones ranging from 23 ± 2.8 to 18 ± 0.5 mm at different concentrations as compared to methanol extracts. Based on the docking score, DNA gyrase (5ZTJ) was found as the most suitable molecular target. DNA gyrase (5ZTJ). Further molecular dynamics simulation study resulted in 7 potential inhibitors from ethyl acetate extract and 5 potential inhibitors from methanol extracts as they had lower free binding energy than the reference drug ciprofloxacin. Based on this study we conclude that the top four phytochemicals that may be used for therapeutic purposes and drug development against <i>salmonella</i> activity are Lanosterol, Lup-20(29)-en-3-one, 9,19-Cyclolanost-24-en-3-ol, (3. beta.)-), and Periplogenin acetate.",

        "abstract": "<i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. <i>enterica</i> includes both typhoidal and non-typhoidal serovars. The former are more likely to cause systemic infections such as typhoid fever, while the latter typically result in localized gastroenteritis. The main symptoms of non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (NTS)infection are transient diarrhea, which typically resolves within approximately five days. However, in a few cases, it may worsen and cause multiorgan dysfunction. A 39-year-old healthy male developed an NTS infection, which likely manifested as enteritis, followed by <i>Salmonella</i> bacteremia, spondylitis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient required mechanical ventilatory support due to rapidly progressive respiratory failure; however, the respiratory condition improved within a short period following antibiotic therapy. Subsequently, prolonged antibiotic treatment was administered for spondylitis. While bone manifestations of NTS bacteremia are frequently reported, cases complicated by both acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and spondylitis are rare. The mechanism of pyogenic spondylitis development by <i>Salmonella</i> is thought to involve hematogenous infection associated with bacteremia. On the other hand, the pathogenesis of ARDS remains unclear. However, direct lung tissue damage caused by <i>Salmonella</i> and secondary lung injury resulting from systemic inflammatory response syndrome may play a role. This case highlights an unusual presentation in a relatively young and otherwise healthy adult.",

Consequently, antibiotic-resistant typhoid bacteria appear, but are not reported to the authorities. There is limited research on the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of S. Typhi among febrile patients in Swabi, Pakistan. This study aimed to address this gap at the Bacha Khan Medical Complex in Swabi. Laboratory records of hospitalized patients who received a blood culture from September 2022 to August 2023 were reviewed in this retrospective, cross-sectional study. Every isolate of S. Typhi underwent antibiotic susceptibility test using modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion and agar-dilution methods to measure the isolates' minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ciprofloxacin and azithromycin. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 24.0. 4.85% of febrile patients were positive for S. Typhi, with a higher prevalence in the 0-14 years age group. Male gender and seasonal variation were significant factors. The isolates were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin; and sensitive to azithromycin, and carbapenems. The MICs for ciprofloxacin were between 0.06 to 16 µg/mL. Among the isolates, 1.094% were sensitive and 98.90% were resistant to ciprofloxacin; and 100% isolates were susceptible to azithromycin. Azithromycin and carbapenem were a suitable empirical therapy choice. However, the isolates were highly resistant to conventional first-line antibiotics (ampicillin, amoxicillin), second generation fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), and third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime), that are considered vital in typhoid treatment.",

This study focuses on the extensive drug resistance (XDR) of <i>Salmonella Typhi</i> in Pakistan, analyzing 11,916 suspected typhoid fever cases, with 424 confirmed as <i>Salmonella Typhi</i> and Paratyphi A. Through antimicrobial susceptibility tests and PCR-based Sanger sequencing, an R717L mutation in the <i>AcrB</i> gene was identified, signalling the emergence of azithromycin resistance. This mutation was notably prevalent among XDR <i>Salmonella Typhi</i> isolates, with a high detection of <i>blaCTX-M</i> gp 1 (93%), followed by <i>blaCTX-M</i> 2 (87%) and <i>blaTEM</i> (81%). Detailed analysis revealed that the R717L mutation significantly alters the <i>AcrB</i> protein's interaction with azithromycin, evidenced by lower docking scores and reduced critical interactions, thus diminishing the antibiotic's affinity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated that this mutation induces considerable structural changes in <i>AcrB</i>, impacting its stability and conformation. Additionally, binding free energy calculations showed decreased binding affinity of azithromycin to the mutated <i>AcrB</i> protein. These findings underscore the critical role of the R717L mutation in conferring drug resistance and highlight the urgent need for developing new antibiotic strategies to combat this growing threat. The evolution of azithromycin resistance in XDR <i>Salmonella Typhi</i> underscores the importance of cautious antibiotic use and the necessity for ongoing surveillance and research to inform effective typhoid fever treatment protocols.",

        "abstract": "<i>Salmonella</i> is a major foodborne pathogen that can effectively replicate inside host macrophages to establish life-threatening systemic infections. <i>Salmonella</i> must utilize diverse nutrients for growth in nutrient-poor macrophages, but which nutrients are required for intracellular <i>Salmonella</i> growth is largely unknown. Here, we found that either acquisition from the host or de novo synthesis of a nonprotein amino acid, β-alanine, is critical for <i>Salmonella</i> replication inside macrophages. The concentration of β-alanine is decreased in <i>Salmonella</i>-infected macrophages, while the addition of exogenous β-alanine enhances <i>Salmonella</i> replication in macrophages, suggesting that <i>Salmonella</i> can uptake host-derived β-alanine for intracellular growth. Moreover, the expression of <i>panD,</i> the rate-limiting gene required for β-alanine synthesis in <i>Salmonella,</i> is upregulated when <i>Salmonella</i> enters macrophages. Mutation of <i>panD</i> impaired <i>Salmonella</i> replication in macrophages and colonization in the mouse liver and spleen, indicating that de novo synthesis of β-alanine is essential for intracellular <i>Salmonella</i> growth and systemic infection. Additionally, we revealed that β-alanine influences <i>Salmonella</i> intracellular replication and in vivo virulence partially by increasing expression of the zinc transporter genes <i>znuABC</i>, which in turn facilitates the uptake of the essential micronutrient zinc by <i>Salmonella</i>. Taken together, these findings highlight the important role of β-alanine in the intracellular replication and virulence of <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>panD</i> is a promising target for controlling systemic <i>Salmonella</i> infection.",

        "abstract": "Early differentiation between severe multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and severe presentations of dengue, scrub typhus, and other endemic tropical infections could help clinicians devise appropriate treatment strategies. This study aims to identify the diagnostic markers that may be used to discriminate between MIS-C versus endemic tropical infections, namely dengue and scrub typhus, which frequently occur in endemic areas. A retrospective study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India between 2020 and 2023. Comparative analysis of 33 children diagnosed with MIS-C was done versus 77 children with five endemic tropical infections-dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever, malaria, and leptospirosis. Rash [63.63% vs. 31.64% (P = 0.005)], conjunctival redness [63.63% vs. 8.86% (P < 0.001)], and altered sensorium [45.45% vs. 22.78% (P = 0.031)] were seen in a greater proportion of MIS-C cases than those with tropical infections. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dl) was significantly higher in children with MIS-C versus those with tropical infections [176.1 (112.61, 198.32) vs. 9.25 (24.05, 69.38), P ≤ 0.001]. Ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were observed to be significantly higher in children with tropical infections compared to those with MIS-C. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds of having a rash were higher among children with MIS-C than those with dengue [OR = 8.07 (95% CI: 1.22-53.48, P = 0.03)]; followed by altered sensorium [OR = 16.04 (95% CI: 2.06-124.62, P = 0.008)]; myocardial involvement [OR = 7.18 (95% CI: 1.12-45.93, P = 0.037)]; and CRP (>50 mg/dl) [OR = 17.59 (95% CI: 2.69-114.92, P = 0.003)]. The findings of our study suggest that several clinical and laboratory measures could potentially distinguish between patients with severe MIS-C and endemic tropical infections. Clinical markers such as rash, altered sensorium, myocardial involvement, and shock were seen in a greater proportion of cases with MIS-C. Inflammatory markers such as CRP were higher in children with MIS-C, whereas ferritin and LDH were higher in dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever, malaria, and leptospirosis.",

        "abstract": "Currently, the prevalence of dysbiosis is increasing, but its treatment options are limited. Dahuang Huanglian Xiexin Decoction (XXD) is a traditional herbal prescription recorded in the Treatise on Typhoid Fever, with a longstanding application in the treatment of digestive system diseases. It consists mainly of three classical chinese medicinal herbs: Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi), and Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.). Previous studies demonstrated the efficacy of XXD in treating dysbiosis. However, the exact underlying mechanism requires further investigation. The effects of XXD were evaluated in this study to determine its impact on dysbiosis and to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying its alleviation using proteomics and transcriptomics. The components of XXD were identified through UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Dysbiosis mice were established by mixing antibiotic solutions, and XXD was employed as the therapeutic agent in the intervention. Body weight changes, diarrhea rates, and histopathology were evaluated to determine the therapeutic effects of XXD. Proteomics and transcriptomics were subsequently employed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of XXD on dysbiosis. Meanwhile, TEM was used to observe tight junctions and pyroptosis in the mouse colon. Furthermore, IF, western blotting, RT-qPCR, and ELISA were employed to investigate the mechanism of XXD. This study indicates that XXD promoted the recovery from dysbiosis and repair of the intestinal barrier. Integrative proteomic and transcriptomic analyses identified the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway as a potential key mechanism, with GBP5 as a possible key protein or gene. In the verification of the prediction results, XXD could significantly inhibit the protein expression of GBP5, NLRP3, ASC, Pro-Caspase1/Cleaved-Caspase1, and N-GSDMD/GSDMD; upregulate the protein levels of ZO-1 and occludin; and reduce the mRNA levels of GBP5 and NLRP3. In addition, it reduced the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. IF confirmed the co-localization of EpCAM-GSDMD, GBP5-NLRP3, and NLRP3-ASC in colon tissues, whereas TEM suggested that XXD alleviated the ultrastructural damage caused by pyroptosis. This study demonstrated that XXD can repair the intestinal mucosal barrier and regulate dysbiosis and its associated symptoms. Multiomics approaches have been used to predict the potential mechanisms of XXD. Evidence from experiments indicates that the regulation of dysbiosis by XXD may involve alleviating pyroptosis via inhibition of the GBP5/NLRP3 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Objective Blood culture is the gold standard for diagnosing enteric fever (EF), but its unavailability in many health facilities often leads to the overuse of antimicrobials. This study aimed to determine whether EF can be predicted early using clinical features and basic laboratory parameters, thus bypassing the need for blood culture. Methodology This prospective cohort study, conducted from September 2015 to February 2017 in Delhi, included children (6 months to 15 years old) presenting with \"fever without focus\" within the first week of onset. Based on the investigation results, children were categorized into either Group I: blood culture positive for EF - <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi/Paratyphi; Group II: blood culture negative for EF but had another diagnosis; or Group III: cases in which the cause could not be established or were treated with empirical antibiotics, considered as the ambiguous group and excluded from the study. Results Out of the 350 cases, blood cultures confirmed EF in 73 children; 112 children had another diagnosis subsequently, and 165 cases could be placed in Group III. Blood culture is considered the gold standard. Logistic regression was applied to statistically significant clinical and laboratory parameters in children in Group I to identify independent predictors of EF. Duration of fever >4 days, rising trend of fever, coated tongue, splenomegaly, C-reactive protein (CRP) (>25 mg/L), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (>40 IU/L), and absolute eosinopenia were independent predictors of EF in this study. Conclusion In resource-limited settings, and short of blood culture, early prediction of EF is possible with clinical features and simple laboratory investigations.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of global distribution. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated leptospirosis a nationally notifiable disease. There is need to raise awareness of the burden of leptospirosis among health care givers and policy makers in Africa. The aim of this review was to highlight the current situation of leptospirosis in Africa and suggest a One Health approach of addressing its status as a leading zoonosis. In tropical regions, the nonspecific symptoms of fever, myalgia and arthralgia result in misdiagnosis of leptospirosis with malaria, yellow fever, typhoid fever, dengue fever, brucellosis, rickettsiosis, and babesiosis. Urinalysis presents an inexpensive diagnostic aid for leptospirosis. Humans with leptospirosis exhibit proteinuria, glucosuria, pyuria, haematuria and granular casts resulting from acute kidney injury. Therapeutic guidelines for empirical treatment of febrile patients should be considered. Febrile patients who test negative for malaria and yellow fever can benefit from doxycycline, which also treats brucellosis, rickettsiosis and typhoid fever. Control of leptospirosis should also address Leptospira infection in domestic animal reservoirs through vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs in endemic areas. Treatment of sick animals with streptomycin eliminates the carrier status, curbing leptospiruria and spread of infection. Rodents are important in transmission of Leptospira to humans in urban slums and rural settings therefore rodent control strategies help in reducing transmission of leptospirosis. Indirect transmission of Leptospira occurs through contact with water, vegetation, or soil contaminated with infected urine. Drinking water should be drawn from protected sources or chlorinated before household use.",

        "title": "Rifampin mediated decapsulation and enhanced bacterial clearance: a new mechanism of rifamycins.",
        "abstract": "Many clinically relevant bacterial pathogens are encapsulated, as exemplified by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. S. Typhi, the causative agent of the life-threatening systemic disease typhoid fever, expresses Vi as the outermost surface glycan that protects the bacteria from host immune responses. Drug resistant S. Typhi strains and Vi variants are spread globally. Whole genome sequences (WGS) of 24,206 S. Typhi clinical isolates were analysed for genetic traits for antibiotic resistance. Rifampin treated S. Typhi was characterised at the molecular and cellular level. The effects of rifampin mediated decapsulation on bacterial clearance were studied using human primary neutrophils and mouse infection models. Computational and functional studies on other encapsulated bacteria were also carried out. Our WGS analyses indicate that almost all S. Typhi clinical isolates are susceptible to rifamycins and azithromycin. Rifampin at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels, which is naturally established in patients during treatment, eliminates the protective capsule Vi, a process referred to as 'decapsulation', thereby enhancing bacterial clearance. Antibiotic-mediated decapsulation of S. Typhi appears specific to rifamycins, since azithromycin does not decapsulate S. Typhi. Rifampin mediated decapsulation occurs at the transcriptional level, where both high AT content and specific RpoB residues play a crucial role. Rifampin also effectively decapsulates Vi variants, which accounts for 1 in 5 S. Typhi isolates at the global level. A mechanistic explanation for rifampin mediated decapsulation of S. Typhi appears to be applicable to other encapsulated pathogens, including S. Paratyphi C. Nearly all S. Typhi isolates are susceptible to rifampin. This study reveals a new mechanism of rifamycin actions; rifampin enhances bacterial clearance by inhibiting the expression of the protective capsular polysaccharides and other key virulence factors. This study has important implications for treating drug resistant S. Typhi, Vi capsule variants, and other encapsulated bacterial pathogens. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",

The typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) is a promising vaccine platform to avert the disease as they elicit sufficient immune response in both adults and children. However, data on long-lasting immune response among children below 2 years are very limited. In this article we present the data collected from healthy Filipino children who were administered with Vi-DT vaccine. In this long-term follow-up study, we included children who had been vaccinated with Vi-DT vaccine and received a booster dose either in the short-term (24 weeks) or in the long-term (96 or 110 weeks). 285 participants divided into three cohort stratum, age strata 1 (6 months to less than 9 months), age strata 2 (9 months to 12 months), and age strata 3 (13 months to 23 months) from the phase II clinical trial were tracked and enrolled in the observational study. Blood samples were collected at 3rd, 4th and 5th year after the vaccination and compared descriptively against the comparator. We assessed the long-term immunogenicity using anti-Vi IgG and serum bactericidal antibody (SBA). Between 24 August 2021 to 28 July 2023, 268 healthy Filipino children were enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of Vi-DT or comparator vaccine from the Phase II clinical trial. Anti-Vi IgG seroconversion were higher in Vi-DT vaccine compared to the comparator, calculating 92.79 % (95 % CI: 88.44, 95.58), 88.68 % (83.71, 92.27), and 86.38 % (81.13,90.35) in the Vi-DT group, and 26.92 % (16.77, 40.25), 29.09 % (18.77, 42.14), and 25.45 % (15.81,38.30) in comparator group at 3rd, 4th and 5th year respectively. The seroconversion is higher in the Vi-DT long-term booster group than in short-term booster group in all age strata except age strata 3 at 5th year which is 83.78 % (68.86,92.35) and 88.89 % (74.69, 95.59) in Vi-DT long-term booster and short-term booster group, respectively. The SBA GMT response was observed to be higher in the Vi-DT vaccine group in all age strata compared to the comparator vaccine, calculating 932.06 (694.14, 1251.53), 958.61 (721.84, 1273.05) and 724.38 (537.89, 975.55) in the Vi-DT vaccine group and 657.63 (367.43, 1177.03), 796.27 (454.92, 1393.76), and 611.83 (338.10, 1107,18) in comparator group at 3rd year, 4th year and 5th year respectively. When administered as a long-term booster dose 2 years after the primary single-dose, the Vi-DT vaccine is capable of eliciting a sustained immune response for at least 5 years following vaccination. The result in this study will support the inclusion of Vi-DT vaccine in the routine immunization program in the endemic and semi-endemic areas.",

This publication includes the readouts from two different studies in Children and elderly: a Comparator Study and Age Extension Study. In the first study, children are included, whereas the latter study also includes elderly subjects. A total of 340 children were enrolled, and a subset received a booster dose of Typbar TCV®, 180 days later. Results established that Typbar TCV® induced significantly higher antibody titer compared to Typhim Vi on days 28 and 90 (<i>p</i> < .001). No significant differences in adverse events were found between the two vaccine arms. Overall, Typbar TCV® was well tolerated, inducing higher anti-Vi-IgG titers than Typhim Vi®, with sustained response over the study period. The booster dose post-6 months in the Typbar TCV® group was significantly less immunogenic compared to a booster at 2 years (<i>p</i> < .001), suggesting a delayed booster might enhance the anamnestic response, a fact confirmed in our previous clinical studies of Typbar TCV®. In the Age Extension study, 300 healthy volunteers, including younger (18-65) and elderly adults (65 and older), received a single dose of Typbar TCV®. The vaccine is reported to be safe and induced similar anti Vi-Ab geometric mean titers (GMTs) in young and elderly adults. Thus, Typbar TCV® was studied effectively from 6 months to above 85 years, which is the upper age limit. CTRI Registration number: CTRI/2016/01/006476, CTRI/2024/06/069638.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever cases and carriers can transmit Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) through fecal shedding. It remains unclear whether the S. Typhi shedding by carriers exhibits similar phenotypic and genotypic characteristics to those from acute cases. We investigated multidrug resistance in S. Typhi from individuals residing in urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We recruited participants ≤ 65 years from six health facilities and tested for typhoid infection through blood and stool cultures. The S. Typhi culture-positive cases were treated and followed up after treatment, where index cases and their household contacts provided stool samples for culture. The susceptibility of all S. Typhi isolates was tested against 14 antibiotics using Kirby Bauer disc diffusion. Total deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from selected multi-drug resistant (MDR) S. Typhi for whole genome sequencing using Illumina Nextseq2000, and their genomes were analyzed on Pathogen-watch. Of the 115 S. Typhi isolates, 81/115 (70%) were from cases, while 34/115 (30%) were from carriers. S. Typhi resistance against ampicillin was observed in 32/81 (40%) and 11/34 (32%) of isolates from cases and carriers, respectively, while resistance against co-trimoxazole was observed in 34/81 (42%) and 10/34 (29%) of isolates from cases and carriers, respectively. In addition, resistance against chloramphenicol was observed in 30/81(37%) and 10/34 (29%) in isolates from cases and carriers, respectively. Multidrug resistance was observed in 33% (38/115) of the S. Typhi isolates, with majority, 28/38 (74%) recovered from cases. A subset (22/38, 15 from cases and 7 from carriers) of the MDR isolates was randomly selected for sequencing. All the 22 S. Typhi belonged to genotype 4.3.1, with the majority 15/22 (68%) from genotype 4.3.1.2EA3. All these isolates carried the blaTEM-1D, catA1, dfrA7; sul1, and sul2 AMR genes. GyrA point mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to quinolones and fluoroquinolones were detected in 19/22 (86%) isolates, with the majority 15/22 (79%) occurring on codon 83. This study's findings highlight the plausibility of typhoid transmission within communities in disease endemic settings. Consequently, the study demonstrates the need for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial stewardship, deployment of typhoid vaccine and improvement of water, hygiene and sanitation infrastructure in disease endemic settings.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi (<i>S</i>. Typhi) is a serious health issue that can complicate typhoid fever treatment and increase fatality rates. The National Centre for Disease Control, Government of India, established a National Antimicrobial Surveillance Network to detect AMR in high-priority infections, including <i>S</i>. Typhi throughout geographical areas of India, and understand AMR dissemination and possible treatment options. The Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission, Government of Gujarat, India, has funded the \"Network Program on Antimicrobial Resistance, Superbugs, and One Health\" to track antibiotic resistance patterns in the Gujarat region. Given the enormity of the AMR problem in <i>S</i>. Typhi, in Gujarat, this study evaluated the antibiotic resistance patterns of <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates from the Ahmedabad and Vadodara regions of Gujarat, India, were used to determine the mechanism underlying antibiotic resistance and developed combination treatments to combat the extensive drug-resistant isolates. We collected 122 <i>Salmonella</i> isolates periodically (2022-2023) in the Ahmedabad and Vadodara regions of Gujarat, India. The antibiotic susceptibility for 122 <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates was prepared using the disc diffusion method and VITEK II compact system. Whole-genome sequencing and <i>in-silico</i> analysis were performed to identify potential antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs); in addition, combination antibiotic therapies were investigated, and resistance patterns were predicted for key antibiotics used in the treatment of typhoid fever. The study discovered notable levels of antibiotic resistance, specifically to cefuroxime (97.54%), doxycycline (97.54%), ceftriaxone (95.90%), cotrimoxazole (95.90%), ampicillin/sulbactam (95.90%), cefotaxime (94.26%), and ciprofloxacin (94.26%). Genetic analysis revealed the presence of <i>aph(3'')-Ib</i> (40.16%), <i>aph(6)-Id</i> (95.08%), <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub> (89.39%), <i>dfrA14</i> (68.85%), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR), and the <i>qnrS1</i> gene (94.26%). IncFIB(K) and IncFIB(pHCM2) were detected in 96.71% of <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates. Point mutations in the QRDR region of <i>gyrA</i> identified three distinct modifications: Ser83Phen (91.80%), Ser83Leu (1.64%), and Ser83Tyr (0.82%). Three genes exhibited point mutations: <i>gyrB</i> (100%), Ile253Val, and <i>parC</i> (6.56%) multiple mutations, and the efflux gene <i>mdtK</i> (100%) Thr224Lys. By evaluating phenotype and genotype, the tests showed an average concordance of 91.69% and a discordance of 8.31%. The study revealed that 97.54% of isolates belonged to the H58 haplotype lineage II (ST1: 4.3.1.2), which is associated with high resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in Southeast Asia. The combination therapy of <i>β</i>-lactam/<i>β</i>-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI) demonstrated good outcomes, with low MICs (<0.5 µg/mL) of ceftazidime/tazobactam, cefixime/tazobactam, and ceftriaxone/tazobactam effective against highly resistant <i>S</i>. Typhi. The emergence of MDR-XDR <i>S</i>. Typhi, attributed to mutations in <i>gyrA</i>, parC, and the H58 lineage, highlights widespread resistance. According to our research, a potential strategy against XDR <i>S</i>. Typhi is a combination treatment with BL/BLI. One of the first studies to assess the antimicrobial resistance patterns of <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates from the Ahmedabad and Vadodara regions; this particular investigation provides vital information on the occurrence of key resistance genes and mechanisms. This study has significantly contributed by finding the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination therapy as an appropriate treatment choice for XDR, which can potentially use <i>S</i>. Typhi on a larger scale. Additionally, it provides the antibiotic resistance prediction of key antibiotics used for treating typhoidal fever. The outcomes of this investigation highlight the urgent need to address the surge of XDR <i>S</i>. Typhi in high-burden regions of Gujarat. Our study highlights the possibility of rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance due to chromosomal point mutations and plasmid-mediated gene transfer. The effectiveness of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors in handling XDR <i>S</i>. Typhi suggests a plausible strategy for treatment that may be included among clinical guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Malaria and typhoid fever remain major health issues in developing countries like Cameroon, with frequent co-infections. The potential liver damage caused by their respective causative pathogens is overlooked in health management, posing a significant risk of severe liver injury and worsening patient conditions. Accordingly, this study investigated the risk factors associated with liver damage in febrile patients with malaria, typhoid fever, or co-infection at the Obili District Medical Center and Mvog-Betsi Dominican Hospital Center, Yaoundé, Cameroon. Over 8 months, 350 febrile patients were evaluated for their adherence to preventive measures concerning malaria and typhoid fever using a structured questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for Plasmodium species and Salmonella antibodies and liver enzyme levels were measured. Liver damage was assessed using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method. Risk factors for infections and liver damage were identified using Fisher's Exact and Chi-Square tests, with significance set at P < 0.05. Among participants tested, 129 (36.86%) and 106 (30.29%) were positive for malaria and typhoid, respectively, while 56 (16.00%) were co-infected. Men (49.2% and 37.3%) were more affected than women (30.6% and 26.7%) for both malaria and typhoid, respectively. Participants aged between 20 and 40 years were the most affected by malaria (21.4%) and typhoid fever (17.4%). The non-use of mosquito nets, presence of standing water, bushes, and garbage dumps near residences were significant risk factors (Relative risk: RR > 2.1; P < 0.0001) for contracting malaria or typhoid fever. The co-infection status (Chi-2 = 18.30; P < 0.0001), parasite density (Chi-2 = 9.8; P = 0.0074), and delay before consulting (Chi-2 = 13.23; P = 0.0013) were significant risk factors for the occurrence of liver injuries. Our findings demonstrated that the alteration of liver enzyme activity, reflecting liver damage among patients with malaria, typhoid, or malaria-typhoid co-infection, is a reality and should be considered during the patient treatment.",

Yet, studies on spatial and temporal distribution of tyhoid fever are lacking. This study was conducted to analyze retrospective hospital-based data at the village level over the period 2017-2023 to understand the spatial and temporal variation of typhoid fever in Jakarta. Spatial analyses were performed by Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) to examine spatial clustering of typhoid incidence and to identify high-risk villages for typhoid fever, respectively. Seasonal decomposition analysis was performed to investigate the seasonality of this infection. A total of 57,468 typhoid cases, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 533.99 per 100,000 people, were reported during the study period. The incidence was significantly clustered (I=0.548; p=0.001) at the village level across Jakarta. Statistically significant high-risk clusters were detected in the South and East of Jakarta that were heterogeneous over time. We identified seven persistent high-risk clusters in the eastern part of the city and two in the southern part. Moreover, the typhoid incidence showed a strong seasonality trend, significantly associated with monthly total rainfall (p=0.018). The study revealed a significant spatial variation with strong seasonality in typhoid incidence across the city suggesting a variation in transmission intensity and needs for effective public health interventions, especially in the high-risk areas. Improvement in water and sanitation facilities, hygiene awareness and surveillance are essential to help reduce typhoid transmission in Jakarta.",

        "abstract": "<i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (<i>S.</i> Typhi) produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that remain comparatively underexplored as potential biotechnological tools. Here, we investigated how hypervesiculating <i>S.</i> Typhi mutants (Δ<i>tolR</i> and Δ<i>degS</i>) can be engineered to load and deliver the fluorescent reporter protein mCherry, targeting human epithelial cells and the murine immune system. Deletions in <i>tolR</i> and <i>degS</i> led to distinct OMV phenotypes characterized by higher vesicle production and altered cargo composition, underscoring the impact of disrupted membrane integrity and envelope stress on OMV biogenesis. By fusing mCherry with the <i>S.</i> Typhi OmpA signal peptide (SP<i><sub>ompA</sub></i>), we achieved robust and functionally intact intravesicular packaging in all strains. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed that the Δ<i>tolR</i> mutant exhibited particularly high cargo loading in the OMV fraction and pronounced mCherry delivery to epithelial cells, highlighting the potential of hypervesiculation to enhance OMV-based protein transport. However, immunization studies in mice showed that wild-type OMVs, despite carrying less mCherry than their hypervesiculating counterparts, induced the strongest anti-mCherry IgG responses. These findings indicate that, at least under these conditions, antigen loading alone is not sufficient to fully determine immunogenicity. Instead, the intrinsic composition or adjuvant-like properties of OMVs play a pivotal role in driving robust immune activation. Our results establish <i>S.</i> Typhi OMVs, especially when genetically modified with a Sec-dependent targeting signal (SP<i><sub>ompA</sub></i>), as versatile platforms for heterologous protein delivery. Although hypervesiculation facilitates increased protein encapsulation and delivery to epithelial cells, native OMVs appear to better preserve and/or present antigens for effective immunogenic responses in vivo. These insights set the stage for further optimization of <i>S.</i> Typhi OMVs in vaccine development and protein therapeutics, where balancing cargo loading with immunostimulatory features may be key to achieving maximal efficacy.",

Globally, an estimated 11 to 21 million cases of typhoid and paratyphoid fever occur annually, with approximately 130,000-160,000 deaths, most of which are reported in South/Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The antibiotic susceptibility of <i>S.</i> Typhi strains varies between countries within broad limits, from 3% to 97% for ampicillin, 9% to 95% for ciprofloxacin, 4% to 94% for chloramphenicol (India vs. Pakistan), and 0% to 99% for ceftriaxone (India vs. Iraq). With <i>S.</i> Typhi increasingly exhibiting resistance to antibiotics, vaccination becomes an essential preventive measure. Currently, three vaccines are licensed for typhoid fever: the typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV), live-attenuated oral vaccine Ty21a (Ty21a), and Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine (Vi-CPS). While no specific vaccine exists for paratyphoid fever, the genetic and antigenic similarities between <i>S.</i> Paratyphi and <i>S.</i> Typhi offer potential for the development of such a vaccine.

        "abstract": "Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid, caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi, has emerged as a critical global health security threat, with Pakistan, particularly Sindh province, at its epicenter. The misuse of antibiotics, inadequate diagnostic tools, and poor water and sanitation infrastructure have created ideal conditions for the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). XDR typhoid strains resistant to multiple first-line antibiotics have been linked to environmental contamination, with urban areas like Karachi demonstrating high rates of waterborne transmission. International travel has amplified this threat, exporting cases to countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, thus highlighting its global implications. This commentary examines the historical context of typhoid treatment, the drivers of AMR in Pakistan, and the critical role of antimicrobial stewardship in combating XDR typhoid. It advocates for an integrated approach that would encompass improvements in water quality, expanded vaccination coverage with typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs), and stringent audit of antibiotic prescription practices. Immediate local and global action is needed to contain this public health crisis and prevent the resurgence of typhoid as a largely untreatable disease. This situation underscores the urgency of addressing AMR to safeguard global health security.",

We developed TyphiNET ( https://www.typhi.net ), an interactive online dashboard for exploring Typhi genotype and AMR distributions derived from publicly available pathogen genome sequences. TyphiNET allows users to explore country-level summaries such as the frequency of pathogen lineages, temporal trends in resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, and the specific variants and mechanisms underlying emergent AMR trends. User-driven plots and session reports can be downloaded for ease of sharing. Importantly, TyphiNET is populated by high-quality genome data curated by the Global Typhoid Pathogen Genomics Consortium, analysed using the Pathogenwatch platform, and identified as coming from non-targeted sampling frames that are suitable for estimating AMR prevalence amongst Typhi infections (no personal data is included in the platform). As of February 2024, data from a total of n = 11,836 genomes from 101 countries are available in TyphiNET. We outline case studies illustrating how the dashboard can be used to explore these data and gain insights of relevance to both researchers and public health policy-makers. The TyphiNET dashboard provides an interactive platform for accessing genome-derived data on pathogen variant frequencies to inform typhoid control and intervention strategies. The platform is extensible in terms of both data and features, and provides a model for making complex bacterial genome-derived data accessible to a wide audience.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, primarily caused by Salmonella Typhi, can result in severe life-threatening complications such as encephalopathy. Here we elucidate the mechanisms by which typhoid toxin, a unique virulence factor of S. Typhi, mediates the neuropathology associated with typhoid fever. Utilizing mice engineered to have specific tissues protected from toxin action and an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we demonstrate that, rather than direct action on neuronal or glial cells, typhoid toxin causes neuropathology by disrupting the BBB. Intravenous tracer studies confirmed significant BBB permeability changes following toxin exposure, an effect we found to be mediated by typhoid toxin's CdtB catalytic subunit. We demonstrate that corticosteroids are effective at mitigating BBB disruption in vivo, supporting their use for managing typhoid fever neurological complications. Our data reveal mechanistic insight into how typhoid toxin causes encephalopathy and suggest targeted therapeutic interventions to alleviate the severe neurological manifestations of typhoid fever.",

        "abstract": "Despite notable progress in public health throughout the 21st century, infectious diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera remain serious threats to global health, particularly in high-risk regions. Understanding the genetic factors that influence susceptibility and resistance to these diseases is essential for developing more effective strategies for their prevention and treatment. This study investigates the genetic variations associated with these infectious diseases with a focus on regions where these diseases are most prevalent. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants that may influence susceptibility to tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera. A thorough analysis of genetic variants associated with susceptibility and resistance to tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera was conducted. Using publicly available genetic data from various ethnic groups. The allele frequency of the prioritized variants was calculated to assess their distribution within the different populations, including Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jewish, European (Non-Finnish), Latino/Admixed American, South Asian, East Asian, European (Finnish), North Asian, Southeast Asian, African American, and Swedish populations. The variants of the IL1β gene exhibiting the highest allele frequencies in the South Asian population were identified and subsequently examined within the local population. Specifically, the variants rs1143627 and rs1143629, which demonstrate the highest allele frequencies and are associated with typhoid, tuberculosis, and cholera, were subjected to detailed analysis. To determine their distribution and potential impact on disease susceptibility. In the local population, statistical analysis of the available sample revealed allele frequencies of 0.1128 % for IL1β (rs1143627) and 0.18 % for IL1β (rs1143629). Furthermore, these findings revealed that certain genetic profiles may play a role in the population's overall response to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera. This research has the potential to guide future public health strategies for more effective management and prevention of these diseases.",

        "title": "Typhoid conjugate vaccines for preventing typhoid fever (enteric fever).",
        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a major cause of enteric disease-related morbidity and mortality. Vaccination reduces disease burden and prevents outbreaks, but policies and programmes should be informed by the most recent evidence as newer vaccines become available. To assess the benefits and harms of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) compared to no vaccine, placebo, typhoid-inactive agents (vaccines for another disease) or other typhoid vaccines for preventing morbidity and mortality associated with typhoid fever in adults and children. In April 2024, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the World Health Organization vaccine repository for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with no restrictions. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing trials (www. gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), grey literature, bibliographic citations of reviews and key articles for additional studies. We contacted study authors for information about ongoing studies. We included RCTs and cluster-RCTs of children and adults living in typhoid-endemic areas or travelling to typhoid-endemic areas. We included studies comparing TCVs to controls (i.e. no vaccine, placebo or vaccines for another disease), non-conjugated typhoid vaccines or other TCVs. Outcomes included acute typhoid fever, defined by laboratory-confirmed isolation of Salmonella typhi, all-cause mortality, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Review authors independently assessed risk of bias for all outcomes, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tools. We resolved disagreements through discussion or adjudication. We assessed the intention-to-treat effect and used the overall RoB judgement to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for eligible studies, followed by full-text assessment. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or adjudication by a fourth author. Four authors independently extracted characteristics of included studies and outcome data using a piloted, standardised data extraction form. We synthesised results for each outcome where possible, using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method and random-effects analysis model. Where meta-analysis was not possible due to the nature of the data, we planned to synthesise results based on direction of effect. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome, assessing risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and other bias. We included 19 trials (17 RCTs and two cluster-RCTs). The 19 trials enrolled 395,650 participants, with ages ranging from six weeks to 60 years. Vaccines were delivered as a single dose in 14 studies; two doses, ranging from four to 24 weeks apart, in six studies; and three doses, four weeks apart, in one study. Comparators included: no vaccine, placebo and other vaccines. Seven studies compared TCV with non-conjugated typhoid vaccines. Six studies compared one TCV to another TCV. TCV compared to control may result in a large reduction in acute typhoid fever (risk ratio (RR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.32; I<sup>2</sup> = 70%; 6 studies, 101,896 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.85; I<sup>2</sup> = 52%; 4 studies, 100,337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). TCV results in little to no difference in AEs when compared to control (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 3 studies, 29,465 participants; high-certainty evidence) and a slight reduction in SAEs compared to control (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 6 studies, 89,625 participants; high-certainty evidence). TCV compared to non-conjugated typhoid vaccines may result in little to no difference in acute typhoid fever (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.69; 1 study, 78 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no deaths in the included studies. When compared to non-conjugated typhoid vaccines, TCV likely results in little to no difference in AEs (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.31; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 3 studies, 244 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and likely results in a slight reduction in SAEs (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.88; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For TCV compared to another TCV, none of the studies reported on acute typhoid fever. Vi tetanus toxoid vaccine (Vi-TT) may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality compared to a different TCV (RR 5.19, 95% CI 0.54 to 49.80; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, 2422 participants; low-certainty evidence). Vi-TT likely results in little to no difference in AEs compared to another TCV (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.51; I<sup>2</sup> = 39%; 4 studies, 2916 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in SAEs (RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.74 to 8.36; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 3 studies, 2866 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence was consistently reduced due to imprecision, indirectness and bias. This review highlights that TCVs, compared to controls, are effective in preventing typhoid fever, and may confer protection for up to four years. TCVs compared to non-conjugated typhoid vaccines may result in little to no difference in acute typhoid fever and AEs, and likely result in a slight reduction in SAEs. Vi-TT compared to another TCV may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality or SAEs, and likely results in little to no difference in AEs.

Paratyphi B and C, remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in resource-constrained settings. Typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) protect against S. Typhi but no vaccine to date protects against paratyphoid fever. There are several bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A products in development; however, the low incidence of paratyphoid fever in many settings limits the feasibility of phase 3 efficacy studies. Two bivalent vaccines adding the S. Paratyphi A-specific O:2 lipopolysaccharide conjugated to a protein carrier to TCV constructs have successfully completed phase 1 studies and will progress rapidly in their development. The WHO's Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) endorsed a regulatory pathway for a bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A vaccine that contemplates demonstrating protective efficacy against S. Paratyphi A infection in a controlled human infection model (CHIM). Since the use of CHIM data in lieu of phase 3 efficacy studies and to identify markers of immune protection is not yet widely accepted by regulatory bodies, the WHO organized a consultation with vaccine developers, manufacturers, and regulators. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the feasibility and considerations for the licensure of a bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A vaccine. The aim of the consultation was to gain alignment among key stakeholders and facilitate the pathway to licensure in endemic countries.",

        "abstract": "As global travel surges in the post-pandemic era, healthcare systems must prepare for proper management of diseases encountered by returning travelers. A retrospective study of the management of returning travelers from tropical or subtropical regions, with fever at the adult and paediatric emergency departments of Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm Sweden. Demographics, travel history, clinical and microbiology data were extracted from health records. Multivariate regression analyses identified factors affecting investigations and diagnoses. A total of 2441 patients (2197 adults, 244 children) were included. An etiological diagnosis was confirmed in 63.3 % (n = 1546) of patients; with malaria (5.6 %, n = 138), dengue (4.0 %, n = 98) and typhoid fever (0.9 %, n = 22) being the most common tropical infections. Patients with fever >38 °C (aOR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.20-1.84) or hospitalization (aOR 4.68, 95 % CI 3.23-6.80) had higher odds of etiological diagnosis. Children were less likely than adults to have a cause of fever diagnosed (OR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.49-0.84). Malaria testing was lower in children than adults who had visited Sub-Sahara Africa (80.6 % vs 90.4 %). Overall, a lower proportion of children underwent blood cultures, compared to adults (29.5 % vs 68.7 %). VFR travelers and migrants had lower probability of other microbiological investigations when malaria testing was negative (aOR 0.69, 95 % CI 0.54-0.90; aOR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.50-0.90). The management of febrile patients following tropical travel varied significantly across different patient groups. Children, migrants and VFR travelers often receive less thoroughly investigations. This highlights the need for equitable management and investigation, especially for these vulnerable populations.",

Understanding the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns of <i>S.</i> Typhi is crucial to guide the treatment and control of typhoid fever. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of typhoid fever in Ghana and describe the antibiotic susceptibility profiles. <b>Methods</b>: Literature searches were conducted using the PubMed repository and three databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. Observational studies reporting typhoid fever prevalence among Ghanaian participants diagnosed by culture or Widal test and published between 1 January 2004 and 16 August 2024 were eligible. Quality was assessed using standardized JBI critical appraisal checklists. Random-effects meta-analysis with a 95% confidence interval was performed to estimate pooled prevalence and conduct subgroup analyses. <b>Results</b>: A total of 22 studies involving 228,107 participants were included in the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of typhoid fever was 4.14% (95% CI: 2.78-5.75). Blood culture detected more cases (3.68%) than stool culture (1.16%). Multidrug resistance was documented in 20-66% of isolates, and ciprofloxacin had the lowest prevalence of resistance (0-17%). <b>Conclusions</b>: This review highlights the substantial typhoid fever burden and evolving antimicrobial resistance in Ghana. Continuous surveillance of the disease is warranted to optimize empiric treatment and control strategies, given the resistance to first-line drugs.

Paratyphi isolates from blood or bone marrow culture-confirmed enteric fever cases at eight sites in seven cities across India between 2021 and 2024. We tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 1150 S. Typhi isolates and 265 S. Paratyphi isolates via disc diffusion and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone and azithromycin via broth dilution. We identified 18 S. Typhi isolates from Ahmedabad that were resistant to ceftriaxone, indicating a larger emergence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant S. Typhi in Western India with a novel plasmid profile. Furthermore, we observed yearly increases in the mean, median and 90th percentile of azithromycin MICs for S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi isolates throughout India between 2021 and 2023. Finally, we found that only 0.70% of S. Typhi isolates and 1.13% of S. Paratyphi isolates exhibited susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Our results indicate the necessity for a shift from ciprofloxacin in the treatment of enteric fever, and the importance of implementing long-term monitoring of resistance to alternative antibiotics such as azithromycin and ceftriaxone.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a leading public health problem in India and other South East Asian countries. Its diagnosis traditionally relies on culture methods with poor sensitivity, and serological methods with limited role in endemic areas. Incorrect diagnosis results in antibiotic misuse, disease complications, emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains. There is a need to develop quality diagnostic tests for effective and early diagnosis of typhoid fever. This will help in early patient management, disease burden estimation, and assessing the impact of public health interventions including vaccines. This paper describes standard protocols for conducting pre-licensure (analytical) and field (clinical) performance evaluation of in-vitro diagnostic tests that detect S. Typhi antigens or antibodies or gene segments in blood/serum/plasma samples. The analytical performance evaluation protocol describes diagnostic accuracy studies for three different IVD formats using well-characterized clinical samples, and the field validation protocol describes the methodology for conducting a cross-sectional study for assessing IVD performance in acute undifferentiated febrile illness. The latter may also be used to establish a typhoid sample biobank. Both the protocols use statistically significant sample size and describe a detailed sample panel (including cross reactive specimens). These protocols will help in robust evaluation of IVDs for typhoid, especially in endemic areas and in absence of a predicate device. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such comprehensive guidance document of their kind, which may be adapted across similar settings.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever remains a substantial public health challenge in low-income and middle-income countries. By 2023, typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) had been introduced in six countries globally, with more than 50 million doses distributed. Now that TCVs are being deployed, there is a need for observational studies to assess vaccine effectiveness in the field. We aimed to evaluate the validity of different observational study designs in estimating vaccine protection. We compared different observational and experimental study designs for assessing vaccine effectiveness by re-analysing data from the TyVAC Bangladesh trial, a participant-blinded and observer-blinded cluster-randomised controlled trial done in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 150 geographical clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine. Eligible children aged 9 months to 15 years were offered a single dose of the vaccine randomly assigned to their cluster of residence, and baseline vaccination was done between April 15 and May 15, 2018. We compared estimates of vaccine effectiveness from the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis-which assessed the risk of blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever among recipients of TCV versus recipients of Japanese encephalitis vaccine-with estimates from cohort study and test-negative case-control study design (TND) analyses, which compared recipients of TCV with non-vaccinees in the 75 geographical clusters where TCV was administered. We further conducted negative-control exposure (NCE) and negative-control outcome (NCO) analyses as bias indicators. 41 344 (67%) of 62 025 age-eligible children in the study area received the TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine during the baseline vaccination campaign. Among the 62 025 age-eligible children, 5582 blood-culture specimens were collected by passive surveillance, including 2546 (46%) specimens from the 75 TCV clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy was 89% (95% CI 81-93) in the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis, 79% (70-86) by the cohort design, 88% (79-93) by the TND when pan-negatives were used as test-negative controls, and 90% (75-96) by the TND when specimens positive for pathogens other than Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi were used as test-negative controls. Using NCE analysis, Japanese encephalitis vaccination was associated with an increased risk of typhoid fever compared with non-vaccinees in the 75 Japanese encephalitis clusters in the cohort design (incidence rate ratio 1·98 [95% CI 1·56-2·52]), but no significant association between Japanese encephalitis vaccination and typhoid fever was found with the TND. Similarly, an increased risk of non-typhoid infections was observed in the cohort NCO analyses when comparing vaccinees with non-vaccinees in both Japanese encephalitis vaccine clusters and TCV clusters, but not in the TND NCO analyses. Our findings suggests that the TND provides reliable estimates of TCV effectiveness, whereas the cohort design can bias vaccine effectiveness estimates, possibly due to unmeasured confounding effects, such as health-care-seeking behaviours. NCE and NCO approaches are useful tools for identifying such biases. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "title": "Modeling solutions for microbial water contamination in the global south for public health protection.",
        "abstract": "Microbial contamination of water sources is a pressing global challenge, disproportionately affecting developing regions with inadequate infrastructure and limited access to safe drinking water. In the Global South, waterborne pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths contribute to diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, resulting in severe public health burdens. Predictive modeling emerges as a pivotal tool in addressing these challenges, offering data-driven insights to anticipate contamination events and optimize mitigation strategies. This review highlights the application of predictive modeling techniques-including machine learning, hydrological simulations, and quantitative microbial risk assessment -to identify contamination hotspots, forecast pathogen dynamics, and inform water resource allocation in the Global South. Predictive models enable targeted actions to improve water safety and lower the prevalence of waterborne diseases by combining environmental, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. Water resources in the Global South are increasingly vulnerability to microbial contamination, and the challenge is exacerbated by rapid urbanization, climate variability, and insufficient sanitation infrastructure. This review underscores the importance of region-specific modeling approaches. Case studies from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia demonstrated the efficacy of predictive modeling tools in guiding public health actions connected to environmental matrices, from prioritizing water treatment efforts to implementing early-warning systems during extreme weather events. Furthermore, the review explores integrating advanced technologies, such as remote sensing and artificial intelligence, into predictive frameworks, highlighting their potential to improve accuracy and scalability in resource-constrained settings. Increased funding for data collecting, predictive modeling tools, and cross-sectoral cooperation between local communities, non-governmental organizations, and governments are all recommended in the review. Such efforts are critical for developing resilient water systems capable of withstanding environmental stressors and ensuring sustainable access to safe drinking water. By leveraging predictive modeling as a core component of water management strategies, stakeholders can address microbial contamination challenges effectively, safeguard public health, and contribute to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.",

        "abstract": "The emergence and spread of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi (<i>S</i>. Typhi) resistant to third-generation cephalosporins is a serious global health concern. In this study, we genomically characterized 142 cephalosporin-resistant <i>S</i>. Typhi strains isolated from India. Comparative genome analysis revealed the emergence of a new clone of ceftriaxone-resistant <i>S</i>. Typhi harboring three plasmids of the incompatibility groups IncFIB(K), IncX1, and IncFIB(pHCM2). Among these, the IncFIB(K) plasmid confers resistance to third-generation cephalosporins through the <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> gene, along with other resistance determinants such as <i>aph(3\")</i>, <i>aph(6')</i>, <i>sul2</i>, <i>dfrA14</i>, <i>qnrS</i>, and <i>tet(A)</i>. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates from Gujarat (<i>n</i> = 140/142) belong to a distinct subclade (genotype 4.3.1.2.2) within genotype 4.3.1.2 (H58 lineage II). Single nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenetic analysis of the core genes in IncFIB(K) suggested a close relatedness of the plasmid backbone to that of IncFIB(K) from other Enterobacteriales, indicating that H58 lineage II possesses the capability to acquire MDR plasmids from these organisms. This could indicate the potential onset of a new wave of ceftriaxone-resistant <i>S</i>. Typhi in India. The implementation of control measures-such as vaccination and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene systems-is crucial in areas where MDR or extensively drug-resistant <i>S</i>. Typhi strains are prevalent to curb the spread and impact of these resistant strains. Typhoid fever remains a global health concern, especially in areas lacking sanitation and clean water. The rise of drug-resistant strains complicates treatment, increasing illness, death, and healthcare expenses. Travel facilitates the spread of these strains worldwide. Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains, including those resistant to first-line antibiotics and fluoroquinolones, pose significant challenges. Azithromycin and third-generation cephalosporins are now preferred treatments. Recently, XDR typhoid emerged in Pakistan, resistant even to third-generation cephalosporins. India also faces challenges, with sporadic cases initially declining but now re-emerging. New strains in India show resistance to third-generation cephalosporins due to plasmid acquisition from other bacteria, particularly <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M</sub>-carrying IncFIB(K). Due to the ongoing nature of this outbreak, the data from this study deserve further consideration in order to control its spread in India.",

        "abstract": "A novel typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) presentation, the microarray patch (MAP), is in early-stage development and could potentially help to increase coverage in hard-to-reach populations beyond what is being achieved with the current TCV in a vial presentation administered with a needle and syringe (TCV-N&S). However, TCV-MAPs may come at a higher price per dose than TCV-N&S. Our analysis evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of TCV-MAPs alongside TCV-N&S compared to TCV-N&S alone. A global extended cost-effectiveness analysis, taking a health care perspective, was conducted for 133 low- to upper-middle-income countries for a time horizon of 20 years (2033-2052). Health outcomes were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and costs in 2021 US dollars, both discounted at 3 %. We assumed TCV-MAP would cost 1.33 to 3 times the price of the TCV-N&S vaccine. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and evaluated them against various cost-effectiveness thresholds. For five selected countries, we conducted an additional subnational analysis to understand the potential value of a district-specific TCV-MAP implementation instead of a national rollout. Across the 133 low- to upper-middle-income countries, national rollout of TCV-MAPs could avert an additional 5.2 million cases, 47,000 deaths, and 2.4 million DALYs compared to TCV-N&S only, at an additional cost of US$3.5 billion over 20 years. The largest proportion of the averted burden would be in the sub-Saharan African region. TCV-MAPs could be cost-effective in 33 % of the countries but in 78 % of sub-Saharan African countries. A subnational implementation could benefit some countries for which a national implementation may not be cost-effective, averting 2-15 % of cases for less than 1-3 % of the additional cost as compared to a national rollout. MAP price was a key driver of the results. Regional or subnational implementation, coupled with a lower price point, could significantly improve the TCV-MAP value proposition.",

This study aims to investigate the patterns and trends of enteric infections from 1990 to 2021, providing valuable insights for health policy formulation, medical resource allocation, and the optimization of patient management plans. We analyzed the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 for 21 regions and 204 countries to understand better the health burden using prevalence, incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), subtype, risk factors, and etiology. We tested correlations with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), and using decomposition analysis to dissect the reasons behind changes in epidemiological indicators of the disease. In 2021, the age-standardized rates of prevalence, incidence, deaths, and DALYs per 100,000 population for enteric infections were 879.58, 577.21, 17.83, and 1020.15, respectively. Compared to 1990, these rates exhibited -0.18, -0.12, -0.73, and -0.72 changes. Gender and age analyses revealed a higher burden among females, those under 15 years old, and the elderly. Regions with low SDI had higher epidemiological indicators. The burden of Typhoid fever declines in high-development regions. Unsafe water sources were identified as the primary risk factor globally in both 1990 and 2021. Rotavirus was the leading cause of deaths and DALYs. This study highlights the complex epidemiological landscape of enteric infections, revealing variations in burden, risk factors, and etiological characteristics across age, gender, and geographical regions. It underscores the urgent need for healthcare professionals and policymakers to develop innovative prevention and healthcare strategies based on the current and evolving burden of enteric infections, to alleviate the global disease burden.",

        "abstract": "In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), understanding the burden of typhoid disease has been challenging as clinical surveillance based on blood culture data alone often poorly represents the community burden. Underreported cases, unclear case definitions, the presence of a chronic carrier state and emerging antimicrobial resistance necessitate alternative approaches to assess disease prevalence and target public health interventions, such as vaccine introduction. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of wastewater and environmental surveillance (WES) in measuring the prevalence of typhoid infection in Indonesia. Between October 11, 2022, and August 31, 2023, WES was conducted in 18 locations across 3 districts in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Samples were collected fortnightly from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), manholes, a river, and public spaces, using grab and passive sampling methods. Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) detection was conducted using quantitative PCR for S. Typhi genes (ttr, tviB, and staG - all positive). Of the 406 samples collected, 13 % (51/406) tested positive for S. Typhi, with monthly positivity rates ranging from 2 % (1/51) in March 2023 to 47 % (16/34) in October 2022. Mean concentrations (in log10) in ttr, tviB, and staG in grab samples were 0.67 (SD ± 0.99), 0.23 (SD ± 1.14), and -0.11 (SD ± 1.05). The highest detection rates were observed in samples from the river compared to central WWTPs (OR 12.68; 95 % CI 2.03-79.20, P = 0.007). No correlation was observed between rainfall and S. Typhi gene detection (P > 0.05 for all genes). WES is feasible in Indonesia and can be used to monitor typhoid disease burden in an endemic region. High positivity rates from the river and septic tanks in traditional markets support a broad approach to sampling in LMICs where formal wastewater management systems may not accurately represent community disease prevalence due to its low population coverage. WES can be a valuable tool to inform public health responses, including vaccine introduction.",

This study employed UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation to investigate SNS's mechanism in treating UC with comorbid depression. UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, in conjunction with network pharmacology and molecular docking, identified active constituents and potential targets of SNS. A UC model induced by a 3 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution was used for experimental validation. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed through behavioral tests, ELISA, routine blood tests, histopathology, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qRT-PCR. SNS alleviated weight loss and inflammation in DSS-induced colitis in mice while exhibiting antidepressant effects in the open field test, forced swim test, and tail suspension test. Furthermore, SNS improved intestinal mucosal barrier function and restored hippocampal blood-brain barrier integrity. It inhibited microglial proliferation and neuroinflammation in the Hippocampus Cornu Ammonis 1 and dentate gyrus regions. Mechanistic analysis revealed that SNS mediates its effects on UC by modulating targets in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. SNS ameliorates UC with comorbid depression by restoring the integrity of both the intestinal mucosal barrier and the blood-brain barrier, alleviating DSS-induced colitis and neuroinflammation.",

We used samples from a trial of praziquantel treatment-effects on vaccine responses in Schistosoma mansoni (Sm)-endemic Ugandan islands, measuring intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2 (I-FABP2), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, anti-endotoxin core antibodies (EndoCab), soluble CD14 (sCD14) in plasma, and faecal lipocalin-2, occult blood (FOB), and calprotectin (fCAL), and evaluating their associations with baseline helminth infection, praziquantel treatment, and responses to BCG, yellow fever, typhoid, HPV, and tetanus-diphtheria vaccines. Sm associated positively with fCAL and FOB, hookworm with I-FABP2, and any helminth with EndoCab IgM, fCAL and FOB. Sm associated inversely with sCD14. Praziquantel treatment reduced all marker concentrations, significantly fCAL and FOB, implying that Sm-associated gut inflammation and MT is reversible. Associations of assessed markers with vaccine-specific responses were predominantly inverse. Interventions to improve gut barrier function may enhance vaccine responsiveness.",

Despite medical advances, this systemic bacterial infection, caused by <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, continues to affect millions worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications and mortality. Even though antibiotic therapy is effective, the emergence of drug-resistant strains is a growing challenge. We present a series of cases encountered in a tertiary infectious disease hospital in Romania over 15 years. The hospitalised patients were mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent; the median time between the onset of the first symptoms and hospital admission was 15 days. The symptoms encountered along with fever were headache, chills, cough, diarrhoea and tachycardia, an unusual feature in the clinical picture of this disease. Aneosinophilia (the absence of peripheral eosinophilic granulocytes) was the most frequently encountered laboratory finding, followed by increased serum transaminases and inflammatory syndrome. <i>S</i>. Typhi was generally identified from blood culture, demonstrating, except in one case, resistance to ciprofloxacin and, in several cases, multi-drug resistance (MDR). In this series of cases, all strains were sensitive to ceftriaxone.",

        "abstract": "According to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, unimproved drinking water sources include unprotected wells and springs, surface water (e.g., rivers, lakes), vendor-provided water, bottled water (without improved alternatives), and tanker truck-provided water. In East Africa, 68.7% of water at very high risk comes from such sources. Using unimproved drinking water sources can lead to serious health risks, including waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and hepatitis. Therefore, this study aimed to map the spatial distribution of unimproved drinking water sources in the region. We analyzed recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 12 East African countries (Burundi, Comoros, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). A total of 206,748 households were sampled in 12 East African countries. Data management and analysis were carried out in several stages, beginning with data cleaning, followed by statistical weighting and data merging. This was then followed by geospatial analysis and mapping, and finally, spatial cluster detection. Spatial clusters of unimproved drinking water sources were identified within the study area (Global Moran's I: 0.018, z-score: 87.10, p <  0.05). A total of 167 significant spatial windows containing primary and secondary clusters were identified. The first spatial window contained the primary clusters, while the remaining 166 spatial windows contained secondary clusters. Primary clusters were found in Madagascar and coastal Mozambique, with secondary clusters distributed across all 12 countries analyzed. This study identified significant clusters, hotspots, and outliers (high-high clusters) of unimproved drinking water sources across various East African countries. To address these issues effectively, priority should be given to the identified clusters, hotspots, and high-high clusters. Primary recommendations include expanding water treatment facilities, improving water distribution systems, and protecting drinking water sources. Secondary recommendations emphasize strengthening regulations, conducting research, and fostering public-private partnerships to ensure sustainable access to clean water. Finally, we urge collaboration among governments, international organizations, and NGOs to enhance water infrastructure. Their efforts should focus on providing technical assistance, financial support, capacity building, project implementation, advocacy, and financing for drinking water infrastructure in the region. Further research integrating health outcome data with spatial analysis could help identify high-risk regions where the impacts of unimproved water sources are most pronounced.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

        "abstract": "Fever is the second most common symptom after respiratory complaints in pediatric practice, often causing parental anxiety despite usually resulting from self-limiting viral infections. Without localized symptoms, diagnosing hidden bacterial infections is challenging. Tropical regions like India present additional diagnostic challenges due to endemic diseases like malaria, dengue, and typhoid. This review provides an algorithmic approach to evaluate and manage short-duration fever in children, tailored to the Indian epidemiological context. The approach requires careful clinical assessment and consideration of bacterial and tropical etiologies. While most cases are self-limited viral infections, early identification of serious bacterial infections (SBI) is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality. A structured approach is outlined, based on clinical symptoms, signs, age, and vaccination status. Children are divided into three groups: neonates (0-28 d), young infants (29-90 d), and older infants/toddlers (3-36 mo). Neonates and sick/toxic-appearing children with fever warrant immediate hospital admission for empirical antibiotics and diagnostic work-up. Management of young infants is stratified according to risk factors for SBI such as bacteremia, urinary tract infections (UTI), and pneumonia. Well-appearing older infants/toddlers are often managed as outpatients, with investigations tailored to specific clinical and epidemiological contexts.",

We present a case of a 10-year-old boy who developed a prolonged febrile illness after traveling to a typhoid-endemic region. Initial treatment with ceftriaxone proved ineffective due to the presence of ESBL-producing <i>S. Typhi</i>, necessitating a change to meropenem combined with azithromycin. Despite persistent fever, the patient showed clinical improvement by day five and became afebrile by day 11, and there was improvement of inflammatory markers and resolution of bacteremia, as confirmed by sterile blood cultures on day 12. This case underscores the challenges in managing MDR typhoid fever and highlights the critical need to maintain appropriate antibiotic regimens, even in the context of prolonged febrile responses. Furthermore, it draws attention to the global spread of MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <i>S. Typhi</i>, often facilitated by international travel, emphasizing the need for vigilant resistance monitoring and empiric treatment adjustments. Effective antibiotic stewardship, adherence to evidence-based guidelines, and heightened clinical awareness are essential to address the complex public health and clinical challenges posed by MDR and XDR <i>S.

GS is very rare in children with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This case report presents a rare case of GS manifesting as a solitary bone mass. A 15-year-old female presented with left knee pain. Complete blood count and biochemistry were normal. No blasts or early granulocytic elements were observed in the peripheral blood smear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 4x4-cm solid lesion extending to the physis line in the distal metaphyseal section of the left femur. A Tru-cut biopsy of the mass confirmed GS with immature promyelocytic cell infiltration containing Auer rods and immature myeloid cells. The t(15;17) mutation was highly positive in the tissue suspension. Bone marrow aspiration performed afterward showed no abnormalities, and acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia mutation panels were negative.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical model for indirectly transmitted typhoid fever disease that incorporates the use of modern and traditional medicines as modes of treatment. Theoretically, we provide two Lyapunov functions to prove the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and the endemic equilibrium (EE) when the basic reproduction number $ (\\mathcal{R}_0) $ is less than one and greater than one, respectively. The model is calibrated using the number of cumulative cases reported in the Penka-Michel health district in Cameroon. The parameter estimates thus obtained give a value of $ \\mathcal{R}_0 $ = 1.2058 > 1, which indicates that the disease is endemic in the region. The forecast of the outbreak up to November 2026 suggests that the number of cases will be 21,270, which calls for urgent attention on this endemic disease. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the basic reproduction number is conducted, and the main parameters that impact the widespread of the disease are determined. The analysis highlights that the environmental transmission rate $ \\beta $ and the decay rate $ \\mu_b $ of the bacteria in the environment are the most influential parameters for $ \\mathcal{R}_0 $. This underscores the urgent need for potable water and adequate sanitation within this area to reduce the spread of the disease. Numerically, we illustrate the usefulness of recourse to any mode of treatment to lessen the number of infected cases and the necessity of switching from modern treatment to the traditional treatment, a useful adjuvant therapy. Conversely, we show that the relapse phenomenon increases the burden of the disease. Hence adopting a synergistic therapy approach will significantly mitigate typhoid disease cases and overcome the cycle of poverty within the afflicted communities.",

A prospective, observational study of antibiotic prescriptions in paediatric departments of two private-sector hospitals in central India. Inpatients were grouped into clinically confirmed infections, suspected infections and no infections. Patients in the NTH and TH and duration of antibiotic prescription, the ratio of prescribed daily dose and defined daily dose i.e. PDD* per 100 bed days, diagnosis-specific patterns and trends, adherence to the Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) classification and prescribing guidelines with significant p value<0.05. Of 19 027, 17 458 inpatients aged less than 18 years stayed at least one night (NTH: 11 415 and TH: 6043). More patients were prescribed antibiotics in the NTH than in the TH (NTH: 80%, TH: 23%, p<0.001) and had shorter antibiotic treatment (NTH: 3 days, TH: 5 days, p<0.001). In the NTH, 43% of prescribed antibiotics were 'Not recommended'; in the TH, 56% were from the 'Watch' group (AWaRe). Ceftriaxone with a beta-lactamase inhibitor ('Not recommended', 39%) was most prescribed in the NTH, and ceftriaxone ('Watch', 31%) in the TH.The reduction in the prescription rates of the most prescribed antibiotic classes for PDD*/100 bed days was observed over 10 years, for infectious acute gastroenteritis, typhoid fever and lung infections, especially in the NTH. For hernia patients, the antibiotic prescribing trend of third-generation cephalosporins increased significantly (β=0.13, p=0.02) while decreased for second-generation cephalosporins (β=0.002, p=0.01). The trends decreased in both hospitals for the most common confirmed infections over 10 years. This decadal study observes the practices of overuse of antibiotics in both hospitals yet more in the NTH. High prescribing rates of the 'Not recommended' and 'Watch' warrant understanding the underlying reasons for targeted interventions. Nonetheless, a significant overtime decrease in prescribing antibiotics for infectious diagnosis indicates the potential for the success of antibiotic stewardship in the future.",

Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease containment. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This study aims to develop a lightweight machine learning-based diagnostic tool for the early and efficient detection of typhoid fever using clinical data. <b>Methods:</b> A custom dataset comprising 14 clinical and demographic parameters-including age, gender, headache, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, cough, fever range (°F), hemoglobin (g/dL), platelet count, urine culture bacteria, calcium (mg/dL), and potassium (mg/dL)-was analyzed. A machine learning metamodel, integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Decision Tree classifiers with a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), was trained and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). <b>Results:</b> The proposed metamodel demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, achieving a precision of 99%, recall of 100%, and an AUC of 1.00. It outperformed traditional diagnostic methods and other standalone machine learning algorithms, offering high accuracy and generalizability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The lightweight machine learning metamodel provides a cost-effective, non-invasive, and rapid diagnostic alternative for typhoid fever, particularly suited for resource-limited settings. Its reliance on accessible clinical parameters ensures practical applicability and scalability, potentially improving patient outcomes and aiding in disease control.

Analyses of S. Typhi isolates in Shenzhen revealed high genetic diversity, with genotypes 3.2.1 (37.8%) and 2.1.7 (20%) being most prevalent. Genotype 3.2.1 formed an independent lineage due to mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR). The multidrug-resistant haplotype 58 (genotype 4.3.1) has been present since 2006. S. Paratyphi A isolates were predominantly genotype 2.3.3 (98.5%). Pathogen exchange occurred with at least four other provinces. A cutoff of ≤3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was effective for outbreak investigation, and 22 genomic clusters were found, suggesting undetected outbreaks or transmission events. While 80% of isolates were susceptible to first-line antibiotics, 16.9% of S. Paratyphi A isolates were multidrug-resistant.

        "title": "Development of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella conjugate vaccines and their evaluation in a trivalent formulation with typhoid conjugate vaccine.",
        "abstract": "Invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections, primarily caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), represent a significant public health concern, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains are increasingly prevalent. Despite the substantial disease burden, no vaccines are currently licensed for iNTS. This study aimed to develop an iNTS conjugate vaccine by conjugating O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) antigens to carrier proteins using chemical conjugation, a proven method known for its efficiency and scalability in licensed glycoconjugate vaccines. Various carrier proteins and chemical conjugation processes were evaluated to optimize the iNTS OSP conjugate vaccine candidates. Through this optimization, diphtheria toxoid (DT) was identified as the carrier protein that significantly enhances the anti-OSP immunogenicity of the iNTS conjugates. Key properties, such as the molecular weight and OSP:DT ratio in the iNTS OSP conjugate were found to be controllable by adjusting the ratios of CDAP conjugate reagent and DT to iNTS OSP. Optimal conjugation process parameters were identified by evaluating the relationship between these property and immunogenicity through tests in mice. The optimized iNTS conjugates for S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis were further developed into a bivalent formulation. This formulation was selected based on a dose-dependent immunogenicity study and included alum as an adjuvant to enhance immune response. Ultimately, a trivalent drug product formulation was developed by combining the bivalent iNTS conjugate vaccine with a typhoid conjugate vaccine. Our findings demonstrated that the iNTS OSP-DT conjugates, at the optimal conjugation ratios, induced robust immune responses with high anti-OSP IgG titers for both iNTS serovars, comparable to or exceeding those of other formulations. The inclusion of alum further enhanced immunogenicity across all formulations. Notably, the trivalent vaccine formulation showed promising results, maintaining robust immunogenic responses against all iNTS OSP antigens and the Vi polysaccharide antigen of Salmonella Typhi, without compromising the immunogenicity of any individual antigens. This study suggests that a bivalent iNTS vaccine combined with a typhoid conjugate vaccine could provide broad protection against both iNTS infections and typhoid fever, addressing a critical unmet need in regions with limited resources.",

        "abstract": "India has a high typhoid fever burden. In 2022, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended introducing typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) into the Universal Immunisation Programme. Our study aims to identify research priorities to support ongoing TCV decision-making in India. We identified 45 evidence factors for TCV decision-making in India by adapting WHO's Evidence-to-Recommendation framework. We assigned an evidence gap score for each evidence factor from 0 (low) to 4 (high) based on the availability and sufficiency, quality, breadth and applicability of evidence identified in a literature review (end date 30 November 2023). We assigned each evidence factor an importance score based on the results of an online survey conducted among national immunisation stakeholders (n=22, 1 July 2023-31 October 2023), where they ranked the importance of seven WHO's Evidence-to-Recommendation criteria and several evidence factors within them. We rescaled mean stakeholder rankings into importance scores from 0 (low) to 4 (high). Finally, we added the evidence gap score to the importance score and used the overall scores to identify research priorities to support ongoing TCV decision-making in India. We estimated the highest evidence priority scores for public perception of typhoid fever, vaccination budget impact, vaccine availability, socioeconomic impact, fiscal space, antimicrobial resistance tracking, typhoid fever mortality, public perception of TCV, immunisation managers' acceptance and vaccine schedule preferences among caregivers. By adapting WHO's Evidence-to-Recommendation framework to the Indian context, we systematically identified several research priorities to support ongoing decision-making on TCV in India. These priorities will evolve as new research studies and questions emerge about the optimal scheduling, roll-out and implementation of TCV in India.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever causes substantial mortality and morbidity in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) as a result of inadequate water, hygiene, and sanitation facilities. The gold standard for typhoid diagnosis is blood culture, however this method is expensive and mostly unavailable in LMICs. Environmental surveillance (ES) could offer a low cost alternative to identify circulation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S.Typhi) and help inform public health interventions including vaccination. We implemented standardized protocols for ES at 40 validated sites in peri-urban communities in Ghana from July 2022 to August 2023. Grab samples (GS) and Moore swabs (MS) were collected monthly for the initial 6 months and subsequently monthly MS were maintained for the rest of the study period. Wastewater samples were tested for S. Typhi target genes (ttr, staG, tviB) and a biomarker of human faecal contamination (Bacteroides HF183) using multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR). Clinical surveillance for typhoid fever was performed by blood culture of febrile cases presenting to the local hospital who lived in the study area. For the first 6 months of wastewater ES, we observed a higher prevalence of S. Typhi in MS compared to GS [100/240 (42%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 34-50% vs. 24/240 (10%; 95% CI: 6-16%)]; p-value < 0.001]. Overall, the detection of S. Typhi throughout the study period based on MS was 42.1% (202/480; 95% CI: 35-50%). The prevalence of S. Typhi in blood culture surveillance was 0.21% [12/5,576; 95% CI: 0.12-0.38%]. Precipitation (1.1 (95% CI: 1.02-1.10) and number of wet days (2.0 (95%CI: 1.40-2.88) were positively associated with an increased odds of S. Typhi detection in MS and GS. Generally the proportion of S.Typhi detections in wastewater samples was less than blood culture-based detections. Limited detection of confirmed typhoid fever cases at the local hospital may reflect healthcare seeking behaviours, access as well as early treatment with over-the-counter antibiotics. Further work is required to confirm these qPCR detections with amplicon sequencing methods. Strategies also needs to be developed for integration of ES into public health decision making for the prevention of typhoid fever.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, caused by <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi, remains a significant public health issue, particularly in low-income countries with inadequate sanitation. The rise of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi has led to a growing reliance on carbapenems as the final line of defense. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of carbapenems in treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) and XDR typhoid at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar. This study aims to assess the efficacy of carbapenems in treating MDR and XDR typhoid fever and identify alternative therapeutic strategies. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex from January to June 2024. A total of 501 patients with confirmed typhoid fever were included. Data on demographics, drug sensitivity, and resistance patterns were extracted from the hospital's Health Management Information System (HMIS) and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Among 501 patients, 299 (59.7%) were male, with a mean age of 23.84 ± 0.24 years. MDR was observed in 106 (36%) patients, while XDR and carbapenem resistance were present in only three (0.6%) cases. Imipenem demonstrated a high sensitivity of 466 (93%), while meropenem had 380 (75.8%) sensitivity with no resistance. Non-carbapenem antibiotics, such as polymyxin 468 (93.4%) sensitivity and colistin 446 (89%) sensitivity, exhibited higher efficacy than carbapenems. Alarmingly, cephalosporins such as cefepime exhibited 454 (91%) resistance. Resistance to carbapenems was rare, affecting only three (0.6%) patients. Carbapenems remain highly effective against MDR and XDR typhoid, but non-carbapenem options such as polymyxin and colistin offer viable alternatives in reducing carbapenem dependence. Enhanced antimicrobial stewardship is critical to preserving these last-resort treatments.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterium <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, which poses major health problems in developing countries, including Ethiopia. However, there is limited information regarding typhoid fever, contributing factors with it, and its drug susceptibility pattern in the research area. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of typhoid fever and its associated risk factors among clinically diagnosed febrile patients at Debark Hospital and evaluate the drug susceptibility patterns of the isolates. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 158 febrile patients from December 2022 to April 2023. Blood and stool samples were collected from each febrile patient. The Widal test was used to test <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi O and H antigens sera from blood, and bacteria were cultured from the stool. Gram staining and biochemical analyses were carried out for each isolate. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for the isolates using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion techniques. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for analysis. In this study, the seroprevalence of typhoid fever among febrile patients at Debark Hospital was 22.8%. Gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02, 0.31, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001), marital status (AOR: 95% CI: 2.63, 4.66, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001), family size (AOR: 95% CI: 0.01, 0.31, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001), residence (AOR: 95% CI: 0.09, 0.83, <i>p</i> = 0.021), practice of using toilet (AOR: 95% CI: 0.08, 0.086, <i>p</i> = 0.027), washing fruits and vegetables before eating (AOR: 95% CI: 0.12, 0.87, <i>p</i> = 0.025), and awareness of typhoid fever transmission and prevention (AOR: 95% CI: 0.12, 0.91, <i>p</i> = 0.032) are the associated risk factors for typhoid fever.

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a significant public health problem endemic in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Antimicrobial treatment of typhoid is however threatened by the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) <i>S.</i> Typhi, especially in the globally successful lineage (4.3.1) which has rapidly spread in East and Southern Africa. AMR elements can be found either on plasmids or in one of the three chromosomal integration sites, and there is variability of this across the lineage. Several previous studies with Malawian isolates indicated a clonal, locally spreading lineage with chromosomally integrated resistance genes. In a recent study however we noted three isolates with predicted resistance genes unusual for the region, and we here present the resolved genomes of these isolates using long- and short-read sequencing. Our work shows that these isolates are potentially imported cases, most closely related to the recently described sub-lineage 4.3.1.EA1, although they encode IncHI1 plasmids with reduced resistance gene repertoire compared to the main IncHI1 plasmids spreading in East Africa. Similar reduced plasmids were reported in a recent large-scale study in five isolates from Tanzania, highlighting the urgency for better coverage of the African continent in genome studies to better understand the dynamics of these potentially co-circulating plasmids.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella infections are widely known to cause gastroenteritis, especially in areas of poor hygiene and sanitation. Common symptoms include sustained fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), various neurological manifestations, and multiorgan failure are other uncommon presentations. Raising appropriate awareness about its clinical spectrum is therefore crucial, even in the absence of typical symptoms. The following case of a 34-year-old Indian female who developed <i>Salmonella Typhi</i>-induced sepsis addresses various challenges involved in diagnosing and treating the condition. The case was successfully managed with rapid diagnostics, targeted antibiotic therapy, and supportive care. Recognizing the condition early and providing necessary treatment is therefore vital to preventing substantial morbidity and mortality. To improve outcomes for critically ill patients, it is important that the causative organism be identified quickly and appropriate treatment be commenced. Here, we present a case of Salmonella sepsis complicated by DIC, its clinical course, and the diagnostic and treatment modalities we have followed.",

        "abstract": "There is a shortage of rapid, accurate, and low-cost assays for diagnosing enteric fever. The dual-path platform for typhoid (DPPT) assay had high accuracy in retrospective studies with banked plasma samples. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DPPT assay in a prospective study using fingerstick capillary blood. For this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled children younger than 18 years, who presented at the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with at least 3 days of fever. We collected blood and nasal swabs, and did the following assays to assess the accuracy of DPPT: blood culture, serological assays for typhoid fever (DPPT assay, Widal, and Test-it), and molecular assays to identify alternative aetiologies (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza, dengue virus, and Rickettsia spp). The primary outcomes of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay for diagnosis of enteric fever. We evaluated the accuracy of combined anti-haemolysin E and anti-lipopolysaccharide IgA readings using the DPPT assay in distinguishing culture-confirmed enteric fever from alternative aetiologies using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). Given the imperfect reference standard diagnostics for enteric fever, we used Bayesian latent class models, incorporating results from the typhoid and alternative aetiology diagnostics, to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay. We also did subgroup analyses for the assay across multiple biological variables. Between Aug 17, 2021, and July 16, 2022, we enrolled 501 participants who presented with at least 3 days of fever. 223 (45%) of 501 participants were female and 278 (55%) were male. 77 participants had culture-confirmed enteric fever (62 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A) and 70 were culture-negative with PCR-confirmed alternative aetiology (34 influenza A or B, 22 dengue virus, seven Rickettsia spp, six RSV, and one participant co-infected with RSV and dengue virus). The AUC for DPPT on fingerstick capillary blood in distinguishing typhoid from alternative aetiologies was 0·969 (95% CI 0·943-0·994). In latent class analysis, the sensitivity of DPPT was 93% (95% credible interval [CrI] 87-97) and specificity was 89% (85-93). The balanced accuracy was higher for DPPT (91%, 95% CrI 87-94) than blood culture (81%, 78-85), Test-it (77%, 74-79), or Widal (70%, 67-73). Assay performance did not vary by sex, age, duration of fever at presentation, antibiotic use before presentation, Salmonella serotype, or sample type. The point-of-care DPPT assay achieved high diagnostic accuracy for enteric fever in a highly endemic community. This assay has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for enteric fever, allowing rapid diagnosis and treatment, and could facilitate more appropriate antimicrobial use.

        "abstract": "This case report describes the unusual presentation of a 32-year-old male from Guayaquil, Ecuador, who was diagnosed with a rare triple infection caused by <i>Salmonella typhi</i>, <i>Leptospira</i>, and <i>Campylobacter coli</i>. The patient presented with persistent high fever, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, and jaundice, following the consumption of street food in a resource-limited area. Important clinical findings included hepatosplenomegaly and elevated liver enzymes, which initially complicated the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of all three pathogens, presenting significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to overlapping symptoms and potential antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The main diagnoses included typhoid fever, leptospirosis, and campylobacteriosis, each requiring distinct yet coordinated treatment approaches. The patient was managed with a combination of antibiotics targeting each pathogen and supportive care to address dehydration and liver dysfunction. After a prolonged hospital stay, the patient recovered with no residual symptoms, underscoring the success of a tailored, multidisciplinary approach in the context of limited healthcare resources. This case underscores the importance of clinical awareness regarding co-infections, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation, where infectious diseases are endemic. The successful management of this complex case highlights the necessity of rapid, accurate diagnostics and coordinated therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes in patients with multi-pathogen infections. This report also emphasizes the critical need for surveillance and tailored interventions in regions facing rising AMR, enhancing our understanding of how to approach emerging infectious diseases in underserved populations.",

However, concerns arise regarding potential pathogen reversion to virulence, which is particularly risky for immunocompromised individuals, contraindicating their administration in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients under modified disease treatments due to the possibility of triggering infections, or stimulating the immune system, precipitating new exacerbations. On the contrary, these vaccines offer enduring immunity that is crucial for protecting MS patients from endemic infectious diseases, leading to severe complications if contracted. These concerns underscore the complex balance between vaccination benefits and the risks of exacerbating MS in patients residing in regions with endemic diseases. This review explores the challenges and considerations associated with their use in MS patients, aiming to maximize benefits while minimizing risks.",

        "title": "Adult vaccination in India: A rapid review of current status & implementation challenges.",
        "abstract": "Background & objectives The expanded programme on immunization launched in India in 1978, with its focus on preventing six diseases in children (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, poliomyelitis, typhoid, and childhood tuberculosis), was widened in its scope in 1985-86. This new avtaar, the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), incorporated measles vaccine for children and rubella and adult diphtheria vaccines for pregnant women. We conducted this rapid review on adult immunization relevant for India, as recent COVID-19 experience revealed how newly emergent or re-emergent pathogens could have their onslaughts on the elderly and adults with comorbidities. Methods Three different bibliographic databases, namely PubMed, Scopus and Ovid were searched electronically to access the articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Relevant consensus guidelines by in-country professional groups were also collated. We conducted deduplication and screening of the outputs of these searches (1242 bibliographical records). Finally, 250 articles were found eligible for inclusion. As trials on the reduction of morbidities, mortalities and hospitalizations in adults due to proposed vaccines under Indian consensus guidelines were not available, no meta-analysis was conducted. Results Evidence from articles finally included in this synthesis were grouped under (i) preventing viral and bacterial infections in adults; (ii) adult vaccination and awareness tools; (iii) vaccine hesitancy/acceptance; and (iv) adult vaccination guidelines. In-country research revealed the need for introducing the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in adolescence or early-adulthood to prevent ano-genital cancers in elderly and later life. Importantly HPV prevalence among cervical cancer patients varied between 88 to 98 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Delhi. The importance of conducting regular surveillance of pneumococcal diseases and influenza, as well as tweaking the vaccines accordingly, was revealed in other articles. A poor uptake of influenza vaccine (≤2%) in adults (≥45 yr) was documented. The uptake of hepatitis B vaccine in Health Care Workers (HCWs) in Delhi and Mumbai was of concern and ranged from 55 to 64 per cent. The vulnerability of HCWs to rubella was investigated in a paediatric ophthalmic hospital in Madurai: a tenth of the selected HCWs were rubella seronegative and mounted good protective immunity following RA 27/3 vaccine administration. An outbreak of measles in college students in Pune emphasized the phenomenon of waning immunity. Similarly, a study in the infectious disease hospital in Kolkata and in-patients in Delhi revealed a lack of protective immunity against diphtheria and tetanus in adults. The researchers estimated the economic benefits of providing a typhoid vaccine to a household to be US$ 23 in a middle-income neighbourhood and US$ 14 in slum settings. The authors highlighted the importance of preventive strategies, finding that the cost of severe typhoid fever was US$ 119.1 in 18 centres across India. Both qualitative and quantitative investigations explored vaccine hesitancy, which was studied more during the COVID-19 pandemic than earlier. Interpretation & conclusions Vaccination programmes in India would require (i) increasing awareness around vaccine-preventable diseases among adults and HCWs; (ii) actively engaging health care systems and community-based organizations; and (iii) developing and producing affordable, safe, and country-appropriate vaccines. Effective communication strategies and tools will be the key to the success of such interventions.",

        "abstract": "Enteric fever is caused by the infection of Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) A, B and C, through contaminated food and water. The disease almost exclusively affects the populations living in low- and middle-income countries, with the World Health Organization Southeast Asian Region (WHO SEAR) having the highest endemicity. Despite humans being the sole reservoir of infection and antibiotics and vaccines are made available, the disease was not taken up for elimination until recently due to several biological and technical reasons, including the lack of accurate and region-specific disease surveillance data in the real-time diagnostic inaccuracy of acute infections, difficulty in identifying the chronic asymptomatic carriers who are the major reservoirs of infection and the absence of a political will. However, there is now a renewed interest and effort to control the disease in the endemic areas with the help of better surveillance tools to monitor disease burden, wider availability of more accurate blood culture methods for diagnosis, and above all, cost-effective typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) that can provide a high level of durable protection, particularly against the multidrug-resistant strains and to the age group most commonly affected by the disease. However, despite the commercial availability of a few TCVs, they are still in the development stage. Several questions need to be answered before they are taken up for routine immunization in countries like India. Furthermore, typhoid vaccines with a wider coverage, including additional efficacy against Salmonella Paratyphi A and B and preferably the non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars, for which no vaccines are currently available would be more desirable. We have developed several subunit vaccine candidates containing the glycoconjugates of the surface polysaccharides of typhoidal and non-typhoidal Salmonellae and an intrinsic Salmonella protein that functions as both antigen and adjuvant. We also developed a novel mouse model of oral Salmonella Typhi infection to test the candidate vaccines, which demonstrated broad protective efficacy against Salmonella spp. through the induction of humoral and cell-mediated immunity as well as memory response.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid is a major health concern. Drug-resistant cases of typhoid have given rise to new debates. Azithromycin has shown adequate results. The study is designed to determine the clinical efficacy of oral azithromycin versus other antimicrobial drugs in typhoid patients. The studies included in the systematic review are randomized controlled trials, comparing the clinical efficacy of azithromycin to other antimicrobial drugs on typhoid patients. We searched 1180 articles from Google Scholar, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, PLOS ONE, and JSTOR on 16th October, 2023. The risk of bias was analyzed by visualizing the funnel plot, Begg's and Egger's test, and plotting risk of bias graphs. Forest plots are created to display the findings. We identified 14 research articles (1556 participants). Odds ratios of the treatment outcomes were extracted. In a forest plot, the overall effect of the treatment outcome (CI=95%) of azithromycin, in comparison to fluoroquinolones appeared to be favourable (Random Effect Model (REM)=2.15, heterogeneity: I2=37%, τ2= 0.1729, p=0.15, the overall pooled effect was towards right side). Compared to chloramphenicol, azithromycin showed a high odds ratio (1.23). However, there was no difference in outcome among ceftriaxone and azithromycin groups (REM=0.67, heterogeneity: I2=0%, τ2=0%, p=0.78, the overall pooled effect touched the no-effect line). Azithromycin is more clinically efficacious than fluoroquinolones and chloramphenicol. The drug has fewer documented relapses in comparison with other antimicrobial drugs. Fever clearance time of azithromycin is greater than ceftriaxone and chloramphenicol.",

        "abstract": "Although typhoid fever has largely been eliminated in high-income countries, it remains a major global public health concern especially among low- and middle-income countries. The causative agent, <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (<i>S.</i> Typhi), is a human restricted pathogen with a limited capacity to replicate outside the human host. Human carriers, 90% of whom have gallstones in their gallbladder, continue to shed the pathogen for an ill-defined period of time after treatment. The genetic mechanisms involved in establishing the carrier state are poorly understood, but <i>S</i>. Typhi is thought to undergo specific genetic changes within the gallbladder as an adaptive mechanism. In the current study, we aimed to identify the genetic differences in longitudinal clinical <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates from asymptomatic carriers with gallstones in a typhoid endemic setting in Nairobi, Kenya. Whole-genome sequences were analyzed from 22 <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates, 20 from stool samples, and 2 from blood samples, all genotype 4.3.1 (H58). Out of this, 19 strains were from four patients also diagnosed with gallstones, of whom three had typhoid symptoms and continued to shed <i>S</i>. Typhi after treatment. All isolates had point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR), and only sub-lineage 4.3.1.2.EA3 encoded multidrug resistance genes. There was no variation in antimicrobial resistance patterns among strains from the same patient/household. Non-multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates formed significantly stronger biofilms <i>in vitro</i> than the MDR isolates, p<0.001. A point mutation within the <i>treB</i> gene (<i>treB</i> A383T) was observed in strains isolated after clinical resolution from patients living in 75% of the households. For missense mutations in Vi capsular polysaccharide genes, <i>tviE</i> P263S was also observed in 18% of the isolates. This study provides insights into the role of typhoid carriage, biofilm formation, AMR genes, and genetic variations in <i>S.</i> Typhi during asymptomatic carriage.",

This study focuses on the city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, investigating whether the presence or absence of solid waste collection services results in varying health and economic impacts, and additionally, seeking to establish a correlation between residing in proximity to dumpsites and the prevalence of diseases like malaria and typhoid, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of the health implications tied to waste exposure. Health data were collected through survey questionnaires, and the geospatial distribution of 19 dumpsites was analyzed using Google Earth Pro 7.3.1 for satellite imagery and GIS software 10.3.1 to map dumpsites and define 1 km buffer zones around the largest dumpsites for household sampling. Statistical analyses were conducted using R Version 4.2.3, employing Chi-square tests for disease prevalence and logistic regression to assess associations between waste management practices and health outcomes. A multivariate regression was used to evaluate correlations between discomfort symptoms (e.g., nasal and eye irritation) and waste activities. The geospatial analysis revealed significant variation in dumpsite size and location, with larger dumpsites near water bodies and flood-prone areas. The study contributes valuable insights into waste-related health risks, emphasizing the need for improved waste management policies in rapidly urbanizing areas like Kinshasa. The socio-demographic analysis reveals distinct traits within the surveyed populations of two communes, Bandalungwa (Bandal) and Bumbu. Bumbu, characterized by larger open dumpsites and limited waste collection services, exhibits a higher prevalence of certain diseases, particularly typhoid fever, and malaria. This discrepancy is statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 2.2 × 10<sup>-16</sup>), suggesting a potential link between waste exposure and disease prevalence. In Bandal, self-waste collection is a high risk of exposure to typhoid (OR = 4.834 and <i>p</i> = 0.00001), but the implementation of a waste collection service shows protective effect (OR = 0.206 and <i>p</i> = 0.00001). The lack of waste collection services in Bumbu increases the risk of exposure, although not significantly (OR = 2.268 and <i>p</i> = 0.08). Key findings indicate that waste disposal methods significantly differ between Bandal and Bumbu. Bumbu's reliance on burning and dumping creates environments conducive to disease vectors, contributing to elevated disease transmission risks. However, an in-depth correlation analysis reveals that specific waste management practices, such as burning, burying, and open dumping, do not exhibit statistically significant associations with disease prevalence, underlining the complexity of disease dynamics. This study contributes valuable insights into the importance for urban public health, particularly in rapidly urbanizing cities like Kinshasa, where inadequate waste management exacerbates health risks. By investigating the correlation between proximity to unregulated dumpsites and the prevalence of diseases such as malaria and typhoid fever, the research underscores the urgent need for targeted waste management policies. The stark health disparities between Bandal, with better waste services, and Bumbu, where services are lacking, highlight the protective effect of organized waste collection. These findings suggest that expanding public waste services and enforcing stricter regulations on waste disposal could reduce disease prevalence in vulnerable areas. Additionally, the study supports integrating waste management into urban planning as a critical public health measure. Its evidence-based approach offers valuable insights for policymakers in Kinshasa and other cities facing similar challenges, emphasizing the broader health implications of environmental governance in urban settings.",

In Thailand, common AUFIs include dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, and typhoid fever. This study aimed to determine the case numbers of AUFI etiologies in Thailand before coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (phase 1 from January 2018 to February 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic with preventive measures (phase 2 from March 2020 to April 2022), and the loosening of the preventive measures (phase 3 from May 2022 to December 2022). We used Thailand's national database from 2018 to 2022 to determine the case numbers of AUFIs and geographic heat maps to identify endemic areas in Thailand. The case numbers of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid, and scrub typhus significantly decreased during phase 2 (preventive measures) (P = 0.02), and cases of malaria and leptospirosis increased during phase 3 (loosened preventive measures) (P = 0.01). In 2022, malaria and leptospirosis increased by 39% and 48%, respectively, compared with the previous year. Malaria increased in western Thailand along the border between Thailand and Myanmar, where malaria preventive measures were insufficient, whereas leptospirosis increased in northern Thailand. The epidemiology of acute febrile diseases changes significantly depending on the global epidemic of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and the implementation of preventive measures, such as face masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, and stay-at-home and lockdown measures.",

This report describes the outbreak response to a rare occurrence of chronic <i>S.</i> Typhi carriage in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and provides recommendations for investigations of small-scale protracted outbreaks. We administered exposure questionnaires using a single interviewer approach, tested stool samples of contacts and food handlers, inspected food premises, collected food samples and reviewed takeout receipts. Social network, spatial and whole genome sequencing analyses were used to investigate additional possible links between cases. Seven people with typhoid fever and onset from October 2018 to May 2022 were linked to an asymptomatic chronic <i>S.</i> Typhi carrier. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that all eight isolates matched the outbreak cluster. All cases and carrier resided within an eight km radius in Ottawa. The chronic carrier worked as a food handler at various locations of a grocery store chain, including the implicated ready-to-eat counter. Transmission occurred via food handling, shared workspaces and social and household networks. The chronic carrier was excluded from food handling until successful completion of treatment and clearance testing.

Here, we have provided an updated overview of the current outbreaks of XDR <i>Salmonella</i> in epidemic and endemic regions. Treatments of XDR <i>Salmonella</i> infections are challenging, as there are records of treatment failure in humans and animals. However, intensive prevention techniques can be implemented pending the advent of novel antibiotics. Emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship and frequent surveillance of the pathogen should be made to keep track of potential outbreaks in both human and animal populations. Although progress is being made to combat XDR <i>Salmonella</i> within some regions, a unified and efficient effort on an international scale is required to curtail the XDR outbreak before it escalates and leads us back to the pre-antibiotic era.",

Understanding the impact of population mobility on the prevention and control of infectious diseases holds profound significance. In this study, we collected the data on the incidence of notifiable infectious diseases in mainland China from 2013 to 2019, and analyzed the characteristics of notifiable infectious diseases, as well as their correlation with transportation passenger traffic. Among 29 common notifiable infectious diseases, the incidence rate of intestinal diseases per 100,000 people was the highest (256.35 cases), while the mortality rate was the lowest (0.017 cases). The mortality rate per 100,000 people due to sexually transmitted and bloodborne diseases was the highest (1.154 cases). A significant linear correlation was noted between commercial passenger traffic and the number of cases of tuberculosis (r = 0.83, P = 0.022), hepatitis A (r = 0.87, P = 0.012), bacillary and amebic dysentery (r = 0.90, P = 0.006), typhoid/paratyphoid (r = 0.94, P = 0.002), leptospirosis (r = 0.90, P = 0.005), AIDS(r=-0.90, P = 0.006), gonorrhea (r=-0.79, P = 0.035) and scarlet fever (r=-0.85, P = 0.016).

The continuing expansion of international tourism increases the opportunities of contact with diverse epidemiological environments, leading to both a risk of bacterial acquisition or infection for the traveler and the circulation of the micro-organisms around the world. With the disparate increase in antibiotic resistance worldwide, the traveler becomes a microbiological sentinel for resistance surveillance. Travel has been associated with the acquisition of digestive carriage of multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, most frequently associated with travel to South Asia, enhanced by diarrhea and/or antibiotic use. But travel has also been the cause of authentic infections caused by multi- or extensively resistant bacteria, such as shigellosis, typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi, sexually transmitted infections caused by gonococci, or skin infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for which worry is the low number of antibiotics remaining effective.

        "abstract": "Vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness vary geographically. Chronic immunomodulating parasitic infections including schistosomes and malaria have been hypothesised to be mediators of geographical variations. We compared vaccine-specific immune responses between three Ugandan settings (schistosome-endemic rural, malaria-endemic rural, and urban) and did causal mediation analysis to assess the role of Schistosoma mansoni and malaria exposure in observed differences. We used data from the control groups of three linked randomised trials investigating the effects of intensive parasite treatment among schoolchildren. All participants received the BCG vaccine (week 0); yellow fever (YF-17D), oral typhoid (Ty21a), human papillomavirus (HPV; week 4); and HPV booster and tetanus-diphtheria (week 28). Primary outcomes were vaccine responses at week 8 and, for tetanus-diphtheria, week 52. We estimated the total effect (TE) of setting on vaccine responses and natural indirect effect (NIE) mediated through current or previous infection with S mansoni or malaria, and baseline vaccine-specific responses. We included 239 (43%) participants from the schistosomiasis-endemic setting, 171 (30%) from the malaria-endemic setting, and 151 (27%) from the urban setting. At week 8, vaccine responses were lower in rural settings: schistosomiasis-endemic versus urban settings (TE geometric mean ratio for YF-17D plaque reduction neutralisation at 50% (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) titres 0·58 [95% CI 0·37 to 0·91], for S Typhi O-lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG 0·61 [0·40 to 0·93], and for tetanus-specific IgG 0·33 [0·22 to 0·51]); malaria-endemic versus urban settings (YF-17D 0·70 [0·49 to 0·99], S Typhi O-lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG 0·29 [0·20 to 0·43], and tetanus-specific IgG 0·53 [-0·35 to 0·80]). However, we found higher BCG-specific IFNγ responses in the malaria-endemic versus urban setting (1·54 [1·20 to 1·98]). The estimated NIEs of setting on vaccine responses mediated through previous and current S mansoni and malaria were not statistically significant. For malaria-endemic versus urban settings, baseline vaccine-specific responses contributed to some but not all differences: S Typhi O-lipopolysaccharide-specific IgG at week 8 (57.9% mediated [38·6 to 77·2]) and week 52 (70·0% mediated [49·4 to 90·6]) and BCG at week 52 (46.4% mediated [-4·8 to 97·7]).

BCG immunisation boosts immune responses to some unrelated vaccines in high-income populations. We aimed to test the hypothesis that BCG revaccination can enhance responses to unrelated vaccines in Ugandan schoolchildren. We conducted an open-label, randomised controlled trial to compare the effects of BCG revaccination versus no BCG revaccination on the immunogenicity of subsequent unrelated vaccines among adolescents aged 13-17 years who are participants in an urban Ugandan birth cohort study, in which BCG vaccination was documented at birth. Participants were excluded if they had received any of the trial vaccines or related agents when aged 5 years or older. Computer-generated 1:1 randomisation was implemented in REDCap. Participants were excluded if they were concurrently enrolled in other trials; had a clinically significant history of immunodeficiency, or serious psychiatric conditions or moderate to severe acute illnesses; were taking immunosuppressive medications; had allergies to vaccine components, a predisposition towards developing keloid scarring; positive HIV tests or pregnancy tests; were female participants who were lactating; or if they planned to use investigational drugs, vaccines, blood products, or any combination thereof. Trial participants assigned to the BCG revaccination group received the live parenteral BCG-Russia vaccine (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India; 0·1 mL intradermally, right upper arm) at week 0. All participants received yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France; 0·5 mL intramuscularly, left upper arm), live oral typhoid vaccine (Ty21a; PaxVax, London, UK; one capsule per day taken for three alternate days), and quadrivalent virus-like particle human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Merck, Rahway, NJ, USA; 0·5 mL intramuscularly, left upper arm) at week 4; and toxoid vaccines (tetanus-diphtheria; Serum Institute of India; 0·5 mL intramuscularly, left upper arm) and an HPV booster at week 28. An additional HPV vaccination at week 8 was provided to female participants older than 14 years who had not previously been vaccinated. The primary outcomes were yellow fever neutralising antibody titres at 4 weeks post-YF-17D vaccination, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (henceforth S Typhi) O-lipopolysaccharide (O:LPS)-specific IgG concentration at 4 weeks post-Ty21a vaccination, and HPV-16 and HPV-18 L1 protein-specific IgG concentration at 4 weeks post-HPV vaccination. Primary outcome assays were conducted at week 8, and at week 52 for tetanus-diphtheria. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis comparing log-transformed outcomes between trial groups, with results back-transformed to geometric mean ratios (GMRs). The safety population comprised all randomly allocated participants. The trial was registered at the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10482904) and is complete. Between Aug 31 and Oct 12, 2020, we screened 376 potential participants for eligibility. We enrolled and randomly allocated 300 participants to the two groups (151 [50%] to the BCG group and 149 [50%] to the no BCG group). 178 (59%) of 300 participants were male and 122 (41%) were female. 142 (91%) of 151 participants in the BCG group and 139 (93%) of 149 in the no BCG group completed follow-up. There was no effect of BCG revaccination, compared with no BCG revaccination, on the response observed for any vaccine. Yellow fever plaque reduction neutralising reference tests (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) titres (the reciprocal of the last plasma dilution that reduced by 50%) had a GMR of 0·95 (95% CI 0·75-1·19; p=0·62) and PRNT<sub>90</sub> (reciprocal of the last plasma dilution that reduced by 90%) had a GMR of 0·94 (0·74-1·19; p=0·60); IgG to S Typhi O:LPS was 0·99 (0·80-1·23; p=0·94); IgG to HPV-16 was 0·97 (0·69-1·35; p=0·85) and to HPV-18 was 1·03 (0·76-1·40; p=0·83); and toxoid-specific IgG for tetanus was 1·13 (0·87-1·47; p=0·36) and was 1·00 (0·87-1·16; p=0·97) for diphtheria. There were no serious adverse events in either group. We found no evidence that BCG revaccination is an effective strategy to improve immunogenicity of other vaccines in this low-income, urban setting. UK Medical Research Council.

        "abstract": "Several important vaccines differ in immunogenicity and efficacy between populations. We hypothesised that malaria suppresses responses to unrelated vaccines and that this effect can be reversed-at least partially-by monthly malaria intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in high-transmission settings. We conducted an individually randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of malaria IPT with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on vaccine responses among schoolchildren aged 9-17 years in Jinja district, Uganda. Participants were recruited from two schools and did not have exposure to vaccines of interest after the age of 5 years, with the exception of human papillomavirus (HPV). Computer-generated 1:1 randomisation was implemented in REDCap. 3-day courses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dosage by weight) or placebo were administered monthly, including twice before the first vaccination. Trial participants were vaccinated with the live parenteral BCG vaccine (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) at week 0; yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France); live oral typhoid vaccine (Ty21a; PaxVax, London, UK), and quadrivalent virus-like particle HPV vaccine (Merck, Rahway, NJ, USA) at week 4; and toxoid vaccines (tetanus-diphtheria; Serum Institute of India) and an HPV booster at week 28. An additional HPV vaccination at week 8 was provided to female participants older than 14 years who had not previously been vaccinated, and a tetanus-diphtheria booster was given after completion of the trial at week 52. Primary outcomes were vaccine responses at week 8 and, for tetanus-diphtheria, at week 52, and analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. Malaria parasite prevalence at enrolment and during follow-up was determined retrospectively by PCR. The safety population comprised all randomly allocated participants. The trial was registered at the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN62041885) and is complete. Between May 25 and July 14, 2021, we assessed 388 potential participants for eligibility. We enrolled and randomly allocated 341 participants to the two groups (170 [50%] to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and 171 [50%] to placebo); 192 (56%) were female and 149 (44%) participants were male. 145 (85%) participants in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group and 140 participants (82%) in the placebo group were followed up until the week 52 endpoint. At enrolment, 109 (64%) of all participants in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group and 99 (58%) of 170 participants in the placebo group had malaria; this reduced to 6% or lower at all follow-up visits in the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group. There was no effect of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine versus placebo on primary outcomes: BCG-specific IFNγ ELISpot response had a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1·09 (95% CI 0·93-1·29), p=0·28; yellow fever neutralising antibody was 1·19 (0·91-1·54), p=0·20 for plaque reduction neutralising reference tests (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) titres (the reciprocal of the last plasma dilution that reduced by 50%) and 1·24 (0·97-1·58), p=0·09 for PRNT<sub>90</sub> titres (reciprocal of the last plasma dilution that reduced by 90%); and IgG to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi O-lipopolysaccharide was 1·09 (0·81-1·46), p=0·58, HPV-16 was 0·72 (0·44-1·77), p=0·19, HPV-18 was 0·71 (0·47-1·09), p=0·11; tetanus toxoid was 1·22 (0·91-1·62), p=0·18, and diphtheria toxoid was 0·97 (0·83-1·13), p=0·72. There was some evidence that dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine reduced waning of the yellow fever response. IPT for malaria with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine did not improve peak vaccine responses, despite reducing malaria prevalence. Possible longer-term effects on response waning should be further explored. UK Medical Research Council. For the Luganda translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",

        "title": "The effect of intensive praziquantel administration on vaccine-specific responses among schoolchildren in Ugandan schistosomiasis-endemic islands (POPVAC A): an open-label, randomised controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Vaccine responses differ between populations and are often impaired in rural and low-income settings. The reasons for this are not fully understood, but observational data suggest that the immunomodulating effects of parasitic helminths might contribute. We hypothesised that Schistosoma mansoni infection suppresses responses to unrelated vaccines, and that suppression could be reversed-at least in part-by intensive praziquantel administration. We conducted an open-label, randomised controlled trial of intensive versus standard intervention against S mansoni among schoolchildren aged 9-17 years from eight primary schools in Koome islands, Uganda. Children were randomly allocated to either an intensive group or a standard group with a computer-generated 1:1 randomisation using permuted blocks sizes 4, 6, 8, and 10. Participants in the intensive group received three praziquantel doses (approximately 40 mg/kg) 2 weeks apart before first vaccination at week 0, and every 3 months thereafter. Participants in the standard group were given one dose of approximately 40 mg/kg praziquantel after the week 8 primary endpoint. Participants in both groups received the BCG vaccine (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) at week 0; the yellow fever (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France), oral typhoid (PaxVax, London, UK), and first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination (Merck, Rahway, NJ, USA) at week 4; and the HPV booster and tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (Serum Institute of India) at week 28. The primary outcome was vaccine response at week 8 (except for tetanus and diphtheria, which was assessed at week 52). The primary analysis population was participants who were infected with S mansoni at baseline, determined retrospectively using either plasma circulating anodic antigen (CAA) or stool PCR. The safety population comprised all randomly allocated participants. The trial was registered at the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN60517191) and is complete. Between July 9 and Aug 14, 2019, we enrolled 478 participants, with 239 children per group. 276 (58%) participants were male and 202 (42%) participants were female. Among participants who were positive for S mansoni at baseline (171 [72%] in the intensive group and 164 [69%] in the standard group) intensive praziquantel administration significantly reduced pre-vaccination infection intensity (to median 30 CAA pg/mL [IQR 7-223] vs 1317 [243-8562], p<0·001) compared with standard treatment. Intensive praziquantel administration also reduced week 8 HPV-16-specific IgG response (geometric mean ratio 0·71 [95% CI 0·54-0·94], p=0·017), but had no effect on other primary outcomes. Among all participants (regardless of S mansoni status at baseline) intensive praziquantel administration significantly improved week 8 BCG-specific IFNγ ELISpot response (1·20 [1·01-1·43], p=0·038). Recognised adverse effects of praziquantel were reported more frequently in the intensive group. There were no recorded serious adverse events in either group. We show evidence suggesting that praziquantel administration improves the BCG-specific cellular response, but not humoral responses to other vaccines. Despite observational evidence that helminths impair vaccine response, these results show minimal immediate benefits of reducing helminth burden. The effect of longer-term helminth control should be investigated. UK Medical Research Council. For the Luganda translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.",

        "title": "Sinisan Alleviates Stress-Induced Intestinal Dysfunction and Depressive-like Behaviors in Mice with Irritable Bowel Syndrome by Enhancing the Intestinal Barrier and Modulating Central 5-Hydroxytryptamine.",
        "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic functional bowel disorder and is strongly associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. The brain-gut axis plays an important role in the pathophysiologic changes in IBS, yet effective treatments for IBS are still lacking. Sinisan, originating from the <i>Treatise on Typhoid Fever</i> by the medical sage Zhang Zhongjing, is a classic formula in the Eight Methods of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that focuses on dispersing the liver and regulating the spleen, relieving depression and transmitting evils, and has been widely used in the treatment of liver-depression and spleen-deficiency, diarrhea, and related liver and stomach disorders. However, the therapeutic effect of sinisan in IBS has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sinisan on stress-induced intestinal dysfunction and depressive behavior in IBS mice. We established a diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) mouse model using a 4% acetic acid enema combined with restraint stress, and analyzed the results using behavioral tests, relevant test kits, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, immunofluorescence (IF), Western blot (WB), and quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that sinisan administration significantly alleviated intestinal dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors in IBS-D mice, improved mild colonic inflammation and intestinal mucosal permeability, up-regulated the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin. Sinisan significantly alleviated intestinal dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors in IBS-D mice by decreasing the expression of TNF-α, promoting the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1) expression, and inhibiting the Tlr4/Myd88 signaling pathway, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response, protecting the intestinal barrier, and alleviating symptoms in the IBS-D mouse model. Taken together, sinisan may ameliorate intestinal inflammation and the intestinal barrier by regulating 5-HT expression and the Tlr4/Myd88 pathway, thereby alleviating stress-induced intestinal dysfunction and depressive behaviors in IBS-D mice.",

        "abstract": "WHO currently recommends a single dose of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in high-burden countries based on 2-year vaccine efficacy data from large randomised controlled trials. Given the decay of immunogenicity, the protection beyond 2 years is unknown. We therefore extended the follow-up of the TyVAC trial in Bangladesh to assess waning of vaccine protection to 5 years after vaccination. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial (TyVAC; ISRCTN11643110) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, between 2018 and 2021. Children aged 9 months to 15 years were invited to receive a single dose of TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine between April 15, 2018, and November 16, 2019, based on the randomisation of their clusters of residence. Children who received the Japanese encephalitis vaccine were invited to receive TCV at the final visit between Jan 6, and Aug 31, 2021, according to the protocol. This follow-on study extended the follow-up of the original trial until Aug 14, 2023. The primary endpoint of this study was to compare the incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid between children who received TCV in 2018-19 (the previous-TCV group) and those who received the vaccine in 2021 (the recent-TCV group), to evaluate the relative decline in vaccine protection. We also did a nested study using the test-negative design comparing the recent-TCV and previous-TCV groups with unvaccinated individuals, as well as an immunogenicity study in a subset of 1500 children. Compared with the recent-TCV group, the previous-TCV group had an increased risk of typhoid fever between 2021-23, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 3·10 (95% CI 1·53 to 6·29; p<0·0001), indicating a decline in the protection of a single-dose of TCV 3-5 years after vaccination. The extrapolated vaccine effectiveness in years 3-5 was 50% (95% CI -13 to 78), and was validated using the test-negative design analysis, with a vaccine effectiveness of 84% (74 to 90) in the recent-TCV group and 55% (36 to 68) in the previous-TCV group, compared with unvaccinated individuals. Anti-Vi-IgG responses declined over the study period. The highest rate of decay was seen in children vaccinated at younger than 2 years in the original trial. The inverse correlation between age and the decay of antibodies was also seen in the subgroup analysis of vaccine effectiveness, where the youngest age group (<7 years at fever visits) exhibited the fastest waning, with vaccine effectiveness dropping to 24% (95% CI -29 to 55) at 3-5 years after vaccination. A decline in the protection conferred by a single-dose TCV was observed 3-5 years after vaccination, with the greatest decline in protection and immune responses observed in children vaccinated at younger ages. A booster dose of TCV around school entry age might be needed for children vaccinated while younger than 2 years to sustain protection against typhoid fever during the school years when the risk is the highest.

        "abstract": "Enteric fever remains a major public health problem in South and Southeast Asia. The recent roll-out of the typhoid conjugate vaccine protecting against S. Typhi exhibits great promise for disease reduction in high burden areas. However, some endemic regions remain vulnerable to S. Paratyphi A due to a lack of licensed vaccines and inadequate WASH. Several developmental S. Paratyphi A vaccines exploit O-antigen as the target antigen. It has been hypothesised that O-antigen is under selective and environmental pressure, with mutations in O-antigen biosynthesis genes being reported, but their phenotypic effects are unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate O-antigen variation in S. Paratyphi A originating from Nepal, and the potential effect of this variation on antibody binding. O-antigen variation was determined by measuring LPS laddering shift following electrophoresis; this analysis was complemented with genomic characterisation of the O-antigen region. We found structural O-antigen variation in <10 % of S. Paratyphi A organisms, but a direct underlying genetic cause could not be identified. High-content imaging was performed to determine antibody binding by commercial O2 monoclonal (mAb) and polyclonal antibodies, as well as polyclonal sera from convalescent patients naturally infected with S. Paratyphi A. Commercial mAbs detected only a fraction of an apparently \"clonal\" bacterial population, suggesting phase variation and nonuniform O-antigen composition. Notably, and despite visible subpopulation clusters, O-antigen structural changes did not appear to affect the binding ability of polyclonal human antibody considerably, which led to no obvious differences in the functionality of antibodies targeting organisms with different O-antigen conformations. Although these results need to be confirmed in organisms from alternative endemic areas, they are encouraging the use of O-antigen as the target antigen in S. Paratyphi A vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Background & objectives Burden estimates of enteric fever are required to make policy decisions on introducing typhoid vaccine in India. Incidence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) of enteric fever are estimated in Chandigarh, India. Methods A hybrid (facility and community-based) surveillance system was set up at a secondary care hospital to enrol patients above six months of age, hospitalized with fever, from a defined catchment population from May 2018 to March 2020. Blood samples were collected and cultured using an automated system (BD BACTECTM blood culture system). The Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi isolates were characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility. OOPE was recorded after 14 and 28 days of discharge. Results Blood samples were collected from 97 per cent of the 1650 study participants enrolled. The incidence of enteric fever was 226.8 per 1,00,000 person-years (PY), severe typhoid fever 156.9 per 1,00,000 PY, and severe paratyphoid fever 69.9 per 1,00,000 PY. Salmonella was highly susceptible to ampicillin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone (99.25%) and least susceptible to ciprofloxacin (11.3%). The OOPE due to hospitalization of individuals infected with S. Paratyphi [INR 8696.6 (USD 116)] was significantly higher than the individuals infected with S. Typhi [INR 7309 (USD 97.5), P=0.01], and among cases who were hospitalized for more than seven days [INR 12,251 (USD 163.3)] as compared with those with a stay of 3-7 days [INR 8038.2 (USD 107.2)] or less than three days [INR 5327.8 (USD 71), P<0.001].

        "abstract": "Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella Typhi restricts typhoid treatment options, heightening concerns for pan-oral drug-resistant outbreaks. However, lack of long-term temporal surveillance data on AMR in countries with high burden like Bangladesh is scarce. Our study explores the AMR trends of Salmonella Typhi isolates from Bangladesh, drawing comparisons with antibiotic consumption to optimize antibiotic stewardship strategies for the country. The typhoid fever surveillance from 1999 to 2022 included two pediatric hospitals and three private clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Blood cultures were performed at treating physicians' discretion; cases were confirmed by microbiological, serological, and biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined following CLSI guidelines. National antibiotic consumption data for cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin was obtained from IQVIA-MIDAS database for comparison. Over the 24 years of surveillance, we recorded 12,435 culture-confirmed typhoid cases and observed declining resistance to first-line drugs (amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole); multidrug resistance (MDR) decreased from 38% in 1999 to 17% in 2022. Cotrimoxazole consumption dropped from 0.8 to 0.1 Daily defined doses (DDD)/1000/day (1999-2020). Ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility persisted at >90% with unchanged consumption (1.1-1.3 DDD/1000/day, 2002-2020). Low ceftriaxone resistance (<1%) was observed, with slightly rising MIC (0.03 to 0.12 mg/L, 1999-2019). Azithromycin consumption increased (0.1 to 3.8 DDD/1000/day, 1999-2020), but resistance remained ≤4%. Our study highlights declining MDR amongst Salmonella Typhi in Bangladesh; first-line antimicrobials could be reintroduced as empirical treatment options for typhoid fever if MDR rates further drops below 5%. The analysis also provides baseline data for monitoring the impact of future interventions like typhoid conjugate vaccines on typhoid burden and associated AMR.",

        "abstract": "West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of <i>Flaviviridae</i> family, is one of the most widely distributed arboviruses in the world. In developing countries like Nigeria, fever resulting from the WNV infection is often presumptively ascribed to malaria or typhoid due to misdiagnosis and low-level awareness of the viral infection. This study determined the prevalence of WNV IgM and IgG antibodies among febrile patients in the Ilorin metropolis. A total of two hundred (200) blood samples were collected from consenting patients and each serum was screened for anti-WNV IgM and IgG antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical correlation and logistic regression analysis were conducted. Overall, 6% (12/200) anti-WNV IgM seropositivity rate was recorded amongst the acute febrile patients with higher prevalence (6.30%) in females than in males (5.45%). Anti-WNV IgG positivity rate of 52% (104/200) was recorded, with 50.67% positivity rate in males and 38.95% in female participants. The convalescence phase posited by the 5.4% (11/200) co-detection of anti-WNV IgG and IgM antibodies among the participants was recorded. A statistical correlation was noticed with the age and religion of respondents to WNV serological positivity while gender, occupation, use of mosquito nets and formal education had no positive correlation at <i>p</i> < 0.05. However, based on odd ratio at 95% CI and logistic regression coefficients, the evaluated risk factors such as blood transfusion, residency, malaria parasite, and proximity to stagnant water and bush were significant to anti-WNV IgG and IgM positivity. The findings of this study show the circulation of WNV in the study area. There is an urgent need for clinicians/physicians to include screening for the West Nile virus in cases of febrile patients before the commencement of treatment.",

This study aimed to analyze their spatial distribution, investigating potential interactions and intersecting patterns. A total of 212 laboratory-confirmed cases of enteric fever and 1106 of leptospirosis between 2016 and 2022, were retrieved from the national e-Notifikasi registry. Point pattern analysis revealed clustering of both diseases in the northern region, but leptospirosis was predominant in the south, exhibiting higher spatial risk. Seven co-infection cases were identified in overlapping hotspot areas. Spatial dependence between the diseases was identified within 4 km distance on average, with varying patterns over time and regions. Recognizing spatial dependence has implications for accurate diagnosis, timely intervention, and tailored public health strategies. The findings underscore the need for multi-disease interventions to address shared risk factors and co-infections in similar geographical contexts.",

        "abstract": "Despite decades of intense research, our understanding of the correlates of protection against <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi (<i>S</i>. Typhi) infection and disease remains incomplete. T follicular helper cells (T<sub>FH</sub>), an important link between cellular and humoral immunity, play an important role in the development and production of high affinity antibodies. While traditional T<sub>FH</sub> cells reside in germinal centers, circulating T<sub>FH</sub> (cT<sub>FH</sub>) (a memory subset of T<sub>FH</sub>) are present in blood. We used specimens from a typhoid controlled human infection model whereby participants were immunized with Ty21a live attenuated <i>S</i>. Typhi vaccine and then challenged with virulent <i>S</i>. Typhi. Some participants developed typhoid disease (TD) and some did not (NoTD), which allowed us to assess the association of cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets in the development and prevention of typhoid disease. Of note, the frequencies of cT<sub>FH</sub> were higher in NoTD than in TD participants, particularly 7 days after challenge. Furthermore, the frequencies of cT<sub>FH</sub>2 and cT<sub>FH</sub>17, but not cT<sub>FH</sub>1 subsets were higher in NoTD than TD participants. However, we observed that ex-vivo expression of activation and homing markers were higher in TD than in NoTD participants, particularly after challenge. Moreover, cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets produced higher levels of <i>S</i>. Typhi-specific responses (cytokines/chemokines) in both the immunization and challenge phases. Interestingly, unsupervised analysis revealed unique clusters with distinct signatures for each cT<sub>FH</sub> subset that may play a role in either the development or prevention of typhoid disease. Importantly, we observed associations between frequencies of defined cT<sub>FH</sub> subsets and anti-<i>S.</i> Typhi antibodies. Taken together, our results suggest that circulating T<sub>FH</sub>2 and T<sub>FH</sub>17 subsets might play an important role in the development or prevention of typhoid disease. The contribution of these clusters was found to be distinct in the immunization and/or challenge phases. These results have important implications for vaccines aimed at inducing long-lived protective T cell and antibody responses.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, caused by the human restricted pathogen <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, remains a major global public health concern. Even after successful treatment, approximately 3-5% of patients with typhoid fail to clear the bacteria within one year and become chronic carriers. Most typhoid carriers have gallstones in their gallbladder, and biofilm formation on gallstones is highly correlated with chronic carriage. This study's goal was to identify asymptomatic typhoid carriers in an endemic setting in Kenya, and to compare acute versus chronic isolates. A cohort of typhoid fever patients identified through blood and/or stool culture, and their household contacts, were followed up after treatment to detect longitudinal <i>S</i>. Typhi stool shedding. An abdominal ultrasound scan was used to identify individuals with gallstones. A total of 32 index patients and 32 household contacts were successfully followed-up. Gallstones were detected in 4 cases and 1 household contact. The duration of <i>S</i>. Typhi shedding was significantly longer in individuals with gallstones compared to those without, <i>P</i><0.001. Eighty-three (83) <i>S</i>. Typhi strains were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobials and examined by <i>in vitro</i> biofilm formation assays. Out of 37 infected individuals, 32.4% had infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) <i>S</i>. Typhi strains and only 18.9% were infected by susceptible strains. Non-MDR strains formed significantly better biofilms <i>in vitro</i> than the MDR strains (<i>P</i><0.001). This study provides data on <i>S</i>.

Metal nanoparticles e.g., zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) exhibited the potential against many bacterial pathogens. Strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi resistant to ceftriaxone were reported first from Pakistan in 2016. Since then, S. Typhi is a pathogen of concern globally owing to its rapidly emerging resistance potential against many last resort antibiotics. In the present study, in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of ZnO NPs against multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) Salmonella Typhi strains from Pakistan was evaluated. Zinc oxide green nanoparticles (ZnO GNPs), synthesized from Aloe vera, were characterized by SEM, XRD, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy. In vitro antibacterial activity of two different concentrations of ZnO GNPs (7 and 15%) was checked using agar well diffusion method. Further, broth microdilution and time kill assays were performed using the ZnO GNPs. In vivo assays were conducted in BALB/c mice sepsis models. In all the three methods, agar well diffusion assay broth microdilution and time kill assay, different zinc oxide dihydrate precursor concentrations had shown the antibacterial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ZnO GNPs nanoparticles against MDR and XDR S. Typhi strains was found as 16 to 64 µg/ml. In vivo experiment has shown a significant decrease in CFU/ml in the mice treated with ZnO GNPs as compared to the control group. Our findings have revealed that ZnO GNPs have significant antibacterial activity against MDR and XDR S. Typhi, both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "There is a clear medical need for an accurate diagnostic test for typhoid that can be performed at point of care. Two antigens (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] and hemolysin E [HlyE]) have recently been identified that can distinguish typhoid from other bacterial infections. Here, we present the results of a diagnostic accuracy study of the Dual Path Platform (DPP) Typhoid assay (Chembio) that detects IgA to both LPS and HlyE using blood culture as the reference standard. This was a retrospective, observational, laboratory study conducted at the Aga Khan University research laboratory, Pakistan, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the DPP Typhoid assay, using archived frozen serum samples collected during a previous typhoid diagnostic accuracy study (NCT04801602). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (area under the receptor operating characteristics curve [AUC]) were then assessed using the manufacturer's and Youden's optimal thresholds. In total, 385 samples were included in the analysis. Using the manufacturer's thresholds, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.6-99.2), 65.3% (95% CI 58.5-71.6), and 81.5% (95% CI 75.5-85.3), respectively. At Youden's optimal threshold, the overall sensitivity of the DPP Typhoid assay was 89.7% and the specificity was 82.2%. In latent class modeling compared with other nine rapid diagnostic tests evaluated from the same cohort sample, the DPP Typhoid assay demonstrated the highest balanced accuracy (89.2%). The DPP Typhoid assay demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy for typhoid fever. However, further adjustment to new thresholds is recommended to enhance its performance capabilities. Currently available diagnostic tests for typhoid have several limitations, including low sensitivity and specificity. Dual Path Platform Typhoid assay is a multiplex rapid test that detects IgA antibodies to lipopolysaccharide and hemolysin E antigen. It is considered to have high sensitivity and specificity, and its results were found to be highly correlated with ELISA results. However, very few studies have been conducted to evaluate this test and limited information about the accuracy of this test is present. Hence, this study evaluated the new typhoid test.",

        "title": "Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance 1990-2021: a systematic analysis with forecasts to 2050.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an important global health challenge in the 21st century. A previous study has quantified the global and regional burden of AMR for 2019, followed with additional publications that provided more detailed estimates for several WHO regions by country. To date, there have been no studies that produce comprehensive estimates of AMR burden across locations that encompass historical trends and future forecasts. We estimated all-age and age-specific deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 22 pathogens, 84 pathogen-drug combinations, and 11 infectious syndromes in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We collected and used multiple cause of death data, hospital discharge data, microbiology data, literature studies, single drug resistance profiles, pharmaceutical sales, antibiotic use surveys, mortality surveillance, linkage data, outpatient and inpatient insurance claims data, and previously published data, covering 520 million individual records or isolates and 19 513 study-location-years. We used statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including those with no data. Our approach leverages the estimation of five broad component quantities: the number of deaths involving sepsis; the proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome; the proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen; the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest; and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden attributable to and associated with AMR, which we define based on two counterfactuals; respectively, an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections are replaced by drug-susceptible infections, and an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection. Additionally, we produced global and regional forecasts of AMR burden until 2050 for three scenarios: a reference scenario that is a probabilistic forecast of the most likely future; a Gram-negative drug scenario that assumes future drug development that targets Gram-negative pathogens; and a better care scenario that assumes future improvements in health-care quality and access to appropriate antimicrobials. We present final estimates aggregated to the global, super-regional, and regional level. In 2021, we estimated 4·71 million (95% UI 4·23-5·19) deaths were associated with bacterial AMR, including 1·14 million (1·00-1·28) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. Trends in AMR mortality over the past 31 years varied substantially by age and location. From 1990 to 2021, deaths from AMR decreased by more than 50% among children younger than 5 years yet increased by over 80% for adults 70 years and older. AMR mortality decreased for children younger than 5 years in all super-regions, whereas AMR mortality in people 5 years and older increased in all super-regions. For both deaths associated with and deaths attributable to AMR, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased the most globally (from 261 000 associated deaths [95% UI 150 000-372 000] and 57 200 attributable deaths [34 100-80 300] in 1990, to 550 000 associated deaths [500 000-600 000] and 130 000 attributable deaths [113 000-146 000] in 2021). Among Gram-negative bacteria, resistance to carbapenems increased more than any other antibiotic class, rising from 619 000 associated deaths (405 000-834 000) in 1990, to 1·03 million associated deaths (909 000-1·16 million) in 2021, and from 127 000 attributable deaths (82 100-171 000) in 1990, to 216 000 (168 000-264 000) attributable deaths in 2021. There was a notable decrease in non-COVID-related infectious disease in 2020 and 2021. Our forecasts show that an estimated 1·91 million (1·56-2·26) deaths attributable to AMR and 8·22 million (6·85-9·65) deaths associated with AMR could occur globally in 2050. Super-regions with the highest all-age AMR mortality rate in 2050 are forecasted to be south Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. Increases in deaths attributable to AMR will be largest among those 70 years and older (65·9% [61·2-69·8] of all-age deaths attributable to AMR in 2050). In stark contrast to the strong increase in number of deaths due to AMR of 69·6% (51·5-89·2) from 2022 to 2050, the number of DALYs showed a much smaller increase of 9·4% (-6·9 to 29·0) to 46·5 million (37·7 to 57·3) in 2050. Under the better care scenario, across all age groups, 92·0 million deaths (82·8-102·0) could be cumulatively averted between 2025 and 2050, through better care of severe infections and improved access to antibiotics, and under the Gram-negative drug scenario, 11·1 million AMR deaths (9·08-13·2) could be averted through the development of a Gram-negative drug pipeline to prevent AMR deaths. This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR from 1990 to 2021, with results forecasted until 2050. Evaluating changing trends in AMR mortality across time and location is necessary to understand how this important global health threat is developing and prepares us to make informed decisions regarding interventions. Our findings show the importance of infection prevention, as shown by the reduction of AMR deaths in those younger than 5 years. Simultaneously, our results underscore the concerning trend of AMR burden among those older than 70 years, alongside a rapidly ageing global community. The opposing trends in the burden of AMR deaths between younger and older individuals explains the moderate future increase in global number of DALYs versus number of deaths. Given the high variability of AMR burden by location and age, it is important that interventions combine infection prevention, vaccination, minimisation of inappropriate antibiotic use in farming and humans, and research into new antibiotics to mitigate the number of AMR deaths that are forecasted for 2050.

        "abstract": "Variations in vaccine responses have been observed between populations. A role for helminth infections has been proposed due to their immunomodulatory properties. In a secondary analysis of data from a randomised trial assessing effects of anthelminthic treatment on vaccine responses, we examined associations between helminth infections at baseline prior to vaccine administration, and vaccine responses among adolescents (9-17 years) in Koome Islands, Lake Victoria, Uganda. Participants received BCG [week 0], yellow fever (YF-17D), oral typhoid (Ty21a), HPV-prime [week 4], and HPV-boost, tetanus/diphtheria [week 28]. Outcomes were BCG-specific interferon-γ ELISpot responses and antibody responses to yellow-fever-, typhoid-, HPV-, tetanus- and diphtheria-specific antigens measured at two time points post vaccination. <i>S. mansoni</i> infection was determined as positive if either the plasma Circulating Anodic Antigen (CAA) assay or stool PCR were positive. Hookworm and <i>Strongyloides</i> were determined by stool PCR. Linear mixed effects regression was used to assess associations. Among 478 adolescents, 70% were <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> (Sm) infected and 23% hookworm infected at baseline. <i>Sm</i> was associated with lower <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi O:LPS-specific IgG responses (adjusted geometric mean ratio (aGMR) 0.69 (0.57-0.83)), and hookworm with higher diphtheria-specific IgG (aGMR 1.16 (1.02, 1.31)) and lower HPV-16-specific IgG (aGMR 0.70 (0.55, 0.90)) post-vaccination. High <i>Sm</i> intensity was associated with lower BCG-specific interferon-γ and <i>S.</i> Typhi O:LPS-specific IgG. We found inverse associations between <i>Sm</i> and responses to two live vaccines, whereas hookworm was positively associated with diphtheria-specific IgG. These findings support the hypothesis that helminth infections can modulate vaccine responses, while also highlighting potential heterogeneity in the direction of these effects.",

        "abstract": "Certain infectious diseases are caused by specific bacterial pathogens, including syphilis, gonorrhea, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, leprosy, and tuberculosis. These diseases significantly impact global health, contributing heavily to the disease burden. The study aims to thoroughly evaluate the global burden of syphilis, gonorrhea, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and leprosy. Leveraging the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021, age-specific and Socio-demographic Index (SDI)-specific incidence, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and death for eight specific bacterial infections across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 were analyzed. Percentage changes in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), DALY rate, and mortality rate (ASMR) were also examined, with a focus on disease distribution across different regions, age groups, genders, and SDI. By 2021, among the eight diseases, gonococcal infection had the highest global ASIR [1096.58 per 100,000 population, 95% uncertainty interval (UI): 838.70, 1385.47 per 100,000 population], and syphilis had the highest global age-standardized DALY rate (107.13 per 100,000 population, 95% UI: 41.77, 212.12 per 100,000 population). Except for syphilis and gonococcal infection, the age-standardized DALY rate of the remaining diseases decreased by at least 55% compared to 1990, with tetanus showing the largest decrease by at least 90%. Globally, significant declines in the ASIR, age-standardized DALY rate, and ASMR for these eight bacterial infections have been observed in association with increases in the SDI. Regions with lower SDI, such as sub-Saharan Africa, experienced a relatively higher burden of these eight bacterial infections. Although there has been an overall decline in these eight diseases, they continue to pose significant public health challenges, particularly in low SDI regions. To further reduce this burden in these areas, targeted intervention strategies are essential, including multi-sectoral collaboration, policy support, improved WASH management, and enhanced research efforts.",

        "abstract": "Vaccine safety and immunogenicity data in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-exposed uninfected (HEU) children are important for decision-making in HIV and typhoid co-endemic countries. In an open-label study, we recruited Malawian HEU and HIV unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants aged 9 - 11 months. HEU participants were randomized to receive Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT) at 9 months, Vi-TT at 15 months, or Vi-TT at 9 and 15 months. HUU participants received Vi-TT at 9 and 15 months. Safety outcomes included solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AE) and serious AEs (SAEs) within 7 days, 28 days, and 6 months of vaccination, respectively. Serum was collected before and at day 28 after each vaccination to measure anti-Vi IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cohort 1 (66 participants) enrollment began 02 December 2019, and follow-up was terminated before completion due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cohort 2 (100 participants) enrollment began 25 March 2020. Solicited AEs were mostly mild, with no significant differences between HEU and HUU participants or one- and two-dose groups. All six SAEs were unrelated to vaccination. Anti-Vi geometric mean titers (GMT) increased significantly from 4.1 to 4.6 ELISA units (EU)/mL at baseline to 2572.0 - 4117.6 EU/mL on day 28 post-vaccination, and similarly between HEU and HUU participants for both one- and two-dose schedules. All participants seroconverted (>4-fold increase in GMT) by the final study visit.

        "abstract": "Controlled human infection model (CHIM) studies, which involve deliberate exposure of healthy human volunteers to an infectious agent, are recognised as important tools to advance vaccine development. These studies not only facilitate estimates of vaccine efficacy, but also offer an experimental approach to study disease pathogenesis and profile vaccine immunogenicity in a controlled environment, allowing correlation with clinical outcomes. Consequently, the data from CHIMs can be used to identify immunological correlates of protection (CoP), which can help accelerate vaccine development. In the case of invasive <i>Salmonella</i> infections, vaccination offers a potential instrument to prevent disease. Invasive <i>Salmonella</i> disease, caused by the enteric fever pathogens <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (<i>S.</i> Typhi) and <i>S.</i> Paratyphi A, B and C, and nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (iNTS), remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries, resulting in over 200,000 deaths and the loss of 15 million DALYs annually. CHIM studies have contributed to the understanding of <i>S</i>. Typhi infection and provided invaluable insight into the development of vaccines and CoP following vaccination against <i>S.</i> Typhi. However, CoP are less well understood for <i>S</i>. Paratyphi A and iNTS.

        "abstract": "Salmonella spp. are intracellular, Gram-negative pathogens responsible for a range of diarrheal diseases, which can present either as self-limited (gastroenteritis) or as a systemic form (typhoid fever), characterizing a serious public health problem. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of oral administration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 in a murine model infected with Salmonella Typhimurium (ST). This yeast species has previously demonstrated the potential to support immune function and reduce inflammation and the ability to exert antimicrobial activity, which is important considering the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Our findings revealed that mice infected with ST and only treated with sterile saline exhibited a higher mortality rate and body weight loss. In contrast, mice treated with I-3856 showed a notable reduction in these adverse outcomes. The yeast demonstrated a high capacity for co-aggregation with the pathogen. Furthermore, the significant amounts of yeast found in the feces of treated mice suggest that intestinal colonization was effective, which was associated with several beneficial effects, including reduced intestinal permeability, which likely limits bacterial translocation to extraintestinal organs. Additionally, the administration of I-3856 reduced levels of sIgA and resulted in a decrease in the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils to infection sites, indicating a modulation of the inflammatory response. Histological analyses showed attenuated liver and intestinal lesions in the yeast-treated mice, corroborating the protective effects of the yeast. In conclusion, the results suggest that S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 has the potential to control the inflammatory response experimentally induced by S. Typhimurium when administered to mice.",

Typhi can invade and survive within host cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages, by modulating their immune responses. However, the immunomodulatory capability of <i>S</i>.

The <i>tolC</i> mutant, which has a defective outer membrane, was impaired in invading epithelial cells compared to the wild-type strain, but the intracellular presence of the <i>tolC</i> mutant exhibited greater cytotoxicity and induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (<i>IL-1β</i> and <i>IL-8</i>) in macrophages compared to the wild-type strain.

Here we describe the characteristics of the first two cases of mph(A)-positive azithromycin-resistant Typhi identified through US surveillance. Isolates were submitted to public health laboratories, sequenced, and screened for antimicrobial resistance determinants and plasmids, as part of CDC PulseNet's routine genomic surveillance. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and long-read sequencing were also performed. Basic case information (age, sex, travel, outcome) was collected through routine questionnaires; additional epidemiological data was requested through follow-up patient interviews. The patients are related and both reported travel to India (overlapping travel dates) before illness onset. Both Typhi genomes belong to the GenoTyphi lineage 4.3.1.1 and carry the azithromycin-resistance gene mph(A) on a PTU-FE (IncFIA/FIB/FII) plasmid. These strains differ genetically from mph(A)-positive Typhi genomes recently reported from Pakistan, suggesting independent emergence of azithromycin resistance in India. Cases of typhoid fever caused by Typhi strains resistant to all available oral treatment options are cause for concern and support the need for vaccination of travellers to Typhi endemic regions. US genomic surveillance serves as an important global sentinel for detection of strains with known and emerging antimicrobial resistance profiles, including strains from areas where routine surveillance is not conducted.",

        "abstract": "<i>Salmonella</i>-induced peritonitis, secondary to spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation, is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. We present a case of a 62-year-old female with a history of systemic hypertension, who presented with diffuse abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Initial evaluation suggested acute gastroenteritis, but worsening symptoms led to emergent exploratory laparotomy, revealing a gastric/duodenal perforation. Peritoneal fluid analysis and culture confirmed <i>Salmonella</i> Paratyphi A infection. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy with omental patch repair and received intravenous ceftriaxone, leading to a full recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering <i>Salmonella</i> infection in the differential diagnosis of peritonitis, prompt surgical intervention, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy for optimal management and outcomes. Further research on epidemiological trends, host-pathogen interactions, and antibiotic resistance should be explored. Clinical studies should refine diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols, while animal models can aid in understanding pathophysiology and vaccine development for <i>Salmonella</i> peritonitis. Public health interventions and environmental studies will enhance prevention and control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Rapid and accurate identification of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi (A, B and C), the causal agents of enteric fever, is critical for timely treatment, case management and evaluation of health policies in low and middle-income countries where the disease still remains a serious public health problem. The present study describes the development of a multiplex assay (EFMAtyping) for simultaneous identification of pathogens causing typhoid and paratyphoid fever in a single reaction by the MeltArray approach, which could be finished within 2.5 h. Seven specific genes were chosen for differentiation of typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella. All gene targets were able to be detected by the EFMAtyping assay, with expected Tm values and without cross-reactivity to other relevant Salmonella serovars. The limit of detection (LOD) for all gene targets was 50 copies per reaction. The LOD reached 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml for each pathogen in simulated clinical samples. The largest standard deviation value for mean Tm was below 0.5 °C. This newly developed EFMAtyping assay was further evaluated by testing 551 clinical Salmonella isolates, corroborated in parallel by the traditional Salmonella identification workflow, and serotype prediction was enabled by whole-genome sequencing. Compared to the traditional method, our results exhibited 100% of specificity and greater than 96% of sensitivity with a kappa correlation ranging from 0.96 to 1.00. Thus, the EFMAtyping assay provides a rapid, high throughput, and promising tool for public health laboratories to monitor typhoid and paratyphoid fever.",

A detailed analysis is done to ensure the solutions are positive, stay within certain limits, and are stable for both situations where the disease is absent and where it is consistently present. The Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion has been used and applied for the purpose of stability analysis. Using the next-generation matrix, we determined the intrinsic potential for disease transmission. It showing that typhoid fever is spreading actively in Sheno town, with cases above a critical level. Our findings reveal the instability of the disease-free equilibrium point alongside the stability of the endemic equilibrium point. We identified two pivotal factors for transmission of the disease: the infectious rate, representing the speed of disease transmission, and the recruitment rate, indicating the rate at which new individuals enter the susceptible population. These parameters are indispensable for devising effective control measures. It is imperative to keep these parameters below specific thresholds to maintain a basic reproduction number favorable for disease control. Additionally, the study carefully examines how different factors affect the spread of typhoid fever, giving a detailed understanding of its dynamics. At the end, this study provides valuable insights and specific strategies for managing the disease in the Sheno town community.",

        "abstract": "The event-based surveillance and response report from the municipality of Buguias in the Philippines covering the period 1 January to 29 October 2022 indicated an unusual increase in the number of typhoid cases that surpassed the epidemic threshold for consecutive weeks. An investigation was conducted to confirm the existence of an outbreak, identify the source(s) of transmission and recommend prevention and control measures. The investigation employed a descriptive design. Medical records were reviewed to verify diagnoses and to identify cases that met case definitions. Key informant interviews were conducted to identify possible sources of transmission and investigate the reporting of cases in the Philippine Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (PIDSR) system. A total of 220 cases of typhoid fever were captured by the PIDSR system. Of the 208 suspected cases that were reviewed, only 15 (7.2%) met the case definition used in this investigation. Fourteen of these 15 verified cases were interviewed; five (35.7%) were farmers and 13 (92.8%) reported using springs as their main water source and source of drinking-water. Reporting of cases in the PIDSR system was largely based on the final chart diagnosis or a positive Typhidot or Tubex rapid diagnostic test result. The PIDSR case definition was not followed in the reporting of cases. This study provides evidence of endemicity of typhoid fever in Buguias, Benguet, Philippines. However, from January to October 2022, cases were overreported by the surveillance system. Medical record reviews showed that most reported suspected cases did not meet case definition criteria. This finding emphasizes the need to improve typhoid guidelines with regards to diagnosis using rapid diagnostic tests and to investigate the cost-effectiveness of making confirmatory laboratory tests for typhoid available in the Philippines.",

However, there are substantial gaps in the monitoring systems, which result in a lack of knowledge about the geographic distribution and role of common pathogens, particularly in rural areas. Thus, this study was aimed at assessing the seroprevalence of typhoid fever, typhus, and malaria among suspected acute febrile patients at the MTU Teaching Hospital and Mizan-Aman Health Center, Southwest region of Ethiopia. A health facility-based cross-sectional study was carried out from July to October 2022. Blood samples were collected from a total of 384 individuals. Widal and Weilfelix direct card agglutination and tube agglutination test methods were used for the <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serotype <i>Typhi</i> (<i>S. typhi</i>) and <i>Rickettsia</i> infections. The diagnosis of malaria was made using thick and thin blood smears. Questionnaires given by interviewers were used to gather information on risk factors and other sociodemographic factors. The data was analyzed using STATA/SE 14.0. A total of 371 patients were tested for <i>S</i>. Typhi and <i>Rickettsia</i> infections using direct card agglutination and tube agglutination methods. Using the screening test, 20.5% (76/371) patients were reactive either for O or H antigens or both, of which 55.3% (42/76) were reactive by the titration test at the cutoff value ≥ 1:80. About 17.5% (65/371) were reactive to OX19 antigen by card agglutination test, and of which 58.5% (38/65) were reactive by the titration test at the cutoff value ≥ 1:80. The overall seroprevalence of <i>S</i>. Typhi and <i>Rickettsia</i> infections using combined direct card and tube agglutination techniques was 11.3% (42/371) and 10.2% (38/371), respectively.

        "abstract": "Salmonellosis, caused by <i>Salmonella</i> species, is one of the most common foodborne illnesses worldwide with an estimated 93.8 million cases and about 155,00 fatalities. In both industrialized and developing nations, Salmonellosis has been reported to be one of the most prevalent foodborne zoonoses and is linked with arrays of illness syndromes such as acute and chronic enteritis, and septicaemia. The two major and most common <i>Salmonella</i> species implicated in both warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals are <i>Salmonella bongori</i> and <i>Salmonella enterica.</i> To date, more than 2400 <i>S. enterica</i> serovars which affect both humans and animals have been identified. <i>Salmonella</i> is further classified into serotypes based on three primary antigenic determinants: somatic (O), flagella (H), and capsular (K). The capacity of nearly all <i>Salmonella</i> species to infect, multiply, and survive in human host cells with the aid of their pathogenic and virulence arsenals makes them deadly and important public health pathogens. Primarily, food-producing animals such as poultry, swine, cattle, and their products have been identified as important sources of salmonellosis. Additionally, raw fruits and vegetables are among other food types that have been linked to the spread of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. Based on the clinical manifestation of human salmonellosis, <i>Salmonella</i> strains can be categorized as either non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> (NTS) and typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i>. The detection of aseptically collected <i>Salmonella</i> in necropsies, environmental samples, feedstuffs, rectal swabs, and food products serves as the basis for diagnosis. In developing nations, typhoid fever due to <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi typically results in the death of 5%-30% of those affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) calculated that there are between 16 and 17 million typhoid cases worldwide each year, with scaring 600,000 deaths as a result. The contagiousness of a <i>Salmonella</i> outbreak depends on the bacterial strain, serovar, growth environment, and host susceptibility. Risk factors for <i>Salmonella</i> infection include a variety of foods; for example, contaminated chicken, beef, and pork. Globally, there is a growing incidence and emergence of life-threatening clinical cases, especially due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Salmonella</i> spp, including strains exhibiting resistance to important antimicrobials such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. In extreme cases, especially in situations involving very difficult-to-treat strains, death usually results. The severity of the infections resulting from <i>Salmonella</i> pathogens is dependent on the serovar type, host susceptibility, the type of bacterial strains, and growth environment. This review therefore aims to detail the nomenclature, etiology, history, pathogenesis, reservoir, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, risk factors, antimicrobial resistance, public health importance, economic impact, treatment, and control of salmonellosis.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the source of typhoid infections and the genetic relatedness of Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) by cluster identification in endemic settings is critical for establishing coordinated public health responses for typhoid fever management. This study investigated the genotypic diversity, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and clustering of 35 S.Typhi strains isolated from cases and carriers in the Mukuru Informal Settlement. We studied 35 S.Typhi isolates, including 32 from cases and 3 from carriers, from study participants in the informal settlement of Mukuru, Nairobi, Kenya. Genomic DNA was extracted, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to determine the phylogenetic relatedness of strains and detect antimicrobial resistance determinants (AMR). WGS data were analyzed using bioinformatics tools available at the Center for Genomic Epidemiology and Pathogenwatch platforms. Genotype 4.3.1.2 EA3 was found to be dominant at 46% (16/35), followed by 4.3.1.2 EA2 at 28% (10/35), and 4.3.1.1 EA1 at 27% (9/35). A comparison of the isolates with global strains from Pathogenwatch identified close clustering with strains from Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and India. Three isolates (9%) distributed in each cluster were isolated from carriers. All genotype 4.3.1.2 EA3 isolates were genotypically multidrug-resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Single mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region were identified in the gyrA (S83Y) and gyrB (S464F) genes. All isolates associated with multidrug resistance showed the presence of the IncQ1 plasmid with the following genes: blaTEM-1B, catA1, sul1, sul2, and dfrA7. The close phylogenetic relatedness between antimicrobial-resistant case isolates and carriage isolates indicates that typhoid carriage is a possible source of infection in the community. Comparative analysis with global isolates revealed that the Kenyan isolates share common lineages with strains from neighboring East African countries and India, suggesting regional dissemination of specific MDR clones. AMR was a major feature of the isolates. Surveillance and testing for antimicrobial susceptibility should inform options for the management of cases.",

This study measured the longevity of immune response to TCV in children aged under 10 years in Hyderabad, Pakistan, where an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant typhoid has been ongoing. A subset of children who received the TCV as part of the outbreak response were enrolled purposively from March 2018 to February 2019. The participants were followed up until January 2023. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and annually 1-4 years after vaccination to measure anti-Vi immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Active phone-based surveillance was performed to identify breakthrough infections. Blood culture was offered to any child with a history of fever ≥3 days within the last 7 days. A total of 81 children received a second dose of TCV in November 2019 during a catch-up campaign organized by the Sindh government. Nearly all participants seroconverted (802 of 837; 95.8%) at 4-6 weeks after vaccination. A total of 4 years after vaccination, 438 of 579 (75.6%) participants remained above the seroconversion threshold. The geometric mean titer (U/mL) of anti-Vi IgG at 4-6 weeks was 832.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 768.0-902.6); at 4 years after vaccination, the geometric mean titers in children aged 6 months to 2 years (12.6, [95% CI: 9.8-16.3]) and >2-5 years (40.1, [95% CI: 34.4-46.6]) were lower than in children aged >5-10 years (71.1, [95% CI: 59.5-85.0]). During 4 years of follow-up, nine children had culture-confirmed Salmonella Typhi infection; these infections occurred after a median duration of 3.4 years. All enteric fever cases seroconverted at 4-6 weeks after vaccination and seven (70.0%) remained seroconverted 4 years after vaccination. We observed 95.8% seroconversion after a single dose of TCV. There was a decay in anti-Vi IgG titers, and, at 4 years, approximately 75.6% remained seroconverted. There was a faster decay in children aged ≤2 years.

        "abstract": "Schumanniophyton magnificum is a medicinal plant used to manage many ailments including malaria, skin diseases, parasitic infections, male sexual dysfunctions, female infertility and typhoid fever. However, no scientific investigation has been made for its folkloric use by the \"Baka\" Pygmies of Cameroon as an aphrodisiac. To investigate the aphrodisiac and androgenic activities of the aqueous extract of the roots of Schumanniophyton magnificum in male rats and analyze the phytoconstituents by UHPLC/MS. Twenty-five male rats of 16-weeks old were divided into 5 groups and orally treated for 30 days with distilled water (10 ml/kg), or sildenafil citrate (5 mg/kg), or the aqueous extract of Schumanniophyton magnificum (43 mg/kg, 86 mg/kg and 172 mg/kg). The sexual behaviour parameters were monitored on day 1 and 30 by pairing male rats to receptive females. At the end of the experiment, rats were killed and the blood and reproductive organs were collected for histological sectioning, sperm analysis and biochemical analysis. The presence of phytoconstituents and their structures were revealed by UHPLC/MS. The plant extract significantly increased the mount, ejaculation and intromission frequencies in comparison to those in the normal control group; and significantly doubled the serum testosterone levels (2.15 ± 0.70 ng/ml) compared to the normal control group. UHPLC/MS of the aqueous extract of Schumanniophyton magnificum identified 7 major compounds such as Schumanniofioside A, Noreugenin and Rohitukine, with antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The plant extracts significantly increased the penile nitric oxide levels (P <0.05). These results were similar to those obtained after administration of sildenafil citrate. The aqueous extract of Schumanniophyton magnificum could be an alternative for erectile dysfunction management.",

        "abstract": "This case report provides data on unique challenges related to amoebiasis diagnostics and treatment in non-endemic regions. The presented case report is focused a 28-year-old male patient of Indian origin, temporarily living in Poland, who was diagnosed with an amoebic liver abscess. The patient presented with a range of non-specific symptoms including shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. The differential diagnosis included cardio-pulmonary diseases, a range of tropical diseases such as malaria or typhoid fever, bacterial abscesses, and malignancies, necessitating a comprehensive, multi-modal diagnostic approach. This approach included an extensive review of patient history, physical examination, and various laboratory and imaging investigations. A further challenge in this case was the unavailability of standard cysticidal treatments in Poland, which required individualized therapeutic strategy. Despite these obstacles, the patient was successfully treated using an alternative regimen of intravenous metronidazole, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, chloroquine, and finally, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (treatment with metronidazole was used as a base drug, due to the lack of typical cysticidal treatment, an alternative treatment was added: chloroquine is a recommended drug used in the treatment of pregnant patients, in addition, doxycycline showed in vitro activity against Entamoeba histolytica). This therapeutic journey underscored the value of adaptability in treatment protocols, particularly in regions where certain resources may not be readily available. This case report underlines the importance of broadening the differential diagnosis in non-endemic regions to include tropical diseases, particularly in the context of increasing global travel and migration. It also highlights the significance of employing comprehensive diagnostic strategies and adaptable treatment protocols in such scenarios. In addition, the report reiterates the need for global collaboration and education among healthcare providers to effectively manage tropical diseases, especially in non-endemic regions. Through its exploration of the complexities associated with diagnosing and managing amebiasis in a non-endemic region, this report offers valuable insights to clinicians worldwide.",

        "abstract": "<i>Salmonella typhi</i>, a gram-negative bacterium responsible for typhoid fever, can infect the inner lining or valves of the heart and cause endocarditis. This systematic review aimed to report cases of <i>S. typhi</i>-associated endocarditis and its clinical features. This systematic review was reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Only case reports and case series of endocarditis caused by <i>S. typhi</i>, irrespective of age, gender, and demographics, were considered eligible for inclusion. To identify relevant studies, a literature search was conducted using relevant keywords on PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 31 December 2023. After selecting the studies, the relevant data were extracted and pooled in terms of frequencies and percentages. A quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. This review included seven case reports, comprising 22.2% female and 77.8% male patients. The mean age of patients was 27.9 + 12.0 years. Regarding past medical history, 33.3% (3/9) of patients had a previous cardiac pathology. Fever remained the most common complaint, occurring in 88.9% of cases. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography were used to diagnose all cases, with 33.3% identifying vegetation on the mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves. Ceftriaxone, with or without gentamycin, remained the choice of antibiotic for 88.9% of cases, and all patients responded to the offered treatment. <i>S. typhi</i>-associated endocarditis, though rare, presents unique challenges and requires timely diagnosis. This systematic review of seven cases highlights a predominantly male population affected, with a mean age in the third decade, suggesting a higher invasiveness than other causes. The findings from this study underscore the importance of early recognition and appropriate management, primarily with antibiotic therapy. Further research with larger cohorts is crucial to refine understanding and guide policymaking for this rare but life-threatening condition.",

        "abstract": "Enteric fever is a serious public health concern. The causative agents, Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, frequently have antimicrobial resistance (AMR), leading to limited treatment options and poorer clinical outcomes. We investigated the genomic epidemiology, resistance mechanisms, and transmission dynamics of these pathogens at three urban sites in Africa and Asia. S Typhi and S Paratyphi A bacteria isolated from blood cultures of febrile children and adults at study sites in Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Blantyre (Malawi) during STRATAA surveillance were sequenced. Isolates were charactered in terms of their serotypes, genotypes (according to GenoTyphi and Paratype), molecular determinants of AMR, and population structure. We used phylogenomic analyses incorporating globally representative genomic data from previously published surveillance studies and ancestral state reconstruction to differentiate locally circulating from imported pathogen AMR variants. Clusters of sequences without any single-nucleotide variants in their core genome were identified and used to explore spatiotemporal patterns and transmission dynamics. We sequenced 731 genomes from isolates obtained during surveillance across the three sites between Oct 1, 2016, and Aug 31, 2019 (24 months in Dhaka and Kathmandu and 34 months in Blantyre). S Paratyphi A was present in Dhaka and Kathmandu but not Blantyre. S Typhi genotype 4.3.1 (H58) was common in all sites, but with different dominant variants (4.3.1.1.EA1 in Blantyre, 4.3.1.1 in Dhaka, and 4.3.1.2 in Kathmandu). Multidrug resistance (ie, resistance to chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, and ampicillin) was common in Blantyre (138 [98%] of 141 cases) and Dhaka (143 [32%] of 452), but absent from Kathmandu. Quinolone-resistance mutations were common in Dhaka (451 [>99%] of 452) and Kathmandu (123 [89%] of 138), but not in Blantyre (three [2%] of 141). Azithromycin-resistance mutations in acrB were rare, appearing only in Dhaka (five [1%] of 452). Phylogenetic analyses showed that most cases derived from pre-existing, locally established pathogen variants; 702 (98%) of 713 drug-resistant infections resulted from local circulation of AMR variants, not imported variants or recent de novo emergence; and pathogen variants circulated across age groups. 479 (66%) of 731 cases clustered with others that were indistinguishable by point mutations; individual clusters included multiple age groups and persisted for up to 2·3 years, and AMR determinants were invariant within clusters. Enteric fever was associated with locally established pathogen variants that circulate across age groups. AMR infections resulted from local transmission of resistant strains. These results form a baseline against which to monitor the impacts of control measures.

        "abstract": "In 2019, following a large outbreak of typhoid fever, the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care conducted a typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) vaccination campaign in nine high-risk suburbs of Harare. We aimed to evaluate TCV vaccination coverage, vaccine perceptions, and adverse events reported after vaccination. We conducted a two-stage cluster survey to estimate vaccination coverage in the campaign target areas among children aged 6 months-15 years and to classify coverage as either adequate (≥75 % coverage) or inadequate (<75 % coverage) among adults aged 16-45 years in one suburb. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographic factors, TCV vaccination history, reasons for receiving or not receiving TCV, adverse events following immunization, and knowledge and attitudes regarding typhoid and TCV. A total of 1,917 children from 951 households and 298 adults from 135 households enrolled in the survey. Weighted TCV coverage among all children aged 6 months-15 years was 85.3 % (95 % CI: 82.1 %-88.0 %); coverage was 74.8 % (95 % CI: 69.4 %-79.5 %) among children aged 6 months-4 years and 89.3 % (95 % CI: 86.2 %-91.7 %) among children aged 5-15 years. Among adults, TCV coverage was classified as inadequate with a 95 % confidence interval of 55.0 %-73.1 %. Among vaccinated persons, the most reported reason for receiving TCV (96 % across all age groups) was protection from typhoid fever; the most common reasons for non-vaccination were not being in Harare during the vaccination campaign and not being aware of the campaign. Adverse events were infrequently reported in all age groups (10 %) and no serious events were reported. The 2019 TCV campaign achieved high coverage among school-aged children (5-15 years). Strategies to increase vaccination coverage should be explored for younger children as part of Zimbabwe's integration of TCV into the routine immunization program, and for adults during future post-outbreak campaigns.",

The causes of abdominal pain in women of childbearing age range from benign and temporary to potentially life threatening. Rare etiologies such as spontaneous ruptured endometrioma are often not included in the radar of diagnosis due to their rarity and non-specific signs and symptoms in the patient. This case report aimed to show a resemblance between the clinical symptoms of acute abdomen in diffuse peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation and spontaneous ruptured endometrioma. A 42-year-old woman presented to our hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of fever for two weeks. She came from a tropical rural area where typhoid fever is common. She was advised to undergo emergency laparotomy because of the suspicion of diffuse peritonitis due to a hollow viscus perforation due to typhoid infection. Because of acute abdominal pain, a vertical incision was made to explore her abdominal cavity, and chocolate-like fluid and ovarian cysts were found during surgery. The diagnosis was changed to diffuse peritonitis due to spontaneous rupture of the endometrioma bilaterally. This case suggests that the exact diagnosis and cause of abdominal pain varies. As the current gold standard for endometrioma is laparoscopy, surgeons must prepare a collaborative approach to the cause of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious threat to the clinical management of typhoid fever. AMR in Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) is commonly associated with the H58 lineage, a lineage that arose comparatively recently before becoming globally disseminated. To better understand when and how H58 emerged and became dominant, we performed detailed phylogenetic analyses on contemporary genome sequences from S. Typhi isolated in the period spanning the emergence. Our dataset, which contains the earliest described H58 S. Typhi organism, indicates that ancestral H58 organisms were already multi-drug resistant (MDR). These organisms emerged spontaneously in India in 1987 and became radially distributed throughout South Asia and then globally in the ensuing years. These early organisms were associated with a single long branch, possessing mutations associated with increased bile tolerance, suggesting that the first H58 organism was generated during chronic carriage. The subsequent use of fluoroquinolones led to several independent mutations in gyrA. The ability of H58 to acquire and maintain AMR genes continues to pose a threat, as extensively drug-resistant (XDR; MDR plus resistance to ciprofloxacin and third generation cephalosporins) variants, have emerged recently in this lineage. Understanding where and how H58 S. Typhi originated and became successful is key to understand how AMR drives successful lineages of bacterial pathogens. Additionally, these data can inform optimal targeting of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) for reducing the potential for emergence and the impact of new drug-resistant variants. Emphasis should also be placed upon the prospective identification and treatment of chronic carriers to prevent the emergence of new drug resistant variants with the ability to spread efficiently.",

The availability of newer imaging modalities has also improved the detection of new cases. Salmonellosis is an uncommon etiology in iliopsoas abscess and sacroiliitis. Most cases reported in the literature are associated with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci species, and Escherichia coli. Diabetes, hematological malignancies, HIV, and other immunocompromised states are important comorbidities/risk factors for iliopsoas abscess. We report a case of an 18-year-old male who presented with a history of fever and right hip pain for 10 days. Radioimaging revealed right sacroiliitis and iliopsoas abscess. Blood culture revealed pan-sensitive Salmonella typhi. After the prolonged course of antibiotics (intravenous ceftriaxone followed by oral levofloxacin), the patient improved with no further relapse in symptoms. Salmonella typhi should be an important differential of iliopsoas abscess in endemic regions after ruling out the common etiology such as S. aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar typhi, presents a substantial global health threat, particularly in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. The rise of multidrug-resistant strains of S. typhi exacerbates this challenge, severely compromising conventional treatment efficacy due to over activity of efflux pumps. In our study, a comprehensive exploration of two fundamental aspects to combat MDR in S. typhi is carried out; i.e. employing advanced bioinformatics analyses and AlphaFold AI, We successfully identified and characterised a putative homologue, ABC-TPA, reminiscent of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) known for its role in multidrug resistance in diverse pathogens. This discovery provides a critical foundation for understanding the potential mechanisms driving antibiotic resistance in S. typhi. Furthermore, employing computational methodologies, We meticulously assessed the potential of lignans, specifically Schisandrin A, B, and C, as promising Efflux Pump Inhibitors (EPIs) against the identified P-gp homologue in S. typhi. Noteworthy findings revealed robust binding interactions of Schisandrin A and B with the target protein, indicating substantial inhibitory capabilities. In contrast, Schisandrin C exhibited instability, showing varied effectiveness among the evaluated lignans. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity predictions underscored the favourable attributes of Schisandrin A, including prolonged action duration. Furthermore, high systemic stability and demanished toxicity profile of SA and SB present their therapeutic efficacy against MDR. This comprehensive investigation not only elucidates potential therapeutic strategies against MDR strains of S. typhi but also highlights the relevance of computational approaches in identifying and evaluating promising candidates. These findings lay a robust foundation for future empirical studies to address the formidable challenges antibiotic resistance poses in this clinically significant infectious diseases.",

New means of prevention became available with the prequalification of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018. Policymakers require evidence to inform decisions about TCV. The economic burden related to typhoid fever can be considerable, both for healthcare providers and households, and should be accounted for in the decision-making process. We aimed to understand the breadth of the evidence on the cost of typhoid fever by undertaking a scoping review of the published literature. We searched scientific databases with terms referring to typhoid fever cost of illness to identify published studies for the period January 1st 2000 to May 24th 2024. We also conferred with stakeholders engaged in typhoid research to identify studies pending completion or publication. We identified 13 published studies reporting empirical data for 11 countries, most of them located in Asia. The total cost of a typhoid episode ranged from $23 in India to $884 in Indonesia (current 2022 United States Dollar [USD]). Household expenditures related to typhoid fever were characterized as catastrophic in 9 studies. We identified 5 studies pending completion or publication, which will provide evidence for 9 countries, most of them located in Africa. Alignment in study characteristics and methods would increase the usefulness of the evidence generated and facilitate cross-country and regional comparison. The gap in evidence across regions should be mitigated when studies undertaken in African countries are published. There remains a lack of evidence on the cost to treat typhoid in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance. Decision-makers should consider the available evidence on the economic burden of typhoid, particularly as risk factors related to antimicrobial resistance and climate change increase typhoid risk. Additional studies should address typhoid illness costs, using standardized methods and accounting for the costs of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) causes severe and occasionally life-threatening disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water. Humans are the only reservoir, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure increases risk of typhoid. High-quality data to assess spatial and temporal relationships in disease dynamics are scarce. We analyzed data from a prospective cohort conducted in an urban slum area of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Passive surveillance at study centers identified typhoid cases by microbiological culture. Each incident case (index case) was matched to two randomly selected index controls, and we measured typhoid incidence in the population residing in a geographically defined region surrounding each case and control. Spatial clustering was evaluated by comparing the typhoid incidence in residents of geometric rings of increasing radii surrounding the index cases and controls over 28 days. Temporal clustering was evaluated by separately measuring incidence in the first and second 14-day periods following selection. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated using Poisson regression models. We evaluated 141 typhoid index cases. The overall typhoid incidence was 0.44 per 100,000 person-days (PDs) (95% CI: 0.40, 0.49). In the 28 days following selection, the highest typhoid incidence (1.2 per 100,000 PDs [95% CI: 0.8, 1.6]) was in the innermost cluster surrounding index cases. The IRR in this innermost cluster was 4.9 (95% CI: 2.4, 10.3) relative to the innermost control clusters. Neither typhoid incidence rates nor relative IRR between index case and control populations showed substantive differences in the first and second 14-day periods after selection. In the absence of routine immunization programs, geographic clustering of typhoid cases suggests a higher intensity of typhoid risk in the population immediately surrounding identified cases. Further studies are needed to understand spatial and temporal trends and to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted vaccination in disrupting typhoid transmission.",

        "abstract": "The scarcity of epidemiological data on acute febrile illnesses from South Asia impairs evidence-based clinical decision-making. Our study aimed to explore the etiological spectrum of short-duration fever in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in West Bengal, India. We conducted a cross-sectional study from May 2021 to April 2022 involving 150 adult patients presenting with a fever lasting less than two weeks at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital (West Bengal, India). We performed comprehensive clinical assessments, including microbiological, serological, and other specific investigations, to identify the causes of the fever. The demographic profile predominantly included individuals aged 21-40 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.9:1; 60.7% of participants were from rural areas. The primary etiological agents identified were scrub typhus (25.3%), dengue (15.3%), and enteric fever (13.3%). Notably, 80% of patients presented with non-localizing symptoms, while 14.7% had respiratory symptoms. Blood cultures pinpointed Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus in a minority of cases (3.3%); malaria, primarily Plasmodium vivax, was diagnosed in 12% of the cases. Our findings highlight the complexity of diagnosing short-duration fevers, dominated by a wide range of etiological agents, with a notable prevalence of scrub typhus. These results underscore the urgent need for enhanced diagnostic facilities, including the availability of scrub typhus testing at primary healthcare centers. We recommend empirical doxycycline therapy for suspected cases and emphasize the need for further research to develop management guidelines for acute febrile illnesses. This study also highlights the importance of raising both community and clinician awareness to prevent irrational antibiotic use.",

        "abstract": "To explore the feasibility of linking data from enhanced surveillance patient questionnaires from each enteric fever case in England with genome sequencing data, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, from the corresponding isolate of typhoidal salmonellae. After linking data we interrogated the merged dataset and assessed the utility of passive surveillance data to match and monitor antimicrobial treatment regimens in enteric fever patients with the AMR profiles of the infectious agent. A high proportion of cases were given antibiotics (n = 1230/1415; 86.9%); half of the cases stated the class of antibiotic they were given (n = 630/1239) and half were prescribed cephalosporins (n = 316/630). Reported treatment with a combination of antibiotics increased with symptom severity. Nearly half of isolates (n = 644/1415; 45.5%) had mutations conferring resistance to ciprofloxacin. Based on genome-derived AMR profiles, typhoidal salmonellae isolates inferred to be susceptible to the recommended first-line antimicrobials were twice as likely to be isolated from individuals residing in the least deprived areas compared with the most deprived (n = 26/169; 15.4% versus n = 32/442; 7.2%). Due to the high proportion of missing data obtained from patient interviews, we recommend a more transparent and systematic approach to recording the antibiotic prescription details by healthcare professionals in primary and secondary care. A more robust approach to data capture at this point in the care pathway would enable us to audit inconsistencies in the prescribing algorithms across England and ensure equitable treatment across all sections of society. Integrating prescribing data with the genome-derived AMR profiles of the causative agent at the individual patient level provides an opportunity to monitor the impact of treatment on clinical outcomes, and to promote best practice in real time.",

In highly endemic areas, children are disproportionately affected, and antimicrobial resistance reduces therapeutic options. It is estimated that 2-5% of enteric fever patients develop chronic asymptomatic infection. These carriers may act as reservoirs of infection; therefore, the prospective identification and treatment of carriers are critical for long-term disease control. We aimed to find the frequency of Salmonella Typhi carriers in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. We also compared the detection limit of culturing versus qPCR in detecting S. Typhi, performed a geospatial analysis of the carriers identified using this study, and evaluated the accuracy of anti-Vi and anti-YncE in identifying chronic typhoid carriage. We performed a cross-sectional study in two centers in Pakistan. Gallbladder specimens were subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and serum samples were analyzed for IgG against YncE and Vi by ELISA. We also mapped the residential location of those with a positive qPCR result. Out of 988 participants, 3.4% had qPCR-positive gallbladder samples (23 S. Typhi and 11 S. Paratyphi). Gallstones were more likely to be qPCR positive than bile and gallbladder tissue. Anti-Vi and YncE were significantly correlated (r = 0.78 p<0.0001) and elevated among carriers as compared to qPCR negative controls, except for anti-Vi response in Paratyphi A. But the discriminatory values of these antigens in identifying carriers from qPCR negative controls were low. The high prevalence of typhoid carriers observed in this study suggests that further studies are required to gain information that will help in controlling future typhoid outbreaks in a superior manner than they are currently being managed.",

Studying the epidemiological patterns of these diseases in various provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) and examining potential influencing factors can provide crucial information for implementing successful control strategies. In this study, we analyzed the cases and incidence rates of typhoid/paratyphoid fever reported in various PLADs of China from 2011 to 2022, along with exploring potential influencing factors. We initially studied spatial shifts in the incidence rates through centroid shift analysis. Seasonal variations in typhoid/paratyphoid fever onset were examined using heatmaps. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was utilized to understand the spatial correlations among different PLADs. To assess potential factors, we utilized a generalized estimating equations model that integrated spatial lag effects and sequence comparison analysis. The study identified significant geographical clustering of typhoid/paratyphoid fever cases in southwestern China. A decrease in incidence rates in the west resulted in a movement of the disease center towards the east. Higher incidence occurred during warmer seasons, highlighting the seasonal pattern of the diseases. Factors such as meteorological conditions and socioeconomic status were probable influencers of typhoid/paratyphoid fever. The geographical and temporal spread of typhoid/paratyphoid fever can be impacted by meteorological and socioeconomic factors.

        "abstract": "None of the typhoid Vi Polysaccharide (ViPS) subunit vaccines incorporate adjuvants, and the immunogenicity of ViPS vaccines (e.g. Typbar TCV<sup>®</sup> and Typhim Vi<sup>®</sup>) is in part due to associated TLR4 ligands such as endotoxin present in these vaccines. Since endotoxin content in vaccines is variable and kept very low due to inherent toxicity, it was hypothesized that incorporating a defined amount of a non-toxic TLR4-ligand such as monophosphoryl lipid A in ViPS vaccines would improve their immunogenicity. To test this hypothesis, a monophosphoryl lipid A-based adjuvant formulation named Turbo was developed. Admixing Turbo with Typbar TCV<sup>®</sup> (ViPS-conjugated to tetanus toxoid) increased the levels of anti-ViPS IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2a/c, and IgG3 in inbred and outbred mice. In infant mice, a single immunization with Turbo adjuvanted Typbar TCV<sup>®</sup> resulted in a significantly increased and durable IgG response and improved the control of bacterial burden compared to mice immunized without Turbo. Similarly, when adjuvanted with Turbo, the antibody response and control of bacteremia were also improved in mice immunized with Typhim Vi<sup>®</sup>, an unconjugated vaccine. The immunogenicity of unconjugated ViPS is inefficient in young mice and is lost in adult mice when immunostimulatory ligands in ViPS are removed. Nevertheless, when adjuvanted with Turbo, poorly immunogenic ViPS induced a robust IgG response in young and adult mice, and this was observed even under antigen-limiting conditions. These data suggest that incorporation of Turbo as an adjuvant will make typhoid vaccines more immunogenic regardless of their intrinsic immunogenicity or conjugation status and maximize the efficacy across all ages.",

        "abstract": "Pakistan has been experiencing an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) outbreak of typhoid for some years. We sought to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted typhoid epidemiology in Pakistan, from the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 through the end of 2022, and the reduction of COVID-19 cases. We compared national public COVID-19 data with retrospectively obtained patient data of confirmed S. Typhi isolates between January 2019 and December 2022 from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre and the hospital's extended network of laboratory collection centers across Pakistan. We observed that during the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 peaks, typhoid positivity generally decreased. This suggests that restrictions and non-pharmaceutical interventions that limited social interactions and promoted good sanitation and hygiene practices had a positive secondary effect on typhoid. This led to an overall yearly decrease in typhoid positivity between 2019 to 2021. However, the percentage of S. Typhi cases isolated that were ceftriaxone-resistant continued to increase, suggesting the continued dominance of XDR typhoid in Pakistan. In 2022, with the alleviation of pandemic restrictions, we observed increased typhoid positivity and COVID-19 and typhoid positivity started to follow similar trends. Given the continued presence of COVID-19 along with XDR typhoid in Pakistan, it will be imperative to use differential testing to ensure that the epidemiology of each reported is accurate, the spread of each it contained, and that antibiotics are not misused. The use of approved vaccinations will lessen the burden of both diseases.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is the causative agent of Typhoid fever. Blood culture is the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, but this is often difficult to employ in resource limited settings. Environmental surveillance of waste-impacted waters is a promising supplement to clinical surveillance, however validating methods is challenging in regions where S. Typhi concentrations are low. To evaluate existing S. Typhi environmental surveillance methods, a novel process control organism (PCO) was created as a biosafe surrogate. Using a previous described qPCR assay, a modified PCR amplicon for the staG gene was cloned into E. coli. We developed a target region that was recognized by the Typhoid primers in addition to a non-coding internal probe sequence. A multiplex qPCR reaction was developed that differentiates between the typhoid and control targets, with no cross-reactivity or inhibition of the two probes. The PCO was shown to mimic S. Typhi in lab-based experiments with concentration methods using primary wastewater: filter cartridge, recirculating Moore swabs, membrane filtration, and differential centrifugation. Across all methods, the PCO seeded at 10 CFU/mL and 100 CFU/mL was detected in 100% of replicates. The PCO is detected at similar quantification cycle (Cq) values across all methods at 10 CFU/mL (Average = 32.4, STDEV = 1.62). The PCO was also seeded into wastewater at collection sites in Vellore (India) and Blantyre (Malawi) where S. Typhi is endemic. All methods tested in both countries were positive for the seeded PCO. The PCO is an effective way to validate performance of environmental surveillance methods targeting S. Typhi in surface water.",

This study delves into the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella Typhi, uncovering the genetic underpinnings of its resistance. Analyzing 897 suspected cases, we identified a significant prevalence of typhoid fever, predominantly in males (58.3 %) and younger demographics. Alarmingly, our data reveals an escalation in resistance to both primary and secondary antibiotics, with cases of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S. Typhi reaching 14.7 % and 43.4 %, respectively, in 2021. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index exceeded 0.2 in over half of the isolates, signaling widespread antibiotic misuse. The study discerned 47 unique antibiotic resistance patterns and pinpointed carbapenem and macrolide antibiotics as the remaining effective treatments against XDR strains, underlining the critical need to preserve these drugs for severe cases. Molecular examinations identified bla<sub>TEM</sub>, bla<sub>SHV</sub>, and bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> genes in ceftriaxone-resistant strains, while qnrS was specific to ciprofloxacin-resistant variants. Notably, all examined strains exhibited a singular mutation in the gyrA gene, maintaining wild-type gyrB and parC genes. The erm(B) gene emerged as the primary determinant of azithromycin resistance. Furthermore, a distressing increase in resistance genes was observed over three years, with erm(B), bla<sub>TEM</sub> and qnrS showing significant upward trends. These findings are a clarion call for robust antimicrobial stewardship programs to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use and forestall the burgeoning threat of antibiotic resistance in S. Typhi.",

        "abstract": "Dahuang Huanglian Xiexin Decoction (XXD), derived from Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Typhoid Fever, has a long history of medicinal use and is widely used for digestive system diseases. It is mainly composed of three natural medicines, including Dahuang (Rheum palmatum L.), Huanglian (Coptis chinensis Franch.), and Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi). Modern pharmacological research shows that the active ingredients of XXD can have a positive effect on intestinal flora regulatory effect, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Clarify the effect of XXD on regulating dysbiosis, and elucidate the mechanism of XXD in alleviating dysbiosis based on network pharmacology, molecular docking and experimental verification. Histopathological observation and intestinal high-throughput sequencing were used to observe the effect. Preliminary prediction of the mechanism of action of XXD in treating dysbiosis through network pharmacology and molecular docking. Finally, the effect of XXD on the IL-17 signaling pathway was verified through in vivo experiments. Histopathology and high-throughput sequencing of intestinal flora indicated that XXD has a good regulatory effect on bacterial dysbiosis. At the same time, network pharmacology identified a total of 40 active compounds, 14 of which may be key compounds for XXD to treat dysbiosis. In addition, the study also revealed 14 potential key targets as well as the top 5 therapeutic targets: IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, TP53 and PTGS2. GO and KEGG predicted the key pathway for IL-17 signaling pathway to play a role in XXD. In the verification of the prediction results, it was found that the above targets and the IL-17 target showed strong activity in molecular docking. Furthermore, it was found that XXD can reduce the levels of IL-17, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, p53 and COX-2 in serum, while inhibiting the expression of IL-17, IL-17RA, Act-1 and NF-κB protein and the mRNA expression of IL-17, IL-17RA and Act-1 in colon tissue. This study found that XXD has a good regulatory effect on dysbiosis and its induced symptoms. Network pharmacology was used to predict the key compounds and therapeutic targets of XXD, and preliminary experiments confirmed that XXD may regulate bacterial dysbiosis by inhibiting the IL-17 signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "Background Typhoid fever presents a significant challenge in developing nations, exacerbated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains due to widespread prevalence and overuse of antibiotics. This study seeks to assess the antibiogram profiles of Salmonella species isolated from blood cultures of patients hospitalized at two prominent tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar, Pakistan: Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) and Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC). By examining these profiles, the research aims to provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape of antibiotic resistance in the context of typhoid fever management. Materials and Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized data gathered from two hospitals in Peshawar, KTH and HMC. Cases of enteric fever were identified based on positive blood cultures for Salmonella species. The study encompasses demographic information, seasonal prevalence, and antibiogram profiles of 3,137 cases that were presented between 2017 and 2023. Results Among the total 3,137 cases, males accounted for the majority, comprising 63% (2,044 cases). Particularly notable was the clustering of cases among children and adolescents aged one to 24 years. The incidence peaked during the months of summer and spring, from April to September. In terms of Salmonella Typhi isolates, considerable resistance was noted against first-line antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate (80.1%), co-trimoxazole/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (66.6%), and chloramphenicol (86.9%), as well as against ceftriaxone (79.7%) and ciprofloxacin (51.6%). Conversely, certain antibiotics displayed higher sensitivity patterns, including meropenem (97.8%), doripenem (99.5%), imipenem (97.7%), ertapenem (96.5%), polymyxin B (99.4%), colistin (98.1%), and tigecycline (97.3%). Despite a limited sample size of 214 specimens, fosfomycin demonstrated a remarkable sensitivity of 93.4%. Sensitivities of amikacin and gentamicin were 90.7% and 81.5%, respectively. However, the sensitivity of azithromycin was concerning, standing at 66.5%. The antibiogram pattern for Salmonella exhibited significant and drastic changes. Conclusion In conclusion, this study sheds light on a higher prevalence of typhoid fever among males, with a notable seasonal peak observed during the summer and spring months. The age group most affected spans from one to 24 years. Salmonella isolates displayed significant resistance to conventional first-line antibiotics, alongside ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins. Azithromycin exhibited lower sensitivity compared to amikacin, gentamicin, and fosfomycin. The research advocates for the empirical use of amikacin, gentamicin, fosfomycin, and meropenem in the treatment of typhoid fever in Pakistan. Urgent measures, including regular Salmonella antibiogram surveillance, antibiotic stewardship, public health education, and Salmonella vaccination programs, are deemed crucial for primary disease prevention.",

Each year, thousands of Poles travel internationally, and many travel to tropical or subtropical destinations in Asia, Africa or South America. The aim of this article was to describe the characteristics of Polish travellers based on the information from a retrospective 12-month review of the medical records of Polish patients seeking pre-travel advice at the largest diagnostic and treatment travel medicine centre in Poland in 2023. The retrospective study was based on the analysis of medical records of 2,147 patients seeking pre-travel advice at the University Centre of Maritime and Tropical Medicine in Gdynia, Poland, between January and December 2023. The study focused on the analysis of the following patients' variables: age, sex, travel details (purpose of travel, length of travel, departure month, continents and countries to be visited). It also aimed to evaluate the range of prevention measures which were either recommended or administered to patients seeking pre-travel advice at the clinic (preventive vaccinations, chemoprophylaxis). In addition, it assessed the health status of the patients presenting at the travel medicine clinic; retrospective health assessments were based on the information from the interviews with the patients. Patients who sought pre-travel advice were mostly aged 36-65 years (49.5%), they were travelling for tourism purposes (78.3%), for a maximum period of 4 weeks (79.0%), mostly in November (15.2%) or in January (14.9%). Most travellers planned to visit Asia (55.5%) or Africa (29.0%); mainly Thailand (21.5%), Vietnam (8.5%), Kenya (8.3%) or India (8.2%). The most frequently administered immunoprophylaxis included vaccinations against typhoid fever and hepatitis A. Other commonly recommended/prescribed prevention measures included: insect repellents (69.3%), sunscreen (58.3%), antimalarials (35.8%), antithrombotic drugs (32.6%), and antidiarrheal drugs (25.6%). The analysis of patient interviews demonstrated that 61.8% of the travellers consulted at the clinic had no pre-existing medical conditions, while 38.2% required the use of chronic medications, mainly for allergies (14.3%), thyroid disorders (13.6%), cardiovascular diseases (9.3%), or psychiatric disorders (5.5%). A large number of Polish travellers visit destinations where the risk of infectious and non-infectious diseases is high. Providing patients with professional advice during a pre-travel consultation will help protect against travel-associated health problems.",

Analysis of a retrospective case series from a tertiary pediatric center (2015-2019), augmented by public health notification and microbiological laboratory data (2018-2019), from Western Sydney, Australia, a region with frequent travel links to South Asia. Eighty-nine (89) patients were diagnosed with enteric fever, including 43 children with complete demographic and travel data. Enteric fever cases increased over time (by 4.9 % per year) and incidence was three times higher in the pediatric population (<15 years old) compared to adults. Travel to India and visiting friends and relatives (VFR) travel were risk factors. Few children received enteric fever vaccination prior to travel, as pre-travel advice most commonly was not sought. Children visiting relatives in high-incidence countries are increasingly at risk for enteric fever, particularly when travelling to South Asia. Targeted health advice to travelers visiting friends and relatives is warranted to mitigate the healthcare burden of enteric fever in low-incidence settings.",

Typhi) has spread globally, fluoroquinolone resistance has mainly affected Asia. Consecutively, 1038 blood cultures were obtained from patients of all age groups with fever and/or suspicion of serious systemic infection admitted at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar in 2015-2016. S. Typhi were analyzed with antimicrobial susceptibility testing and with short read (61 strains) and long read (9 strains) whole genome sequencing, including three S. Typhi strains isolated in a pilot study 2012-2013. Sixty-three S. Typhi isolates (98%) were MDR carrying blaTEM-1B, sul1 and sul2, dfrA7 and catA1 genes. Low-level ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 69% (43/62), with a single gyrase mutation gyrA-D87G in 41 strains, and a single gyrA-S83F mutation in the non-MDR strain. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and azithromycin. All MDR isolates belonged to genotype 4.3.1 lineage I (4.3.1.1), with the antimicrobial resistance determinants located on a composite transposon integrated into the chromosome. Phylogenetically, the MDR subgroup with ciprofloxacin resistance clusters together with two external isolates. We report a high rate of MDR and low-level ciprofloxacin resistant S. Typhi circulating in Zanzibar, belonging to genotype 4.3.1.1, which is widespread in Southeast Asia and African countries and associated with low-level ciprofloxacin resistance. Few therapeutic options are available for treatment of typhoid fever in the study setting. Surveillance of the prevalence, spread and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. Typhi can guide treatment and control efforts.",

Botkin during the siege of Leningrad (from September 8, 1941 to January 27, 1944). The structure of diseases of the deceased varied during different periods of the siege of Leningrad. In the first period (September-December 1941), diphtheria, dysentery, measles, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever prevailed among the diseases. The most common causes of death in the second period (April-December 1942) were typhus, dysentery, tuberculosis, lobar pneumonia, and typhoid fever. Nosological structure in the third period of the blockade (January 1943 - January 1944): tuberculosis, dysentery, cachexia, lobar pneumonia, infectious jaundice. The discrepancy between clinical and morphological diagnoses is most often noted for the following nosology: pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever, pneumonia, stomach and hepatopancreatobiliary cancer, measles, influenza. The first period of the blockade was distinguished by a high specific proportion of examination of children's bodies - 51.2% of all autopsies; in subsequent periods, the specific share of autopsies of deceased adults (20-59 years) increased to 76.2%. The difference in the nosological structure and age groups of those who died during different periods of the siege of Leningrad was determined by the epidemiological situation in the city, social and living conditions and medical and organizational factors. Conducted in the pathological-anatomical department of the hospital named after. S.P. Botkin during the siege of Leningrad, pathological studies made it possible to timely establish the causes of deaths and identify the peculiarities of the course of infectious diseases against the background of cachexia.

Associated disease-related complications and drug resistance further compound this problem. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon complication of enteric fever with high morbidity and mortality. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in enteric fever-associated HLH syndrome. We searched major electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus) to identify the cases of enteric fever associated with HLH from inception until June 2023. Prespecified data regarding clinical presentation, outcomes, and HLH therapy were collected. A total of 53 cases of enteric fever with HLH were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients was 20 years, and the proportions of female and pediatric patients were 52.8% and 45.3%, respectively. The mean duration of illness was 10.4 days. A total of 39.6% of patients had enteric fever-associated complications; coagulopathy and encephalopathy were the most common (23.1% and 13.5%). The overall mortality rate was 9.4% in HLH. A total of 51% of patients received HLH-specific therapy (corticosteroids in 41.5% and intravenous immunoglobulin in 20.8% of patients). On multivariate analysis, high ferritin levels (≥5,000 ng/mL) were significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 3.01; 95% CI = 0.62-14.12, P = 0.041). Enteric fever with secondary HLH is associated with high mortality. This review reveals the potential role of ferritin in disease prognosis. In cases with significantly elevated ferritin levels, the role of immunosuppressants or combination antibiotics should be explored.",

We present results from, to our knowledge, the first ever human study of a bivalent paratyphoid A-typhoid conjugate vaccine (Sii-PTCV). In this double-blind phase 1 study, 60 healthy Indian adults were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single intramuscular dose of either Sii-PTCV or typhoid conjugate vaccine (Typbar-TCV). Safety was assessed by observing solicited adverse events for 1 week, unsolicited events for 1 month, and serious adverse events (SAEs) over 6 months. Immunogenicity at 1 month and 6 months was assessed by measuring anti-capsular polysaccharide antigen Vi (anti-Vi) IgG and IgA against Salmonella Typhi and anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) IgG against Salmonella Paratyphi A by ELISA, and functional antibodies using serum bactericidal assay (SBA) against Salmonella Paratyphi A. This study is registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2022/06/043608) and is completed. 60 participants were enrolled. Of these 60 participants, 57 (95%) participants were male and three (5%) participants were female. Solicited adverse events were observed in 27 (90%) of 30 participants who received Sii-PTCV and 26 (87%) of 30 participants who received Typbar-TCV. The most common local solicited event was pain in 27 (90%) participants who received Sii-PTCV and in 23 (77%) participants who received Typbar-TCV. The most common solicited systemic event was myalgia in five (17%) participants who received Sii-PTCV, whereas four (13%) participants who received Typbar-TCV had myalgia and four (13%) had headache. No vaccine-related unsolicited adverse events or SAEs were reported. The seroconversion rates on day 29 were 96·7% (95% CI 82·8-99·9) with Sii-PTCV and 100·0% (88·4-100·0) with Typbar-TCV for anti-Vi IgG; 93·3% (77·9-99·2) with Sii-PTCV and 100·0% (88·4-100·0) with Typbar-TCV for anti-Vi IgA; 100·0% (88·4-100·0) with Sii-PTCV and 3·3% (0·1-17·2) with Typbar-TCV for anti-LPS (paratyphoid); and 93·3% (77·9-99·2) with Sii-PTCV and 0% (0·0-11·6) with Typbar-TCV for SBA titres (paratyphoid). Paratyphoid anti-LPS immune responses were sustained at day 181.

Currently, data on TIP in Western databases are primarily from countries that speak English, likely due to non-English publication and citation biases. Despite the high burden of infectious diseases in Francophone Africa, data from these countries regarding TIP remain limited. This study aims to highlight the incidence and morbidity of TIP in Francophone African countries using an extended search algorithm. We conducted a scoping review using the PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases with the keywords \"peritonitis\", \"non-traumatic ileal perforation\", and \"typhoid\" in Francophone African countries. Additionally, we contacted surgeons in Africa and concurrently used citation chasing to obtain data not found in western databases. In total, 32 studies from 12 countries were identified and included in this review. A total of 22 publications were in French. Patient median age was 20 years and TIP caused a median of 35% of acute peritonitis cases. Mortality rates ranged from 6-37% (median: 16%). Rate of complications ranged from 15-92% (median: 46%). Ileostomy creation as a treatment for TIP varied between hospitals (0-79%), with the highest rates reported in Niger. In Francophone Africa, TIP is associated with high morbidity and mortality, most commonly in children and young adults.

The government of Bangladesh plans to introduce typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) in its expanded program on immunization (EPI) schedule. However, the optimal introduction strategy in addition to the costs and benefits of such a program are unclear. We extended an existing mathematical model of typhoid transmission to integrate cost data, clinical incidence data, and recently conducted serosurveys in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the status quo (i.e., no vaccination) and eight vaccine introduction strategies including routine and 1-time campaign strategies, which differed by age groups targeted and geographic focus. Model outcomes included clinical incidence, seroincidence, deaths, costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each strategy. We adopted a societal perspective, 10-year model time horizon, and 3 % annual discount rate. We performed probabilistic, one-way, and scenario sensitivity analyses including adopting a healthcare perspective and alternate model time horizons. We projected that all TCV strategies would be cost saving compared to the status quo. The preferred strategy was a nationwide introduction of TCV at 9-12 months of age with a single catch-up campaign for children ages 1-15, which was cost saving compared to all other strategies and the status quo. In the 10 years following implementation, we projected this strategy would avert 3.77 million cases (95 % CrI: 2.60 - 5.18), 11.31 thousand deaths (95 % CrI: 3.77 - 23.60), and save $172.35 million (95 % CrI: -14.29 - 460.59) compared to the status quo. Our findings were broadly robust to changes in parameter values and willingness-to-pay thresholds. We projected that nationwide TCV introduction with a catch-up campaign would substantially reduce typhoid incidence and very likely be cost saving in Bangladesh.",

Although anti-pathogenic drugs have been widely used, they carry a constant threat of selecting for resistance. Vaccines offer a promising means by which to enhance the global control of tropical infectious diseases; however, these have been difficult to develop, mostly because of the complex nature of the pathogen lifecycles. Here, we present recently developed vaccine candidates for five tropical infectious diseases in the form of a catalog that have either entered clinical trials or have been licensed for use. We deliberate on recently licensed dengue vaccines, provide evidence why combination vaccination could have a synergistic impact on schistosomiasis, critically appraise the value of typhoid conjugate vaccines, and discuss the potential of vaccines in the efforts to eliminate vivax malaria and hookworms.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid Fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income settings. The Severe Typhoid in Africa programme was designed to address regional gaps in typhoid burden data and identify populations eligible for interventions using novel typhoid conjugate vaccines. A hybrid design, hospital-based prospective surveillance with population-based health-care utilisation surveys, was implemented in six countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients presenting with fever (≥37·5°C axillary or ≥38·0°C tympanic) or reporting fever for three consecutive days within the previous 7 days were invited to participate. Typhoid fever was ascertained by culture of blood collected upon enrolment. Disease incidence at the population level was estimated using a Bayesian mixture model. 27 866 (33·8%) of 82 491 participants who met inclusion criteria were recruited. Blood cultures were performed for 27 544 (98·8%) of enrolled participants. Clinically significant organisms were detected in 2136 (7·7%) of these cultures, and 346 (16·2%) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi were isolated. The overall adjusted incidence per 100 000 person-years of observation was highest in Kavuaya and Nkandu 1, Democratic Republic of the Congo (315, 95% credible interval 254-390). Overall, 46 (16·4%) of 280 tested isolates showed ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility. High disease incidence (ie, >100 per 100 000 person-years of observation) recorded in four countries, the prevalence of typhoid hospitalisations and complicated disease, and the threat of resistant typhoid strains strengthen the need for rapid dispatch and implementation of effective typhoid conjugate vaccines along with measures designed to improve clean water, sanitation, and hygiene practices.

        "title": "Efficacy of typhoid vaccines against culture-confirmed Salmonella Typhi in typhoid endemic countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Typhoid is a serious public health threat in many low-income and middle-income countries. Several vaccines for typhoid have been recommended by WHO for typhoid prevention in endemic countries. This study aimed to review the efficacy of typhoid vaccines against culture-confirmed Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase for studies published in English between Jan 1, 1986 and Nov 2, 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing typhoid vaccines with a placebo or another vaccine. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of several typhoid vaccines, including live attenuated oral Ty21a vaccine, Vi capsular polysaccharide (Vi-PS), Vi polysaccharide conjugated to recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A vaccine (Vi-rEPA), and Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (TCV). The certainty of evidence for key outcomes was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The outcome of interest was typhoid fever confirmed by the isolation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in blood and adverse events following immunisation. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021241043). We included 14 RCTs assessing four different vaccines (Ty21a: four trials; Vi-PS: five trials; Vi-rEPA: one trial; TCV: four trials) involving 585 253 participants. All trials were conducted in typhoid endemic countries and the age of participants ranged from 6 months to 50 years. The pooled efficacy against typhoid fever was 45% (95% CI 33-55%; four trials; 247 649 participants; I<sup>2</sup> 59%; moderate certainty) for Ty21a and 58% (44-69%; five trials; 214 456 participants; I<sup>2</sup> 34%; moderate certainty) for polysaccharide Vi-PS. The cumulative efficacy of two doses of Vi-rEPA vaccine at 2 years was 91% (88-96%; one trial; 12 008 participants; moderate certainty). The pooled efficacy of a single shot of TCV at 2 years post-immunisation was 83% (77-87%; four trials; 111 130 participants; I<sup>2</sup> 0%; moderate certainty). All vaccines were safe, with no serious adverse effects reported in the trials. The existing data from included trials provide promising results regarding the efficacy and safety of the four recommended typhoid vaccines. TCV and Vi-rEPA were found to have the highest efficacy at 2 years post-immunisation. However, follow-up data for Vi-rEPA are scarce and only TCV is pre-qualified by WHO. Therefore, roll-out of TCV into routine immunisation programmes in typhoid endemic settings is highly recommended. There was no funding source for this study.",
