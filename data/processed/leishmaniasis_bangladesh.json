        "abstract": "Home to a quarter of the global population, the World Health Organization's South-East Asia Region bears a substantial burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Identifying means to eliminate NTDs in these regions has been a flagship priority since 2014, with India, Nepal, and Bangladesh committed to eliminating Kala-azar or Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) sooner or by the end of 2026 (WHO, 2023a). In this context, vanillin-derived molecules are well established in inhibiting several kinases present in cancer cells and have high LD<sub>50</sub> values along with broad therapeutic window. In view of the demand of suitable oral candidate for controlling Leishmania parasitic proliferation in human body here, we are reporting ortho vanillin and l-Alanine amino acid derived ligand molecule t2-{(E)-[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methylidene] amino} propanoate (L) and its Cu(II) conjugates L<sub>1</sub> & L<sub>3</sub> as water-soluble, and nontoxic drug candidates for the treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis. In silico binding study against potential chemotherapeutic target MAP kinase (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, (PDB id: 4QNY) was undertaken and significant binding was shown by these molecules. Both compounds demonstrated significant inhibition of amastigote proliferation. For L. donovani, L<sub>1</sub> exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.544 μgml<sup>-1</sup> and L<sub>3</sub> an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.691 μgml<sup>-1</sup>. Against L. mexicana, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.750 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L<sub>1</sub> and 1.748 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L<sub>3</sub>. These results were comparable to the standard reference drug Amphotericin B, which exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.450 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L. donovani and 1.532 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L. mexicana. The toxicity studies were undertaken against macrophages THP-1 cell lines where the IC<sub>50</sub> value is quite higher in comparison to Amphotericin-B. Additionally, the potential of molecules was checked against PANC-1 cancer cell lines in comparison to normal HPNE cell lines. Both complexes caused double-strand DNA nicks, consistent with the higher cytotoxic activities observed in Cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the cell cycle results also confirmed that L<sub>1</sub> arrested (PANC-1) cells in the G1-S phase of the cell cycle followed by an increase in the sub-G1 phase. L<sub>1</sub>, has shown that the population of late/secondary cellular apoptotic cells increased from 2.35 % to 93.56 %, whereas the population of early/primary apoptotic cells increased from 0.13 % (control) to 12.08 %. These findings suggest that L<sub>1</sub> causes apoptosis, or cell death that is programmed.",

        "abstract": "Knockdown resistance alleles (kdr alleles) within the para voltage-gated sodium channel gene (Vgsc) are a common mechanism of DDT and pyrethroid resistance in insect vectors. In the primary Asian visceral leishmaniasis vector, Phlebotomus argentipes, two kdr alleles in codon 1014 of the Vgsc are associated with insecticide resistance, potentially presenting challenges to vector control efforts in the Indian subcontinent. Here, we screened Vgsc-1014 alleles and blood meal origin in P. argentipes females collected between September 2013 and August 2015 in Bangladesh (Mymensingh), to understand how Vgsc-1014 alleles could impact feeding patterns. The sand fly collection took place in parallel with the vector control agency's biannual indoor residual spraying (IRS) programme. In this region, the wild-type leucine (wt-leucine) was the most common allele (66.7%), followed by the mutant serine (19.4%) and phenylalanine alleles (13.9%). Only 55 sand fly blood meals (13%) came from humans, with most of bovine origin (61%). However, sand flies that had fed on humans showed strongly contrasting Vgsc-1014 genotypic frequencies compared to those feeding on other blood sources. Whilst most (81%) P. argentipes with human blood possessed kdr genotypes with two mutant alleles, most (81%) sand flies feeding on other blood sources possessed genotypes with wt-leucine alleles (P < 0.001). Significant spatial variation in kdr frequencies was detected, but there was no clear temporal trend nor effect of sampling year on any results, and no significant impact of recent IRS in any analyses. The association between human feeding and kdr alleles in parallel with pyrethroid spraying indicates a new mechanism of how kdr alleles might impact VL control programs.",

        "abstract": "Laboratory-established sand fly colonies provide important material for leishmaniasis research; however, the establishment and maintenance of such colonies can be complicated. In this study, a colony of Phlebotomus argentipes (P. argentipes) was established using wild-caught sand flies in Bangladesh by following standard procedures described in the published literature. The colony was initiated in a controlled laboratory environment. A total of 430 female P. argentipes sand flies were collected to develop the colony. Over multiple generations (F0 to F6), 1,034 P. argentipes sand flies laid eggs. The number of eggs that successfully emerged differed significantly between the wild-caught generation and other generations, except for the F1 and F6 generations. A significant difference was observed in the incubation period between wild-caught (F0) and laboratory-reared sand flies (F1 to F6). The mean mortality rate was highest in the first instar (13.9) and lowest in the pupae stage (1.9%). The development from pupae to adult sand flies was 98% successful. It was observed that the copulation was much more frequent after the females had taken a blood meal. This is the first successful attempt to colonize sand flies from Bangladesh in laboratory settings. The study's findings will contribute to a better understanding of the role of P. argentipes as a vector of Leishmania parasites in Bangladesh, as well as in the region. The colony can also be used for xenodiagnoses, insecticide resistance monitoring, and other experimental infections to generate the necessary evidence.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases that tend to thrive in developing regions of the world where inadequate access to healthcare makes it difficult for some people to even receive a diagnosis. This study examined the usefulness of oral swabs as specimens for VL diagnosis, by detecting <i>Leishmania donovani</i> DNA in oral swabs from both VL patients and <i>L. donovani</i>-infected mice. Eighty oral swab (OS) and blood buffy coat (BC) samples were collected from suspected VL cases in Bangladesh. These samples were evaluated using <i>Leishmania kinetoplast minicircle DNA</i> (<i>kDNA</i>) in real-time PCR, and the results showed that 62.5% (50/80) and 67.5% (54/80) of the cases tested positive for the BC specimen and OS, respectively. The OS positivity was statistically comparable to the BC. <i>L. donovani</i> DNA was also detected in an oral swab of all infected BALB/c mice by conventional PCR targeting the <i>large subunit ribosomal RNA gene</i> (<i>LSUrRNA</i>), while it was negative in uninfected mice. This study highlights the potential of practical methods for the molecular diagnosis of VL using oral swabs as a non-invasive, simple, and accurate approach.",

        "title": "Diagnostic techniques for visceral leishmaniasis: An overview of methods used in East Africa.",
        "abstract": "Leishmanias is a parasitic infection caused by a protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania and transmitted by sand fly, Phlebotomus fly in the old world and Lutzomyia in the New world. The disease is prevalent in the tropics, subtropics, and Southern Europe, where it affects about 1.5 million to 2 million people annually. India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil and Ethiopia account for up to 90% of all the VL cases. While Leishmania cases in Asia are declining, cases in East Africa especially in Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have been increasing. The rise in East African cases is partially attributed to ongoing armed conflicts especially in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan, which has displaced people and increased their exposure to sand fly bites. Migration from endemic to non-endemic regions, misdiagnosis, famine, malnutrition, climate change and an increase in HIV cases are other contributing factors. The clinical diagnosis of Leishmania in East Africa combines the patient's clinical signs with either serological or parasitological test, with rK39 strip and microscopy being the major methods used. Diagnosis of the condition remains challenging, as current techniques have limitations, including the inability to detect parasites in tissue, the need for specialized expertise, prohibitive costs of testing equipment, low antibody titers, and the risk of misdiagnosis due to co-infections with diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid. Various techniques, including serological and molecular parasitological methods, have been employed in attempts to address these challenges, but with limited success. This article therefore, reviews some of the techniques that have been used in Leishmania diagnosis in East Africa and discusses other available new techniques with aim of overcoming the current challenges.",

        "abstract": "Detection of infection with Mycobacterium leprae allows timely prophylactic treatment, thereby reducing transmission as well as the risk of permanent, leprosy-associated nerve damage. However, since there is no worldwide-implemented standard test for M. leprae infection, detection of infection in asymptomatic individuals remains a major challenge for control programs in endemic areas. In previous studies, we developed and field-tested a lateral flow assay (LFA) quantitatively detecting human IgM against M. leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid I (anti-PGL-I), a marker for both active and past infection. This rapid test utilizes luminescent, background-free, up-converting reporter particles (UCP) and immunochromatography (i.e. the UCP-LF test platform) for accurate quantitation of anti-PGL-I IgM without operator bias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the final version of this quantitative UCP-based rapid test (i.e. PGL-I QURapid), using serum and fingerstick blood (FSB). The test comprises a lateral flow strip, in a standard plastic or biodegradable cassette. It can be provided with a humanized, recombinant control to monitor test performance and calculate accurate anti-PGL-I IgM levels. The performance of this QUR-test was assessed using serum and FSB from patients with leprosy (n = 214), tuberculosis (n = 20), buruli ulcer (n = 19), leishmaniasis (n = 14), non-tuberculous mycobacterial (n = 35) infections, as well as healthy Dutch individuals (n = 710) and humanized, recombinant anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies. Plot receiver operating characteristic curves were created and sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and the area under the curve were calculated to evaluate test performance. Test results classified multibacillary leprosy patients with 95.0% Sn and 100% Sp using serum and 91.5% Sn and 99.8% Sp using FSB. Qualitative test results could be read after 2 min flow time, with accurate quantitation from 10 min onwards. The new anti-PGL-I IgM control supports production of batches with predetermined seropositivity thresholds and monitoring of the PGL-I QUR-test in various settings. The operational version of the PGL-I QURapid with point-of-care applicability, meets the WHO target product profile criteria. Thus, this QUR-test is ready for public health implementations.",

With a major reduction in VL cases resulting from the elimination program during the last two decades, the efforts are now focused on the challenges posed by potential reservoirs within the asymptomatic cases, HIV-co-infection VL cases and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases that continue to sustain the parasite transmission cycle in known and newer endemic zones. This article brings attention to a new potential parasite reservoir in the form of atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) cases caused by novel <i>L. donovani</i> genetic variants. <i>L. donovani</i> mediated ACL is an emerging phenomenon in recent endemic sites that now justify a need for implementing molecular surveillance tools to identify region-specific <i>L. donovani</i> variants with dermotropic capabilities and potential to revert to visceral disease. A timely detection of novel ACL causing <i>L. donovani</i> genetic lineages in South-East Asian endemic regions is necessary to halt the spread of ACL and is potentially crucial for the sustainability of the advances made by the VL elimination.",

        "abstract": "As post kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) threatens the success of the Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) elimination initiative, we aimed to investigate the PKDL burden, including an active search for PKDL in leprosy-negative skin lesion cases. We also investigated their health-seeking behavior and perceived level of stigma. This was a cross-sectional survey among inhabitants in the VL-endemic villages of the five most VL-endemic upazilas. VL experts trained medical officers in Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) and leprosy facilities in PKDL management. Frontline workers conducted house-to-house surveys, referring PKDL suspects to designated centers. Data analysis involved Epi Info version 7 and IBM SPSS Statistics 25. Among 472,435 screened individuals, 4022 had past VL (0.85 %). Among the screened population, 82 were PKDL suspects, and 62 PKDL cases were confirmed. The overall PKDL burden was 1.3 (95 % CI: 1.0-1.7) in the 10,000 population in the endemic villages. Male predominance and macular form of PKDL were observed. Thirty-nine PKDL patients perceived stigma of different levels. Only 27 of 62 (44 %) had received PKDL treatment. Medicine's unavailability and side effects were a major reason behind treatment interruption. Active screening among 137 leprosy-negative PKDL suspects yielded 10 (7.3 %) PKDL cases. The existence of PKDL cases in the VL endemic areas is a concern as those are inter-epidemic reservoirs. As per the WHO roadmap, the PKDL burden must be reduced by 70 % and 100 %, respectively, by 2026 and 2030. NKEP can take the current burden of 1.3 per 10,000 people in VL endemic villages as a baseline. Integrating active case detection for PKDL in leprosy hospitals and screening centers is feasible and worth deploying nationwide.",

It is prevalent throughout Asia, Africa, the Americas, and the Mediterranean area, where 147 million people are at risk of contracting the illness. The manifestation of heterotrophic illness relies on both Leishmania implicated and the host's immunological response, ranging from asymptomatic to severe leishmaniasis with potentially lethal effects. We reviewed the literature (published till 31st December 2023) on the worldwide situation of leishmaniasis, standard and novel detection techniques, and traditional and modern treatment strategies and endeavors to eliminate VL. Moreover, epidemiological data was collected from the World Health Organization's publicly available databases. GraphPad Prism Version 8 was used to analyze and produce figures based on the epidemiological data. Diagnosis of parasites in tissues or serology is commonly employed. Diagnosis by identifying parasite DNA using molecular techniques is becoming more popular. Despite recent findings of L. donovani resistance to pentavalent antimoniate medications, it continues to be the cornerstone in the medical management of VL. Amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, injectable paromomycin, and oral miltefosine are among the new therapy options being researched. The number of reported VL cases has reduced remarkably over the last decade due to human interventions made to eliminate VL. Particularly countries from the South East Asian region have experienced momentous progress in reducing VL cases and eliminating this disease from this region. Owing to the robust elimination programs, countries such as Bangladesh has eliminated VL as a public health concern. India and Nepal are on the verge of its elimination. Rapid diagnosis, effective and inexpensive treatment, simple access to newly discovered medications, appropriate vector control, and a well-designed vaccine are all required for the elimination of this disease burden in impoverished areas of the globe.",

The main objective of this study is to present a comprehensive summary of the ophthalmic adverse effects associated with miltefosine when used in the treatment of leishmaniasis. A systematic search was performed on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar, covering articles from inception up to June 2023, without language restrictions, to identify relevant studies documenting ocular toxicity following miltefosine treatment for leishmaniasis. A total of eight studies involving 31 leishmaniasis patients who developed ocular toxicities while undergoing miltefosine treatment were included in the analysis. These studies were conducted in various regions, with five originating from India, two from Bangladesh, and one from Nepal. Patients presented a spectrum of ophthalmic complications, including uveitis, keratitis, scleritis, and Mooren's ulcer. Commonly reported symptoms included pain, redness, excessive tearing, partial vision impairment, permanent blindness, light sensitivity, and the appearance of white spots on the eye. On average, patients received miltefosine treatment for a duration of 47 days before experiencing the onset of ocular problems. It is important to note that the risk of ocular toxicities increases with prolonged use of miltefosine. Therefore, to mitigate the potential for irreversible damage to the eyes, it is imperative that all individuals undergoing miltefosine therapy undergo regular eye examinations.",

For humans, LdBPK_323600.1 (D36) antigen produced short-lived antibodies and performed well in patient cohorts from Bangladesh and Ethiopia, but not Kenya. This study adds promising new candidates to our serodiagnostic toolbox but highlights the need for more antigen discovery studies that may have to be focused on regional performance.",

        "abstract": "In Southeast Asia, treatment is recommended for all patients with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Adherence to the first-line regimen, twelve weeks of miltefosine (MF), is low and ocular toxicity has been observed with this exposure period. We assessed the safety and efficacy of two shorter-course treatments: liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) alone and combined with MF. An open-label, phase II, randomized, parallel-arm, non-comparative trial was conducted in patients with parasitologically confirmed PKDL, 6 to ≤60 years. Patients were assigned to 20 mg/kg LAmB (total dose, in five injections over 15 days) alone or combined with allometric MF (3 weeks). The primary endpoint was definitive cure at 12 months, defined as complete resolution of papular and nodular lesions and >80% re-pigmentation of macular lesions. Definitive cure at 24 months was a secondary efficacy endpoint. 118/126 patients completed the trial. Definitive cure at 12 months was observed in 29% (18/63) patients receiving LAmB and 30% (19/63) receiving LAmB/MF (mITT), increasing to 58% and 66%, respectively, at 24 months. Most lesions had resolved/improved at 12 and 24 months for patients receiving LAmB (90%, 83%) and LAmB/MF (85%, 88%) by qualitative assessment. One death, unrelated to study drugs, was reported; no study drug-related serious adverse events were observed. The most frequent adverse drug reactions were MF-related vomiting and nausea, and LAmB-related hypokalaemia and infusion reactions. Most adverse events were mild; no ocular adverse events occurred. Both regimens are suitably safe and efficacious alternatives to long-course MF for PKDL in South Asia. CTRI/2017/04/008421.",

        "abstract": "Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) arises as a dermal complication following a visceral leishmaniasis (VL) infection. Current treatment options for PKDL are unsatisfactory, and there is a knowledge gap regarding the distribution of antileishmanial compounds within human skin. The present study investigated the skin distribution of miltefosine in PKDL patients, with the aim to improve the understanding of the pharmacokinetics at the skin target site in PKDL. Fifty-two PKDL patients underwent treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (20 mg/kg) plus miltefosine (allometric dosing) for 21 days. Plasma concentrations of miltefosine were measured on study days 8, 15, 22 and 30, while a punch skin biopsy was taken on day 22. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to evaluate the distribution of miltefosine into the skin. Following the allometric weight-based dosing regimen, median miltefosine concentrations on day 22 were 43.73 µg/g (IQR: 21.94-60.65 µg/g) in skin and 33.29 µg/mL (IQR: 25.9-42.58 µg/mL) in plasma. The median individual concentration ratio of skin to plasma was 1.19 (IQR: 0.79-1.9). In 87% (45/52) of patients, skin exposure was above the suggested EC90 PK target of 10.6 mg/L associated with in vitro susceptibility. Simulations indicated that the residence time of miltefosine in the skin would be more than 2-fold longer than in plasma, estimated by a mean residence time of 604 versus 266 hours, respectively. This study provides the first accurate measurements of miltefosine penetration into the skin, demonstrating substantial exposure and prolonged retention of miltefosine within the skin. These findings support the use of miltefosine in cutaneous manifestations of leishmaniasis. In combination with parasitological and clinical data, these results are critical for the future optimization of combination therapies with miltefosine in the treatment of PKDL.",

We treated the patient successfully with a modified treatment regimen of 10 mg/kg body weight LAmB for two consecutive days along with oral miltefosine for seven days as loading dose. For secondary prophylaxis, the patient received 3 mg/kg body weight LAmB along with oral miltefosine for seven days monthly for five doses followed by hormonal replacement.

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis is a deadly infectious disease and is one of the world's major neglected health problems. Because the symptoms of infection are similar to other endemic diseases, accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment. Definitive diagnosis using splenic or bone marrow aspirates is highly invasive, and so, serological assays are preferred, including the direct agglutination test (DAT) or rK39 strip test. These tests, however, are either difficult to perform in the field (DAT) or lack specificity in some endemic regions (rK39), making the development of new tests a research priority. The availability of <i>Leishmania</i> spp. genomes presents an opportunity to identify new diagnostic targets. Here, we use genome data and a mammalian protein expression system to create a panel of 93 proteins consisting of the extracellular ectodomains of the <i>Leishmania donovani</i> cell surface and secreted proteins. We use these panel and sera from murine experimental infection models and natural human and canine infections to identify new candidates for serological diagnosis. We observed a concordance between the most immunoreactive antigens in different host species and transmission settings. The antigen encoded by the <i>LdBPK_323600.1</i> gene can diagnose <i>Leishmania</i> infections with high sensitivity and specificity in patient cohorts from different endemic regions including Bangladesh and Ethiopia. In longitudinal sampling of treated patients, we observed reductions in immunoreactivity to LdBPK_323600.1 suggesting it could be used to diagnose treatment success. In summary, we have identified new antigens that could contribute to improved serological diagnostic tests to help control the impact of this deadly tropical infectious disease. Visceral leishmaniasis is fatal if left untreated with patients often displaying mild and non-specific symptoms during the early stages of infection making accurate diagnosis important. Current methods for diagnosis require highly trained medical staff to perform highly invasive biopsies of the liver or bone marrow which pose risks to the patient. Less invasive molecular tests are available but can suffer from regional variations in their ability to accurately diagnose an infection. To identify new diagnostic markers of visceral leishmaniasis, we produced and tested a panel of 93 proteins identified from the genome of the parasite responsible for this disease. We found that the pattern of host antibody reactivity to these proteins was broadly consistent across naturally acquired infections in both human patients and dogs, as well as experimental rodent infections. We identified a new protein called LdBPK_323600.1 that could accurately diagnose visceral leishmaniasis infections in humans.",

        "abstract": "Systems for disease vector control should be effective, efficient, and flexible to be able to tackle contemporary challenges and threats in the control and elimination of vector-borne diseases. As a priority activity towards the strengthening of vector control systems, it has been advocated that countries conduct a vector-control needs assessment. A review was carried out of the perceived needs for disease vector control programs among eleven countries and subnational states in South Asia and the Middle East. In each country or state, independent teams conducted vector control needs assessment with engagement of stakeholders. Important weaknesses were described for malaria, dengue and leishmaniases regarding vector surveillance, insecticide susceptibility testing, monitoring and evaluation of operations, entomological capacity and laboratory infrastructure. In addition, community mobilization and intersectoral collaboration showed important gaps. Countries and states expressed concern about insecticide resistance that could reduce the continued effectiveness of interventions, which demands improved monitoring. Moreover, attainment of disease elimination necessitates enhanced vector surveillance. Vector control needs assessment provided a useful planning tool for systematic strengthening of vector control systems. A limitation in conducting the vector control needs assessment was that it is time- and resource-intensive. To increase the feasibility and utility of national assessments, an abridged version of the guidance should focus on operationally relevant topics of the assessment. Similar reviews are needed in other regions with different contextual conditions.",

        "abstract": "Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a dermatosis which can occur after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and is a public health problem in VL endemic areas. We conducted a systematic scoping review to assess the characteristics of published PKDL clinical studies, understand the scope of research and explore the feasibility and value of developing a PKDL individual patient data (IPD) platform. A systematic review of published literature was conducted to identify PKDL clinical studies by searching the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, WHO Global Index Medicus, PASCAL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Ovid Global Health, Cochrane Database and CENTRAL, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Only prospective studies in humans with PKDL diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up measurements between January 1973 and March 2023 were included. Extracted data includes variables on patient characteristics, treatment regimens, diagnostic methods, geographical locations, efficacy endpoints, adverse events and statistical methodology. A total of 3,418 records were screened, of which 56 unique studies (n = 2,486 patients) were included in this review. Out of the 56 studies, 36 (64.3%) were from India (1983-2022), 12 (21.4%) from Sudan (1992-2021), 6 (10.7%) were from Bangladesh (1991-2019), and 2 (3.6%) from Nepal (2001-2007). Five (8.9%) studies were published between 1981-1990 (n = 193 patients), 10 (17.9%) between 1991-2000 (n = 230 patients), 10 (17.9%) between 2001-2010 (n = 198 patients), and 31 (55.4%) from 2011 onwards (n = 1,865 patients). Eight (14.3%) were randomised clinical trials, and 48 (85.7%) were non-randomised studies. The median post-treatment follow-up duration was 365 days (range: 90-540 days) in 8 RCTs and 360 days (range: 28-2,373 days) in 48 non-randomised studies. Disease diagnosis was based on clinical criterion in 3 (5.4%) studies, a mixture of clinical and parasitological methods in 47 (83.9%) and was unclear in 6 (10.7%) studies. Major drugs used for treatment were miltefosine (n = 636 patients), liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) (n = 508 patients), and antinomy regimens (n = 454 patients). Ten other drug regimens were tested in 270 patients with less than 60 patients per regimen. Our review identified studies with very limited sample size for the three major drugs (miltefosine, L-AmB, and pentavalent antimony), while the number of patients combined across studies suggest that the IPD platform would be valuable. With the support of relevant stakeholders, the global PKDL community and sufficient financing, a PKDL IPD platform can be realised. This will allow for exploration of different aspects of treatment safety and efficacy, which can potentially guide future healthcare decisions and clinical practices.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis, caused by the parasite of the genus Leishmania, is a neglected tropical disease which is endemic in more than 60 countries. In South-East Asia, Brazil, and East Africa, it mainly occurs as kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis, VL), and subsequently as post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in a smaller portion of cases. As stated per WHO roadmap, accessibility to accurate diagnostic methods is an essential step to achieve elimination. This study aimed to test the accuracy of a portable minoo device, a small battery-driven, multi-use fluorimeter operating with isothermal technology for molecular diagnosis of VL and PKDL. Fluorescence data measured by the device within 20 min are reported back to the mobile application (or app) via Bluetooth and onward via the internet to a backend. This allows anonymous analysis and storage of the test data. The test result is immediately returned to the app displaying it to the user. The limit of detection was 11.2 genome copies (95% CI) as determined by screening a tenfold dilution range of whole Leishmania donovani genomes using isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). Pathogens considered for differential diagnosis were tested and no cross-reactivity was observed. For its diagnostic performance, DNA extracted from 170 VL and PKDL cases, comprising peripheral blood samples (VL, n = 96) and skin biopsies (PKDL, n = 74) from India (n = 108) and Bangladesh (n = 62), was screened. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 91%, respectively. Minoo devices can offer a convenient, cheaper alternative to other molecular diagnostics. Its easy handling makes it ideal for use in low-resource settings to identify parasite burden.",

        "abstract": "A rapid, cost-effective, and simple nucleic acid isolation technique coupled with a point-of-need DNA amplification assay is a desirable goal for programmatic use. For diagnosis of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) rapid tests for the detection of Leishmania DNA are versatile and have operational advantages over qPCR. To facilitate the delivery of the RPA test at point-of-need for VL diagnosis, we compared two rapid DNA extraction methods, SwiftDx (SX) and an in-house Boil and Spin (BS) method, coupled with RPA amplification, versus more widely used methods for DNA extraction and amplification, namely Qiagen (Q) kits and qPCR, respectively. A total of 50 confirmed VL patients and 50 controls, matched for age and gender, were recruited from Mymensingh, Bangladesh, a region highly endemic for VL. Blood samples were collected from each participant and DNA was extracted using Q, SX and BS methods. Following DNA extraction, qPCR and RPA assays were performed to detect <i>L. donovani</i> in downstream analysis. No significant differences in sensitivity of the RPA assay were observed between DNA extraction methods, 94.00% (95% CI: 83.45-98.75%), 90% (95% CI: 78.19-96.67%), and 88% (95% CI: 75.69-95.47%) when using Q, SX, and BS, respectively. Similarly, using qPCR, no significant differences in sensitivity were obtained when using Q or SX for DNA extraction, 94.00% (95% CI: 83.45-98.75%) and 92.00% (80.77-97.78%), respectively. It is encouraging that RPA and qPCR showed excellent agreement (k: 0.919-0.980) when different extraction methods were used and that the DNA impurities using BS had no inhibitory effect on the RPA assay. Furthermore, significantly higher DNA yields were obtained using SX and BS versus Q; however, a significantly higher parasite load was detected using qPCR when DNA was extracted using Q versus SX. Considering the cost, execution time, feasibility, and performance of RPA assay, rapid extraction methods such as the Boil and Spin technique appear to have the potential for implementation in resource-limited endemic settings. Further clinical research is warranted prior to broader application.",

We investigated the efficacy and safety of different primaquine regimens to prevent <i>P. vivax</i> relapse. A systematic review identified <i>P. vivax</i> efficacy studies from South Asia published between 1 January 2000 and 23 August 2021. In a one-stage meta-analysis of available individual patient data, the cumulative risks of <i>P. vivax</i> recurrence at day 42 and 180 were assessed by primaquine total mg/kg dose and duration.

        "abstract": "Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a dermatosis that occurs 2-3 years after an apparently successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In rare cases, PKDL occurs concurrently with VL and is characterized by fever, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy, and poor nutritional status and is known as Para-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (Para-KDL). Co-association of active VL in PKDL patients is documented in Africa, but very few case reports are found in South Asia. We present a case of Para-kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (Para-KDL) in a 50-year-old male patient with a history of one primary Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) and 2 times relapse of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). The patient presented with fever, skin lesions, and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory tests revealed LD bodies in the slit skin smear and splenic biopsy. The patient was treated with two cycles of Amphotericin B with Miltefosine in between cycles for 12 weeks to obtain full recovery. This case report serves as a reminder that Para-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis can develop as a consequence of prior visceral leishmaniasis episodes, even after apparently effective therapy. Since para-kala-azar is a source of infectious spread, endemics cannot be avoided unless it is effectively recognized and treated.",

Visceral leishmaniasis is associated with almost 20,000 reported deaths annually, with children under 5 years of age being at the greatest risk of mortality. Amongst WHO-recognised Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), leishmaniasis is one of the most important in terms of mortality and morbidity. With an increasing global burden of disease and a growing threat from climate change, urbanisation and drug resistance, there remains an imperative to develop leishmaniasis vaccines. New tools to understand correlates of protection and to assess vaccine efficacy are being developed to ease the transition into larger scale efficacy trials or provide alternate routes to licensure. Early indications suggest a diverse portfolio of manufacturers exists in endemic countries with an appetite to develop leishmaniasis vaccines. This Vaccine Value Profile (VVP) provides a high-level, comprehensive assessment of the currently available data to inform the potential public health, economic, and societal value of leishmaniasis vaccines. The leishmaniasis VVP was developed by a working group of subject matter experts from academia, public health groups, policy organizations, and non-profit organizations. All contributors have extensive expertise on various elements of the leishmaniasis VVP and have collectively described the state of knowledge and identified the current gaps.

        "abstract": "Nepal, Bangladesh, and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2005 to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem from the Indian subcontinent by 2015. By 2021, the number of reported VL cases in these countries had declined by over 95% compared to 2007. This dramatic success was achieved through an elimination programme that implemented early case detection and effective treatment, vector control, disease surveillance, community participation, and operational research that underpinned these strategies. The experience offered an opportunity to assess the contribution of implementation research (IR) to VL elimination in Nepal. Desk review and a stakeholder workshop was conducted to analyse the relationship between key research outputs, major strategic decisions in the national VL elimination programme, and annual number of reported new cases over time between 2005 and 2023. The results indicated that the key decisions across the strategic elements, throughout the course of the elimination programme (such as on the most appropriate tools for diganostics and treatment, and on best strategies for case finding and vector management), were IR informed. IR itself responded dynamically to changes that resulted from interventions, addressing new questions that emerged from the field. Close collaboration between researchers, programme managers, and implementers in priority setting, design, conduct, and review of studies facilitated uptake of evidence into policy and programmatic activities. VL case numbers in Nepal are now reduced by 90% compared to 2005. Although direct attribution of disease decline to research outputs is difficult to establish, the Nepal experience demonstrates that IR can be a critical enabler for disease elimination. The lessons can potentially inform IR strategies in other countries with diseases targeted for elimination.",

        "abstract": "Serum or whole blood collection, processing, transport and storage still present significant challenges in low resource settings where mass surveillance is required to sustain disease elimination. Therefore, in this study, we explored the diagnostic efficacy of dried blood spots (DBS) as a minimally invasive and potentially cost-effective alternative sampling technique to whole blood sampling procedures for subsequent detection of Leishmania donovani antibodies or DNA. Archived serum, DNA samples from whole blood of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases and healthy controls, and DBS from corresponding cases and controls, were used. Both molecular and serological assays were optimized to detect L. donovani antibodies or DNA in DBS elute and results were compared against those obtained with whole blood. Serological assays (both rK28 ELISA and rK39 ELISA) of DBS samples showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% and had excellent agreement with results from whole blood samples (kappa value ranged from 0.98-1). Bland-Altman analysis of OD values from rK28-ELISA with DBS elute and patients' serum showed an excellent agreement (ICC = 0.9) whereas a good agreement (ICC = 0.8) was observed in the case of rK39-ELISA. However, qPCR and RPA of DBS samples had a diminished sensitivity of 76% and 68%, respectively, and poor agreement was observed with the whole blood samples. Our results demonstrate that DBS offer excellent diagnostic efficiency for serological assays and represent a viable alternative to whole blood sampling procedures.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 has largely impacted the management of Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), like several other Neglected Tropical Diseases. The impact was particularly evident in Lower and Middle-Income countries where the already inadequate healthcare resources were diverted to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Bangladesh achieved the elimination target for VL in 2016. To sustain this success, early diagnosis and treatment, effective vector control, and periodic surveillance are paramount. However, the specific control measures for VL in Bangladesh that were hampered during COVID-19 and their extent are unknown. This study aimed at identifying the gaps and challenges in the follow-up of treated VL patients by interviewing both the treated VL cases and their health service providers. We followed VL cases treated between 2019 and 2020 in five VL endemic subdistricts (upazilas) both retrospectively and prospectively to monitor clinical improvement, relapse, or other consequences. Moreover, interviews were conducted with the health service providers to assess the impact of COVID-19 on VL case detection, treatment, reporting, vector control operations, and logistic supply chain management. There was no added delay for VL diagnosis; however, VL treatment initiation and reporting time increased almost two-fold due to COVID-19. Indoor Residual Spraying activity was significantly hampered due to a shortage of insecticides. Out of 44 enrolled and treated VL patients, two relapsed (4.5 %), two developed Para Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (4.5 %), and three (6.8 %) Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL). The health service providers highlighted patients` unwillingness to visit the hospital, financial constraints, and distance from the hospitals as the main reasons for missed follow-up visits (20.5 %). Building good communication in the community, awareness schemes, and incentive-based approaches were suggested as possible solutions to mitigate these problems. Long-term follow-up is required for the early detection and management of VL relapse and PKDL cases. Effective vector control measures, capacity development, and identification of new VL hotspots are pivotal in the VL endemic regions to sustain the elimination goal.",

        "abstract": "The success of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination program largely depends on cost-effective vector control measures. Our goal was to investigate the longevity of the efficacy of insecticidal wall painting (IWP), a new vector control tool, compared with a routine indoor residual spraying (IRS) program for reducing the VL vector density in Bangladesh. This study is the extension of our recent IWP study for VL vector management in Bangladesh, which was undertaken in seven highly VL endemic villages of the Mymensingh district with a 12-month follow-up. In this 24-months follow-up study, we collected sand flies additionally at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months since the interventions from the IWP and control (where the program did routine IRS) clusters to examine the longevity of the efficacy of IWP on sand fly density reduction and mortality. The difference-in-differences regression models were used to estimate the effect of IWP on sand fly reduction against Program IRS. The IWP showed excellent performance in reducing sand fly density and increasing sand fly mortality compared with Program IRS. The effect of IWP for controlling sand flies was statistically significant for up to at least 24 months. The mean female Phlebotomus argentipes density reduction ranged from -56% to -83%, and the P. argentipes sand fly mortality ranged from 81% to 99.5% during the 24-month follow-up period. Considering the duration of the efficacy of IWP for controlling VL vectors, Bangladesh National Kala-azar Elimination Program may consider IWP as the best alternative to IRS for the subsequent phases of the program.",

The study investigated new visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases reported between 2019 and 2020 in four sub-districts (Dharmapasha, Hakimpur, Islampur and Savar) where we tested 560 members using the rK39 rapid test and conducted vector collections in six neighbouring houses of the index cases to assess sandfly density and distribution, examined sandflies' infection, and determined the spatial relationship with VL infection. Furthermore, we highlighted the importance of early detection, and community awareness in controlling the spread of the disease. The study screened 1078 people from 231 households in the four sub-districts for fever, history of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and PKDL-like skin lesions. Among sub-districts, positivity rate for rK39 rapid test was highest (3.5 %) in Savar. Sandflies were present across all areas except in Dharmapasha, but all 21 collected female P. argentipes sandflies were negative for Leishmania parasite DNA. We found one person from Islampur with a history of VL, and one from Islampur and another one from Savar had PKDL. After the awareness intervention, more people became familiar with VL infection (91.2 %), and their knowledge concerning sandflies being the vector of the disease and the risk of having VL increased significantly (30.1 %). The study found no active case in the suspected new foci, but some asymptomatic individuals were present. As sandfly vectors exist in these areas, the National Kala-azar Elimination Programme (NKEP) should consider these areas as kala-azar endemic and initiate control activities as per national guidelines.",

While the first process has low specificity, the later one carries the risk of fatal hemorrhage. Over the last decade, multiple Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based diagnosis has been developed using blood and urine sample with a varying degree of sensitivity and specificity, an issue worth improving for precision diagnosis. Earlier, we reported a PCR-based diagnosis of L. donovani in peripheral blood using a novel set of PCR primers with absolute specificity. Using the same set of primers and PCR conditions, here we describe diagnosis of L. donovani from urine, for a non-invasive, rapid and safe diagnosis. Diagnosis of VL was carried out using urine samples collected from clinically diagnosed VL patients (n = 23) of Bangladesh in Real Time PCR. Test results were validated by comparing blood samples from the same set of patients. Sensitivity and specificity of this diagnosis was analyzed using retrospective bone marrow samples, collected earlier from confirmed VL patients (n = 19). The method showed 100% sensitivity in detecting L. donovani in urine and corresponding blood and retrospective bone marrow samples, as well as 100% specificity in control groups. A Real Time PCR-based molecular detection system using urine sample is hereafter presented what could be a, non-invasive approach for VL detection with precision and perfection.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniases are considered among the most neglected yet dangerous parasitic diseases worldwide. According to the recent WHO report (Weekly Epidemiological Record, Sep, 2021), 200 countries and territories reported leishmanises cases in 2020; of which 89 (45%) for CL, and 79 (40%) for VL were endemic. Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh and Nepal), one of the three eco-epidemiological hotspots of VL, currently reported 18% of the total cases of VL worldwide. Eastern Mediterranean region and the Region of the Americas together reported >90% of the new CL cases, of which >80% were from Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Iraq, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic. While considering the current therapeutic options, conventional anti-leishmanial drugs have long been proved to be toxic and/or expensive and have resulted in extensive drug resistance in India. Recent searches for novel anti-leishmanial drugs have led to find out the prime cellular targets and metabolic pathways to bridge the gap between the known facts and unexplored data. Cutting edge knowledge based drug designing has simplified the search for novel molecules with leishmanicidal efficacy by identifying ligand-receptor interactions and has accelerated the cost effective primary discovery of molecules through computational validation against Leishmaniases. This review focuses on the limitations of conventional drugs, and discusses the chemotherapeutic potential of many novel natural and synthetic anti-leishmanial agents reported since the last decade. It is also interpreted that some of the reported molecules might be tested singly or as a part of combinatorial therapy on pre-clinical and clinical level.",

This retrospective cross-sectional study discusses 16 Para-KDL cases with one-year follow-up data, treated between 2012-2021 at the Surya Kanta Kala-azar Research Center, Bangladesh. We collected data from hospital records and used STATA 16 to analyze and see the frequency distribution and variable means. We found five patients without any history of kala-azar infection. All the patients were treated with 20 mg/kg Liposomal Amphotericin B in 4 divided doses except one with a history of AmBisome hypersensitivity. One year after treatment, all patients were free from skin lesions, with no hepatosplenomegaly, and observed significant improvement in BMI and hemoglobin levels. The Para-KDL patients are challenging to diagnose, and the relapse and treatment failure leishmania patients might have belonged to this rare group, contributing to their poor prognosis. Therefore, developing an appropriate diagnostic workflow and a new drug regimen is essential to sustain the success of our elimination efforts.",

Evaluation of 18S rRNA-RPA and our previously developed kDNA-RPA assays on 70 real-time PCR-positive leishmaniasis samples of varying pathologies resulted in sensitivity rates of 35.71% and 88.57%, respectively, while the combined sensitivity was 98.57%. Combinatorial application of 18S rRNA-RPA and kDNA-RPA assays can be recommended for further diagnostic assessments.",

Here, we evaluate a design-locked loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to diagnose PKDL. A total of 76 snip-skin samples collected from individuals with probable PKDL (clinical presentation and a positive rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT)) were assessed by microscopy, qPCR, and LAMP. An equal number of age and sex-matched healthy controls were included to determine the specificity of the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay with a Qiagen DNA extraction (Q-LAMP) showed a promising sensitivity of 72.37% (95% CI: 60.91-82.01%) for identifying the PKDL cases. LAMP assay sensitivity declined when the DNA was extracted using a boil-spin method. Q-qPCR showed 68.42% (56.75-78.61%) sensitivity, comparable to LAMP and with an excellent agreement, whereas the microscopy exhibited a weak sensitivity of 39.47% (28.44-51.35%). When microscopy and/or qPCR were considered the gold standard, Q-LAMP exhibited an elevated sensitivity of 89.7% (95% CI: 78.83-96.11%) for detection of PKDL cases and Bayesian latent class modeling substantiated the excellent sensitivity of the assay. All healthy controls were found to be negative. Notwithstanding the optimum efficiency of the LAMP assay towards the detection of PKDL cases, further optimization of the boil-spin method is warranted to permit remote use of the assay.",

        "abstract": "Phlebotomus argentipes is the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Bangladesh and is controlled using deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, through indoor residual spraying (IRS). A mutation at L1014 (leucine at codon 1014) of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), known as a knockdown resistance (kdr) gene, is thought to be an important pyrethroid resistance mechanism. This study detected mutations at codon 1014, and at codons 1011, 1016, and 1020, which are kdr sites in other insects. The kdr relationship with deltamethrin resistance in P. argentipes from an IRS-targeted site in Bangladesh was also evaluated. Sand flies were collected from Magurjora village, Mymensingh district, Bangladesh in November 2012. A WHO cone bioassay test using deltamethrin was conducted and specimens were grouped as 'live' or 'dead'. After morphological identification, genomic DNA was used to genotype a partial VGSC gene from P. argentipes. The kdr/ pyrethroid resistance relationship was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. Targeted codons were genotyped from 8 'live' and 63 'dead' P. argentipes. All 'live' specimens had mutant alleles (L1014F and L1014S) at codon 1014. The mutant allele rate was 94% for 'live' specimens and 55% for 'dead' specimens. The mutant allele survival odds were higher for the wild-type L1014L allele, and L1014F odds were lower for L1014S. There were no mutations at codons 1011, 1016, and 1020. The L1014 mutations suggested that pyrethroid resistance had appeared in Bangladesh. Further research on kdr mutations in P. argentipes is important for the appropriate IRS.",

At present there is no consensus on the definition of asymptomatic Leishmania infection, nor is there a safe and accessible gold standard test for its identification. This paper presents a scoping review to summarize definitions of asymptomatic Leishmania infection found in the literature, as well as to detail the approach (molecular, serological, cellular, and/or parasitological tests) used by researchers to identify this asymptomatic population. A scoping review of published and gray literature related to asymptomatic Leishmania infection was conducted; retrieved citations were screened based on predefined eligibility criteria, and relevant data items were extracted from eligible articles. The analysis is descriptive and is presented using tables, figures, and thematic narrative synthesis. We conducted a screening of 3008 articles, of which 175 were selected for the full review. Of these articles, we selected 106 that met the inclusion criteria. These articles were published between 1991 and 2021, and in the last 5 years, up to 38 articles were reported. Most of the studies were conducted in Brazil (26%), Spain (14%), India (12%), Bangladesh (10%), and Ethiopia (7%). Of the studies, 84.9% were conducted in the immunocompetent population, while 15.1% were conducted in the immunosuppressed population (HIV, immunosuppressive drugs, and organ transplantation population). We report 14 different techniques and 10 strategies employed by researchers to define asymptomatic Leishmania infection in an endemic area. The definition of asymptomatic Leishmania infection is not unified across the literature, but often includes the following criteria: residence (or extended stay) in a Leishmania-endemic area, no reported signs/symptoms compatible with leishmaniasis, and positive on a combination of serological, molecular, cellular, and/or parasitological tests. Caution is recommended when comparing results of different studies on the subject of asymptomatic infections, as the reported prevalence cannot be confidently compared between areas due to the wide variety of tests employed by research groups. More research on the importance of asymptomatic immunosuppressed and immunocompetent Leishmania-positive populations in leishmaniasis epidemiology is required.",

        "abstract": "Quantification of pathogen load, although challenging, is of paramount importance for accurate diagnosis and clinical management of a range of infectious diseases in a point-of-need testing (PONT) scenario such as in resource-limited settings. We formulated a quantification approach to test the standard-curve based absolute quantification ability of isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay. As a test of principle, a 10-fold dilution series of <i>Leishmania donovani</i> (LD) genomic DNA prepared in nuclease-free-water (NFW), and from culture-spiked-blood (CSB) were tested, and a 15 min assay was performed. A modified algorithm was formulated to derive the detection outcome. The threshold-record times (Tr) in seconds thus obtained were plotted against the initial load of parasite genomes for log-linear regression analysis. The quantitative RPA (Q-RPA) assay was further evaluated against a LD quantitative (q)-PCR assay with DNA extracted from visceral and post-Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis case specimens and stratified into different ranges of threshold cycle (Ct). The best-fitted regression models were found linear with mean r<sup>2</sup>/root mean square error (RMSE) values of residual points (in seconds) estimated as 0.996/8.063 and 0.992/7.46 for replicated series of NFW and CSB, respectively. In both series, the lower limit of detection reached less than 0.1 parasite genome equivalent DNA. Absolute agreement between Q-RPA and LD-qPCR was found for test positivity, and strong positive correlations were observed between the Tr and Ct values (r = 0.89; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) as well as between the absolute parasite loads (r = 0.87; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) quantified by respective assays. The findings in this very first Q-RPA assay for leishmaniasis are suggestive of its potential in monitoring LD load in clinical specimens, and the development of rapid Q-RPA assays for other infectious diseases.",

This prospective study includes 11 children and 19 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of kala-azar (total 30 cases). Intravenous infusion of LAmB (10 mg/kg body weight) was given to all of the patients. Clinical assessments were conducted during treatment, before hospital discharge, and on days 30 and 180 after treatment. Efficacy was estimated in terms of initial cure (at day 30) and the final cure (at 180 days). All information was recorded in a preformed case record form and analysis was performed in SPSS 22. The mean age was 27.13 ± 18.04 years (3-65) with male predominance (60%). Significant regression of spleen size was found following treatment with LAmB at 30 days and 180 days follow up visit (p < 0.05 for all). Overall, rate of initial cure was 90% (n = 27) (child 90.9% vs 89.47% adult) and final cure was 96.66% (n = 29) (child 100% vs 94.73% adult). Fourteen adverse events were recorded mostly including fever and/or shivering (85.71%). No case relapsed or were referred either due to management or Severe Adverse Event (SAE). In real-life experience, the LAmB treatment for visceral leishmaniasis is as safe and effective for treatment of kala-azar patients.

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or Kala-azar is a vector borne protozoan infection caused by Leishmania donovani in the Indian subcontinent mainly India, Nepal and Bangladesh. It is a major public health problem in these countries mostly affecting the socio-economically poor population. Leishmaniasis ranks the third most important disease after malaria and filariasis but is still considered as one of the neglected tropical diseases of the world. For development of better therapeutic agents and effective vaccine against VL, there is a need to understand host immunological changes that play a vital role during course of infection. Therefore, we investigated the role of Th17 pathway in Balb/c mice during Leishmania donovani infection and treatment with amphotericin B. Mice were divided in four groups i.e. Control, Infected, Uninfected treated and Infected treated. The cytokine levels were estimated in the spleen of Balb/c mice on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35, 45 and 60 post infection and during course of treatment. The mRNA levels of the Th17 pathway during active Leishmania donovani infection and after treatment were determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein levels by flow cytometry and ELISA. Results of our study revealed that active infection was associated with low levels of Th17 cytokines IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 and elevated levels of IL-6, IL-1β and TGF-β. Amphotericin B treatment restored production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-22. The levels of transcription factor RORγt were found to correlate with the levels of IL-17 during infection and also after chemotherapy whereas STAT3 levels were elevated during infection and vice versa after treatment. The findings of this study suggest that Th17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 are associated with protection against VL infection and development of any interventions or chemotherapeutic agents targeting Th17 pathway could be an important approach for VL treatment.",

The interventions included insecticidal wall painting (IWP), reduced-coverage insecticidal durable wall lining (DWL), insecticide-impregnated bednets (ITN), and indoor residual spraying with deltamethrin (IRS). Sakhua union with seven villages was the study area, which was the most highly endemic visceral leishmaniasis union in Trishal upazila, Bangladesh. Each cluster containing the different interventions included approximately 50 households. Study methods included random selection of clusters, collection of sandfly by CDC light trap and manual aspirator to determine sandfly density, and sandfly mortality determined by WHO cone bioassay test. Trained field research assistants interviewed household heads using structured questionnaires for sociodemographic information, as well as safety and acceptability of the interventions. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods measured interventions' effect and its duration on sandfly density reduction and mortality. We measured the relative efficacy of IWP on sandfly control against DWL, ITN, and IRS by the difference-in-difference regression model. We found that existing interventions were effective and safe for sandfly control with different duration of effect and acceptability. The relative efficacy of IWP for sandfly reduction varied by -59% to -91%, -75% to -81%, and -30% to -104% compared with DWL, ITN, and IRS, respectively, at different time points during the 12-month follow-up. These study results will guide the NKEP for selection of sandfly control tool(s) in its subsequent consolidation and maintenance phases.",

In cutaneous leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, Leishmania parasites reside and multiply in the dermis of the skin. As miltefosine is orally administered and this drug is currently studied for the treatment of these skin-related types of leishmaniasis, there is an urgent need for an accurate assay to determine actual miltefosine levels in human skin tissue to further optimize treatment regimens through target-site pharmacokinetic studies. We describe here the development and validation of a sensitive method to quantify miltefosine in 4-mm human skin biopsies utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. After the skin tissues were homogenized overnight by enzymatic digestion using collagenase A, the skin homogenates were further processed by protein precipitation and phenyl-bonded solid phase extraction. Final extracts were injected onto a Gemini C18 column using alkaline eluent for separation and elution. Detection was performed by positive ion electrospray ionization followed by a quadrupole - linear ion trap mass spectrometer, using deuterated miltefosine as an internal standard. The method was validated over a linear calibration range of 4-1000 ng/mL (r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9996) using miltefosine spiked digestion solution for calibration and quality control samples. Validation parameters were all within internationally accepted criteria, including intra- and inter-assay accuracies and precisions within± 15% and ≤ 15% (within± 20% and ≤ 20% at the lower limit of quantitation). There was no significant matrix effect of the human skin tissue matrix and the recovery for miltefosine, and internal standard were comparable. Miltefosine in human skin tissue homogenates was stable during the homogenization incubation (37 °C,± 16 h) and after a minimum of 10 days of storage at - 20 °C after the homogenization process. With our assay we could successfully detect miltefosine in skin biopsies from patients with post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis who were treated with this drug in Bangladesh.",

PKDL patients are potential reservoirs of LD parasites, which can initiate a new epidemic of anthroponotic VL. Therefore, host infectiousness to its sand fly vector is a critical factor for transmission, and its accurate estimation can facilitate control strategies. At present, conventional microscopy serves as the reference method to detect parasites in its vector. However, low sensitivity of microscopy can be a limiting factor. In this study, real-time quantitative PCR (LD-qPCR) and recombinase polymerase amplification (LD-RPA) assays were evaluated against microscopy for the detection of LD DNA extracted from live sand flies five days after controlled feeding on PKDL cases. The sensitivity of LD-qPCR and LD-RPA assays were found to be 96.43 and 100%, respectively, against microscopy for the selected fed sand flies (n = 28), and an absolute specificity of both molecular tools for apparently unfed sand flies (n = 30). While the proportion of infectious cases among 47 PKDL patients was estimated as 46.81% as defined by microscopic detection of LD in at least one fed sand fly per case, LD-RPA assay evaluation of only the microscopy negative sand flies fed to those 47 PKDL cases estimated an even greater proportion of infectious cases (51.06%). In overall estimation of the infectious cases in retrospective manner, discordance in positivity rate was observed (p < 0.05) between LD-RPA (59.57%) assay and microscopy (46.81%), while LD-RPA had slightly better positivity rate than LD-qPCR (55.32%) as well. Considering the sensitivity, cost, detection time, and field applicability, RPA assay can be considered as a promising single molecular detection tool for investigations pertaining to LD infections in sand flies and/or host infectiousness in PKDL, while it can also be useful in confirmation of microscopy negative sand fly samples.",

We were also able to measure the degree of opening of the stomodeal valve and demonstrate the extension of the PSG and parasites into the pharynx. Although our pilot study could only examine a few flies, it supports the hypothesis that a second, non-infected, blood meal enhances parasite transmission as we showed that the thoracic PSG-parasite plug in infected flies after a second blood meal was, on average, more than twice the volume of the plug in infected flies that did not have a second blood meal.",

        "abstract": "In 2005, Bangladesh, India and Nepal agreed to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as a public health problem. The approach to this was through improved case detection and treatment, and controlling transmission by the sand fly vector Phlebotomus argentipes, with indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide. Initially, India applied DDT with stirrup pumps for IRS, however, this did not reduce transmission. After 2015 onwards, the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin was applied with compression pumps, and entomological surveillance was initiated in 2016. Eight sentinel sites were established in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. IRS coverage was monitored by household survey, quality of insecticide application was measured by HPLC, presence and abundance of the VL vector was monitored by CDC light traps, insecticide resistance was measured with WHO diagnostic assays and case incidence was determined from the VL case register KAMIS. Complete treatment of houses with IRS increased across all sites from 57% in 2016 to 70% of houses in 2019, rising to >80% if partial house IRS coverage is included (except West Bengal). The quality of insecticide application has improved compared to previous studies, average doses of insecticide on filters papers ranged from 1.52 times the target dose of 25mg/m2 alpha-cypermethrin in 2019 to 1.67 times in 2018. Resistance to DDT has continued to increase, but the vector was not resistant to carbamates, organophosphates or pyrethroids. The annual and seasonal abundance of P. argentipes declined between 2016 to 2019 with an overall infection rate of 0.03%. This was associated with a decline in VL incidence for the blocks represented by the sentinel sites from 1.16 per 10,000 population in 2016 to 0.51 per 10,000 in 2019. Through effective case detection and management reducing the infection reservoirs for P. argentipes in the human population combined with IRS keeping P. argentipes abundance and infectivity low has reduced VL transmission. This combination of effective case management and vector control has now brought India within reach of the VL elimination targets.",

        "abstract": "Global annual reports of visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar (\"black fever\") reduced from 200,000 cases in 2012 to 23,804 in 2015. India, Bangladesh and Nepal reported 80% of the global cases in 2012, but 39% in 2015. We sought to identify major amenable barriers to early diagnosis of kala-azar in peripheral areas of Mymensingh district, an area of Bangladesh that was highly endemic for kala-azar. We conducted sequential exploratory mixed methods research. Qualitative data were first derived from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions among 29 patients diagnosed with kala-azar, their families, and neighbours. Preliminary results from qualitative analysis were used to design a structured questionnaire, which was administered to collect data on the processes leading to the diagnosis of kala-azar from 102 patients. Qualitative and quantitative data were integrated consistent with the chronology for kala-azar patients seeking care. The study was conducted from September 2011 to May 2012 in Fulbaria and Gaffargaon sub-districts of Mymensingh. The median delay from fever onset to confirmatory diagnosis of kala-azar was 60 days, with 38% of the cases diagnosed within 30 days. Public health facilities and Gaffargaon sub-district achieved high proportions of early diagnosis. Individual barriers to early diagnosis were low awareness of symptoms and treatment facilities, poverty, and traditional beliefs. Other factors were the remoteness of health care centres, wet season transport difficulty, mis-diagnosis as typhoid, limited availability of rK-39 testing at the community level, and the inclusion of splenomegaly in the case definition. Targeted community awareness campaigns appropriate for underprivileged communities will increase care seeking and consequently diagnosis. Improved diagnostic guidelines and a strong referral chain for kala-azar will accelerate diagnosis. These steps will contribute significantly to the National Kala-azar Elimination Program of Bangladesh, especially during the post-elimination era.",

        "abstract": "Phlebotomus argentipes is a predominant vector of Leishmania donovani, the protozoan parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis in the Indian subcontinent. In hosts bitten by P. argentipes, sand fly saliva elicits the production of specific anti-salivary protein antibodies. Here, we have utilised these antibodies as markers of human exposure to P. argentipes in a visceral leishmaniasis endemic area in Pabna district, Bangladesh. The use of whole salivary gland homogenate as an antigen to detect these antibodies has several limitations, therefore it is being superseded by the use of specific recombinant salivary proteins. We have identified three major P. argentipes salivary antigenic proteins recognised by sera of bitten humans, expressed them in a recombinant form (rPagSP04, rPagSP05 and rPagSP06) and tested their applicability in ELISA and immunoblot. One of them, PpSP32-like protein rPagSP06, was identified as the most promising antigen, showing highest resemblance and correlation with the IgG response to P. argentipes salivary gland homogenate. Furthermore, we have validated the applicability of rPagSP06 in a large cohort of 585 individuals and obtained a high correlation coefficient for anti-rPagSP06 and anti-P. argentipes saliva IgG responses. The anti-rPagSP06 and anti-P. argentipes salivary gland homogenate IgG responses followed a similar right-skewed distribution. This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. argentipes saliva antibodies using recombinant salivary protein. The rPagSP06 was proven to be a valid antigen for screening human sera for exposure to P. argentipes bites in a visceral leishmaniasis endemic area.",

In this regard, here we investigated the diagnostic efficacies of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay (Loopamp™ <i>Leishmania</i> Detection Kit, Eiken Chemical CO., Ltd, Japan), a real-time quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) and the <i>Leishmania</i> antigen ELISA (CLIN-TECH, UK) with different sampling techniques and evaluated their prospect to incorporate into post-elimination VL control strategies. Eighty clinically and rK39 rapid diagnostic test confirmed VL cases and 80 endemic healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood and dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from all the participants at the time of diagnosis.

The disease usually manifests as a variable combination of hypopigmented patches, erythematous succulent papulo-plaques, and nodular lesions on the face and upper body and sometimes extending on the extremities, genitalia, and tongue. Atypical morphology and presentations are not uncommon, especially in endemic areas, which include photosensitivity, verrucous, hypertrophic, xanthomatous, and ulcerative lesions. Recognition of spectrum of mucocutaneous changes helps physicians in early initiation of treatment and in reducing disease transmission in the community. The differential diagnosis depends on the pattern of manifestations, but lepromatous leprosy is the closest mimicker. Since PKDL does not cause significant morbidity, at least initially, but the affected patients continue to act as a reservoir of the disease, active case detection is required to identify cases early to control the disease transmission in the community.",

PKDL has been identified as one of the epidemiological marker of \"kala-azar elimination programme.\" Data obtained in 2018 showed PKDL distribution primarily concentrated in 6 countries, which includes India, Sudan, south Sudan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Nepal in decreasing order of case-burden. In India, PKDL cases are mainly found in 54 districts, of which 33 are in Bihar, 11 in West Bengal, 4 in Jharkhand, and 6 in Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal the districts reporting cases of PKDL cases include Darjeeling, Uttar Dinajpur, Dakshin Dinajpur, Malda, and Murshidabad. The vulnerability on the young age is documented in various studies. The studies also highlights a male predominance of the disease but recent active surveillance suggested that macular form of PKDL shows female-predominance. It is recommended that along with passive case detection, active survey helps in early identification of cases, thus reducing disease transmission in the community. The <i>Accelerated plan for Kala-azar elimination</i> in 2017 introduced by Government of India with the goal to eliminate Kala-azar as a public health problem, targets to reduceing annual incidence <1/10,000. <i>Leishmania donovani</i> is the established causative agent, but others like <i>L. tropica</i> or <i>L. infantum</i> may occasionally lead to the disease, especially with HIV-co-infection. Dermal tropism of the parasite has been attributed to overexpression of parasite surface receptors (like gp 63, gp46). Various host factors are also identified to contribute to the development of the disease, including high pretreatment IL 10 and parasite level, inadequate dose and duration of treatment, malnutrition, immuno-suppression, decreased interferon-gamma receptor 1 gene, etc. PKDL is mostly concentrated in the plains below an altitude of 600 mts which is attributed to the environment conducive for the vector sand fly (<i>Phlebotumus</i>). Risk factors are also linked to the habitat of the sand fly. Keeping these things in mind \"Integrated vector control\" is adopted under <i>National vector borne disease control programme</i> as one of the strategies to bring down the disease burden.",

The newly developed recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay incorporated in a suitcase laboratory has shown promising diagnostic efficacy over real-time PCR in detection of <i>leishmania</i> DNA from clinical samples. For broader application of this point-of-need system, we undertook a current multi-country diagnostic evaluation study towards establishing this technique in different endemic settings which would be beneficial for the ongoing elimination programs for leishmaniasis. For this study purpose, clinical samples from confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients were subjected to both real-time PCR and RPA assay in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Further skin samples from confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients were also included from Sri Lanka. A total of 450 clinical samples from VL patients, 429 from PKDL patients, 47 from CL patients, and 322 from endemic healthy/healthy controls were under investigation to determine the diagnostic efficacy of RPA assay in comparison to real-time PCR. A comparative sensitivity of both methods was found where real-time PCR and RPA assay showed 96.86% (95% CI: 94.45-98.42) and 88.85% (95% CI: 85.08-91.96) sensitivity respectively in the diagnosis of VL cases. This new isothermal method also exhibited promising diagnostic sensitivity (93.50%) for PKDL cases, when a skin sample was used. Due to variation in the sequence of target amplicons, RPA assay showed comparatively lower sensitivity (55.32%) than that of real-time PCR in Sri Lanka for the diagnosis of CL cases. Except for India, the assay presented absolute specificity in the rest of the sites. Excellent concordance between the two molecular methods towards detection of <i>leishmania</i> DNA in clinical samples substantiates the application of RPA assay incorporated in a suitcase laboratory for point-of-need diagnosis of VL and PKDL in low resource endemic settings.

In the Indian sub-continent, VL is caused by <i>Leishmania donovani</i> and transmitted <i>via</i> the bite of an infected <i>Phlebotomus argentipes</i> female sand fly, the only competent vector species in the region. The highest disease burden is in the northern part of the Indian sub-continent, especially in the state of Bihar. India, Bangladesh, and Nepal embarked on an initiative, coordinated by World Health Organization, to eliminate VL as a public health problem by the year 2020. The main goal is to reduce VL incidence below one case per 10,000 people through early case-detection, prompt diagnosis and treatment, and reduction of transmission using vector control measures. Indoor residual spraying, a major pillar of the elimination program, is the only vector control strategy used by the government of India. Though India is close to its VL elimination target, important aspects of vector bionomics and sand fly transmission dynamics are yet to be determined. To achieve sustained elimination and to prevent a resurgence of VL, knowledge gaps in vector biology and behavior, and the constraints they may pose to current vector control methods, need to be addressed. Herein, we discuss the successes and failures of previous and current vector-control strategies implemented to combat kala-azar in Bihar, India, and identify gaps in our understanding of vector transmission towards development of innovative tools to ensure sustained vector control in the post-elimination period.",

The disease is associated with depressed cellular immunity. Tinea is a fungal infection of the skin, which can become more extensively pathogenic particularly in patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity. Regulatory T cells and Th17 cells have been shown to be responsible for post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). We present a rare case of a 52-year-old house wife with a history of recurrent itching, depigmentation of the skin of extremities, and loss of appetite for 2-3 months followed by progressive spread of such lesion all over the body in an apparently healthy female. On examination, there were many hypopigmented scaly lesions mainly over the extensor aspect of the body. Skin lesions were characteristics of tinea infection with or without PKDL. A diagnosis of PKDL with tinea was made based on the history of kala-azar and on the skin slit smear for amastigote forms, <i>rK39</i> test, and KOH mount. Routine blood investigations showed negative serology for HIV and lower normal CD4+T counts. The patient was advised for treatment on systemic antifungal therapy with antihistaminics and later with miltefosine. We have highlighted that PKDL, although uncommon, is a distinct manifestation of VL. In our case study, we also tried to find the reason of coinfection; this was probably due to the depressed cellular immunity, skin abruptions, and acquired dermatophytic infection which is prevalent and associated with lower CD4+ T cell count.",

L. donovani is transmitted by the sand fly species Phlebotomus argentipes. Our collaborative group and others have shown that sand flies trapped outside in endemic villages have fed on cattle and dogs in addition to people. Domestic animals are reservoirs for L. donovani complex spp., particularly L. infantum, in other endemic areas. Multiple studies using quantitative PCR or serological detection methods have demonstrated that goats, cattle, rats and dogs were diagnostically positive for L. donovani infection or exposure in eastern Africa, Bangladesh, Nepal and India. There is a limited understanding of the extent to which L. donovani infection of domestic animals drives transmission to other animals or humans on the ISC. Evidence from other vector-borne disease elimination strategies indicated that emerging infections in domestic species hindered eradication. The predominant lesson learned from these other situations is that non-human reservoirs must be identified, controlled and/or prevented. Massive efforts are underway for VL elimination on the Indian subcontinent. Despite these herculean efforts, residual VL incidence persists. The spectre of an animal reservoir complicating elimination efforts haunts the final push towards full VL control.

Diagnostics which detect active asymptomatic infection, which are suitable for monitoring and surveillance, may be of benefit to the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination campaign on the ISC. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and the direct agglutination test (DAT) were carried out on blood samples, and the Leishmania antigen ELISA was carried out on urine samples collected from 720 household and neighbouring contacts of 276 VL and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) index cases, with no symptoms or history of VL or PKDL, in endemic regions of Bangladesh between September 2016 and March 2018. Of the 720 contacts of index cases, asymptomatic infection was detected in 69 (9.6%) participants by a combination of qPCR (1.0%), LAMP (2.1%), DAT (3.9%), and Leishmania antigen ELISA (3.3%). Only one (0.1%) participant was detected positive by all four diagnostic tests. Poor agreement between tests was calculated using Cohen's kappa (κ) statistics; however, the Leishmania antigen ELISA and DAT in combination captured all participants as positive by more than one test. We find evidence for a moderately strong association between the index case being a PKDL case (OR 1.94, p = 0.009), specifically macular PKDL (OR 2.12, p = 0.004), and being positive for at least one of the four tests. Leishmania antigen ELISA on urine detects active asymptomatic infection, requires a non-invasive sample, and therefore may be of benefit for monitoring transmission and surveillance in an elimination setting in combination with serology. Development of an antigen detection test in a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) format would be of benefit to the elimination campaign.",

        "title": "Rodent Ectoparasites in the Middle East: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
        "abstract": "Rodents carry many ectoparasites, such as ticks, lice, fleas, and mites, which have potential public health importance. Middle Eastern countries are hotspots for many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as plague, leishmaniasis, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Q fever, due to their ecological, socioeconomic, and political diversity. Rodent ectoparasites can act as vectors for many of these pathogens. Knowledge of rodent ectoparasites is of prime importance in controlling rodent ectoparasite-borne zoonotic diseases in this region. The current systematic review and meta-analysis performs a comprehensive synthesis of the available knowledge, providing an evidence-based overview of the ectoparasites detected on rodents in Middle Eastern countries. Following a systematic search in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 113 published articles on rodent ectoparasites were studied and analyzed. A total of 87 rodent species were documented, from which <i>Mus musculus</i>, <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>, and <i>Rattus rattus</i> were found to be the most common. Fleas were the most reported ectoparasites (87 articles), followed by mites (53), ticks (44), and lice (25). <i>Xenopsylla cheopis</i>, <i>Polyplax spinulosa</i>, <i>Ornithonyssus bacoti</i>, and <i>Hyalomma rhipicephaloides</i> were the most commonly described fleas, lice, mites, and ticks, respectively. Based on the reviewed articles, the median flea, louse, mite, and tick indices were highest in Israel (4.15), Egypt (1.39), Egypt (1.27), and Saudi Arabia (1.17), respectively. Quantitative meta-analysis, using a random-effects model, determined the overall pooled flea prevalence in the Middle East as 40% (95% CI: 25-55, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), ranging between 13% (95% CI: 0-30, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 95%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) in Iran and 59% (95% CI: 42-77, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 75%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) in Israel. The overall pooled louse prevalence was found to be 30% (95% CI: 13-47, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), ranging between 25% in Iran (95% CI: 1-50, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 99%) and 38% in Egypt (95% CI: 7-68, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%). In the case of mites, the pooled prevalence in this region was 33% (95% CI: 11-55, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), where the country-specific prevalence estimates were 30% in Iran (95% CI: 4-56, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 99%) and 32% in Egypt (95% CI: 0-76, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%). For ticks, the overall prevalence was found to be 25% (95% CI: 2-47, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), ranging from 16% in Iran (95% CI: 7-25, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 74%) to 42% in Egypt (95% CI: 1-85, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 100%). The control of rodent ectoparasites should be considered to reduce their adverse effects. Using the One Health strategy, rodent control, and precisely control of the most common rodent species, i.e., <i>Mus musculus</i>, <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>, and <i>Rattus rattus</i>, should be considered to control the rodent-borne ectoparasites in this region.",

        "abstract": "The People's Republic of Bangladesh has been working to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis or Kala-azar cases since there was a memorandum of understanding signed between neighboring countries in 2005. As a part of the elimination activity, 44 cases of Kala-azar were diagnosed and treated in the regional referral center Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) during the last three years, which is reported here. Confirmed leishmaniasis cases were included. Patients attending this specialized center with different demographic characteristics and varied presentations with laboratory findings were reviewed and recorded in a structured case record form. Ethical clearance was obtained prior to starting the study. A total of 44 patients with leishmaniasis were reviewed. Approximately 89% (n = 39) were New Kala-azar (NKA), 7% (n = 3) were Relapse Kala-azar (Relapse KA), only one case (2%) was Kala-azar Treatment Failure (KATF) and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) for both. The mean age of presentation was 32 years. Forty percent of patients had houses made by mud, 26% by tin shed, and the rest lived in buildings and semi-buildings. The predominant clinical features were fever (90.9%), pallor (88.6%), splenomegaly (81.8%) and hepatomegaly (68.2%). rK39 was positive in 90.7% of cases, and 94.4% of cases were positive for LD bodies on splenic aspirate. Of all, 90.90% were treated with Inj. Liposomal amphotericin B and 9.10% with the combination of Inj. Liposomal Amphotericin B and Inj. Miltefosine.

This cross-sectional study was performed in Bangladesh to evaluate VL diagnostic tools including serology, buffy coat smear microscopy for LD body and various DNA-based techniques using buffy coat in 100 confirmed VL cases and 100 controls. The performance of tools against spleen smear (gold standard) was evaluated using kappa coefficient. Diagnostic precision and other inherent indicators were considered for index scoring (IS) of performance of tools using factor analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was formulated based on the IS and availability of the tools at different health care facilities of Bangladesh. A high level of agreement (kappa ≥  0.80) was observed for all the diagnostic tools. The highest kappa coefficients were found for rK39 RDT and rK39 ELISA (0.95), followed by ssuRNA-PCR (0.94), Buffy coat smear (0.93), rK28 ELISA (0.92), rK28 RDT (0.89), LAMP (0.89), Mini-exon PCR (0.86), ITS1 (0.85), and ITS2 PCR (0.80). rK39 RDT was found to be the best diagnostic test (IS: 1.7) followed by rK28 RDT (IS: 1.5), buffy coat smear microscopy (IS: 0.5), rK39 & rK28 ELISA (IS: 0.3), ssuRNA-PCR (IS: -0.7) and LAMP, Mini-exon, ITS1, & ITS2 PCR (IS: -0.9). rK39 RDT has been proposed as the best option for primary health care facilities, while buffy coat smear microscopy was found to be a good adjunct for confirmation of serology-positive cases and proposed for secondary and tertiary facilities. ssuRNA-PCR or LAMP can be an alternate confirmation tool only applicable to the tertiary facilities.",

Clinical case series document a 5% case fatality rate for kala-azar patients in the hospital as complication of the disease. Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Brazil and Sudan constitute five countries of the world where more than 90% of visceral leishmaniasis occurs. Mymensingh accounted for more than 50% of total kala-azar case reported in Bangladesh. This observational study was done at SKKRC under Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from 1st august 2013 to 28th February 2014, to find out various clinical features and hematological picture in visceral leishmaniasis. Total 100 diagnosed case of visceral leishmaniasis was taken. Among total patient male and female were nearly equally affected by kala-azar. All age group were affected by kala-azar from below 2 years to above 50 years. Poor people in the society were affected more by kala-azar. Mymensingh was the highest incidence of kala-azar among different district in Bangladesh. Pyrexia, pallor, weight loss were the main symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis. Abdominal distension, jaundice, vomiting, cough, bleeding manifestation were less frequent symptoms of kala-azar. Hepatosplenomegaly were the frequent sign of kala-azar. Majority of patient had anemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. ESR was frequently raised in kala-azar patient among those patient many had high ESR more than 100 mm in 1st hour. In conclusion prolong fever, progressive pallor, anorexia, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly in endemic area were the main clinical features of visceral leishmaniasis.

        "abstract": "Understanding of spatiotemporal transmission of infectious diseases has improved significantly in recent years. Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which additional estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyze longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on VL and PKDL infectiousness, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: 85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300 m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 mo for 88% of VL infectors, but up to 2.9 y for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0 to 6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced overall VL incidence by up to 25%. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally targeted interventions against VL.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by <i>Leishmania</i> protozoa that are transmitted by female sand flies. On the Indian subcontinent (ISC), VL is targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for elimination as a public health problem by 2020, which is defined as <1 VL case (new and relapse) per 10,000 population at district level in Nepal and sub-district level in Bangladesh and India. WHO is currently in the process of formulating 2030 targets, asking whether to maintain the 2020 target or to modify it, while adding a target of zero mortality among detected cases. The NTD Modelling Consortium has developed various mathematical VL transmission models to gain insight into the transmission dynamics of VL, identify the main knowledge gaps, and predict the feasibility of achieving and sustaining the targets by simulating the impact of varying intervention strategies. According to the models, the current target is feasible at the appropriate district/sub-district level in settings with medium VL endemicities (up to 5 reported VL cases per 10,000 population per year) prior to the start of the interventions. However, in settings with higher pre-control endemicities, additional efforts may be required. We also highlight the risk that those with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) may pose to reaching and sustaining the VL targets, and therefore advocate adding control of PKDL cases to the new 2030 targets. Spatial analyses revealed that local hotspots with high VL incidence remain. We warn that the current target provides a perverse incentive to not detect/report cases as the target is approached, posing a risk for truly achieving elimination as a public health problem although this is taken into consideration by the WHO procedures for validation. Ongoing modelling work focuses on the risk of recrudescence when interventions are relaxed after the elimination target has been achieved.",

As an alternative, we evaluated two rapid DNA extraction methods and determined their impact on the detection of the parasite DNA using our newly developed recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay. Skin samples were collected from suspected PKDL cases following their diagnosis through national guidelines. The extracted DNA from three skin biopsy samples using three different extraction methods was subjected to RPA and qPCR. The qPCR and RPA assays exhibited highest sensitivities when reference DNA extraction method using Qiagen (Q) kit was followed. In contrast, the sensitivity of the RPA assay dropped to 76.7% and 63.3%, respectively, when the boil & spin (B&S) and SpeedXtract (SE) rapid extraction methods were performed. Despite this compromised sensitivity, the B&S-RPA technique yielded an excellent agreement with both Q-qPCR (k = 0.828) and Q-RPA (k = 0.831) techniques. As expected, the reference DNA extraction method was found to be superior in terms of diagnostic efficacy.

However, a small portion of patients evolves with recurrence of kala-azar becoming symptomatic even after all available drug treatments. Kala-azar is not a formal indication for splenectomy in adults. Splenectomy is recommended as a saving measure, when kala-azar is associated with symptomatic hypersplenism and for drug-resistant cases. In the study, we report two cases of kala-azar with splenomegaly that presented several hospitalizations due to the recurrence of the kala-azar, in addition to hospitalizations for normalizing the blood count. After splenectomy, kala-azar cases and the effects of hypersplenism are cured. Thus, splenectomy should be seen as a surgical treatment option with a curative purpose in patients with recurrent kala-azar, in whom the possibilities of drug therapy have been exhausted and even so they progressed with hypersplenism and clinical repercussions.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by dimorphic Leishmania species is a parasitic disease with high socioeconomic burden in endemic areas worldwide. Sustaining control of VL in terms of proper and prevailing immunity development is a global necessity amid unavailability of a prophylactic vaccine. Screening of experimental proteome of the human disease propagating form of Leishmania donovani (amastigote) can be more pragmatic for in silico mining of novel vaccine candidates. By using an immunoinformatic approach, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-specific epitopes from experimentally reported L. donovani proteins having secretory potential and increased abundance in amastigotes were screened. A chimera linked with a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) peptide adjuvant was constructed and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, binding interaction with TLR4 in simulated physiological condition and the trend of immune response following hypothetical immunization. Selected epitopes from physiologically important L. donovani proteins were found mostly conserved in L. infantum, covering theoretically more than 98% of the global population. The multi-epitope chimeric vaccine was predicted as stable, antigenic and non-allergenic. Structural analysis of vaccine-TLR4 receptor docked complex and its molecular dynamics simulation suggest sufficiently stable binding interface along with prospect of non-canonical receptor activation. Simulation dynamics of immune response following hypothetical immunization indicate active and memory B as well as CD4+ T cell generation potential, and likely chance of a more Th1 polarized response. The methodological approach and results from this study could facilitate more informed screening and selection of candidate antigenic proteins for entry into vaccine production pipeline in future to control human VL.",

Identified genetic groups vary in heterozygosity and levels of linkage, suggesting different recombination histories. We characterise chromosome-specific patterns of aneuploidy and identified extensive structural variation, including known and suspected drug resistance loci. This study reveals greater genetic diversity than suggested by geographically-focused studies, provides a resource of genomic variation for future work and sets the scene for a new understanding of the evolution and genetics of the <i>Leishmania donovani</i> complex.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh, India, and Nepal aim for the elimination of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), a systemic parasitic infectious disease, as a public health problem by 2020. For decades, male patients have comprised the majority of reported VL cases in this region. By comparing this reported VL sex ratio to the one observed in population-based studies conducted in the Indian subcontinent, we tested the working hypothesis that mainly socio-cultural gender differences in healthcare-seeking behavior explain this gender imbalance. We compared the observed sex ratio of male versus female among all VL cases reported by the health system in Nepal and in the two most endemic states in India with that observed in population-based cohort studies in India and Nepal. Also, we assessed male sex as a potential risk factor for seroprevalence at baseline, seroconversion, and VL incidence in the same population-based data. The male/female ratio among VL cases reported by the health systems was 1.40 (95% CI 1.37-1.43). In the population cohort data, the age- and study site-adjusted male to female risk ratio was 1.27 (95% CI 1.08-1.51). Also, males had a 19% higher chance of being seropositive at baseline in the population surveys (RR 1.19; 95% CI 1.11-1.27), while we observed no significant difference in seroconversion rate between both sexes at the DAT cut-off titer defined as the primary endpoint. Our population-based data show that male sex is a risk factor for VL, and not only as a socio-cultural determinant. Biological sex-related differences likely play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.",

        "abstract": "The main clinical forms of leishmaniasis in Bangladesh are visceral leishmaniasis and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, which are caused by Leishmania donovani. Imported cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is emerging globally due mainly to increased human mobility. In recent years, several imported CL cases have also been reported in Bangladesh. Sporadic atypical cases of CL can be challenging for diagnosis and clinical management, while occurrence of infection on a frequent basis can be alarming. We report of a case of a Bangladeshi temporary-migrant worker who, upon return, presented development of skin lesions that are characteristic of CL. A serum sample was collected and tested with an rK39 immunochromatographic test. Nucleic acid from skin biopsy derived culture sample was extracted and screened with a real-time PCR assay which targets the conserved REPL repeat region of L. donovani complex. The internal transcribed spacer 2 region of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster was amplified and sequenced. The suspect had a history of travel in both CL and VL endemic areas and had a positive rK39 test result. Based on clinical presentation, travel history and demonstration of the parasite in the skin biopsy, CL was diagnosed and the patient underwent a combination therapy with Miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B. While typical endemic species were not detected, we identified Leishmania major, a species that, to our knowledge, has never been reported in Bangladesh. Proper monitoring and reporting of imported cases should be given careful consideration for both clinical and epidemiological reasons. Molecular tests should be performed in diagnosis to avoid dilemma, and identification of causative species should be prioritized.",

        "abstract": "To sustain the achievement of kala-azar elimination program (KEP), early detection and treatment of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases and associated modalities such as treatment failure (TF), relapse VL (RVL), and Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is the cornerstone. A predictive biomarker for VL development and related complications could also play a crucial role in curtailing disease incidence and transmission. Investigations to find a biomarker with prospective capabilities are, however, scarce. Using samples and known clinical outcomes generated within two previous longitudinal cohort studies, we aimed to determine if fluctuations in serum anti-rK39 antibody levels could provide such predictive value. Serum samples collected at four different time points (Baseline, 12, 18, and 24 months) from 16 patients who had developed VL within the monitoring period and 15 of their asymptomatic healthy controls counterparts were investigated. To investigate potential prediction of VL related complications, serum samples of 32 PKDL, 10 RVL, 07 TF, and 38 cured VL from a single dose AmBisome trial were analyzed. Of this second panel, all patients were monitored for 5 years and sera were collected at four time points (Baseline then 1, 6, and 12 months after treatment). The level of anti-rK39 antibodies in archived samples was measured by a semi-quantitative ELISA. The mean antibody level was significantly higher in VL patients compared to their asymptomatic healthy counterparts at each time point. Likewise, we observed a trend toward elevations in antibody levels for PKDL, RVL, TF relative to the reducing levels observed in cured VL. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis found a promising predictive power of rK39 antibody levels to reveal progression from asymptomatic <i>Leishmania donovani</i> infection stage to VL, defined as 87.5% sensitive and 95% specific. Following treatment, rk39 antibody notably showed 100% sensitivity and 95% specificity in predicting TF. Our data indicate that the relative quantity of serum anti-rK39 antibody has promise within either a predictive or prognostic algorithm for VL and VL-related modalities. These could enable VL control programs to implement more effective measures to eliminate the disease. Further research is, however, imperative to standardize the rK39 antibody ELISA between sites prior to broader use.",

Although the numbers of new reported cases of VL in Africa have been relatively stable for several years, the low numbers currently reported on the Indian subcontinent suggest a positive impact of new treatments and intervention strategies. In both regions, however, VL relapse and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) maintain infectious reservoirs and therefore present a threat to control programs. In this review, we outline the evolving appreciation of PKDL as an impactful disease in its own right and discuss the various diagnostic methods that can be applied for the detection and characterization of PKDL cases.

        "title": "Effect of insecticide-treated bed nets on visceral leishmaniasis incidence in Bangladesh. A retrospective cohort analysis.",
        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a parasitic disease, transmitted by the sand fly species Phlebotomus argentipes in the Indian sub-continent. Effective vector control is highly desirable to reduce vector density and human and vector contact in the endemic communities with the aim to curtail disease transmission. We evaluated the effect of long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLIN) and bed nets impregnated with slow-release insecticide tablet K-O TAB 1-2-3 (jointly insecticide-treated nets or ITN) on VL incidence in a highly endemic sub-district (upazila) in Bangladesh. Several distributions of LLIN or K-O TAB 1-2-3 for self-impregnation of bed nets at home took place in Fulbaria upazila, Mymensigh district from 2004 to 2008 under three research projects, respectively funded by CDC, Atlanta, USA (2004) and WHO-TDR, Geneva, Switzerland (2006 & 2008). We included all households (n = 8142) in the 20 villages that had benefited in the past from one of these interventions (1295 donated LLIN and 11,918 local bed nets impregnated with K-O TAB 1-2-3) in the \"exposed cohort\". We recruited a \"non-exposed cohort\" in villages with contemporaneously similar incidence rates who had not received such vector control interventions (7729 HHs from nine villages). In both cohorts, we visited all families house to house and ascertained any VL cases for the 3 year period before and after the intervention. We evaluated the incidence rate (IR) of VL in both cohorts as primary endpoint, applying the difference-in-differences method. The study identified 1011 VL cases (IR 140.47/10,000 per year [py]) before the intervention, of which 534 and 477 cases in the intervention and control areas respectively. The IR was 144.13/10,000 py (534/37050) and 136.59/10,000 py (477/34923) in the intervention and control areas respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.3901) before the intervention. After the intervention, a total of 555 cases (IR 77.11/10,000 py) were identified of which 178 (IR 48.04/10,000 py) in the intervention and 377 (107.95/10,000 py) in the control area. The intervention area had a significant lower IR than the control area during follow up, rate difference = -59.91, p<0.0001. The IR during follow up was significantly reduced by 96.09/10,000 py in the intervention area (p<0.0001) and 28.63/10,000 py in control area (p<0.0001) compared to baseline. There was a strong and significant overall effect of the ITN intervention, δ = -67.45, p <0.0001. Sex (OR = 1.36, p<0.0001) and age (OR = 0.99, p<0.0001) also had a significant effect on VL incidence. Male had a higher risk of VL than female and one year increase in age decreased the likelihood of VL by about 0.92%. Two third of the VL incidence occurred in the age range 2 to 30 years (median age of VL patients was 17 years). VL incidence rate was significantly lower in the ITN intervention cohort compared to control in Bangladesh. Some bias due to more intense screen-and-treat activities or other interventions in the intervention area cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, given their feasibility and sustainability, ITNs should be considered for integrated vector control during the maintenance phase of the VL elimination programme.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the relationship of treatment regimens for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and visceral leishmaniasis relapse (VLR) development. Study subjects included cohorts of patients cured of VL since treatment with monotherapy by sodium stibogluconate (SSG), miltefosine (MF), paromomycin intramuscular injection (PMIM), liposomal amphotericin B [AmBisome (AMB)] in a single dose (SDAMB) and in multidose (MDAMB), and combination therapies by AMB+PMIM, AMB+MF, and PMIM+MF. Follow up period was 4 years after treatment. Cohorts were prospective except SSG (retrospective) and MF (partially retrospective). We compared incidence proportion and rate in 100-person-4year of PKDL and VLR by treatment regimens using univariate and multivariate analysis. 974 of 984 enrolled participants completed the study. Overall incidence proportion for PKDL and VLR was 12.3% (95% CI, 10.4%-14.5%) and 7.0% (95% CI, 5.6%-8.8%) respectively. The incidence rate (95% CI) of PKDL and VLR was 14.0 (8.6-22.7) and 7.6 (4.1-14.7) accordingly. SSG cohort had the lowest incidence rate of PKDL at 3.0 (1.3-7.3) and VLR at 1.8 (0.6-5.6), followed by MDAMB at 8.2 (4.3-15.7) for PKDL and at 2.7 (0.9-8.4) for VLR. Development of PKDL and VLR is related with treatment regimens for VL. SSG and MDAMB resulted in less incidence of PKDL and VLR compared to other treatment regimens. MDAMB should be considered for VL as a first step for prevention of PKDL and VLR since SSG is highly toxic and not recommended for VL.",

        "abstract": "In the Indian subcontinent, infection with Leishmania donovani can cause fatal visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic variation in L. donovani is believed to occur rapidly from environmental changes and through selective drug pressures, thereby allowing continued disease occurrence in this region. All previous molecular markers that are commonly in use multilocus microsatellite typing and multilocus sequence typing, were monomorphic in L. donovani originating from the Indian subcontinent (with only a few exceptions) and hence are not suitable for this region. An multilocus sequence typing scheme consisting of a new set of seven housekeeping genes was developed in this study, based on recent findings from whole genome sequencing data. This new scheme was used to assess the genetic diversity amongst 22 autochthonous L. donovani isolates from Bangladesh. Nineteen additional isolates of the L. donovani complex (including sequences of L. donovani reference strain BPK282A1) from other countries were included for comparison. By using restriction fragment length polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer 1 region (ITS1-RFLP) and ITS1 sequencing, all Bangladeshi isolates were confirmed to be L. donovani. Population genetic analyses of 41 isolates using the seven new MLST loci clearly separated L. donovani from Leishmania infantum. With this multilocus sequence typing scheme, seven genotypes were identified amongst Bangladeshi L. donovani isolates, and these isolates were found to be phylogenetically different compared with those from India, Nepal, Iraq and Africa. This novel multilocus sequence typing approach can detect intra- and inter-species variations within the L. donovani complex, but most importantly these molecular markers can be applied to resolve the phylogenetically very homogeneous L. donovani strains from the Indian subcontinent. Four of these markers were found suitable to differentiate strains originating from Bangladesh, with marker A2P being the most discriminative one.",

Twenty nine male patients were included to observe the effect of miltefosine on reproductive health. All PKDL patients had history of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in different time periods. Among them three (10.3%) patients were unable to ejaculate semen. In semen analysis, 3 patients (10.3%) were found azoospermia (sperm count & motility- 0, viscosity- good, pH- 7 to 8), microscopically there was presence of RBC (5-15/HPF), WBC (8-15/HPF). Another 3 patients (10.3%) were found oligospermia (sperm count- 4.2 to 15.3 million/ml, motility- 20 to 50%, viscosity- good, pH- 6 to 9, RBC- 4 to 15/HPF, WBC- 4 to 15/HPF).

        "abstract": "Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) is one of the parasites that cause leishmaniasis. The mechanisms by which L. donovani fights against adverse environment and becomes resistant to drugs are not well understood yet. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of different regulators on the modulation of Transplasma Membrane Electron Transport (transPMET) systems of susceptible and resistant L. donovani cells. Effects of UV, different buffers, and electron transport inhibitors and stimulators on the reduction of α-lipoic acid (ALA), 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulphonic acid (NQSA) and ferricyanide were determined. ALA reductions were inhibited in susceptible, sodium antimony gluconate (SAG)-resistant and paromomycin (PMM)-resistant AG83 amastigote cells, and stimulated in susceptible and SAG-resistant AG83 promastigote cells upon UV exposure. The results indicate that UV irradiation almost oppositely affect ALA reductions in amastigotes and promastigotes. ALA reductions were stimulated in sensitive and inhibited in resistant GE1 amastigotes upon UV exposure. Susceptible amastigotes and promastigotes inhibited, and resistant amastigotes and promastigotes stimulated NQSA reduction under UV irradiation. Thus, susceptible and drug-resistant amastigotes and promastigotes are different in the reduction of ALA. Susceptible and resistant AG83 amastigotes and promastigotes inhibited the ferricyanide reductions upon UV exposure, which indicates, there is no such difference in ferricyanide reductions among susceptible as well as resistant AG83 amastigotes and promastigotes. The reductions of extracellular electron excerptors in susceptible promastigotes requires the availability of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions for maximal activity but susceptible amastigotes are mostly not dependent on the availability of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. Both in promastigotes and amastigotes, reductions of electron acceptors were strongly inhibited by carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. Furthermore, antimycin A, rotenone and capsaicin markedly inhibited the reductions of electron acceptors in promastigotes, but not in amastigotes. Results of this study suggest that the transPMET system is functionally different in wild and resistant strains of L. donovani.",

However, treatment response and adverse effect to anti-leishmanial drugs may vary across different populations and in Bangladesh the effect to amphotericin B deoxycholate for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis is still unknown. Therefore, there is a need to explore cure rate and adverse effects to amphotericin B deoxycholate to justify its use on visceral leishmaniasis patients in Bangladesh. Here we report 34 visceral leishmaniasis patients who received treatment with amphotericin B deoxycholate in the Surya Kanta Kala-azar Research Centre from December 2011 to June 2015. The dose of the treatment was 1 mg/kg body weight for 15 days followed up until 12 months after treatment. Response to amphotericin B deoxycholate treatment was excellent as all 34 patients achieved a final cure. Hypokalaemia (47%), shivering (47%), vomiting (35%) and acidity (15%) were most common adverse events. However, we did not observe any serious adverse events. Amphotericin B deoxycholate for relapse visceral leishmaniasis was found to be highly effective and safe. Our study justified to include amphotericin B deoxycholate as a second line drug for visceral leishmaniasis in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by vector-borne protozoans. In Sri Lanka, the cutaneous form of the disease is predominant, which is usually diagnosed using Giemsa-stained slit skin smear examination and by histology. However, the sensitivity of slit skin smears and histology are reportedly low. Moreover, facilities for the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are available only in a few highly-equipped parasitology laboratories. Therefore, there is a need for low cost, sensitive and specific screening tests for diagnosis of leishmaniasis at the point of need. In this study, a mobile suitcase laboratory applying novel extraction (SpeedXtract) and isothermal amplification and detection (recombinase polymerase amplification assay, RPA) methods were evaluated for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka. First, the developed assay was applied to three different sample types (punch biopsy, slit skin smears and fine needle aspirates) at a local hospital. The results showed that the 2 mm punch biopsy sample produced the best exponential amplification curve and early fluorescence signal in the RPA assay. Secondly, punch biopsies were collected from 150 suspected cutaneous leishmaniasis cases and screened with SpeedXtract/RPA, RNAlater/PCR and ATL buffer/PCR, in addition to Giemsa-stained slit skin smears. Fifty-seven samples were negative in all detection methods. In total 93 samples were positive with assay sensitivities of 65.5% (SpeedXtract/RPA), 63.4% (RNAlater/PCR) and 92.4% (ATL buffer/PCR). The Giemsa-stained slit skin smear delivered the worst clinical sensitivity (32.2%). The SpeedXtract/RPA method under field conditions took 35 min, while almost 8 h were needed to finalize the extraction and detection by PCR in the laboratory. The SpeedXtract/RPA method produced similar sensitivity to samples preserved in RNAlater and subjected to PCR amplification, but both were less sensitive than ATL-preserved samples subjected to PCR amplification. There is a need for a standardization of sample collection and nucleic acid extraction methods.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by the Leishmania donovani complex, is a fatal, neglected tropical disease that is targeted for elimination in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Improved diagnostic tests are required for early case detection and for monitoring the outcomes of treatments. Previous investigations using Leishmania lysate antigen demonstrated that the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 response is a potential indicator of a patient's clinical status after chemotherapy. IgG1 or IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with rK39 or lysate antigens and novel IgG1 rK39 rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were assessed with Indian VL serum samples from the following clinical groups: paired pre- and postchemotherapy (deemed cured); relapsed; other infectious diseases; and endemic, healthy controls. With paired pre- and post-treatment samples (n = 37 pairs), ELISAs with rK39- and IgG1-specific conjugates gave a far more discriminative decrease in post-treatment antibody responses when compared to IgG (P < .0001). Novel IgG1 rK39 RDTs provided strong evidence for decreased IgG1 responses in patients who had successful treatment (P < .0001). Furthermore, both IgG1 rK39 RDTs (n = 38) and ELISAs showed a highly significant difference in test outcomes between cured patients and those who relapsed (n = 23; P < .0001). RDTs were more sensitive than corresponding ELISAs. We present strong evidence for the use of IgG1 in monitoring treatment outcomes in VL, and the first use of an IgG1-based RDT using the rK39 antigen for the discrimination of post-treatment cure versus relapse in VL. Such an RDT may have a significant role in monitoring patients and in targeted control and elimination of this devastating disease.",

        "abstract": "Resolution of leishmanial infection is dependent on the coordinated interactions between components of cell mediated immune response, central to which is the activation of targeted T-cell populations for appropriate cytokine production and activation of infected cells. There is a correlation between the clinical outcome of Leishmania infection and the cytokine response profile. While a protective immune response against Leishmania has been clearly identified to be related to the influence of a type-l response and IFN-γ production, the precise role of T helper (TH) 2 cytokines in non-healing infections requires further exploration. Experimental evidence and clinical studies indicate multifaceted role of various factors leading to parasite survival and multiplication. In early stage of infection, generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates play significant role in curtailing the parasite multiplication. In later phase, hepatic resistance is expressed by the dominant role played by nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 gene regulation and on the other hand, production of inhibitors of NOS-2 gene expression, interleukin 10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) correlate well with reduced parasite killing. The hepatic infection is usually self-limiting due to production of multiple cytokine responses including moderate level of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) but in spleen excess TNF mediates destructive pathology. CD8+ T cells appear to play multiple roles comprising both cytotoxic activity and secretion of cytokines and chemokines. A better understanding of the innate and acquired immune functioning of the host could aid in rational control and better therapeutic intervention of the disease.",

        "abstract": "We compared the efficacy of three intervention packages for active case detection (ACD) of visceral leishmaniasis (VL)/post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) combined with sandfly control around an index case. The packages were 1) no kala-azar transmission activity involving indoor residual spraying (IRS) with deltamethrin, peri-domestic deployment of larvicide with temephos, and house-to-house search for cases; 2) fever camp (FC) plus durable wall lining (DWL) with deltamethrin; and 3) FC plus insecticide (deltamethrin) impregnated bed-nets (ITN) around an index case. Fever camp includes 1-day campaign at the village level to screen and diagnose VL, PKDL, leprosy, malaria, and tuberculosis among residents with chronic fever or skin disease. Efficacy was measured through yield of new cases, vector density reduction, and mortality at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following intervention. Fever camp + DWL was the most efficacious intervention package with 0.5 case detected per intervention, 79% reduction in vector density (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.21, <i>P</i> = 0.010), and 95.1% (95% confidence interval: 93.4%, 96.8%) sandfly mortality at 12 months. No kala-azar transmission activity was efficacious for vector control (74% vector reduction, IRR = 0.26, <i>P</i> < 0.0001 at 9 months; and 84% sandfly mortality at 3 months), but not for case detection (0 case per intervention). Fever camp + ITN was efficacious in detection of VL/PKDL cases (0.43 case per intervention), but its efficacy for vector control was inconsistent. We recommend index case-based FC for ACD combined with DWL or IRS plus larvicide for sandfly control during the consolidation and maintenance phases of the VL elimination program of the Indian subcontinent.",

        "abstract": "On the Indian subcontinent, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence is on track to reach elimination goals by 2020 in nearly all endemic districts. Although not included in official targets, previous data suggest post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients can act as an infection reservoir. We conducted xenodiagnosis on 47 PKDL patients and 15 VL patients using laboratory-reared Phlebotomus argentipes. In direct xenodiagnosis, flies were allowed to feed on the patient's skin for 15 minutes. For indirect xenodiagnosis, flies were fed through a membrane on the patient's blood. Five days later, blood-fed flies were dissected and examined by microscopy and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A 3-mm skin snip biopsy (PKDL) or venous blood (VL) was processed by quantitative PCR. Twenty-seven PKDL patients (57.4%) had positive results by direct and/or indirect xenodiagnosis. Direct was significantly more sensitive than indirect xenodiagnosis (55.3% vs 6.4%, P < .0001). Those with positive xenodiagnosis had median skin parasite loads >1 log10 unit higher than those with negative results (2.88 vs 1.66, P < .0001). In a multivariable model, parasite load, nodular lesions, and positive skin microscopy were significantly associated with positive xenodiagnosis. Blood parasite load was the strongest predictor for VL. Compared to VL, nodular PKDL was more likely and macular PKDL less likely to result in positive xenodiagnosis, but neither difference reached statistical significance. Nodular and macular PKDL, and VL, can be infectious to sand flies. Active PKDL case detection and prompt treatment should be instituted and maintained as an integral part of VL control and elimination programs.",

        "abstract": "Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a sequel to visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is found in VL-endemic countries including Bangladesh. Because of these enigmatic cases, the success of the National Kala-azar Elimination Program is under threat. To date, diagnostic methods for PKDL cases in endemic regions have been limited to clinical examination and rK39 test or microscopy, and a suitable and accurate alternative method is needed. In this study, we investigated the application of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a potential method for diagnosis of PKDL in comparison with microscopy. Ninety-one suspected macular PKDL cases from Mymensingh district, Bangladesh, were enrolled in the study after diagnosis by clinical examination and an rK39 strip test. All of them responded after completion of the treatment with miltefosine. During enrollment, a skin biopsy was done for each patient, and both microscopy and real-time PCR were performed for detection and quantification of <i>Leishmania donovan</i> body (LDB) and LD DNA, respectively. Real-time PCR detected 83 cases among all suspected PKDL patients, with an encouraging sensitivity of 91.2% (83.4%-96.1%), whereas microscopy showed 50.6% (39.9%-61.2%) sensitivity. Among all suspected PKDL cases, 42 cases were positive in both microscopy and qPCR, whereas 41 cases were detected as positive through qPCR only. This study provides evidence that real-time PCR is a promising tool for diagnosis of PKDL in endemic regions. In addition to diagnosis, the quantitative ability of this method could be further exploited for after-treatment prognosis and cure assessment of PKDL cases.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is characterised by a high degree of spatial clustering at all scales, and this feature remains even with successful control measures. VL is targeted for elimination as a public health problem in the Indian subcontinent by 2020, and incidence has been falling rapidly since 2011. Current control is based on early diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases, and blanket indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) in endemic villages to kill the sandfly vectors. Spatially targeting active case detection and/or IRS to higher risk areas would greatly reduce costs of control, but its effectiveness as a control strategy is unknown. The effectiveness depends on two key unknowns: how quickly transmission risk decreases with distance from a VL case and how much asymptomatically infected individuals contribute to transmission. To estimate these key parameters, a spatiotemporal transmission model for VL was developed and fitted to geo-located epidemiological data on 2494 individuals from a highly endemic village in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. A Bayesian inference framework that could account for the unknown infection times of the VL cases, and missing symptom onset and recovery times, was developed to perform the parameter estimation. The parameter estimates obtained suggest that, in a highly endemic setting, VL risk decreases relatively quickly with distance from a case-halving within 90m-and that VL cases contribute significantly more to transmission than asymptomatic individuals. These results suggest that spatially-targeted interventions may be effective for limiting transmission. However, the extent to which spatial transmission patterns and the asymptomatic contribution vary with VL endemicity and over time is uncertain. In any event, interventions would need to be performed promptly and in a large radius (≥300m) around a new case to reduce transmission risk.",

Indoor residual spraying (IRS) using dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was used by the national programme in the 1960s to control malaria. Despite findings of research trials demonstrating that the synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin 5 WP was very effective at reducing vector densities, no national VL vector control operations took place in Bangladesh between 1999 to early 2012. In 2012, IRS using deltamethrin 5 WP was re-introduced by the national programme, which consisted of pre-monsoon spraying in eight highly endemic sub-districts (upazilas). The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of IRS on VL vectors, as well as the process and performance of the spraying activities by national programme staff. Five highly endemic upazilas of Mymensingh district were purposively selected (Fulbaria, Trishal, Mukthagacha, Gaforgaon and Bhaluka) to conduct the present study using the WHO/TDR monitoring and evaluation tool kit. IRS operations, conducted by 136 squads/teams, and 544 spraymen, were observed using check lists and questionnaires included in the WHO/TDR monitoring and evaluation tool kit. A household (HH) acceptability survey of IRS was conducted in all study areas using a structured questionnaire in 600 HHs. To measure the efficacy of IRS, pre-IRS (two weeks prior) and post-IRS (at one and five months after), vector density was measured using CDC light traps for two consecutive nights. Bioassays, using the WHO cone-method, were carried out in 80 HHs (40 sprayed and 40 unsprayed) to measure the effectiveness of the insecticide on sprayed surfaces. Of the 544 spraymen interviewed pre-IRS, 60%, 3% and 37% had received training for one, two and three days respectively. During spraying activities, 64% of the spraying squads had a supervisor in 4 upazilas but only one upazila (Mukthagacha) achieved 100% supervision of squads. Overall, 72.8% of the spraying squads in the study upazilas had informed HHs members to prepare their houses prior to spraying. The required personal protective equipment was not provided by the national programme during our observations and the spraying techniques used by all sprayers were sub-standard compared to the standard procedure mentioned in the M&E toolkit. In the HH interviews, 94.8% of the 600 respondents said that all their living rooms and cattle sheds had been sprayed. Regarding the effectiveness measurements (i.e. reduction of vector densities), a total of 4132 sand flies were trapped in three intervals, of which 3310 (80.1%) were P. argentipes; 46.5% (1540) males and 53.5% (1770) females. At one month post-IRS, P. argentipes densities were reduced by 22.5% but the 5 months post-IRS reduction was only 6.4% for both male and female. The bioassay tests showed a mean corrected mortality of P. argentipes sand flies at one month post-IRS of 87.3% which dropped to 74.5% at 4 months post-IRS in three upazilas, which is below the WHO threshold level (80%). The national programme should conduct monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure high quality of IRS operations as a pre-condition for achieving a fast and sustained reduction in vector densities. This will continue to be important during the maintenance phase of VL elimination on the Indian subcontinent. Further research is needed to determine other suitable vector control option(s) when the case numbers are very low.",

The patients act as a reservoir for the causative parasite (i.e. Leishmania donovani) and thus should be diagnosed and treated with the utmost urgency to prevent the transmission of the disease. In this study, we tried to report the first instances of corneal complications supposedly associated with Miltefosine (MF), in PKDL patients and the probable pathophysiology of such events. The recently rejuvenated National Kala-azar Elimination Program in Bangladesh has put great emphasis on monitoring all the leishmaniasis patients to investigate possible adverse drug reactions (ADR). A total of 194 patients have received Miltefosine for the treatment of Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis. So far five patients were found to have developed unilateral ophthalmic complications during the periods from May 2016 to October 2017, after being treated with MF for PKDL. Unfortunately, one of whom had to go through complete evisceration of the affected eyeball. Despite the fact that MF is the only oral formulation of choice to treat PKDL, occurrences of such unexpected ADRs after MF administration urges the exploration of the pathogenesis of such incidents and determine measures to avert such occurrences from happening in future.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) also known as kala-azar (KA) is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and can be fatal in the absence of treatment. KA is highly endemic in Mymensingh region of Bangladesh. Although estimating the true incidence of VL may be difficult. The objective of the study was to evaluate clinico-haematological parameters in different groups of leishmaniasis cases. It was a cross-sectional descriptive type of study and was conducted in a research centre of Mymensingh, Bangladesh from February 2016 to January 2017. A total of 90 cases who were rk-39 strip test positive from five divisions of Bangladesh admitted to Research Centre were included for clinical and haematological parameters. All the cases were categorized into five different groups depending on the clinical case definition and Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using buffy coat preparation. The age of the study subjects ranged from 3 to 80 years. Mymensingh was the highest affected division (60%) and primary kala azar (PKA) cases were more than half of the study subjects. Fever was the most common feature (100%) in PKA, relapse kala azar (R-KA) and treatment failure kala azar (TF-KA) followed by splenomegaly (70.2%) in PKA, loss of appetite (62.9%) in R-KA, and skin pigmentation was observed (100%) in PKDL cases. Anaemia was present in 62.7%, leucopenia in 57.6% and thrombocytopenia in 61.7% PKA cases. Pancytopenia was observed in a total of 33 cases from all groups. There were no significant changes in serum bilirubin, SGPT and serum creatinine level. RT-PCR was performed in all cases and found positive in 30 (63.8%) PKA, 16 (59.3%) R-KA, 2 (100%) TF-KA and 2 (50%) R-KA associated with PKDL cases. Overall, VL cases were positive in 62.5% (50/80) and no PKDL cases were detected by buffy-coat RT-PCR. In endemic areas, the magnitude of the problem and limited resources of a developing country like ours, clinical characteristics and hematological parameters may also play important role for diagnosis of the clinical cases.",

        "abstract": "Adverse effects of antileishmanial drugs can affect patients' quality of life and adherence to therapy for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). In Bangladesh, there are 26 treatment centers that manage leishmaniasis cases coming from 100 endemic upazilas (subdistricts) of 26 districts (these include VL, PKDL, treatment failure, and relapse VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis cases). This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using focused pharmacovigilance for VL (VLPV) in Bangladesh's National Kala-azar Elimination Programme for the early detection and prevention of expected and unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This activity has been going on since December 2014. Activity area includes secondary public hospital or Upazila health complex (UHC) in hundred sub districts and Surya Kanta Kala-azar Research Center (SKKRC) in Mymensingh District, a specialized center for management of complicated VL and PKDL cases. Communicable Disease Control (CDC) of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) assigned twenty five of hundred UHCs and SKKRC (total 26) as treatment centers depending on their suitable geographical location. This was implemented for better management of VL cases with Liposomal Amphotericin B (AmBisome®) to ensure patient convenience and proper utilization of this expensive donated drug. A VLPV expert committee and a UHC VLPV team were established, an operational manual and pharmacovigilance report forms were developed, training and refresher training of health personnel took place at UHCs and at the central level, collected information such as patient data including demographics, treatment history and response, adverse events were analyzed. This report includes information for the period from December 2014 to December 2016. From December 2014 to December 2016, 1327 leishmaniasis patients were treated and 1066 (80%) were available for VLPV. Out of these, 57, 33, 9, and 1% were new VL, PKDL, VL relapse, and other cases, respectively. Liposomal amphotericin B was mostly used (82%) for case management, followed by miltefosine (20%) and paromomycin (3%). Out of the 1066 patients, 26% experienced ADRs. The most frequent ADR was fever (17%, 176/1066), followed by vomiting (5%, 51/1066). Thirteen serious adverse events (SAEs) (eight deaths and five unexpected SAEs) were observed. The expert committee assessed that three of the deaths and all unexpected SAEs were possibly related to treatment. Out of the five unexpected SAEs, four were miltefosine-induced ophthalmic complications and the other was an AmBisome®-induced avascular necrosis of the nasal alae. The Directorate General of the Drug Administration entered the ADRs into the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) VigiFlow database. This study found that VLPV through NKEP is feasible and should be continued as a routine activity into the public health system of Bangladesh to ensure patient safety against anti-leishmanial drugs.",

        "abstract": "The sand fly Phlebotomus argentipes is the vector for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Indian sub-continent. In Bangladesh since 2012, indoor residual spraying (IRS) was applied in VL endemic areas using deltamethrin. In Nepal, IRS was initiated in 1992 for VL vector control using lambda-cyhalothrin. Irrational use of insecticides may lead to vector resistance but very little information on this subject is available in both countries. The objective of this study was to generate information on the susceptibility of the vector sand fly, P. argentipes to insecticide, in support of the VL elimination initiative on the Indian sub-continent. Susceptibility tests were performed using WHO test kits following the standard procedures regarding alpha cypermethrin (0.05%), deltamethrin (0.05%), lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%), malathion (5%) and bendiocarb (0.1%) in six upazilas (sub-districts) in Bangladesh. In Nepal, the tests were performed for two insecticides: alpha cypermethrin (0.05%) and deltamethrin (0.05%). Adult P. argentipes sand flies were collected in Bangladesh from six VL endemic upazilas (sub-districts) and in Nepal from three endemic districts using manual aspirators. The results show that VL vectors were highly susceptible to all insecticides at 60 minutes of exposure in both countries. In Bangladesh, corrected mortality was 100% at 15 minutes as well as 30 minutes of exposure. The study sites in Nepal, however, showed some diverse results, with a mortality rate less than 90% for 15 minutes of exposure with alpha cypermethrin and deltamethrin in two districts but was above 95% after 30 minutes of exposure. These results suggest that the insecticides tested can still be used in the national programmes of Bangladesh and Nepal. However, insecticide rotation should be performed to mitigate the possible development of insecticide resistance. Periodic susceptibility tests should be performed by the countries to get timely alerts regarding insecticide resistance.",

BLASTn analysis identified 150 reads with high similarity with parasites from 19 different genera. In particular, we detected sequences of Babesia spp. in five dogs; consistent with this, a previous study using conventional PCR showed that four of these dogs were positive for B. gibsoni. Several reads with similarity to Leishmania and filarial nematodes were also identified. These findings indicate that cfDNA in blood can be a potential screening marker for identifying parasite diversity in dogs.",

This gold standard diagnostic method uses a technically challenging microscopy procedure that is often not accessible in many places in the world where VL is endemic. Here, we report the current systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether urine is a reliable clinical sample for diagnosis of human VL. Data were extracted from ten available databases during the period from 2002 to 2017. Overall, 29 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction in this systematic review. Most studies (72.4%) using urine specimens were reported from five countries: India 6 (20.7%), Iran 5 (17.2%), Bangladesh 4 (13.8%), Japan 3 (10.3%) and Spain 3 (10.3%), respectively. The most common diagnostic tests performed on urine were Katex (62.1%), ELISA (24.1%), and the rK39 (17.2%) assays. In meta-analysis the sensitivity and specificity of the three most commonly used diagnostic assays were rK39 (97%; CI: 91-99; 98%;76-100), ELISA (91%; 82-95; 99%; CI: 94-100), and Katex (83%; 73-90; 98%; 98-100), suggesting that the rK39 assay provided the highest sensitivity and the ELISA assay provided the highest specificity for diagnosis of VL from urine samples. Our findings suggest that urine is a valuable clinical sample for the diagnosis of human VL, particularly in areas where the gold standard test for VL is not available.",

The traditionally accepted relationships between the causative species of Leishmania and the resultant disease phenotype have been challenged during recent years and have underscored the importance of revisiting the previously established taxonomy with revisions to its classification. The weak voice of the afflicted with decades of neglect by scientists and policy makers have led to the miserably inadequate and slow advancements in product development in the fields of diagnostics, chemotherapeutics and vector control that continue to hinder the effective management and control of this infection. Limitations notwithstanding, the regional drive for the elimination of VL initiated over a decade ago that focused on India, Nepal and Bangladesh, the three main afflicted countries in the Indian subcontinent is therefore, commendable, with the subsequent status reviews and restructuring of strategies possibly even more so. However, the renewed efforts would need to be combined with plans to combat new challenges in the South-Asian region that includes the emergence of atypical parasite variants, in order to realistically achieve the set goal of regional elimination of VL.",

Here, single-dose liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) has been adopted as a first-line regimen for VL; however the effectiveness and safety of AmBisome for PKDL has not been formally evaluated. The safety and effectiveness of AmBisome 15 mg/kg, given over 15 days in 5 biweekly infusions of 3 mg/kg on an outpatient basis, was evaluated between April and November 2014 in patients with clinically diagnosed PKDL, aged ≥12 years and residing in a highly VL-endemic area in Bangladesh. This was a prospective cohort observational study, with the objective to assess final cure 12 months after treatment. Clinical response was monitored at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and safety during treatment and up to 1 month after treatment. Of the 280 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 273 were assessed at 12 months. A complete or major improvement of lesions was seen in 245 patients (89.7%); 213 (78.0%) were considered completely cured. Lesions did not improve in 28 (10.3%) and new lesions appeared in 13 (4.8%). All patients completed treatment without severe or serious adverse events. A short-course 15-mg/kg AmBisome regimen proved safe and effective in the treatment of clinically diagnosed PKDL in Bangladesh, and should be considered a treatment option for routine programmatic use in the VL elimination effort in the Indian subcontinent.",
