Key steps in the dissemination will include \npresenting the recommendations at international conferences; conducting workshops \nto support regional and country adaptation; rapidly developing adaptation tools to help \ncountries set priorities for resource allocation so as to facilitate full implementation over \ntime; and conducting briefings and joint planning for dissemination with international and \nnational implementing partners. \nMonitoring of implementation will rely on the Gl",

Process for \ndeveloping the guidelines\nA1.1 Overview\nThese guidelines were developed in accordance with procedures established by the WHO \nGuidelines Review Committee. The recommendations in these guidelines are based on the \nGRADE approach to reviewing evidence and formulating recommendations. Consistent with \nprevious WHO guidelines, these guidelines employ a public health approach that considers \neffectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and resource needs across a variety of settings. \nAll external contributors to the guidelines, including members of the Guideline Development \nGroup (GDG) and the External Review Group (ERG), completed a WHO declaration of interests \nform in accordance with WHO policy for experts (Web Annex A).\nThe systematic reviews on lenacapavir for HIV prevention and on HIV testing strategies \nfor injectable long-acting PrEP followed research questions in population, intervention, \ncomparator, outcome (PICO) format. \nThe system",

The contexts surrounding migration across all its \nphases profoundly affect health outcomes. Health systems must, therefore, be adaptive and inclusive, \nintegrating refugees and migrants within the broader health system responses as well as within health \nsystem strengthening interventions.\nThe WHO 14th General Programme of Work emphasizes the need to address the social, economic and \nenvironmental determinants of health and to strengthen prevention approaches by acting on the root \ncauses of ill health.

These efforts are crucial to \npromoting and protecting the health of all individuals, including displaced and migrant populations.\nIn today's rapidly changing world, the pace of climate change and environmental degradation has \naccelerated, emerging as an escalating threat to human health. Extreme weather events and rising global \ntemperatures are increasing in frequency, intensity and duration, disproportionately affecting regions and \npopulations in vulnerable situations including refugees, migrants and other displaced groups. Climate \nhazards impact health both directly and indirectly, exacerbating noncommunicable diseases, increasing \nthe emergence and spread of climate-sensitive diseases and increasing health emergencies.\nClimate change is a risk multiplier, intensifying human migration and displacement and impacting \npopulation health through stressors such as extreme weather, prolonged droughts and env",

Introduction\n1.1 Focus of this review\nThis review in the Global Evidence Review on Health and Migration (GEHM) series addresses health \nsystem strengthening at the nexus of health, climate change, migration and displacement. Specifically, \nit examines how health systems are responding to the emerging health needs of displaced and migrant \npopulations in the context of climate change. The review addresses the following question: what are the \nhealth system interventions to improve the health of displaced and migrant populations in the context of \nclimate change?\nThe Glossary outlines the definitions used in this review, which includes the working definitions of a \nclimate migrant as set out by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in its definition of climate \nmigration (\"for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment due to climate change\"); the \nreview also considers populations that have mo",

In this GEHM, the populations have been \nidentified as climate migrants when reported as such in the texts and are referred to more generally as \nclimate affected when they were identified as displaced (irrespective of the reason) and exposed to climate-\nrelated health risks. This is an evolving field of research; therefore, definitions may continue to evolve. This \nis also discussed further in the limitations (section 3.1.2).\nIn this report, migrant-inclusive health systems describes health systems that consciously and \nsystematically incorporate the health and wider needs of migrants into policy, planning, implementation \nand evaluation.

The recommendations apply to pregnant women, sexually active adolescents and \nyoung people, sex workers and men who have sex with men (Table 1). \nThe recommendations are based on the combined prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at a \npopulation level. For sexually active adolescents and young people, a high prevalence in a setting is suggested \nto be about 15–20% combined for both infections. For pregnant women, due to the adverse health effects \non infants, a combined prevalence of 10% in a setting may be considered high.
