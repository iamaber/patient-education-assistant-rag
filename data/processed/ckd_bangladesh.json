        "title": "Prevalence and Associated Factors of Prediabetes and Diabetes in Rural and Peri-Urban Bangladesh: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Background and objectives The global burden of prediabetes and diabetes is rising rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, where lifestyle and nutritional transitions are accelerating. Economically disadvantaged rural populations often lack awareness and access to care, making them highly vulnerable. Measuring the prevalence and identifying associated factors is essential for guiding public health strategies and resource allocation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi community to inform targeted prevention and control strategies. Methodology We recruited 891 adults for this cross-sectional study in January-June 2020 through random sampling from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System in Bangladesh, ensuring at least five years of residency. Trained Community Health Workers collected sociodemographic data using a semi-structured questionnaire and performed physical examination and anthropometric measurements. We used fasting blood sugar to screen patients for prediabetes and diabetes, and measured serum creatinine and urine albumin to creatinine ratio to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also collected blood samples to measure serum albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood and urine samples were tested in an accredited laboratory. Results Prevalence of prediabetes was 38% (n=343), and diabetes was 17% (n=151). Age-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 5%, 12% and 22%, and of diabetes were 1%, 3% and 13%, for the age groups of 18-30, 31-45, and ≥46 years, respectively. Sex-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 22% and 17%, and diabetes were 9% and 8%, for female and male participants, respectively. In multiple multinomial logistic regression, for prediabetes, significant risk factor was age ≥31 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.84, 95%CI 1.64-4.92), and protective factors were smokeless tobacco use (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.94) and hypoalbuminemia (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.24-0.99), and for diabetes, significant risk factors were age ≥31 years (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 1.37-11.95), abdominal obesity (aOR 2.80, 95%CI 1.49-5.30), CKD (aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.70-4.62), hypercholesterolemia (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.17-3.30) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.44-3.79), and protective factors were being female (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.066-0.68), and smokeless tobacco user (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.63). Conclusion This study reveals a high burden of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi population. The findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen community-based screening and targeted prevention strategies to address the growing diabetes burden in underserved areas.",

        "title": "Late outcomes of Viabahn self-expandable covered stent for the elective treatment of popliteal artery aneurysms.",
        "abstract": "In the present study we aim to evaluate in detail the late outcomes of the overall endovascular cohort of the PARADE study, with a focus on factors that could influence such outcomes as these may provide useful insights for patients and clinicians alike. Between January 2010 and December 2023 patients with non-acute elective PAAs undergoing endovascular exclusion with the Viabahn stent-graft were included in a multicenter retrospective cohort study (40 sites from 10 countries). A cut-off of 15 procedures was used to define a participating center as \"high-volume\" (>15) or \"low-volume\" (<15). During the 14-year studied period, 326 patients were treated who met inclusion criteria for the present study. Patients were predominantly male (304, 93.3%) with a mean age of 74.6 ± 9.2 years. Most of patients were asymptomatic (221, 67.8%), whilst 56 (17.2%) had intermittent claudication, and 49 (15%) CLTI. Acute technical success was not obtained in 2 cases (0.6%), due to residual type Ia endoleak (1 case), and residual type Ib endoleak (1 case), Of these, one patient received an open conversion, whereas the other one was followed up because unfit for any type of reintervention. At 30 days, 2 patients died with an overall 30-day mortality rate of 0.6%. Both were not cardiovascular deaths related to interventions. In addition, 30-day rates of MACE, graft occlusion, and procedure-related reinterventions were 1.2%, 3.7%, and 5.2%, respectively. No patient underwent early major amputation. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency, secondary patency, freedom from reinterventions(s), and amputation-free survival were 65.8% (95% CI: 61.7% to 71.9%), 84.9% (95% CI: 78.7% to 89.1%), 70.5% (95% CI: 66.2% to 74.8%), and 98.2% (95% CI: 96.4% to 99.6%), respectively. Amputation-free survival was adversely affected by active smoking (p = .011), chronic kidney disease (p < .001), poor run-off status (p = .042), and low number of cases for each center (<15) (p = .011). Multivariate analysis reported an approaching significance for active smoking (HR 3.460, 95% CI 2.6 to 6.1, p = .051), and confirmed the association with chronic kidney disease (HR 7.413, 95% CI 5.4 to 9.3, p = .006). The findings from this study show that endovascular repair using the Viabahn stent-graft may provide a feasible technical option for elective treatment of PAA. Some patient-related and procedure-related factors were identified, including chronic kidney disease, that were associated with higher rates of long-term complications.",

        "abstract": "Background Normal kidney function is essential for maintaining good health. The objective of the study was to explore the association between socio-demographic characteristics and body mass index (BMI) with serum uric acid, urea, and creatinine levels among women of reproductive age (WRA) in selected areas of Bangladesh. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 178 WRA in selected districts of Bangladesh. Data on demographic, socioeconomic, and anthropometric variables were collected. Blood samples were collected, processed, stored, and analyzed using the DIALAB GmbH semi-automatic biochemistry analyzer DTN-405 (Austria) to measure uric acid, urea, and creatinine. Results The study found that 42 women (23.6%) were underweight, while 35 (19.7%) were classified as overweight or obese. The average (mean ± SD) serum levels (mg/dL) were 5.74 ± 2.07 for uric acid, 17.93 ± 9.83 for urea, 0.89 ± 0.28 for creatinine, and 92.18 ± 35.86 mL/min/1.73 m² for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Elevated levels of creatinine, uric acid, and urea were observed in 47 (27%), 56 (31.5%), and 73 (41%) participants, respectively. Additionally, chronic kidney disease (CKD) was identified in 32 individuals (18%). Overall, normal kidney function markers were found in 55 participants (about 31%), while 9 participants (about 5%) showed elevated levels for all three markers. The odds of having one or more elevated kidney function markers were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.22-6.42; p < 0.05) among individuals with a BMI greater than 18.5 kg/m² compared to underweight women. After adjusting for related factors, BMI was found to be significantly associated with the risk of elevated kidney function markers. Conclusion Only one-third of the WRA displayed normal kidney function indicators, and BMI demonstrated a significant non-linear relationship with one or more elevated kidney function indicators, even within the normal BMI range. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to gain deeper insights.",

        "title": "In-hospital mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a tertiary care hospital in Dhaka City: a retrospective cohort study.",
        "abstract": "In-hospital mortality during COVID-19 treatment is a crucial metric used to assess the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of medical interventions. By identifying mortality risk factors, we aim to inform policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve preparedness for future pandemics. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Data were gathered from the hospital's electronic medical records between July 2021 and September 2021. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 218 patients with complete medical records were selected for the analysis. The independent variables examined included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. To assess in-hospital mortality, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis employing the Delta method. The study included 218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, primarily male (51.4%) with an average age of 56.4 years (standard deviation of 15 years). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 18.3%. Older age (≥60) (RR:3.10, 95% CI: 1.16-8.29), long-standing hypertension (≥5 years) (RR:2.78, 95% CI:1.54-5.02), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR:4.43, 95% CI:2.93-6.70) were significant risk factors for mortality. Patients with diabetes (≥3 years) had a moderately increased risk (RR:1.68, 95% CI: 1.01-2.83). Notably, shorter hospital stays (≤7 days) were associated with higher mortality, potentially due to delayed treatment initiation. Moreover, Vaccinated patients have a significantly lower risk of death (RR: 0.07) compared to unvaccinated patients, highlighting the protective effect of vaccination. Greater lung involvement (especially in lower lobes) and higher Total Severity Scores (TSS ≥ 14) strongly predict COVID-19 mortality, with non-survivors exhibiting significantly worse radiographic damage. Age, particularly when combined with chronic conditions like hypertension or chronic kidney disease, is a key predictor of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. While gender is not an independent risk factor, males tend to have higher mortality rates. Delayed treatment, reflected by shorter hospital stays, also increases risk. Vaccination markedly lowers mortality. In resource-limited settings, lower lobe involvement >50% and TSS ≥ 14 can serve as early triage markers to guide ICU admission or intensified care. These indicators should inform risk assessment tools, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to reduce pandemic-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents the third most common stroke type with unique etiologies, risk factors, diagnostics, and treatments. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "title": "Deep learning for early detection of chronic kidney disease stages in diabetes patients: A TabNet approach.",
        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a significant risk for diabetes patients, often leading to severe complications. Early and accurate CKD stage detection is crucial for timely intervention. However, it remains challenging due to its asymptomatic progression, the oversight of routine CKD tests during diabetes checkups, and limited access to nephrologists. This study aimed to address these challenges by developing a multiclass CKD stage prediction model for diabetes patients using longitudinal data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. A novel iterative backward feature selection strategy was employed to determine key predictors of the CKD stage. TabNet, an attention-based deep learning architecture, was used to build classification models in complete and simplified categories. The complete model used 31 features, including complex kidney biomarkers, while the simplified model used 15 features readily available from routine checkups. The performance of TabNet was compared against traditional tree-based ensemble methods (XGBoost, random forest, AdaBoost) and a multi-layer perceptron. Model-specific and model-agnostic explainable AI (XAI) techniques were applied to interpret model decisions, enhancing the transparency and clinical applicability of the proposed approach. The TabNet models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.06 % and 92.71 % accuracy in cross-validation for the complete and simplified models, respectively, and 91.00 % and 88.00 % accuracy on test sets. XAI analysis identified serum creatinine, cystatin C, sex, and age as the most influential factors in CKD stage classification. The proposed TabNet models offer a robust approach for early CKD severity detection in diabetes patients, potentially improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The global burden of chronic diseases is increasing and becoming a public health issue throughout the world. The use of telenursing is increasing significantly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to treat and prevent chronic diseases. Telenursing is growing in many countries to reduce health care costs, increase the number of aging and chronically ill populations, and increase health care coverage to distant, rural, small, or sporadically populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help to solve increasing shortages of nurses, reduce distances, save travel time, and keep patients out of the hospital. The objective of this study is to apply the self-management telenursing program and telenursing system developed by the researchers to Bangladesh and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy (improved diabetes control in participants). This is a pilot, quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study. Diabetes patients who will attend the Grameen Primary Health Centers (PHCs) in Bangladesh will be enrolled between September 2024 and August 2025. We include patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, both sexes, ages 18-75 years old, all types of treatment, willing to participate and give us consent. We exclude patients who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, diabetes as a secondary cause, complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is less than 7% for the past 1 year with CKD stage 1 or 2, no complications or complications with good control, having enough knowledge (had education before) and implemented good practice regarding diabetes management assessed by the research nurses, and disabled persons who need other person's support for daily living. The sample size was calculated and found 70. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The study protocol got approval from the National Research Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC/NREC/2022-2025/336) on September 08, 2024. The outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of telenursing intervention by controlling HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The project was funded in 2024. The enrollment of the participants started on October 26, 2024, and the required sample (n=70) enrollment was completed in February 2025. Data analysis will be started after completion of data collection and results will be expected to be submitted for publication in 2026. Diabetic patients will acquire disease-specific management skills. Setting and monitoring goals ensures the continuation of the desired behavior and gives the patients control over their lifestyle. After developing self-management skills, patients assess their lab data and lifestyles including diet, and understand their condition so that they can work with their physiological data by acquiring knowledge of both the disease and self-care. By making self-supported decisions, the patients will be able to manage their diet, exercise, and medication. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06632652; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06632652.

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of liver cirrhosis worldwide. While hepatic complications are well-documented, extra-hepatic manifestations such as secondary amyloidosis are less common and can lead to diverse and complex clinical outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic hepatitis B who progressed to liver cirrhosis and presented with chronic, unexplained, intractable diarrhea unresponsive to standard treatments. He also experienced significant unintentional weight loss and generalized weakness. Further investigations revealed amyloid deposition in the duodenum, confirming secondary amyloidosis affecting the gastrointestinal tract as the cause of malabsorption. Persistent diarrhea and malabsorption necessitated nutritional support and symptomatic management. This case highlights the rare association between chronic liver disease (CLD), secondary amyloidosis, and malabsorption syndrome, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial to managing these complex cases, improving outcomes, and preventing further complications.",

        "abstract": "The global prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is increasing despite optimal management of traditional risk factors such as hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. This study examines the influence of cardiorenal risk factors, socioeconomic status, and ethnic and cardiovascular comorbidities on ESKD outcomes in the general population. This cross-sectional study analysed data from 502,408 UK Biobank study participants recruited between 2006 and 2010. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to assess risk factors for ESKD, with results presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 1191 (0.2%) of the study participants reported ESKD. Diabetes increased ESKD risk by 62% [1.62 (1.36-1.93)], with early-onset diabetes (before age 40) conferring higher odds compared to later-onset (after age 40) [2.26 (1.57-3.24)]. Similarly, early-onset hypertension (before age 40), compared to later onset (after age 40), increased ESKD odds by 73% [1.73 (1.21-2.44)]. Cardiovascular comorbidities, including stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction and angina, were strongly associated with ESKD [5.97 (3.99-8.72), 5.35 (4.38-6.56), 4.94 (3.56-6.78), and 4.89 (3.47-6.81)], respectively. Males were at 22% higher risk of ESKD than females [1.22 (1.04-1.43)]. Each additional year of diabetes duration increased ESKD odds by 2% [1.02 (1.01-1.03)]. Non-white ethnicity, compared to white and socioeconomically most deprived, compared to the least deprived quintiles, were at 70% and 83% higher odds of ESKD. Each unit of HbA1c rise increased the odds of ESKD by 2%. Compared to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria increased the odds of ESKD by almost 10-fold [9.47 (7.95-11.27)] while normoalbuminuria reduced the odds by 73% [0.27 (0.22-0.32)]. Early onset of diabetes and hypertension, male sex, non-white ethnicity, deprivation, poor glycaemic control, and prolonged hyperglycaemia are significant risk factors for ESKD. These findings highlight the complexity of ESKD and the need for multifactorial targeted interventions in high-risk populations. Not applicable.",

        "title": "Status of Lipid Profile among Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.",
        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing threat for health-care systems in the world. Primary causes of CKD are diabetes and vascular diseases. So, optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction, treatment of albuminuria, avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and adjustments to drug dosing. Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hypocalcemia, hyper-kalemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic acidosis, hyper-phosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyper-parathyroidism and anaemia. This cross-sectional study was executed in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2022 to June 2023. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. A sum of 120 subjects was included in this study. Out of them, 60 were selected as case of CKD patients and another 60 apparently normal healthy persons were selected as control. In this study, serum lipid profile was measured for analytical study. All the values were showed as mean±SD and these were serum TC were 149.85±38.84 in Group I and 178.92±41.85mg/dl in Group II; Serum TG were 122.77±36.88 in Group I and 175.93±63.50mg/dl in Group II; Serum LDL-C were 95.13±24.43 in Group I and 115.60±45.62 mg/dl in Group II and Serum HDL-C were 48.62±8.70 and 41.55±2.79mg/dl in Group I and Group II respectively. Statistical analysis was done by using statistical package for social science (SPSS), windows package version 26.0. The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control was evaluated using Student's unpaired 't' test. After careful evaluation, the present study found that mean serum total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG) and Low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) level were significantly increased and High density lipoprotein (HDL-C) level were significantly decreased in CKD patients.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "abstract": "HIV transmission and infection among dialysis patients have become a major healthcare concern and a rising threat throughout the world. Our current systematic review and meta-analysis targeted to determine the global epidemiologic state of HIV infection among dialysis patients. Three online databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect were searched for eligible studies using specific keywords. 15 studies matched our eligibility criteria and were included in the study. The worldwide pooled prevalence of HIV among dialysis patients was 0.8% (95% CI 0.4 to 1.2) with a high degree of heterogeneity (95%) among the included studies. Substantial variations in pooled prevalence were found among different continents in our subgroup analysis. Africa (21.1%, 95% CI 6.4 to 35.8) and North America (19.3%, 95% CI 0.0 to 39.8) had a higher prevalence of HIV in dialysis patients whereas in Europe (0.3%, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6), South America (0.7%, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.6) and Asia (0.7%, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.6) the frequency was much lower. Perhaps, due to the lack of awareness and preventive knowledge, insufficient healthcare facilities and breaches in infection control protocols in dialysis centers, risky attitudes and practices immigration issues the prevalence of HIV among dialysis patients in Africa and North America enhanced as compared to that of Europe, Asia and South America. Strict adherence to HIV preventive practices, raising public awareness, and advanced healthcare systems are suggested to reduce the prevalence of HIV among dialysis patients all over the world.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as obesity, are risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease. The renal impacts of glucose-lowering and weight-lowering drugs and their potential benefits in preventing CKD often guide clinicians in choosing them appropriately. Only limited data based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is currently available on the renal effects and safety profile of tirzepatide. To explore the renal benefits and safety of tirzepatide <i>vs</i> controls. RCTs involving patients receiving tirzepatide for any indication in the intervention arm and placebo or active comparator in the control arm were searched through multiple electronic databases. The co-primary outcomes were percent change from baseline (CFB) in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and absolute CFB in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>); the secondary outcome was tirzepatide's renal safety profile. RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as mean differences (MD) or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Fifteen RCTs (<i>n</i> = 14471) with mostly low risk of bias (RoB) were included. Over 26-72 weeks, tirzepatide 10 mg [MD -26.95% (-40.13, -13.76), <i>P</i> < 0.0001] and 15 mg [MD -18.03% (-28.58, -7.47), <i>P</i> = 0.0008] were superior to placebo in percent reductions of UACR. Tirzepatide, at all doses, outperformed insulin in percent reductions of UACR. Compared to the placebo, the percent UACR reduction was greater in subjects with T2D than those with obesity but without T2D (MD -33.25% <i>vs</i> -7.93%; <i>P</i> = 0.001). The CFB in eGFR with all doses of tirzepatide was comparable [5 mg: MD 0.36 (-1.41, 2.14); 10 mg: MD 1.17 (-0.22, 2.56); 15 mg: MD 1.42 (-0.04, 2.88)]; <i>P</i> > 0.05 for all] <i>vs</i> insulin. Tirzepatide (pooled and separate doses) did not increase the risks of adverse renal events, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, acute kidney injury, and renal cancer compared to the placebo, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Short-term data from RCTs with low RoB suggests that tirzepatide positively impacts UACR without detrimental effects on eGFR in subjects with T2D and obesity without T2D, with a reassuring renal safety profile. Larger RCTs are warranted to prove the longer-term renal benefits of tirzepatide, which might also prevent eGFR decline and worsening of CKD.",

        "abstract": "We present a case of a 64-year-old male with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), characterized by systemic involvement, including renal, hepatic, and neurological complications. The patient presented with persistent micturition difficulties, hematuria, and abdominal pain, compounded by hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Imaging revealed bilateral renal enlargement with hemorrhagic cysts, a kidney stone, and hepatic cysts causing hepatomegaly. Neurological evaluation identified chronic and recent intracerebral hemorrhages associated with poorly controlled hypertension, underscoring ADPKD's multisystem impact. ADPKD, caused by PKD1 or PKD2 mutations, often leads to progressive renal dysfunction, hypertension, and extrarenal manifestations such as hepatic cysts and intracranial aneurysms. Advances like tolvaptan demonstrate efficacy in slowing renal disease progression, while somatostatin analogs offer promise for hepatic cyst management. This case emphasizes the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach, including strict blood pressure control, regular imaging, and pharmacological intervention, to address ADPKD's complexities and optimize patient outcomes. Early diagnosis and vigilant monitoring remain crucial for preventing complications and enhancing quality of life. This report underscores the importance of integrated care in managing ADPKD, highlighting emerging therapies and the ongoing need for personalized treatment strategies in such challenging cases.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a significant impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of affected individuals due to its progressive and disabling nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the HRQoL and its predictors among CKD patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out at kidney foundation Hospital and research Institute at Dhaka, Bangladesh. Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL™ -36) questionnaire were used to measure the HRQoL of CKD patients. The study also used kidney-targeted KDQoL-36 Summary Score (KSS). Socio-demographic and medical records were also collected. Descriptive statistics, and multiple linear regression were performed. Out of 430 patients, 77.9% were in moderate to advanced stage of CKD. Patients aged, occupation, income, co-morbidities such as diabetes or hypertension, medication used, and serum hemoglobin were found significantly (p <0.05) associated at different stages of CKD. The mean domain scores of physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS), burden of kidney disease (BKD), effect of kidney disease (EKD), symptoms and problems of kidney disease (SPKD) subscales were 37.19, 45.94, 31.49, 63.95, and 73.35, respectively. The KSS was 63.24. The stage of CKD has been documented as an important predictor of HRQoL of all subscales of KDQoL-36 as well as KSS. The older age group also showed a clear link with a lower HRQoL in all subscales of KDQoL-36, except SPKD. In multiple linear regression analysis, stage of CKD, patients age, employment status and use of medication were found significant predictors of KSS. Further, higher levels of education, being married, absence of diabetes and heart disease were all independent predictors of a higher MCS. Whereas retirement, low duration of CKD and the use of three or more drugs strongly linked to worse scores of PCS. By addressing the determinants of poor HRQoL, healthcare providers can tailor treatment plans to better meet the needs of these individuals and ultimately enhance their overall well-being.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxia and interleukin (IL)-1β are independent mediators of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, the histological hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we examine how hypoxia and IL-1β act in synergy to augment maladaptive proximal tubular epithelial cell (PTEC) repair in human CKD. Ex vivo patient-derived PTECs were cultured under normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) or hypoxic (1% O<sub>2</sub>) conditions in the absence or presence of IL-1β and examined for maladaptive repair signatures. Hypoxic PTECs incubated with IL-1β displayed a discrete transcriptomic profile distinct from PTECs cultured under hypoxia alone, IL-1β alone or under normoxia. Hypoxia+IL-1β-treated PTECs had 692 'unique' differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to normoxic PTECs, with 'cell cycle' the most significantly enriched KEGG pathway based on 'unique' down-regulated DEGs (including CCNA2, CCNB1 and CCNB2). Hypoxia+IL-1β-treated PTECs displayed signatures of cellular senescence, with reduced proliferation, G2/M cell cycle arrest, increased p21 expression, elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and increased production of pro-inflammatory/fibrotic senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors compared to normoxic conditions. Treatment of Hypoxia+IL-1β-treated PTECs with either a type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) neutralizing antibody or a senolytic drug combination, quercetin+dasatinib, attenuated senescent cell burden. In vitro findings were validated in human CKD bio-specimens (kidney tissue, urine), with elevated PTEC IL-1RI expression and senescence (SA-β-gal activity) detected in fibrotic kidneys and numbers of senescent (SA-β-gal<sup>+</sup>) urinary PTECs correlating with urinary IL-1β levels and severity of interstitial fibrosis. Our data identify a mechanism whereby hypoxia in combination with IL-1β/IL-1RI signalling trigger PTEC senescence, providing novel therapeutic and diagnostic check-points for restoring tubular regeneration in human CKD.",

In this investigation, 2K1C rats were used as an experimental animal model for kidney dysfunction. 2K1C rats were provided with food and drinking water and received febuxostat at a dose of 10 mg/kg or allopurinol at 100 mg/kg, respectively. After the treatment completion, all rats were sacrificed, and tissue samples were collected. 2K1C rats exhibited increased plasma creatinine, uric acid level, and glomerular injury assessed based on microscopic findings. Both allopurinol and febuxostat significantly normalized creatinine and uric acid levels. Furthermore, 2K1C rats showed increased lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) alongside decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity. Again, both drug treatments ameliorated these elevated oxidative stress parameters in 2K1C rats. The antioxidant genes such as Nrf-2, HO-1, and SOD were also restored in the kidneys of 2K1C rats by allopurinol and febuxostat treatment. 2K1C rats also showed increased IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-кB mRNA expression in the kidneys which were normalized by allopurinol and febuxostat treatment. Thus, the data suggest that XO inhibition protects kidney function potentially by restoring antioxidant enzyme function and suppressing inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care (PC) is an interdisciplinary approach aimed at improving the physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being of patients and families affected by life-threatening diseases. This study aimed to investigate the need for PC among critically ill patients and their quality of life (QOL) in low-income groups in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted at four healthcare facilities from March to April 2023, involving 553 registered patients with advanced chronic conditions. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 183 patients in the advanced stage of illness were included. We collected data on sociodemographic, comorbidities, disabilities, and the 10-item African Palliative Outcome Scale (APOS). The Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT) was used to identify individuals requiring PC. The study investigated patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3-4, indicating significant functional impairment, and explored QOL across four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental factors. The mean age of the 183 patients was 53.8 (± 14.53) years, with 69.5% being female. We found that 10.3% of patients with chronic illness required PC, particularly cancer patients (87%) and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (53.3%). The APOS scores indicated that family anxiety (48.6%) was the most burdensome issue, followed by severe pain (15.5%), severe worry about illness (22.4%), and feelings of life being unworthy (9.4%). Patients with severe functional limitations (ECOG 3-4) were significantly more likely to need PC (58%) compared to those with moderate or no limitations (ECOG 0-2) (24%). Among those requiring PC, 70.1% rated their QOL as poor or very-poor, while only 23.8% of patients not needing PC reported similar ratings. Female patients had poorer QOL than males across all domains, and those facing financial hardships also experienced significantly lower QOL. In Bangladesh's low-income communities, a significant proportion of patients with chronic illnesses require palliative care (PC) due to advanced conditions. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating PC early in the treatment process for cancer and CKD patients, as it can greatly improve their QOL and provide essential support for both patients and families. The results advocate for a holistic approach to PC that addresses physical, psychological, social, and environmental factors affecting patients' QOL.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension remains a major chronic disease morbidity across the world, even in the twenty-first century, affecting ≈40% of the global population, adversely impacting the healthcare budgets in managing the high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications and mortality because of elevated blood pressure (BP). However, evaluation and management of endocrine hypertension are not optimal in clinical practice. With three unique clinical case scenarios, we update the evidence base for diagnostic evaluation and management of endocrine hypertension in this review to inform appropriate day-to-day clinical practice decisions. Although most individuals with high BP suffer from essential hypertension (≈85%), some patients may have a clear underlying etiology (termed secondary hypertension), and a significant proportion of these patients have endocrine hypertension (≈10%) consequent to hormone excess from dysfunction of one or more endocrine glands. Even if a relatively common disease in the general population, the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of endocrine hypertension is often delayed because of poor awareness among clinicians, including primary care providers and physicians in the secondary care settings. An accurate and timely diagnosis of endocrine hypertension is crucial to potentially cure or at least properly manage these patients because the consequences of delays in diagnosis can be catastrophic, with markedly higher end-organ complications such as CVD, chronic kidney disease, and even premature mortality among sufferers.",

        "abstract": "The strong association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and fatty liver is well known, and its nomenclature has even recently changed to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Healthy MASLD patients are frequently overlooked and maltreated, especially in Bangladesh. In this present study, we tried to correlate T2DM burden in apparently healthy, incidentally diagnosed fatty liver patients on ultrasound. This cross-sectional study was done in Sheikh Hasina Medical College Hospital, Tangail, Bangladesh, from August 2022 to February 2023. A total of 92 patients with ultrasonological evidence of grade II fatty change in the liver were included and evaluated. Known T2DM, hypothyroidism, consumption of alcohol, HBV or HCV infection, Wilson's disease, autoimmune liver disease, hemochromatosis, and any other chronic liver or kidney disease patients were excluded. The patients were then assessed for the presence and absence of T2DM using OGTT (2 hours 75 gm glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L) and/or HbA1c (≥6.5%) as diagnostic criteria. Data was analyzed by SPSS, version 23. Out of 92 patients, 48 were male and 44 were female. A total of 50 patients (54.3%) were newly diagnosed with T2DM. Statistically significant differences were seen in the T2DM group and non-DM group for AST (50.33 IU vs 36.53 IU) and TG (270 mg/dL vs 189 mg/dL). Although no noteworthy differences were evident in mean age (41 years vs 38 years), ALT (58.9 IU vs 60.23 IU), and BMI (28.85 vs 29.29). In the present study, more than 54% of patients with grade II fatty liver were newly diagnosed with T2DM. They would later present with more advanced T2DM and related complications. Although a larger study is needed, physicians and healthcare workers in Bangladesh should be more concerned about treating MASLD patients with early diagnosis of T2DM, recommending prompt lifestyle interventions, and prescribing drugs if necessary.

A systematic literature search was conducted for cohort, cross-sectional, and case series that reported co-infection with HIV and COVID-19 published from January to September 2020. Clinical features such as age, comorbidities, CD4<sup>+</sup>T lymphocyte counts, HIV RNA levels, and antiretroviral regimens were evaluated using meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 15.0 software. A total of 24 articles with 939 cases of HIV/COVID-19 co-infection were included in this study. The overall mortality rate was 10.3% (97/939). Older age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, and tumors were significantly associated with increased mortality (95% confidence interval 0.005-0.050, 0.042-2.294, 0.390-2.754, 0.513-2.848, 0.348-3.743, and 1.943-7.101, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.021, 0.043, 0.012, 0.008, 0.022, and 0.005).

Improved HIV treatment, complex immune interactions, study population variability, and lack of direct SARS-CoV-2 targeting by ART likely obscure the correlation between CD4<sup>+</sup> counts or ART and COVID-19 mortality in HIV patients. HIV-infected individuals with COVID-19 have a similar prognosis to the general population. However, older age, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetesetc.), and lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts are associated with increased mortality.

Due to an increase in the incidence of systemic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, which are the two main causes of CKD and kidney damage, the prevalence of CKD is rising globally. Chronic Kidney Disease results in mineral disorders as well as profound lipid disorders due to improper balancing of the mineral & hormone levels in the body. This cross-sectional study was completed in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, during the period of July 2022 to June 2023. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. Total 120 subjects were included in this study. Out of them, 60 were selected chronic kidney disease patient (Group II) and another 60 apparently normal healthy persons were selected as control (Group I). In this study, serum magnesium levels were measured for analytical study. All the values were demonstrated as mean±SD and values of serum magnesium were in Group I (1.99±0.50 mg/dl) and in Group II (2.24±0.19 mg/dl). Statistical analysis was performed using by statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 26.0. The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control was evaluated using Student's unpaired 't'-test (p<0.001).

Therefore, it is very important to identify the influencing factors to reduce the dimensions of the problem. This study was conducted to investigate the mortality rate in medical and surgical patients with AKI requiring CRRT treatment. In this observational study, which was conducted as a cross- sectional analytical study, 100 patients with AKI requiring CRRT treatment, including medical and surgical patients, were selected from 2018 to 2021 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital. The mortality rate was estimated. Also, the effective factors were investigated and compared between the dead and surviving patients. 85 cases (85%) of the patients died. Most underlying and demographic variables had no statistically significant difference between the dead and surviving patients (P>0.05). However, in the cases of primary calcium (P=0.001), primary leukocyte (P=0.037), bicarbonate during hospitalization (P=0.025), bicarbonate during AKI (P=0.028), magnesium during hospitalization (P=0.038), and magnesium at the end of CRRT (P=0.019), the differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, mortality is observed in 5 out of 6 patients with acute kidney failure who need CRRT treatment, which is related to risk factors such as bicarbonate, magnesium, leukocyte, and calcium levels.

Using data from the third iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA), we aimed to systematically identify sub-national geographic or population clusters with high prevalence of CKD. The ISN-GKHA survey was conducted from July to September 2022, and included questions regarding whether a regional CKD hotspot existed in the respondents' country and possible contributors. A CKD hotspot was defined as a population cluster with a high risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant, or people dying from kidney failure. Overall, 46 out of 162 responding countries reported subnational hotspots for CKD within their country. Hotspots were reported across all regions, except for the Middle East. Latin America had the highest percentage (12 of 21, 57%) of countries reporting a regional CKD hotspot followed by the regions of North and East Asia, and Western Europe. Adults aged 18 to 44 years and rural populations were most commonly identified as the primary groups affected. Clinical factors were most commonly identified as contributors to CKD (hypertension in 74% and diabetes in 72%), followed by cultural (e.g., diet and herbal medications in 67%), and environmental (e.g., polluted water in 43%) factors. Latin American countries more commonly reported climate, cultural, and environmental factors as contributors compared to other regions. Across the world, there are a number of subnational regions where in-country experts identify a disproportionately higher burden of CKD, commonly occurring among younger age groups with clinical, cultural, and environmental contributors specific to these geographic regions. In-depth studies, starting with systematic epidemiology efforts, are needed to investigate the aetiopathogenesis of these CKD hotspots around the world so that tailored interventions can be offered.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) is a significant global health issue due to its high incidence, drug resistance, contagious nature, and impact on people with compromised immune systems. As mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is responsible for more global fatalities than any other infectious illness. On the other side, WHO also claims that noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people yearly worldwide. In this regard, several studies suggest that PTB and NCDs are linked in various ways and that people with PTB are more likely to acquire NCDs. At the same time, NCDs can increase susceptibility to active TB infection. Furthermore, because of potential drug interactions and therapeutic challenges, treating individuals with both PTB and NCDs can be difficult. This study focuses on seven NCDs (lung cancer (LC), diabetes mellitus (DM), Parkinson's disease (PD), silicosis (SI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) and rigorously presents the genetic relationship with PTB regarding shared genes and outlines possible treatment plans. BlueThis study aims to identify the drug components that can regulate abnormal gene expression in NCDs. The study will reveal hub genes, potential biomarkers, and drug components associated with hub genes through statistical measures. This will contribute to targeted therapeutic interventions. Numerous investigations, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene regulatory network (GRN), enrichment analysis, physical interaction, and protein-chemical interaction, have been carried out to demonstrate the genetic correlation between PTB and NCDs. During the study, nine shared genes such as TNF, IL10, NLRP3, IL18, IFNG, HMGB1, CXCL8, IL17A, and NFKB1 were discovered between TB and the above-mentioned NCDs, and five hub genes (NFKB1, TNF, CXCL8, NLRP3, and IL10) were selected based on degree values. In this study, we found that all of the hub genes are linked with the 10 drug components, and it was observed that aspirin CTD 00005447 was mostly associated with all the other hub genes. This bio-informatics study may help researchers better understand the cause of PTB and its relationship with NCDs, and eventually, this can lead to exploring effective treatment plans.",

        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

        "abstract": "Among the different complications of chronic kidney diseases, peripheral arterial disease is not uncommon. Though it is an indicator of widespread atherosclerosis, sometimes it is neglected in CKD patients. Our study was done to evaluate the frequency and pattern of PAD in chronic kidney disease patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital of Bangladesh. One hundred (100) admitted patients of CKD were taken by nonrandom purposive sampling considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. After clinical evaluation and Ankle brachial index (ABI) measurement 5 cc venous blood was collected and sent to Clinical Pathology and Biochemistry department of CMCH. Data was collected in a structured proforma and analyzed. Among the 100 patients, 2.0% patient belonged to stage 3, 28.0% were in stage 4 and remaining 70.0% were in stage 5. We found the proportion of PAD in CKD were 18.0%. Among 18 PAD patients, 66.67% were in stage 5, 22.22% in stage 4 and 11.11% in stage 3. Regarding right lower limb 12 patients had some PAD, 3 patients had moderate PAD, 2 patients had borderline and 1 patient had calcified PAD. For left lower limb, 10 patients had some PAD, 4 patients had moderate PAD, 4 patients had borderline PAD. The mean AB) of the PAD patients for right limb was 0.87 and for left limb 0.84. 50.0-55.0% patients were asymptomatic. Among the PAD patients 38.9% had DM, 72.2% had HTN, 33.3% had both DM and HTN, 44.4% had other vascular events, 55.6% were smokers, 33.3% had dyslipidemia and 22.2% had family history of PAD.

        "abstract": "Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is primarily associated with preceding group A streptococcal skin or throat infections, now mainly observed in economically disadvantaged communities. This condition significantly predisposes individuals to later-life chronic kidney disease and concurrent renal complications, with the elderly experiencing increased severity and less favourable outcomes. Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B and nephritis-associated plasmin receptor are identified nephritogenic antigens (nephritogens). Pathogenesis of PSGN is multifactorial. It can involve the formation of antigen-antibody immune complexes, causing inflammatory damage to renal glomeruli. Deposition of circulating immune complexes or in situ formation of immune complexes in glomeruli, or both, results in glomerulonephritis. Additionally, molecular mimicry is hypothesized as a mechanism, wherein cross-reactivity between anti-streptococcal antibodies and glomerular intrinsic matrix proteins leads to glomerulonephritis. Besides, as observed in clinical studies, streptococcal inhibitor of complement, a streptococcal-secreted protein, can also be associated with PSGN. However, the interplay between these streptococcal antigens in the pathogenesis of PSGN necessitates further investigation. Despite the clinical significance of PSGN, the lack of credible animal models poses challenges in understanding the association between streptococcal antigens and the disease process. This review outlines the postulated mechanisms implicated in the development of PSGN with possible therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

Despite these advantages, the global utilization of PD remains suboptimal, particularly in South Asia (SA), where a significant gap in PD delivery exists. This study aims to uncover the perceived barriers hindering PD utilization among nephrologists in SA. This is a cross-sectional survey involving 732 nephrologists from SA region. . The majority of respondents (44.7%) reported initiating less than six PD cases annually, reflecting low PD utilization. Cost and financial reimbursement policies emerged as major barriers, with 44.3% considering PD more expensive than haemodialysis (HD). Accessibility, negative attitudes toward PD, and fear of complications were identified as critical factors influencing PD adoption. The study also highlighted variations in PD costs among SA countries, emphasizing the need for tailored health economic strategies. This analysis provides insights into the multifaceted challenges faced by SA nephrologists in promoting PD and underscores the importance of targeted interventions.",

        "abstract": "Acute and chronic inflammation are common in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). So, the adsorption of pro-inflammatory cytokines by the hollow fiber of the dialysis membrane has been expected to modify the inflammatory dysregulation in ESKD patients. However, it remains to be determined in detail what molecules of fiber materials can preferably adsorb proteins from the circulating circuit. We aimed this study to analyze directly the adsorbed proteins in the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes in patients on predilution online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF). To compare the adsorbed proteins in the PMMA and PES hemodiafilters membrane, we initially performed predilution OL-HDF using the PES (MFX-25Seco) membrane while then switched to the PMMA (PMF™-A) membrane under the same condition in three patients. We extracted proteins from the collected hemodiafilters by extraction, then SDS-PAGE of the extracted sample, protein isolation, in-gel tryptic digestion, and nano-LC MS/MS analyses. The concentrations of adsorbed proteins from the PMMA and PES membrane extracts were 35.6±7.9 μg/μL and 26.1±9.2 μg/μL. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed distinct variations of adsorbed proteins mainly in the molecular weight between 10 to 25 kDa. By tryptic gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis, the PMMA membrane exhibited higher adsorptions of β2 microglobulin, dermcidin, retinol-binding protein-4, and lambda-1 light chain than those from the PES membrane. In contrast, amyloid A-1 protein was adsorbed more potently in the PES membrane. Western blot analyses revealed that the PMMA membrane adsorbed interleukin-6 (IL-6) approximately 5 to 118 times compared to the PES membrane. These findings suggest that PMMA-based OL-HDF therapy may be useful in controlling inflammatory status in ESKD patients.",

        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating mental illness characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in daily activities. The objective of this study was to investigate whether levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β) and macrophage chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2) in the blood were associated with the pathophysiology and development of MDD compared to healthy controls (HCs). This case-control study was conducted involving 50 MDD patients and 38 HCs. We performed a comprehensive assessment to match age, sex, BMI, and socio-demographic profile between the groups. The study excluded participants with chronic infection, inflammatory diseases, coexisting psychiatric disorder, history of liver and kidney diseases, and individuals who are under antipsychotic medications. A professional psychiatrist diagnosed MDD patients and evaluated HCs based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) criteria. The severity of depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression (Ham-D) rating scale. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to quantify the serum MIP-1β and MCP-2 levels. The results indicated elevated serum MIP-1β levels (207.73±24.24 pg/ml) in MDD patients compared to HCs (58.77±9.14 pg/ml). This difference in concentration is positively correlated with severity of disease symptoms (r = 0.451; p<0.001). Similarly, the levels of MCP-2 were found to be elevated in patients compared to controls (143.61±19.92 vs. 56.84±4.02 pg/ml; p = 0.003), with a positive correlation with the Ham-D scores (r = 0.373; p = 0.004). According to this study, elevated levels of MIP-1β and MCP-2 may be associated with the pathophysiology and development of MDD. These increased serum MIP-1β and MCP-2 levels could be used as risk assessment tools for MDD. The present findings urge further research and the development of therapeutic and diagnostic approaches for depression.",

Around 46.85% of the participants aged above 40 years presented with one to two chronic diseases, and 16.33% had three or more chronic diseases. Among all comorbidities, the participants with cancer and chronic kidney disease were found to have relatively lower scores in all four domains than other comorbidities. The lowest QoL scores were observed in the psychological domain. Those with three or more simultaneous chronic comorbidities had the lowest QoL score in all four domains: physical, psychological, social relationship, and environmental.

In addition to the burden of CKD and kidney failure from traditional risk factors, CKD of unknown etiologies from India and Sri Lanka compounds the challenges of optimal management of CKD in the region. From the third edition of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA), we present the status of CKD burden, infrastructure, funding, resources, and health care personnel using the World Health Organization's building blocks for health systems in the ISN South Asia region. The poor status of the public health care system and low health care expenditure resulted in high out-of-pocket expenditures for people with kidney disease, which further compounded the situation. There is insufficient country capacity across the region to provide kidney replacement therapies to cover the burden. The infrastructure was also not uniformly distributed among the countries in the region. There were no chronic hemodialysis centers in Afghanistan, and peritoneal dialysis services were only available in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Kidney transplantation was not available in Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives. Conservative kidney management was reported as available in 63% (n = 5) of the countries, yet no country reported availability of the core CKM care components. There was a high hospitalization rate and early mortality because of inadequate kidney care. The lack of national registries and actual disease burden estimates reported in the region prevent policymakers' attention to CKD as an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Data from the 2023 ISN-GKHA, although with some limitations, may be used for advocacy and improving CKD care in the region.",

        "title": "Global burden of 288 causes of death and life expectancy decomposition in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

        "abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome that is characterized by the rapid development of organ failures predisposing these patients to a high risk of short-term early death. The main causes of organ failure in these patients are bacterial infections and systemic inflammation, both of which can be severe. For the majority of these patients, a prompt liver transplant is still the only effective course of treatment. Kidneys are one of the most frequent extrahepatic organs that are affected in patients with ACLF, since acute kidney injury (AKI) is reported in 22.8-34% of patients with ACLF. Approach and management of kidney injury could improve overall outcomes in these patients. Importantly, patients with ACLF more frequently have stage 3 AKI with a low rate of response to the current treatment modalities. The objective of the present position paper is to critically review and analyze the published data on AKI in ACLF, evolve a consensus, and provide recommendations for early diagnosis, pathophysiology, prevention, and management of AKI in patients with ACLF. In the absence of direct evidence, we propose expert opinions for guidance in managing AKI in this very challenging group of patients and focus on areas of future research. This consensus will be of major importance to all hepatologists, liver transplant surgeons, and intensivists across the globe.",

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. CKD has a long period of asymptomatic stage. The symptoms of CKD usually present at the advanced stage of the disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a potentially fatal that impacts various physiological systems. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Physiology in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology, Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital (SMAGOMC&H), from July 2022 to June 2023 to observe the status of kidney function among the employees of SMAGOMC&H, Bangladesh. The study population consisted of all willingly participating volunteers working at SMAGOMC&H between the ages of 18 and 59 years. Participants with acute illness, malignancy, pregnancy, diagnosed case of CKD, and history of kidney transplant were excluded from the study. A thorough history was taken, and a physical examination was done. Serum creatinine, and spot urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) of each participant were measured. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) was estimated by using NKF (National Kidney Foundation) eGFR calculator app. A Semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Most of the participants were between 50-59 years (46.0%). The mean age of these study subjects was 45.25±10.08 years. The mean serum creatinine level was 0.85±0.18 mg/dl, the mean eGFR was 102.92±16.21 ml/min/1.73m² and the mean urinary ACR was 27.44±12.48 mg/gm found in this study. Out of the total participants, 16.5% were at stage 1 CKD, 6.5% were at stage 2 CKD and 2.5% were at stage 3 CKD, according to eGFR by CKD-EPI (Chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration) equation. Seventy five percent (75.0%) of the participants had normal to mildly increased ACR and 25.0% had moderately increased ACR. Pearson's correlation test revealed a significant negative correlation of eGFR with age, serum creatinine, and urinary ACR (p<0.001). This study revealed that 16.5%, 6.5% and 2.5% of the study participants were at CKD stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3, respectively. Assessment of renal function can help early identification of CKD in apparently healthy asymptomatic subjects.",

We planned to study the changes in thyroid hormone profile in acute coronary syndrome patients admitted in the coronary care unit and compare them between two groups: unstable angina/non-ST elevated Myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and ST elevated Myocardial infarction (STEMI). This study was a hospital based descriptive cross sectional study which was conducted from 01 March 2018 to 01 February 2019 in Coronary Care Unit of Bangladesh Medical College Hospital and laboratory tests were done in Microbiology Department of Bangladesh Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Eighty three cases of acute coronary syndromes were taken for the study. Troponin-I was measured as cardiac marker, Electrocardiogram, Complete blood count, blood glucose level, Blood urea, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, Fasting lipid profile, Thyroid profile, Echocardiography 2D were done. Most of the respondents were distributed in age group 46-60 years where 34(64.15%) male and 19(35.85%) female. Out of 83 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients, 27(32.53%) hypertensive, 22(26.50%) diabetic and 16(19.27%) were Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Abnormal lipid profile was present in 30(43.47%) patients. Among total 52 male and 31 female 9(17.30%) male and 6(19.35%) female had abnormal thyroid function. We further elaborated abnormal thyroid function tests in STEMI group and UA/Non STEMI group of ACS patients. We found 10 patients in STEMI group and 5 patients in UA/Non STEMI group with abnormal thyroid function 29.41% and 10.20% respectively which was not statistically significant (p=0.025). This study depicts abnormality in thyroid hormone profile in 18.07% patients of ACS. Abnormal thyroid function increases risk of coronary artery disease.

This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2021 to December 2021 in the department of Biochemistry in Mymensingh Medical College in cooperation with the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The study was carried out to evaluate the status of serum magnesium, zinc and CRP in patients with CKD not on dialysis for monitoring the disease progression. For this purpose, 110 subjects were included, where 55 Hospitalized CKD patients were considered as Group I and 55 normal healthy individuals as Group II. Study subjects were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive and convenient sampling method. Serum magnesium and zinc were determined by colorimetric method while CRP was measured by CRP-Latex Test (Slide Agglutination Test) from each sample. SPSS windows package, version 21.0 was used to perform the statistical analysis. Statistical significance of difference between Group I and Group II were evaluated by using student's unpaired 't'-test and the significance was defined as p<0.05. Correlation was done by using Pearson's correlation coefficient test. Mean age of Group I was 52.65±4.93 and Group II was 51.15±6.32 years. P-value was 0.165 which is statistically insignificant. The mean ±SD of BMI was 24.46±1.84 Kg/m² for Group I and 24.50±1.05 Kg/m² for Group II. P-value was 0.886 which is statistically insignificant. Among the study groups the mean serum magnesium were 2.25±0.17 and 1.95±0.05mg/dl, zinc were 88.64±9.21 and 102.11±12.93μg/dl, CRP were 24.00±16.73 and <6.0±0.00mg/L in Group I and Group II respectively. Analysis showed that, the mean serum magnesium and CRP were significantly increased while serum zinc was significantly decreased in CKD patients in comparison to that of healthy individual.

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) are a significant public health issue with potential for severe complications such as hypertension, anemia, and renal failure. Timely diagnosis is crucial for effective management. Leveraging machine learning within healthcare offers promising advancements in predictive diagnostics. In this paper, we developed a machine learning-based kidney diseases prediction (ML-CKDP) model with dual objectives: to enhance dataset preprocessing for CKD classification and to develop a web-based application for CKD prediction. The proposed model involves a comprehensive data preprocessing protocol, converting categorical variables to numerical values, imputing missing data, and normalizing via Min-Max scaling. Feature selection is executed using a variety of techniques including Correlation, Chi-Square, Variance Threshold, Recursive Feature Elimination, Sequential Forward Selection, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression to refine the datasets. The model employs seven classifiers: Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (AdaB), Gradient Boosting (GB), XgBoost (XgB), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT), to predict CKDs. The effectiveness of the models is assessed by measuring their accuracy, analyzing confusion matrix statistics, and calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) specifically for the classification of positive cases. Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost (AdaB) achieve a 100% accuracy rate, evident across various validation methods including data splits of 70:30, 80:20, and K-Fold set to 10 and 15. RF and AdaB consistently reach perfect AUC scores of 100% across multiple datasets, under different splitting ratios. Moreover, Naive Bayes (NB) stands out for its efficiency, recording the lowest training and testing times across all datasets and split ratios. Additionally, we present a real-time web-based application to operationalize the model, enhancing accessibility for healthcare practitioners and stakeholders.

Transplant recipients frequently have altered levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH] D) and 1, 25-hydroxyvitamin (1, 25[OH] D). To explore the status of vitamin D level in renal allograft recipients and its association with renal function and cardio-metabolic risk markers. One hundred two adult kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) were included. Clinical history and information about transplantation and immunosuppression were recorded. Blood and urine samples were collected for relevant laboratory tests, including chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder markers (Ca, PO4, and 25[OH] D). The mean age was 35 ± 8 years, with a male/female ratio of 89/11%. The transplant duration was 34 ± 26 (4.5-112) months. All donors involved were living-related: fathers comprised 44%, wives 16%, sisters 13%, mothers 11%, and the others 16% (ie, brothers, sons, daughters, uncles, aunts). The immunosuppression regimen included prednisolone and tacrolimus in all, with mycophenolate mofetil in 96%. The estimated glomerular filtration rate showed CKD distribution from stage 1 to 5 in 6%, 29%, 44%, 15%, and 6%, respectively. Vitamin D level was lower in 22% (<20 ng/mL), insufficient (20-30 ng/mL) in 48%, and adequate (>30 ng/mL) in 30%. We compared different clinical and laboratory variables in 3 different vitamin D groups but found no difference in cardio-renal risk factors (P = Not Significant). Similarly, no correlation was seen between vitamin D levels and other clinical and metabolic factors. According to conventional cutoffs, the vitamin D (25[OH] D) level is inadequate in 70% of renal allograft recipients. The hormone level has no apparent association with renal function and major cardio-metabolic risk factors.",

The aim of this study was to examine population health trends in Canada over the past 30 years in relation to other countries. We used data on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability, life expectancy (LE), and child mortality for Canada and other countries between 1990 and 2019 provided by the Global Burden of Disease Study. Life expectancy, age-standardized YLL, and age-standardized DALYs all improved in Canada between 1990 and 2019, although the rate of improvement has leveled off since 2011. The top five causes of all-age DALYs in Canada in 2019 were neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental disorders. The greatest increases in all-age DALYs since 1990 were observed for substance use, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and sense organ disorders. Age-standardized DALYs declined for most conditions, except for substance use, diabetes and chronic kidney disease, and musculoskeletal disorders, which increased by 94.6%, 14.6%, and 7.3% respectively since 1990. Canada's world ranking for age-standardized DALYs declined from 9th place in 1990 to 24th in 2019. Canadians are healthier today than in 1990, but progress has slowed in Canada in recent years in comparison with other high-income countries.

        "abstract": "Dialysis in pediatric groups is complicated by a wide range of factors that can affect long-term prognosis. The purpose of this meta-analysis and systematic review is to better understand the demographic and clinical factors that affect dialysis success in children. We searched a variety of databases for relevant articles and included 14 reports that dealt with the case studies of pediatric patients undergoing dialysis for a wide range of renal diseases. Patients' demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes were the primary areas of data collection. To get a better sense of the overall prevalence of certain outcomes and to spot noteworthy trends or patterns in the disease process, we conducted a meta-analysis. Variations in dialysis efficacy and outcomes are highlighted throughout a wide range of ages in the pediatric dialysis cohort, from neonates to teenagers. Acute kidney injuries (AKI) tended to impact more boys, but chronic kidney diseases (CKD), such as lupus nephritis, disproportionately afflicted girls. Many different ethnic groups were represented, and there was evidence that some diseases having a hereditary component were more common in some areas than others. However, the potential for long-term consequences remained a concern. Hemodialysis was found to be effective in controlling end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and AKI, with some patients going on to have a kidney transplant. At the same time, peritoneal dialysis was associated with an increased risk of infection. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of demographic and clinical parameters in determining pediatric dialysis outcomes. A 14.47% mortality rate and gender disparities are revealed by this meta-analysis of pediatric renal diseases, which included a cohort of 235 patients with conditions like lupus nephritis and hepatitis C infection. The findings stress the necessity for individualized treatment techniques and suggest that demographic characteristics should be addressed in prognostic models. For better patient outcomes, the study also suggests standardized reporting in pediatric dialysis studies.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease that leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Malnutrition increases the risk of mortality among patients with ESRD. This study aimed to determine malnutrition prevalence and associated factors among twice-weekly (n = 94/120) and thrice-weekly (n = 26/120) hemodialysis patients/HDP. A cross-sectional study was conducted at two tertiary-level public hospitals in Dhaka city using a consecutive sampling technique from April to June 2021. Nutritional status was assessed by Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was performed to determine which socioeconomic, clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary factors are associated with MIS. The prevalence of malnutrition was very high among HDP (severe 15.5%, mild/moderate 56.7%) with an average dialysis vintage of 28.7 months. Comorbidities (80.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms/GIS (68.3%) were ubiquitous, and \"dialysis frequencies\" were not associated with MIS in bivariate analysis. Multivariable ordinal regression showed that anthropometric factors like mid-upper arm circumference/MUAC (adjusted odds ratio/AOR = 0.978), post-dialysis body mass index/BMI (AOR = 0.957), and biochemical parameters like albumin (AOR = 0.733) and TIBC/total iron binding capacity (AOR = 0.996) negatively (<i>P</i> < .05) associated with MIS. Moreover, having \"no GIS\" (AOR = 0.672, <i>P</i> < .001) was 33.0% less likely to be associated with MIS. Contrarily, as the month of dialysis increases, MIS increases by 22.0% (AOR = 1.22). Significant associations of clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical characteristics with MIS indicate the importance of routine screening of the nutritional status of patients with CKD to improve health status and prevent protein-energy wasting. The MIS could be a simple, noninvasive tool for testing nutritional status in patients with CKD.",

        "abstract": "Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) caused by respiratory viruses is among the most common causes of hospitalization and mortality in children. We aimed to identify risk factors for poor outcomes in children <5 years old hospitalized with ALRI caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We searched Embase, Medline and Global Health databases and included observational studies reporting risk factors for poor outcomes (defined as use of supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospital stay and mortality) published between January 2011 and January 2023. Two authors independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes and risk factors. Due to limited data, meta-analyses were only conducted for RSV-ALRI poor outcome risk factors using random effects model when there were at least 3 studies. We included 30 studies. For RSV-related ALRI, significant risk factors based on meta-analysis were: neurological disease [odds ratio (OR): 6.14; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 2.39-15.77], Down's syndrome (5.43; 3.02-9.76), chronic lung disease (3.64; 1.31-10.09), immunocompromised status (3.41; 1.85-6.29), prematurity (2.98; 1.93-4.59), congenital heart disease (2.80; 1.84-4.24), underlying disease (2.45; 1.94-3.09), age <2 months (2.29; 1.78-2.94), age <6 months (2.08; 1.81-2.39), viral coinfection (2.01; 1.27-3.19), low birth weight (1.88; 1.19-2.95) and being underweight (1.80; 1.38-2.35). For influenza-related ALRI, chronic conditions and age 6-24 months were identified as risk factors for poor outcomes. Cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and high blood pressure were reported as risk factors for mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 associated ALRI. These findings might contribute to the development of guidelines for prophylaxis and management of ALRI caused by RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2.",

This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Department of Medicine and Nephrology, Chittagong Medical College (CMC), Chittagong, Bangladesh from June to December, 2014 and was performed to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events according to Framingham's Risk Score of CKD patients. In this research, 100 patients who was diagnosed as CKD and admitted in the Chittagong Medical College Hospital were enrolled. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the MDRD formula. Cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed by Framinghams criteria and after compilation data were analyzed by SPSS-18.0. Among 100 patients, most of patients were under 60 years of age where males (56.0%) were more than females (44.0%). Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score revealed that most of the male were at high risk group compared to female. Regarding different components of lipid profile with Framingham risk score, higher risk group had high mean total cholesterol (212.17mg/dl) and also low mean HDL level (38.58mg/dl). Patient with different stages of CKD with cardiovascular risk showed stage 5 CKD was 80%, stage 4 was 15.0% and rest 5 was at stage 3 and most were in low risk group (56.0%).

Multiple complications arise and different biochemical parameters change in this disease. This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December, 2021 in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College with the help of the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. The motive of this study was to explore the status of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin and serum zinc in patients with CKD for monitoring the disease progression. In this study, 110 subjects were included, where 55 Hospital admitted CKD patients act as Group I and 55 normal healthy individuals act as Group II. The subjects were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive and convenient sampling method. In this study, CRP levels, serum albumin and serum zinc were measured. All values were expressed as Mean±SD. All statistical analysis was done by using SPSS (statistical package for social science) windows package version 21.0. Statistical significance of difference between Group I and Group II were evaluated by using Student's unpaired 't'-test and the significance was defined as p<0.05. Correlation was done by using Pearson's correlation coefficient test. Mean age of Group I was 52.65±4.93 and Group II was 51.15±6.32. P value was 0.165 which is statistically insignificant. The mean±SD of BMI was 24.46±1.84 for Group I and 24.50±1.05 for Group II. P value was 0.886 which is statistically insignificant. The mean±SD values of CRP were 24.00±16.73mg/L and <6.0±0.00mg/L in Group I and Group II respectively. So, we found significant (p<0.05) increase in CRP levels. The mean±SD values of serum albumin were 3.62±0.26g/dl and 4.16±0.69g/dl in Group I and Group II respectively. We found highly significant (p<0.001) decrease in serum albumin. Among the study groups the mean serum zinc was 88.64±9.21μg/dl and 102.11±12.93μg/dl in Group I and Group II respectively. The mean serum zinc was highly significantly (<0.001) decreased.

Using random sampling we recruited 872 adults in 2020, from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System of Bangladesh, who had resided in the area for at least five years. Interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire, physical examination and anthropometric measurements were done, followed by blood and urine testing. The blood and urine tests were repeated in selected participants after three months as per the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation. The prevalence of SLT consumption was 29%.

This was a cross sectional descriptive study which was carried out in the Department of Medicine of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Bangladesh from July 2019 to December 2019. The sample size was 67. Purposive sampling technique was employed. Patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP), aged ≥14 years of both sex with recently developed radiological pulmonary shadowing with compatible clinical symptoms and signs were included. Patients who were chronically immunosuppressed, with chronic starvation, advanced liver disease or chronic kidney disease with or without receiving haemodialysis were excluded.

High rate of inflammation is common in CKD and it causes high CRP level. High CRP levels are associated with low e-GFR and low serum albumin level. This study was conducted to determine the changes of blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum albumin and C-reactive protein in chronic kidney diseased patients and compared with healthy subjects. This analytical type of cross sectional study was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from July 2021 to June 2022. A total number of 140 subjects, age range between 25-70 years were included in this study. Among them, 70 healthy subjects were taken as control group (Group I) with 35 male (IA) and 35 female (IB) and 70 chronic kidney diseased patients were taken as study group (Group II) with 35 male (IIA) and 35 female (IIB). Calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was done by chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Data were expressed as mean±SD and statistical significance difference among the group were calculated by unpaired t-test. In this study, we found that eGFR (in IIA 29.83±0.73 ml/min and in IIB 30.80±0.73ml/min) and serum albumin (in IIA 2.96±0.04g/dl in IIB 2.07±0.02g/dl) were significantly decreased in study group in comparison to control group.

        "abstract": "Hemodialysis (HD) is a treatment for ensuring the survival of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, and nutrition care is integral to their management. We sent questionnaires to evaluate the total dialysis service capacity and nutrition services across all dialysis facilities (DF) in Bangladesh, with responses from 149 out of 166 active DFs. Survey results revealed that 49.7% of DFs operated two shifts, and 42.3% operated three shifts daily, with 74.5% holding between one and ten dialysis machines. Sixty-three percent of DFs served between one and 25 patients per week, and 77% of patients received twice-weekly dialysis. The average cost for first-time dialysis was 2800 BDT per session (range: 2500-3000 BDT), but it was lower if reused dialyzers were used (2100 BDT, range: 1700-2800 BDT). Nutritionists were available in only 21% of the DFs. Parameters related to nutritional health screening (serum albumin, BMI, MIS-malnutrition inflammation assessment, and dietary intakes) were carried out in 37.6%, 23.5%, 2%, and 2% of the DFs, respectively, only if recommended by physicians. Nutrition education, if recommended, was provided in 68.5% of DFs, but only in 17.6% of them were these delivered by nutritionists. The recommendation for using renal-specific oral nutrition supplements (ONS) is not a familiar practice in Bangladeshi DFs and, therefore, was scarcely recommended. Dialysis capacity across Bangladesh is inadequate to meet current or projected needs and nutrition education and support across the DFs to benefit improving patients' quality of life is also inadequate.",

        "abstract": "With the rising global prevalence of fatty liver disease related to metabolic dysfunction, the association of this common liver condition with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become increasingly evident. In 2020, the more inclusive term metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was proposed to replace the term non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The observed association between MAFLD and CKD and our understanding that CKD can be a consequence of underlying metabolic dysfunction support the notion that individuals with MAFLD are at higher risk of having and developing CKD compared with those without MAFLD. However, to date, there is no appropriate guidance on CKD in individuals with MAFLD. Furthermore, there has been little attention paid to the link between MAFLD and CKD in the Nephrology community. Using a Delphi-based approach, a multidisciplinary panel of 50 international experts from 26 countries reached a consensus on some of the open research questions regarding the link between MAFLD and CKD. This Delphi-based consensus statement provided guidance on the epidemiology, mechanisms, management and treatment of MAFLD and CKD, as well as the relationship between the severity of MAFLD and risk of CKD, which establish a framework for the early prevention and management of these two common and interconnected diseases.",

        "title": "Risk factors for COVID-19 mortality among telehealth patients in Bangladesh: A prospective cohort study.",
        "abstract": "Estimating the contribution of risk factors of mortality due to COVID-19 is particularly important in settings with low vaccination coverage and limited public health and clinical resources. Very few studies of risk factors of COVID-19 mortality used high-quality data at an individual level from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We examined the contribution of demographic, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19 mortality in Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country in South Asia. We used data from 290,488 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients who participated in a telehealth service in Bangladesh between May 2020 and June 2021, linked with COVID-19 death data from a national database to study the risk factors associated with mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between risk factors and mortality. We used classification and regression trees to identify the risk factors that are the most important for clinical decision-making. This study is one of the largest prospective cohort studies of COVID-19 mortality in a LMIC, covering 36% of all lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country during the study period. We found that being male, being very young or elderly, having low socioeconomic status, chronic kidney and liver disease, and being infected during the latter pandemic period were significantly associated with a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Males had 1.15 times higher odds (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.09, 1.22) of death compared to females. Compared to the reference age group (20-24 years olds), the odds ratio of mortality increased monotonically with age, ranging from an odds ratio of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.73) for ages 30-34 to an odds ratio of 21.6 (95% CI: 17.08, 27.38) for ages 75-79 year group. For children 0-4 years old the odds of mortality were 3.93 (95% CI: 2.74, 5.64) times higher than 20-24 years olds. Other significant predictors were severe symptoms of COVID-19 such as breathing difficulty, fever, and diarrhea. Patients who were assessed by a physician as having a severe episode of COVID-19 based on the telehealth interview had 12.43 (95% CI: 11.04, 13.99) times higher odds of mortality compared to those assessed to have a mild episode. The finding that the telehealth doctors' assessment of disease severity was highly predictive of subsequent COVID-19 mortality, underscores the feasibility and value of the telehealth services. Our findings confirm the universality of certain COVID-19 risk factors-such as gender and age-while highlighting other risk factors that appear to be more (or less) relevant in the context of Bangladesh. These findings on the demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality can help guide public health and clinical decision-making. Harnessing the benefits of the telehealth system and optimizing care for those most at risk of mortality, particularly in the context of a LMIC, are the key takeaways from this study.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible change in kidney function and structure with a prevalence of about 9.1% worldwide. Toxins and heavy metal exposure, as well as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, are common causes of CKD. Despite extensive therapeutic options such as renal replacement therapy and renal transplants, most changes in kidney function remain irreversible, causing lifelong morbidity and affecting the quality of life of patients. Increased susceptibility to infections as well as serious complications from influenza, is a major cause of concern in nephrological care. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the protective role of influenza vaccination against seasonal influenza, which can worsen preexisting kidney dysfunction. This commentary explores a possible relationship between the influenza vaccine and patient outcomes in CKD in terms of complications, hospitalization, and possibly prognostic improvements in patient outcomes from CKD.",

        "abstract": "Although waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) has established association with cardiometabolic disease, the trend of changes in elevated WHtR among general population have not been examined adequately. This study examined the prevalence of elevated WHtR and waist circumference (WC) and their trends over time using Joinpoint regression models among adults who participated in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (U.S. NHANES) 1999-2018. We performed weighted logistic regression to identify the association between central obesity subtypes and the prevalence of comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The prevalence of elevated WHtR has increased from 74.8% in 1999-2000 to 82.7% in 2017-2018 while elevated WC also increased from 46.9% in 1999-2000 to 60.3% in 2017-2018. Men, older adults, former smokers, and people with lower education levels were more likely to have elevated WHtR. A total of 25.5% of American adults had normal WC but elevated WHtR, and they had a significantly higher chance of suffering from diabetes (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06 [1.66, 2.55]), hypertension (OR = 1.75 [1.58, 1.93]) and CVD (OR = 1.32 [1.11, 1.57]). In conclusion, the burden of elevated WHtR and WC have been increasing among U.S. adults throughout the years, and the changes have been more significant across most subgroups. It is also notable that approximately a quarter of the population had normal WC but elevated WHtR, which had increased likelihood of having cardiometabolic diseases, especially diabetes. Future clinical practices should pay more attention to this subgroup of the population with overlooked health risks.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition distinguished by structural and functional changes to the kidney over time. Studies show that 10% of adults worldwide are affected by some kind of CKD, resulting in 1.2 million deaths. Recently, CKD has emerged as a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making it necessary to develop a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to diagnose CKD automatically. Machine Learning (ML) based CAD system can be used by a clinician to automatically diagnoses mass people. Since ML models are considered a black box, it is also necessary to expose influential causes behind a model's prediction of a particular output. So that, a doctor can make a more rational decision based on the model's output and analysis of the features influence on the model. In this paper, we have used the XGBoost as the ML classifier to predict whether a patient has CKD or not. Using the XGBoost classifier, we have obtained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively using all [Formula: see text] features. Furthermore, we have used Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm to find an effective subset of the features. The BBO algorithm selected almost half of the initial features. We have obtained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively using only 13 features selected by the BBO algorithm. Finally, we have explained the impact of the feature on the ML models using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Using SHAP analysis and BBO algorithm, we have found that hemoglobin and albumin mostly contribute to the detection of CKD.",

        "abstract": "Globally, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the major public health concerns. CKD and renal failure are reported to be high in the areas with higher salinity, however, the association is still unclear. We aimed at assessing the association of degree of groundwater salinity with CKD among diabetic populations of two selected areas in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional analytic study was carried out among 356 diabetic patients aged 40-60 years in high groundwater salinity exposed Pirojpur (n = 151) and non-exposed Dinajpur (n = 205), the southern and northern districts of Bangladesh, respectively. The primary outcome was the presence of CKD (via estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min) using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Binary logistic regression analyses were done. In non-exposed (mean age 51.2±6.9 years) and exposed (mean age 50.8±6.9 years) respondents, men (57.6%) and women (62.9%) were predominant, respectively. The proportion of patients with CKD was found to be higher in the exposed group than that of the non-exposed group (33.1% vs. 26.8%; P 0.199). The odds (OR [95% confidence interval]; P) of CKD were not found to be significantly higher in high salinity exposed respondents (1.35 [0.85-2.14]; 0.199), compared to the non-exposed. However, the odds of hypertension were found to be significantly higher in high salinity exposed respondents (2.10 [1.37-3.23]; 0.001), compared to the non-exposed. And, the interaction of high salinity and hypertension showed a significant association with CKD (P = 0.009). In conclusion, the findings suggest that groundwater salinity may not be directly associated with CKD in southern Bangladesh, however, it may have an indirect association with the disorder through the association of hypertension with groundwater salinity. Further large scaled studies are required to answer the research hypothesis more clearly.",

        "abstract": "Radial artery occlusion (RAO) is now a major concern in transradial approach (TRA). RAO limits future radial artery use for further TRA, for as a conduit during CABG, for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and for creation of arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients through same vascular approach. The effect of duration of hemostatic compression of RAO is unknown in Bangladesh. This prospective observational study was conducted in the department of Cardiology, National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Dhaka, Bangladesh (NICVD) from September 2018 to August 2019, to evaluate the effect of duration of hemostatic compression on the incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO) after transradial percutaneous coronary intervention. A total of 140 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) through TRA. RAO was defined as an absence of antegrade flow or monophasic flow or invert flow on Duplex study. In this study 70 patients (Group I) received 2 hours hemostatic compression after transradial PCI. Another 70 patients (Group II) received 6 hours hemostatic compression after transradial PCI. Radial arterial blood flow assessed at early (24 hours) and late (30 days) by color duplex study after the procedure in both groups. Early radial artery occlusion occurred in 4.3% of patients in Group I and 12.8% of patients in Group II, (p=0.04). Late radial artery occlusion occurred in 2.8% of patients in Group I and 11.4% of patients in Group II, the difference was statistically significant (p=0.04). From multivariate logistic regression analysis duration of hemostatic compression time 6 hours (p=0.01), post-procedural nitroglycerine use (p=0.03) and procedure time (p=0.03) were predictors of RAO. Shorter duration of hemostatic compression is associated with a lower incidence of early and late radial artery occlusion after transradial intervention.",

In this study total 200 subjects were selected with age ranged from 25 to 60 years and divided into 100 healthy persons as control group and 100 CKD patients as study group. Both control and study group were further divided into 50 male and 50 female. Unpaired student's t test was used for Statistical data analysis. The mean±SE BMI of control group male and study group male were 25.04±0.13 and 23.87±0.41 kg/m² respectively. In study group male, mean±SE BMI was decreased. Result was statistically significant (p<0.05). The mean±SE BMI of control group female and study group female were 24.13±0.43 and 22.90±0.27 kg/m² respectively. In study group female, mean±SE BMI was decreased and result was significant (p<0.05). BMI was decreased in study group than in control group. The results were statistically significant. Fasting serum glucose was evaluated by the Enzymatic, colorimetric, GOD-PAP method. The results showed that the mean±SE fasting serum glucose of control group male & study group male were 5.31±0.17mmol/L and 7.56±0.37mmol/L respectively. In study group male, mean±SE FSG was increased. Result was statistically highly significant (p<0.0001).

        "abstract": "National strategies for addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) are crucial to improving kidney health. We sought to describe country-level variations in non-communicable disease (NCD) strategies and CKD-specific policies across different regions and income levels worldwide. The International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (GKHA) was a multinational cross-sectional survey conducted between July and October 2018. Responses from key opinion leaders in each country regarding national NCD strategies, the presence and scope of CKD-specific policies, and government recognition of CKD as a health priority were described overall and according to region and income level. 160 countries participated in the GKHA survey, comprising 97.8% of the world's population. Seventy-four (47%) countries had an established national NCD strategy, and 53 (34%) countries reported the existence of CKD-specific policies, with substantial variation across regions and income levels. Where CKD-specific policies existed, non-dialysis CKD care was variably addressed. 79 (51%) countries identified government recognition of CKD as a health priority. Low- and low-middle income countries were less likely to have strategies and policies for addressing CKD and have governments which recognise it as a health priority. The existence of CKD-specific policies, and a national NCD strategy more broadly, varied substantially across different regions around the world but was overall suboptimal, with major discrepancies between the burden of CKD in many countries and governmental recognition of CKD as a health priority. Greater recognition of CKD within national health policy is critical to improving kidney healthcare globally.",

        "abstract": "Despite improvements in many health indicators in the last few decades, providing access to affordable and quality healthcare for older citizen remains a considerable challenge in Bangladesh. This study aimed to understand individuals 'experiences regarding their healthcare-seeking, treatment cost, accessibility and coping mechanisms for the promotion of appropriate strategies to enhance the quality of life of the older citizens of Bangladesh.A qualitative descriptive approach was used in this study. A total of 27 In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted in a district in Bangladesh with older people between January and February 2020, where gender distribution was equal. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained and experienced interviewers regarding healthcare-seeking and accessibility, affordability, and healthcare coping strategy. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the data. It was found that the health condition of the older population is not satisfactory. Most of them had been suffering from several diseases such as benign tumor, chronic kidney disease, body aches, gastric ulcers for a longer period of time. The majority of the participants were suffering from multiple non-communicable diseases while diabetes and hypertension were the foremost of all diseases. This study provides insight into the challenges of managing healthcare services for older citizens in Bangladesh. Healthcare facilities were available, but high out-of-pocket payments, lack of caregivers, and time distance created a barrier to the service provision. The findings indicated that geriatric care policymakers and service providers should prioritize the older-friendly health infrastructures with affordable cost of treatment for the betterment of the health status of older citizens in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health concern worldwide and has been recognized as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The elevated level of uric acid (hyperuricemia) has been suggested to be associated with obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, there is limited information on the relationship between hyperuricemia and CKD. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of CKD and assess its relationship with hyperuricemia in Bangladeshi adults. In this study, blood samples were collected from 545 participants (398 males and 147 females) aged ≥ 18 years. Biochemical parameters such as serum uric acid (SUA), lipid profile markers, glucose, creatinine and urea were measured by colorimetric methods. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CKD were determined based on serum creatinine levels with existed formula. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between SUA and CKD. The overall prevalence of CKD was 5.9% with 6.1% in males and 5.2% in females. Hyperuricemia was prevalent in 18.7% of participants with 23.2% in males and 14.6% in females. An increasing trend of CKD prevalence was observed with increasing age in the groups. The mean eGFR level was significantly lower in male (95.1 ± 31.8 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) than in female (109.3 ± 77.4 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) subjects (p < 0.01). The mean level of SUA was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in participants having CKD (7.1 ± 1.9 mg/dL) than in participants without CKD (5.7 ± 1.6 mg/dL). A decreasing trend for eGFR concentration and an increasing trend for CKD prevalence was observed across the SUA quartiles (p < 0.001). In regression analysis, a significant positive association was found between hyperuricemia and CKD. This study showed an independent association between hyperuricemia and CKD in Bangladeshi adults. Further mechanistic studies are needed to explore the potential link between hyperuricemia and CKD.",

Therefore, MR inhibition is a crucial pharmacological strategy to overcome cardiovascular dysfunction. Despite efficient blockade of MR with steroidal MR antagonists (MRAs), their clinical application is unsatisfactory due to the adverse effects. Newer non-steroidal MRAs with greater potency could be suitable for clinical application, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Although clinical evidence has shown the beneficial effects of non-steroidal MRAs on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Therefore, comparative pharmacological characterization of non-steroidal MRAs over classic steroidal MRAs is crucial. Here, we summarize the pre-clinical evidence of non-steroidal MRAs, which suggests an improvement in cardiac dysfunction, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms in animal models mimicking different clinical conditions. In addition, we discuss up-to-date information from clinical trials regarding the beneficial effects of non-steroidal MRAs on meaningful cardiovascular outcomes. Both pre-clinical and clinical evidence support treatment with non-steroidal MRAs in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

This study identified risk factors for prolonged LOS in patients with cardiac arrest receiving TTM and explored the association between LOS and neurological outcomes after TTM. The retrospective cohort consisted of 571 non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients aged 18 years or older, treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), had a Glasgow Coma Scale score <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo><</mo></math> 8, or were unable to comply with commands after the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and received TTM less than 12 hours after ROSC. Prolonged LOS was defined as LOS beyond the 75th quartile of the entire cohort. We analyzed and compared relevant variables and neurological outcomes between the patients with and without prolonged LOS and established prediction models for estimating the risk of prolonged LOS. The patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest had a longer LOS than those with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (<i>p</i> = 0.0001). Duration of CPR (<i>p</i> = 0.02), underlying heart failure (<i>p</i> = 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<i>p</i> = 0.008), chronic kidney disease (<i>p</i> = 0.026), and post-TTM seizures (<i>p</i> = 0.003) were risk factors for prolonged LOS. LOS was associated with survival to hospital discharge, and patients with the lowest and highest Cerebral Performance Category scores at discharge had a shorter LOS. A logistic regression model based on parameters at discharge achieved an area under the curve of 0.840 to 0.896 for prolonged LOS prediction, indicating the favorable performance of this model in predicting LOS in patients receiving TTM. Our study identified clinically relevant risk factors for prolonged LOS following TTM and developed a prediction model that exhibited adequate predictive performance. The findings of this study broaden our understanding regarding factors associated with hospital stay and can be beneficial while making clinical decisions for patients with cardiac arrest who receive TTM.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a dangerous ailment that can last a person's entire life and is caused by either kidney malignancy or decreased kidney functioning. It is feasible to halt or slow the progression of this chronic disease to an end-stage wherein dialysis or surgical intervention is the only method to preserve a patient's life. Earlier detection and appropriate therapy can increase the likelihood of this happening. Throughout this research, the potential of several different machine learning approaches for providing an early diagnosis of CKD has been investigated. There has been a significant amount of research conducted on this topic. Nevertheless, we are bolstering our approach by making use of predictive modeling. Therefore, in our approach, we investigate the link that exists between data factors as well as the characteristics of the target class. We are capable of constructing a collection of prediction models with the help of machine learning and predictive analytics, thanks to the better measures of attributes that can be introduced using predictive modeling. This study starts with 25 variables in addition to the class property, but by the end, it has narrowed the list down to 30% of those parameters as the best subset to identify CKD. Twelve different machine learning-based classifiers have been tested in a supervised learning environment. Within the confines of a supervised learning environment, a total of 12 different machine learning-based classifiers have indeed been examined, with the greatest performance indicators being an accuracy of 0.983, a precision of 0.98, a recall of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.98 for the XgBoost classifier. The way the research was done leads to the conclusion that recent improvements in machine learning, along with the help of predictive modeling, make for an interesting way to find new solutions that can then be used to test the accuracy of prediction in the field of kidney disease and beyond.",

We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct until October 2021 and found a total of 131 papers. With meticulous screening finally, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. COVID-19 patients with sodium levels greater than the reference level were the study population and the outcome of interest was the poor outcome; such as mortality, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospital stay. The pooled estimate was calculated as the odds ratio (OR). There were 19,032 patients with hypernatremia in the 17 studies included. An overall random effect meta-analysis showed that hypernatremia was associated with mortality (OR: 3.18 [1.61, 6.28], P < .0001, I2 = 91.99%), prolong hospitalization (OR: 1.97 [1.37, 2.83], P < .001, I2 = 0.00%) and Ventilation (OR: 5.40 [1.89, 15.42], P < .001, I2 = 77.35%), ICU admission (OR: 3.99 [0.89, 17.78], P = .07, I2 = 86.79%). Meta-regression analysis showed the association of age with the ICU outcome of hypernatremia patients. Whereas, other parameters like male, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus did not significantly influence the odds ratio. Hypernatremia was markedly associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Hence, a blood ionogram is warranted and special attention must be given to hypernatremia COVID-19 patients.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA. We analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5 × 5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units. We found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group. As the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.",

Nevertheless, there is limited data on the global burden of diseases attributable to lead exposure. In this study, we evaluated the temporal-spatial trend of disease burden caused by lead exposure in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Based on Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and DALYs rate (ASDR) were estimated by region, country, sex and age. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR between 1990 and 2019. Global deaths increased from 0.53 (95% UI: 0.31, 0.77) to 0.90 (95% UI: 0.55, 1.29) million, and the number of DALYs increased from 16.02 (95% UI: 10.32, 22.17) to 21.68 (95% UI: 13.81, 30.30) million between 1990 and 2019.

Most of disease burden of lead exposure occurred in the men and elderly population. Stroke and ischemic heart disease were two key sources of disease burden of lead exposure. Also, a negative association between sociodemographic index (SDI) and disease burden of lead exposure was observed.

        "abstract": "Fibrosis is a hallmark of progressive kidney diseases. The overexpression of profibrotic cytokine, namely transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) due to excessive inflammation and tissue damage, induces kidney fibrosis. The inhibition of TGF-β signaling is markedly limited in experimental disease models. Targeting TGF-β signaling, therefore, offers a prospective strategy for the management of kidney fibrosis. Presently, the marketed drugs have numerous side effects, but plant-derived compounds are relatively safer and more cost-effective. In this study, TGFβR-1 was targeted to identify the lead compounds among flavonoids using various computational approaches, such as ADME/T (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion/toxicity) analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation. ADME/T screening identified a total of 31 flavonoids with drug-like properties of 31 compounds, a total of 5 compounds showed a higher binding affinity to TGFβR-1, with Epicatechin, Fisetin, and Luteolin ranking at the top three (-13.58, -13.17, and -10.50 kcal/mol, respectively), which are comparable to the control drug linagliptin (-9.074 kcal/mol). The compounds also exhibited outstanding protein-ligand interactions. The molecular dynamic simulations revealed a stable interaction of these compounds with the binding site of TGFβR-1. These findings indicate that flavonoids, particularly Epicatechin, Fisetin, and Luteolin, may compete with the ligand-binding site of TGFβR-1, suggesting that these compounds can be further evaluated for the development of potential therapeutics against kidney fibrosis. Further, <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> studies are recommended to support the current findings.",

        "abstract": "Persistent kidney illness in children and those on dialysis therapy, risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies due to abnormal renal metabolism, anorexia, inadequate intake, poor gastrointestinal absorption, drug-nutrient interaction, and dialysis-related losses. Adequate nutritional management is essential to achieve and maintain an optimal nutritional status for the usual pattern of growth, sexual and neurocognitive development, metabolic abnormalities, and ultimately reducing the risk of chronic mortality and morbidity in adulthood. The purpose of this paper is to describe a protocol for a systematic review to assess the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation in children with chronic renal disease. This systematic review protocol is developed according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) as well as the Cochrane group guidelines. Comprehensive searching for all possible relevant works of literature- such as PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Science-Direct, Scopus, Research-Gate, Clinical Trials for all randomized controlled studies, full paper articles, and articles written in English will be considered. The primary outcome of this review will be measuring any changes (such as changes in body mass, BMI, and overall Z-score) in the nutritional status of the children (age < 18 years) with chronic kidney disease following vitamin and mineral supplementations.

        "title": "System biology approaches identified novel biomarkers and their signaling pathways involved in renal cell carcinoma with different human diseases.",
        "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of cancer that develops in the renal epithelium of the kidney. It is responsible for approximately 3% of adult malignancies, and 90-95% of neoplasms originate from the kidney. Advances in tumor diagnosis, innovative immune therapeutics, and checkpoint inhibitors-based treatment options improved the survival rate of patients with RCC accompanied by different risk factors. RCC patients with diabetes, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or obesity (OB) may have a comorbidity, and finding the risk factor for better clinical treatment is an urgent issue. Therefore, the study focused on network-based gene expression analysis approaches to learning the impact of RCC on other comorbidities associated with the disease. The study found critical genetic factors and signal transduction pathways that share pathophysiology and commonly use dysregulated genes of the illness. Initially, the study identified 385 up-regulated genes and 338 down-regulated genes involved with RCC. OB, chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and HCV significantly shared 28, 14, 5, and 3 genes, respectively. RCC shared one down-regulated gene versican (VCAN) with OB and HCV and one down-regulated gene oxidase homolog 2 (LOXL2) with OB and CKD. Interestingly, most of the shared pathways were linked with metabolism. The study also identified six prospective biomarkers, signaling pathways, and numerous critical regulatory and associated drug candidates for the disease. We believe that the discovery will help explain these diseases' complicated interplay and aid in developing novel therapeutic targets and drug candidates.",

        "abstract": "Glomerular diseases are the leading drivers of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease disability-adjusted life years in resource-limited countries. Proper diagnosis and treatment relies on resources including kidney biopsy, ancillary testing, and access to evidence-based therapies. We conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey cascaded through society mailing lists among nephrologists in countries of Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. We collected the data on respondent demographics, their ability to perform and appropriately interpret a kidney biopsy, and their access to complementary investigations and treatment practices. A total of 298 kidney care specialists from 33 countries (53.3% from Asia and 44.6% from Africa; 64% from academic or university hospitals) participated in the survey. Of these specialists, 85% performed kidney biopsy. About 61% of the respondents could not obtain a kidney biopsy in more than 50% of patients with suspected glomerular disease. About 43% of the respondents from Africa had access to only light microscopy. Overall, the inability to undertake and fully evaluate a biopsy and perform ancillary investigations were more profound in Africa than in Asia. Overall, 59% of participants reported that more than 75% of their patients meet the cost of diagnosis and treatment by out-of-pocket payments. Empirical use of immunosuppression was higher in Africa than in Asia. The main barriers for diagnosis and treatment included delayed presentation, incomplete diagnostic work-up, and high cost of treatment. Major system-level barriers impede the implementation of guideline-driven approaches for diagnosis and treatment of patients with glomerular disease in resource-limited countries.",

        "abstract": "Hyperthyroidism is one of the major complications in CKD patients who results in a number of metabolic disorders and contributes to morbidity and mortality. The objective of the study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for secondary hyperparathyroidism among CKD patients as well as its correlation with different laboratory parameters. This was a cross-sectional study conducted among the admitted CKD patients of Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, Sylhet, Bangladesh from January 2019 to December 2019. Following recruitment, clinical parameters were extracted from the patients' medical records. Afterward, blood sample blood was collected to measure the biochemical parameters and serum parathyroid hormone levels. A binary logistic regression model was used to assess the factors associated with hyperparathyroidism. The mean±SD serum PTH in all CKD patients was 215.04±168.15 pg/ml. The overall prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism among CKD patients was 75.0% (32.0% in stage 3, 88.0% in stage 4 and 93.0% in stage 5 CKD). Serum PTH levels had a significant positive correlation with serum creatinine and serum phosphate levels and a significant negative correlation with serum albumin and serum calcium levels. However, only female sex was revealed as a significant risk factor in the adjusted regression model (aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.98 for male sex compared to female sex). As the prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism increases in advanced stages of CKD, early detection and management of CKD are crucial to prevent metabolic disorders that could trigger the development of this complication.",

        "abstract": "The outcomes of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) vary internationally, given regional differences in patient co-morbidities, access to health care, interventional procedures and adherence to guideline-based management practices. This study aimed to identify the predictors of mortality from a large ACS registry of patients admitted to a tertiary care cardiac centre in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This was a hospital record based retrospective cross sectional observational study that included all patients presenting with ACS to Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital and Research Institute, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2013 to December 2013. Data were collected from cardiac catheterization laboratory database and hospital discharge records. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethical approval was obtained by Institutional Review Board of the hospital. A total of 1914 ACS patients were studied: 39.8% presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 39.7% with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 20.5% with unstable angina (UA). There were 146 in-hospital deaths (7.6%). Mortality was highest among STEMI patients (10.5%), followed by NSTEMI (8.1%) and UA (1.03%). The mean age of expired patients was significantly higher than that of those who survived (64.82±12.14 years vs. 57.32±11.99 years; p<0.001). Male patients were 71.4%, with no significant gender differences observed between expired and surviving groups. Age >50 years {odds ratio (OR) 2.56, p=0.005}, chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 2.1, p<0.001), shock (OR 16.82, p<0.001), left ventricular failure (LVF) (OR 2.43, p<0.001) and STEMI (OR 1.92, p=0.002) were independent predictors of mortality among ACS patients. Although diabetes per se was not associated with mortality (OR 1.3; 95% CI=0.89-1.91; p=0.169), uncontrolled diabetes defined as HbA1c levels ≥7.5% had significant risk of mortality (OR 51.4, p<0.001). ACS patients who did not undergo angiography (OR 16.4; p<0.001) or PCI (OR 18.9; p<0.001) had greater risk of mortality. ACS patients complicated with shock, LVF, uncontrolled diabetes and CKD had increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Improved outcomes may be likely with prompt angiography and PCI during index admission. This study is a preliminary initiative, and prospective multi-centre registries with nation-wide involvement are warranted.",

Aim of this study was to assess of serum calcium level in chronic kidney diseased patients in order to compare this parameter with healthy subjects. This analytical type of cross-sectional study was carried out in the Physiology department, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2018 to June 2019. A total number of 200 subjects, age range 30-70 year were included in this study. Among 200 subjects, 100 healthy were taken as control group (Group I) and 100 chronic kidney diseased patients were taken as study group (Group II). Control group (Group I) subdivided into male healthy subject (Group IA) and female healthy subject (Group IB). Also study group (Group II) subdivided into male chronic kidney diseased patient (Group IIA) and female chronic kidney diseased patient (Group IIB). The results were calculated and analyzed by using SPSS version-21. Expression of data as mean±SE and statistical significance of difference among the group was calculated by unpaired student's 't' test. In this study we found that mean±SE serum calcium of Group IA and Group IIA were 9.60±0.09mg/dl & 8.04±0.03mg/dl respectively. The mean±SE serum calcium of Group IB and Group IIB were 9.38±0.096mg/dl & 8.19±0.05mg/dl respectively. Serum calcium was significantly decreased in study groups in comparison with control groups (p<0.001). By this study we therefore recommended that routine estimation of this parameter is important for prevention of complication related to chronic kidney disease for leading a healthy life.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients are a significant threat to chronic kidney disease (CKD) development during their life. However, there is always a high chance of delay in CKD detection because CKD can be asymptomatic, and T1DM patients bypass traditional CKD tests during their routine checkups. This study aims to develop and validate a prediction model and nomogram of CKD in T1DM patients using readily available routine checkup data for early CKD detection. This research utilized 1375 T1DM patients' sixteen years of longitudinal data from multi-center Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) clinical trials conducted at 28 sites in the USA and Canada and considered 17 routinely available features. Three feature ranking algorithms, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forest (RF), and extremely randomized trees classifier (ERT), were applied to create three feature ranking lists, and logistic regression analyses were performed to develop CKD prediction models using these ranked feature lists to identify the best performing top-ranked features combination. Finally, the most significant features were selected to develop a multivariate logistic regression-based CKD prediction model for T1DM patients. This model was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F1 score on train and test data. A nomogram of the final model was further generated for easy application in clinical practices. Hypertension, duration of diabetes, drinking habit, triglycerides, ACE inhibitors, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, age, and smoking habit were the top-8 features ranked by the XGB model and identified as the most important features for predicting CKD in T1DM patients. These eight features were selected to develop the final prediction model using multivariate logistic regression, which showed 90.04% and 88.59% accuracy in internal and test data validation. The proposed model showed excellent performance and can be used for CKD identification in T1DM patients during routine checkups.",

        "title": "Disease-specific distress healthcare financing and catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure for hospitalization in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Financial risk protection and equity are two fundamental components of the global commitment to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which mandates health system reform based on population needs, disease incidence, and economic burden to ensure that everyone has access to health services without any financial hardship. We estimated disease-specific incidences of catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure and distress financing to investigate progress toward UHC financial risk indicators and investigated inequalities in financial risk protection indicators by wealth quintiles. In addition, we explored the determinants of financial hardship indicators as a result of hospitalization costs. In order to conduct this research, data were extracted from the latest Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in 2016-2017. Financial hardship indicators in UHC were measured by catastrophic health expenditure and distress financing (sale/mortgage, borrowing, and family support). Concentration curves (CC) and indices (CI) were estimated to measure the pattern and severity of inequalities across socio-economic classes. Binary logistic regression models were used to assess the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure and distress financing. We found that about 26% of households incurred catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and 58% faced distress financing on hospitalization in Bangladesh. The highest incidence of CHE was for cancer (50%), followed by liver diseases (49.2%), and paralysis (43.6%). The financial hardship indicators in terms of CHE (CI = -0.109) and distress financing (CI = -0.087) were more concentrated among low-income households. Hospital admission to private health facilities, non-communicable diseases, and the presence of chronic patients in households significantly increases the likelihood of higher UHC financial hardship indicators. The study findings strongly suggest the need for national-level social health security schemes with a particular focus on low-income households, since we identified greater inequalities between low- and high-income households in UHC financial hardship indicators. Regulating the private sector and implementing subsidized healthcare programmes for diseases with high treatment costs, such as cancer, heart disease, liver disease, and kidney disease are also expected to be effective to protect households from financial hardship. Finally, in order to reduce reliance on OOPE, the government should consider increasing its allocations to the health sector.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked to major health consequences and a poor quality of life. Despite the fact that CKD is becoming more prevalent, public knowledge of the disease remains low. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of a health education intervention designed to enhance knowledge, health-related quality of life (QOL), and motivation about healthy lifestyle among adults with CKD. This study was a parallel-group (1:1), randomized controlled trial in the Mirzapur subdistrict of Bangladesh that compared 2 groups of patients with CKD. Adults with CKD (stages 1-3) were enrolled in November 2020 and randomly assigned the intervention or control group. The intervention group received health education through a CKD awareness campaign and mobile health technologies and was observed for 6 months, whereas the control group received standard treatment. The primary outcome was the evaluation of improved scores on the CKD knowledge questionnaire, and the secondary outcomes were improved QOL and changes in the levels of blood pressure (BP), BMI, serum creatinine, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The study enrolled 126 patients (control: n=63; intervention: n=63) and performed intention-to-treat analysis. The analyses included repeated measures ANOVA, and the results were observed to be significantly different from within groups (P<.001), between groups (P<.001), and the interaction of group × time factor (P<.001) for knowledge score. Diastolic BP and BMI showed significant differences arising from within groups (P<.001 and P=.01, respectively) and the interaction of group × time factor (P=.001 and P=.02, respectively); food salinity and hip circumferences showed significant differences arising from within groups (P=.001 and P=.03, respectively) and between groups (P=.001 and P=.02, respectively). Moreover, systolic BP and waist circumference showed significant differences from within groups (P<.001 and P=.003, respectively). However, no significant differences were found arising from within groups, between groups, and the interactions of group × time for QOL, urine salinity, and mid-upper arm circumference. Regarding the laboratory findings, from baseline to 6 months, the mean (SD) FBS decreased by 0.51 (3.77) mmol/L in the intervention group and 0.10 (1.44) mmol/L in the control group (P=.03); however, blood urea nitrogen increased by 3.64 (7.17) mg/dL in the intervention group and 1.68 (10.10) mg/dL in the control group (P=.01). The health education strategy, which included a campaign and mobile health, showed promise for enhancing CKD knowledge among patients with CKD. This strategy may also aid patients with CKD in controlling their FBS and BP. The combined health education initiatives give evidence for scaling them up in Bangladesh and possibly other low- and middle-income countries, particularly in rural and peri-urban settings.

Multiple studies have proved that there is a substantial pathophysiological link between COVID-19 disease and patients having comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. In this study, we attempted to identify differentially expressed genes as well as genes that intersected among them in order to comprehend their compatibility. Gene expression profiling indicated that 849 genes were mutually exclusive and functional analysis was done within the context of gene ontology and key pathways involvement. Three genes (PRPF31, FOXN2, and RIOK3) were commonly upregulated in the analysed datasets of three disease categories. These genes could be potential biomarkers for patients with COVID-19 and cystic fibrosis, and COVID-19 and chronic kidney disease. Further extensive analyses have been performed to describe how these genes are regulated by various transcription factors and microRNAs. Then, our analyses revealed six hub genes (PRPF31, FOXN2, RIOK3, UBC, HNF4A, and ELAVL). As they were involved in the interaction between COVID-19 and the patient with CF and CKD, they could help researchers identify potential therapeutic molecules. Some drugs have been predicted based on the upregulated genes, which may have a significant impact on reducing the burden of these diseases in the future.",

It is a retrospective cross-sectional study to investigate the variation in age, sex, dwelling, comorbidities, and medication with the COVID-19 severity and hospitalization by enrolling 1025 recovered individuals while comparing their time of recovery with or without comorbidities. COVID-19 patients mostly suffered from fever. The predominant underlying medical conditions in them were hypertension (HTN) followed by diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (54.3%) and hepatic disorders (HD) (43.6%) experienced higher severity. The risk of symptomatic cases was higher in aged (odds ratio, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02-1.06) and comorbid (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.34-2.60) patients. T-test confirmed the differences between the comorbid and non-comorbid patients' recovery duration. The presence of multiple comorbidities increased the time of recovery (15-27 days) and hospitalization (20-40%). Increased symptomatic cases were found for patients having DM+HTN whereas CVD+Asthma patients were found with higher percentage of severity. Besides, DM+CKD (chronic kidney disease) was associated with higher hospitalization rate. Higher odds of severity were found for DM+CVD (OR = 4.42, 95% CI = 1.81-10.78) patients. Hospitalization risk was also increased for them (OR = 5.14, 95% CI = 2.02-13.07). Moreover, if they had HTN along with DM+CVD, they were found with even higher odds (OR = 6.82, 95% CI = 2.37-19.58) for hospitalization. Our study indicates that people who are aged, females, living in urban area and have comorbid conditions are at a higher risk for developing COVID-19 severity. Clinicians and health management authorities should prioritize these high-risk groups to reduce mortality attributed to the disease.",

Immunosuppression was undertaken using tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (1,500 mg/day), and prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day). All patients received basiliximab for induction therapy. The median baseline anti-ABO antibody titer was 164 (range, 132-1128). Transplantation was performed at a titer of ≤18. Our patients attended three to five PEX sessions before transplantation. Graft survival was 100% in the seven cases over a mean period of 22 months. The mean creatinine level was 204.6±47.4 µmol/L. Two patients were suspected of having developed acute rejection and received intravenous methylprednisolone, resulting in improved kidney function. One patient required posttransplant hemodialysis due to delayed graft function and subsequently improved. Infection was the most common complication experienced by ABOi KT patients. Two patients developed severe cytomegalovirus pneumonia and died with functioning grafts. ABOi KT in Bangladesh will substantially expand the living kidney donor pool and bring hope to a large number of ESRD patients without ABO-compatible donors. However, the high cost and risk of acute rejection and infection remain major concerns.",

        "abstract": "Kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), have become critical clinical, socioeconomic, and public health concerns worldwide. The kidney requires a lot of energy, and mitochondria act as the central organelle for the proper functioning of the kidney. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with the pathogenesis of AKI and CKD. Natural products and their structural analogs have been sought as an alternative therapeutic strategy despite the challenges in drug discovery. Many studies have shown that small-molecule natural products can improve renal function and ameliorate kidney disease progression. This review summarizes the nephroprotective effects of small-molecule natural products, such as berberine, betulinic acid, celastrol, curcumin, salidroside, polydatin, and resveratrol. Treatment with small-molecule natural products was shown to attenuate renal oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and restore mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in the kidneys against various injury stimuli. Therefore, small-molecule natural products should be recognized as multi-target therapeutics and promising drugs to prevent kidney diseases, particularly those with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "Abnormalities in hematology and comorbidities might have a role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, the exact relationships between hematological parameters and the severity of CKD are not well understood. Also, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of different blood parameters and comorbidities among hospitalized CKD patients in Bangladesh. The present study enrolled admitted CKD patients at Evercare Hospital Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 1, 2021, to August 1, 2021. For this study, the demographic and clinical information of the patients were collected. Then some routine blood tests for the hematological profile of CKD patients were performed. Finally, several statistical methods were performed and data interpretations were done to evaluate the role of hematological changes on CKD patients. Among 300 patients, early-stage CKD patients (ESCKDP) and advanced-stage CKD patients (ASCKDP) were 153 and 147, respectively. The decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) in ASCKDP were observed. However, the present study found increased levels of corpuscular Hb in ASCKDP than ESCKDP. Also, the present study noticed correlations between these changes and the severity of CKD. Also, we observed a significant difference in age and body mass index between ESCKDP and ASCKDP. Based on our results, lower Hb and RBC levels may use in assessing the severity and the treatment decisions of CKD patients in the hospital setting. Therefore, our findings may assist with developing a treatment protocol for hospitalized CKD patients.",
