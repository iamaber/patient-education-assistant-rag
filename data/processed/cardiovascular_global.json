        "title": "Trends in epilepsy mortality of three incidence cohorts across 2006-2023 in Sweden: a matched register-based study.",
        "abstract": "Idiopathic epilepsy alone accounts for a large health burden as shown in the Global Burden of Diseases Study. In countries with ageing populations, secondary epilepsies are now even more common. Altered clinical practice and reduced use of older enzyme-inducing drugs may be beneficial, but understanding of trends in the prognosis of all epilepsy is needed. Our objective was to determine and study trends in mortality in persons with epilepsy in Sweden through 2006-2023. We performed a matched cohort study by cross-referencing National Patient, Drug, and Cause of Death Registers. We included all persons with a diagnosis of epilepsy and antiseizure medication (ASM) after 2006 (n = 61,375) and three age-/sex-matched comparators/case. Mortality was assessed for three incidence cohorts; 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2020, totally and in four subgroups: age >50, vascular disease, generalized epilepsy, and age <20. Risk of death was assessed by Cox regression. Carbamazepine and valproic acid were common first ASMs in 2006-2010, but replaced by levetiracetam by 2016-2020. Valproate became less common in generalized epilepsy. The adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for death was 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.90-2.08) in 2006-2010 and 1.90 (95% CI: 1.82-1.99) in 2016-2020. The adjusted HR for death was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.50-1.68) for persons with cardiovascular disease versus comparators during 2016-2020. A sensitivity analysis showed that the excces risk of cardiovascular death had decreased between our cohorts. Young persons with epilepsy had a 30-50 fold increased HR of death. Dementia and vascular disease were important risk factors for death in persons with epilepsy. Mortality in epilepsy has remained largely unchanged relative to age- and sex matched comparators. The increased use of non-inducing ASMs may have reduced vascular risk slightly. Efforts should be targeted to specific patient groups, particularly regarding epilepsy management in the young and vascular and neurodegenerative comorbidities in older persons with epilepsy.

        "title": "Obesity and male infertility - a tenuous relationship: Facts discerned for the busy clinicians.",
        "abstract": "Obesity is a common health problem affecting over a third of the population worldwide. Obesity has been correlated with many diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer, brain degeneration, and premature aging. In men, obesity can also cause issues like erectile dysfunction, poor sperm quality, and prostate problems. Factors like high insulin levels, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress may play a role in how obesity affects male fertility. Obesity can disrupt the male reproductive system by changing hormone levels, affecting sperm production, and causing problems with metabolism. This can result in a reduction of sperm count, motility, and normal forms. Obesity can also cause sperm DNA fragmentation, increase cell death, and impact the genetic information that can be passed on to future generations. This narrative review explores how obesity impacts male reproductive health and fertility, as well as possible treatment options like weight management, lifestyle changes, medications, and alternative therapies.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the connection between monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and to introduce a novel perspective to early clinical diagnosis of CIN. This single-center bidirectional cohort study included 1771 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from January 2017 to July 2022 at the Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. The study collected data retrospectively through an electronic medical record system with postoperative follow-up. The primary endpoint was CIN, and secondary endpoints were mortality and readmission within two years after PCI, along with total days of hospitalization. Patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative MHR (Group 1: MHR <0.42; Group 2: MHR ≥0.42 and <0.64; Group 3: MHR ≥0.64). The study used regression analyses to investigate the relationship between MHR and CIN rate and postoperative mortality, and demonstrated the cumulative incidence of postoperative fatal events in the three groups of patients by Kaplan-Meier curves, and also analyzed the predictive value of MHR and other inflammatory indicators on the risk of CIN by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Compared to Group 1, Groups 2 and 3 had a higher incidence of CIN, higher mortality, and longer hospital stays (<i>P</i> <0.001). Survival analysis showed significant differences in long-term mortality among the three groups (Log rank test, <i>P</i> = 0.032). Multivariate regression analysis showed that for every 1-unit increase in MHR, the risk of CIN increased 8.567-fold (95% CI: 4.291-17.102, <i>P</i> <0.001) and the risk of death increased 3.080-fold (95% CI: 1.423-6.666, <i>P</i> = 0.004). ROC analysis showed that MHR had a good predictive ability for CIN (AUC: 0.713, 95% CI: 0.666-0.759, <i>P</i> <0.001). MHR is significantly linked to CIN and 2-year mortality following PCI in CAD patients, serving as a CIN risk assessment tool to assist clinics in early identification of high-risk patients and optimization of treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "The dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12), which may result from genomic alterations or modulation by upstream effectors, is implicated in cancer oncogenesis and progression. CDK12 overexpression or activation is sufficient to induce tumor initiation, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. However, CDK12 may also exert tumor-suppressive functions in a context-dependent manner. Therefore, caution is warranted when targeting CDK12 in future clinical trials. A comprehensive elucidation of the dual roles and underlying mechanisms of CDK12 in carcinogenesis is urgently needed to advance precision oncology. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the dysregulation and biological roles of CDK12 in cancer. Subsequently, we systematically summarize the functions and mechanisms of the oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles of CDK12 in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the potential of CDK12 as a novel therapeutic target and its implications in clinical oncology, offering insights into future directions for innovative cancer treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator, ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia. We investigated the effects of pemafibrate on steatotic liver disease (SLD) in relation to various atherogenic lipid profiles. Thirty-nine Japanese patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertriglyceridemia (men/women: 24/15, mean age: 58.2 years, median duration of diabetes: 5.0 years) were treated with 0.2 mg/day of pemafibrate for 12 months (M). SLD was estimated by fatty liver index (FLI), which is calculated by using waist circumference, body mass index and levels of triglycerides and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Treatment with pemafibrate significantly increased mean levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (baseline/3M/6M/12M: 46/55/55/54 mg/dL) and decreased median levels of triglycerides (baseline/3M/6M/12M: 211/112/99/98 mg/dL), non-HDL-C (146/128/125/121 mg/dL), small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (45/33/30/30 mg/dL) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (8.1/2.6/2.3/2.4 mg/dL). There was no significant change in hemoglobin A1c level over time. FLI (mean ± standard deviation: 68.1 ± 21.9 <i>vs</i>. 39.6 ± 25.0, P < 0.001), but not FIB-4 index as a marker of hepatic fibrosis (median [interquartile range]: 1.04 [0.78-1.39] <i>vs</i>. 1.01 [0.68-1.36], P = 0.909), was significantly decreased by treatment with pemafibrate for 12M, and the proportion of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD (MASLD) was significantly decreased from 92.3% (baseline) to 61.5% (12M). Pemafibrate ameliorates MASLD estimated by FLI in addition to various atherogenic lipid profiles in Japanese hypertriglyceridemia patients with T2DM in the past mean 5 years. An early intervention with pemafibrate might contribute to prevention of the development of MASLD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "PGC-1α is induced by hypoxia and interacts with the receptor ERR-α to stimulate angiogenic factors expression and promote angiogenesis. We investigated the possible role of the PGC-1α/ERR-α pathway in regulating angiogenic factors expression in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). We analysed vitreous fluid samples from PDR and non-diabetic patients and epiretinal fibrovascular membranes from PDR patients. Streptozotocin-treated rats were used as a model of diabetic retinopathy. Vitreous samples, epiretinal membranes, rat retinas, human retinal Müller glial cells and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were studied by Western blot analysis, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined with spectrofluorometric analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated co-expression of PGC-1α and ERR-α in endothelial cells and leukocytes in epiretinal membranes. Angiogenic activity, determined by the numbers of CD31-positive vessels, correlated significantly with PGC-1α and ERR-α expression levels. PGC-1α, ERR-α and the angiogenic biomarkers vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 were significantly increased in PDR vitreous samples. Diabetes induced upregulation of PGC-1α and ERR-α immunoreactive proteoforms in rat retinas. Cultured Müller cells and HRMECs constitutively expressed PGC-1α and ERR-α. In Müller cells, the PGC-1α inhibitor SR-18292 and the ERR-α selective inverse agonist XCT790 significantly attenuated VEGF, angiopoietin 2 and MCP-1/CCL2 upregulation induced by diabetic mimetic conditions. Treatment of Müller cells with the PGC-1α activator XLN005 induced significant upregulation of VEGF and attenuated ROS production induced by diabetic mimetic conditions. Our findings suggest that suppression of the PGC-1α/ERR-α pathway might impair the upregulation of angiogenic factors in PDR.",

Insulin regulates cellular metabolism and growth under normal conditions by activating downstream signaling pathways through its receptors. Nonetheless, insulin resistance, which compromises the insulin signaling pathway and impairs cardiovascular system performance, is common in individuals with T2DM. The key insulin signaling genes include IRS1, IRS2, PIK3R1, and GLUT4 play important roles in insulin receptor signaling, PI3K complex assembly, and glucose transport, respectively. Mutations or abnormal expression of these genes may lead to disorders in the insulin signaling pathway, affecting the normal regulation of glucose metabolism and impairment of myocardial function, thereby promoting the development of DCM. This review delves into the specific roles of these genes in the pathogenic mechanisms and treatment of DCM, with the aim of providing scientific evidence and guidance for future research endeavors.",

The objective of this analysis was to identify risk factors for postoperative mitral valve regurgitation progression and evaluate valvuloplasty effectiveness. This retrospective, single-center study investigated the clinical efficacy of mitral valvuloplasty and identified factors that affect prognosis. Pediatric patients with moderate or severe mitral valve regurgitation who had undergone mitral valvuloplasty between September 2016 and August 2023 were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess freedom from both mitral valve deterioration and cardiovascular death. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors. The study comprised 137 pediatric patients (mean age, 37.5 months [range, 2.4-167.6 months]) who had moderate (64/137 [46.7%]) or severe (73.137 [53.3%]) mitral valve regurgitation. At midterm follow-up (median, 55.3 months), mitral valve regurgitation had statistically significantly decreased compared with preoperative levels (<i>P</i> < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test); freedom from cardiovascular death was 97.5%, and freedom from worsening mitral valve regurgitation was 89.4%. Cox regression analysis identified body weight (<i>P</i> = .02), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (<i>P</i> = .005), and left ventricular ejection fraction (<i>P</i> = .01) at 1 month and cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i> = .007) as independent risk factors for deterioration. Patients weighing 10 kg or more (<i>P</i> = .04) or with a ventricular septal defect 8 mm or larger (<i>P</i> = .04) had worse outcomes. Mitral valvuloplasty resulted in low mortality and positive long-term results in pediatric patients with mitral valve regurgitation.

The present study describes the cases of 3 patients with hyperkalemia that occurred during RAASi therapy and describes the therapeutic approach used for this serious complication. The clinical/laboratory findings of hospitalized patients with hyperkalemia within a short time period (within 30 days) and treatment were recorded. Acute hyperkalemia developed due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and spironolactone in 3 patients, whose cases are reported herein. Insulin glucose infusion (IGI) + salbutamol + potassium binders were used for the treatment of severe hyperkalemia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) regressed in all patients. Hyperkalemia was corrected within 6 h in 1 patient who was treated with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in addition to IGI. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that hyperkalemia may be symptomatic/asymptomatic and may develop during the earlier or later period of RAASi therapy for cardiovascular-renal disease, particularly in older patients. AKI improved with the correction of hyperkalemia and the discontinuation of ACEi/ARB and spironolactone. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may be the preferred treatment in emergency cases of hyperkalemia due to its rapid effects. On the other hand, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may also be used to avoid the development of hyperkalemia in patients undergoing RAASi therapy.",

The role of plasmalogens in various patho-physiological processes has been revealed in recent years, including various neurological disorders associated with plasmalogen deficiency. Plasmalogen Replacement Therapy (PRT) is a therapeutic approach that aims to increase plasmalogen levels in the body and address plasmalogen deficiencies in diseases such as age-related neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, certain genetic peroxisomal disorders, and metabolic disorders. We provide a detailed overview of current information on the role of plasmalogens in health and disease. We summarize various strategies for regulating plasmalogen levels and highlight recent advancements in therapeutic applications.

The study included 377 healthy adults aged 18-59 years (mean {SD}: 31.34 {11.64} years). Participants with health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, gastrointestinal diseases, kidney disorders, and cardiovascular issues, were excluded. Additionally, individuals taking prescription medications, food supplements, consuming high levels of caffeine or alcohol, smoking heavily, or engaging in intense aerobic training were also excluded. Sociodemographic data were collected, and hydration status was assessed using urine samples (first-morning and 24-hour) and blood tests (plasma osmolality, blood count, and renal function). Urine measurements included specific gravity (USG), osmolality (UOSM), volume (UVOL), and colour (UCOL), which were compared against hydration biomarkers. Chi-square tests and independent t-tests (p<0.05) were employed to compare sociodemographic characteristics and hydration status between urban and rural adults. Factor analysis was used to assess the reliability of hydration measurements. Significant differences were observed in USG, UOSM, and UVOL of first-morning urine samples (χ²{2}=6.537, p=0.038; χ²{1}=6.465, p=0.011; t{375}=-2.10, p=0.036). Additionally, significant differences in USG and UOSM of 24-hour urine samples were noted between urban and rural adults (χ²{2}=27.686, p=0.000; χ²{2}=11.030, p=0.000). Blood tests revealed significant differences in hematocrit (HCT) (t{375}=-1.987, p=0.048), sodium concentration (Na) (t{375}=-4.468, p=0.000), potassium concentration (K) (t{375}=3.563, p=0.000), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (t{371.96}=-4.247, p=0.000) between urban and rural adults. The results indicated that rural adults are less hydrated than their urban counterparts. Factor analysis confirmed that urine measurements are strong indicators of hydration status (quality scores >1), with USG and UOSM in first-morning urine (FMU) showing a strong positive correlation with 24-hour urine samples (0.999), indicating that urine tests are more reliable than blood tests for assessing hydration status. This study found significant differences in hydration status between urban and rural adults in Selangor, Malaysia, based on both urine and blood measurements; however, urine tests proved to be more reliable for assessing hydration levels. These findings may inform strategies to improve hydration among Malaysian adults. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing hydration status.",

        "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, particularly among adults aged 45 years and older. Self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) is an evidence-based intervention that can help patients manage hypertension outside of the clinical setting. We conducted a needs and assets assessment to identify (1) health center adopters and implementers and (2) barriers and facilitators to SMBP adoption and implementation in six community health centers in Texas. Data sources included: (1) needs and assets assessment surveys and semi-structured interviews; (2) site visits with participating health centers; and (3) detailed meeting notes and logs. Leaders and administrators from the participating health centers completed a self-administered 56-item survey. We computed descriptive statistics for survey data. For open-ended survey responses, interview data, and meeting notes, team members labeled the reported and observed barriers and facilitators to program implementation. Barriers to SMBP adoption and implementation included staffing shortages, limited funding to procure blood pressure devices, and perceived challenges reaching patients and maintaining engagement in an SMBP program. Facilitators included existing hypertension management guidelines, health center familiarity with SMBP programs, and the use of non-physician team members in hypertension management programs. Adopters included leadership professionals and administrators, and implementers included healthcare providers, and non-physician team members. Findings inform our understanding of SMBP program adoption, implementation, and importantly, how to best allocate resources to incorporate SMBP programs into clinical workflows.",

Our objective was to investigate AGPA regarding related markers of cardiovascular disease and dementia using cross-sectional and interventional approaches. In Study 1, community-based older individuals were assessed, and 30 individuals who performed AGPA (AG group) and 30 1:1 age-, sex-, and objective activity-matched controls were cross-sectionally compared (mean age, 75 ± 6 y). Arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity) was lower and hand-finger dexterity (pegboard test) was higher in the AG vs. control groups. The interventional results of Study 2 (secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial) confirmed that consistent AGPA might regress white matter hyperintensities in older individuals.

The research was carried out as part of the fourth Serbian National Health Survey, in the period from October to December 2019, as a descriptive, cross-sectional analytical study and included the population of cardiovascular patients (<i>N</i> = 4,712) aged over 20 years; Descriptive and inferential statistical methods, including percentage-based structure indicators, Chi-square (χ2) tests for categorical variable differences, and prevalence ratio for examining relationships between dependent and independent variables, were used in the data analysis. The analysis identified several significant contributors to cardiovascular healthcare utilization, emphasizing distinct and overlapping factors that impact various types of healthcare use.

After being transferred to our tertiary center, he quickly progressed to cardiac arrest and required extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). Initially, due to high levels of inflammatory markers, sepsis became the most probable diagnosis. The patient responded well to antibiotics and supplemental corticosteroid therapy. Subsequent investigation revealed sepsis-induced absence of cortisol based on previously unknown hypopituitarism. Following corticoid administration, rapid myocardial recovery occurred with successful ECMO weaning. The patient was discharged from the ICU after 13 days with a favorable neurological outcome.

This review delves into the critical role of T cells in the pathogenesis of KD, with a particular focus on how the expansion of CD8+ T cells and the imbalance between Th17 and Tregs contribute to IVIG resistance and persistent inflammation. Our analysis suggests that interventions targeting T cell function could potentially improve the clinical prognosis for KD patients.

However, the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke remains complex and poorly understood. Recent studies have revealed the infiltration of γδ T cells within ischemic stroke lesions, accompanied by the upregulation of IL-17, IL-23, and other inflammatory cytokines, suggesting their involvement in the stroke's pathological process. Literature indicates that γδ T cells are recruited to the lesion site by microglia-derived chemokines and subsequently infiltrate the damaged brain tissue. This review summarizes current knowledge on the precise mechanisms underlying γδ T cell activation, migration, and ensuing immune-inflammatory responses in neuroinflammation, as well as their role in the progression of ischemic stroke. It further discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting γδ T cells to modulate neuroinflammation for ischemic stroke treatment, thereby offering novel therapeutic targets for managing neuroinflammation in this condition.",

This was a post-hoc analysis of the BASEL-PMI study (NCT02573532). The study included patients from one tertiary care centre who underwent primary total hip (THA) or knee (TKA) arthroplasty, and revision THA and TKA. Patients were included if they had established cardiovascular comorbidities or were aged ≥ 65 years, and were eligible for our institutional PMI screening and response programme. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels were measured preoperatively and on postoperative days one and two. The primary endpoint was the incidence of PMI, and secondary endpoints included the rates of all-cause mortality and MACE at 120 days postoperatively. Between May 2014 and February 2018, 673 patients were included in the study, of whom 443 underwent primary THA or TKA, 111 underwent aseptic revision, and 119 underwent revision for PJI. PMI occurred in 120 patients (18%) overall, with higher rates in revisions (23; 21%) in the aseptic and 42 (35%) in the PJI groups) compared with 55 (12%) in the primary arthroplasty group. All-cause mortality was significantly increased in patients who underwent revision for PJI (9%) compared with aseptic revision (4%) and primary arthroplasty (2%). The rates of MACE were also increased in revisions, particularly in those for PJI (12%). Multivariable analysis showed an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 5.2) for PMI in revisions for PJI. Patients who underwent revision arthroplasty had significantly increased risks of PMI, MACE, and mortality compared with those who underwent primary arthroplasty.

However, the mechanisms underlying sEV-mediated myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are not well understood. In this study, it is discovered that the levels of miR-15a-5p and miR-96-5p in circulating sEVs (<sup>sEV</sup>miR-15a-5p/96-5p) are elevated in HCM patients with myocardial fibrosis. These sEVs enhance fibroblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro. Similar findings are observed in isopropanol (ISO)-induced myocardial fibrosis mouse model, where <sup>sEV</sup>miR-15a-5p/96-5p levels are elevated, predominantly originating from lung-derived sEVs. GW4869-mediated sEV suppression reduces pulmonary/cardiac <sup>sEV</sup>miR-15a-5p/96-5p levels, suggesting therapeutic potential. Importantly, the systemic trafficking of lung-derived sEVs is also mapped to cardiac tissue in vivo using a lung-specific lineage-tracing strategy using SFTPC (surfactant protein C) promoter-driven AAV9-CD63-GFP vectors. Administering lung-derived sEVs from ISO-treated mice into the myocardium increases cardiac fibroblast proliferation and scar formation. Furthermore, it is identified that miR-15a-5p and miR-96-5p directly target Smad7, reducing its expression, while SMAD7 overexpression reverses profibrotic effects. These findings indicate that lung-derived <sup>sEV</sup>miR-15a-5p/96-5p may exacerbate myocardial fibrosis by targeting Smad7 in cardiac fibroblasts. Thus, lung-derived sEV miR-15a-5p and miR-96-5p can serve as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for managing HCM-related myocardial fibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal dilation of the abdominal aorta, typically due to chronic arterial wall degeneration. Aorto-caval fistula (ACF) is a rare but serious complication of AAA, occurring in less than 1% of cases overall, with incidence increasing in the setting of rupture. ACF involves the formation of an abnormal communication between the abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava (IVC), resulting in blood shunting from the arterial to the venous system. This can cause reduced organ perfusion, high-output cardiac failure, and multiorgan dysfunction. We present the case of a 65-year-old hypertensive male with a known AAA who presented with 2 days of abdominal pain but no systemic or gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination revealed periumbilical tenderness, while laboratory results were normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large (10 cm) infrarenal AAA with evidence of rupture, mural thrombus, and a fistulous connection to the IVC. The patient underwent successful endovascular repair with complete resolution of the aneurysm and fistula, as shown in follow-up imaging. This case highlights the importance of high clinical suspicion and the role of early imaging in diagnosing ACFs, even in the absence of classical signs or lab abnormalities. The aim is to raise awareness of such atypical presentations and emphasize our case's uniqueness in its silent, stable, yet severe presentation.",

The presence of significant LMCA calcification was confirmed through coronary imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Pre-angioplasty imaging was conducted to assess lesion severity, grade the extent of LMCA calcification, and determine the appropriate calcium modification modality for each patient. Post-stenting imaging was performed to evaluate stent expansion, edge dissection, and wall apposition. A total of 120 patients participated, with a mean age of 6634 years, and shared similar clinical profiles. In-hospital, 5.7% (4 patients) in the WCB group experienced stent thrombosis or required repeat PCI, whereas no such events were reported in the RA or IVL groups. At the 3-year follow-up, the rate of repeat PCI varied significantly across the three groups: WCB (24.3%), RA (6.6%) and IVL (20%). Similarly, the incidence of in-stent restenosis differed: WCB (20%), RA (6.7%) and IVL (25%) respectively. The rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) - including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) - also varied significantly, with the highest proportion observed in the IVL group (55%) compared to WCB and RA (42.9% and 30%, respectively). In-hospital mortality was zero for all groups, but by the end of the study, total mortality was highest in the IVL group (10.0%), compared to WCB (5.7%) and RA (6.7%). The success rate was marginally higher for both WCB and RA at 3 years compared to IVL but not statistically significant. The IVL group experienced higher rates of MACE and mortality, while the WCB group had the highest rates of stent thrombosis, in-stent restenosis and target vessel revascularisation. Though outcomes for various study endpoints were marginally different for various calcium modification tools, the overall performance regarding the incidence of MACE and mortality, procedural success and secondary outcomes were comparable for all the tools (WCB, RA and IVL) in both the short-term and long-term follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Varicose veins are a common condition affecting millions of people worldwide. While they are often considered primarily a cosmetic issue, varicose veins can also lead to pain, swelling, and discomfort. Histopathological studies are valuable for examining the structure and composition of varicose veins. These studies provide important insights into the underlying causes of the condition and help inform treatment options for patients. To evaluate the distribution of collagen and elastin in the venous walls using Masson's Trichrome and Verhoeff's Van Gieson staining. This study examines histological changes in varicose veins, focusing on the distribution of collagen and elastin through Masson's Trichrome and Verhoeff's Van Gieson staining methods. This study examined histological samples of varicose veins from 30 individuals. The tissue samples were fixed in formalin and stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin, Masson's Trichrome, and Verhoeff's Van Gieson stains, followed by analysis using light microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS version 23.0. Histological evaluation revealed significant changes in the tunica media, including a loss of smooth muscle (86.67%) and increased collagen deposition (76.67%). The intima exhibited prevalent intimal thickening (96.67%) and fibrosis (93.33%), while the adventitia showed notable adventitial fibrosis (86.67%) and vascular remodeling (53.33%). Elastic fiber impairment was observed in 13.33% of individuals, with collagen as the main structural component in all venous layers. Histopathological studies offer valuable insights into the structural changes that occur in varicose veins through the use of special stains. These studies play a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of varicose veins by providing detailed information about tissue structure and pathology. This information helps healthcare providers deliver personalized care to patients affected by this condition. Continued research in this field will further enhance our understanding of varicose veins and improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Drug-eluting stent (DES) angioplasty is the gold standard treatment for coronary lesions. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) is an option for in-stent restenosis, and has also shown promise for small-calibre coronary artery disease. We evaluated the 3-year effectiveness of a decision algorithm for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) that favoured a stent-less strategy (SLS) in primary angioplasty. All patients who underwent angioplasty during 1 year were included in a prospective observational study. Patients eligible for SLS first underwent scoring balloon followed by DCB angioplasty or DES in case of mandatory bailout. Patients not eligible for SLS were unstable patients who underwent conventional drug-eluting stenting. The metal index, stent burden, was calculated by stent length divided by the total lesion length. A 36-month follow-up recorded target lesion revascularization (TLR). Patients eligible for SLS represented 85% (n = 840) of patients who underwent PCI. TLR was required in 2.6% and 6% of patients in the DCB-only and bailout-DES groups, respectively. Median metal index was 0.25 (IQR: 0.5) in patients with TLR. There was a difference between TLR-free survival distributions in the DCB-only and bailout-DES groups (p = 0.016). The SLS based on a combination of scoring balloon and DCB was effective at 3 years with a low rate of TLR. This rate was higher in patients with stent burden. This study was registered with clinicaltrials. gov (NCT03893396, first posted on March 28, 2019).",

        "abstract": "As the epidemiology of infective endocarditis (IE) evolves, updated antimicrobial management assessments are needed. This study aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics, causative microorganisms, and antibiotic susceptibility of patients with healthcare-associated (HAIE) and community-acquired infective endocarditis (CAIE), as well as identify risk factors for 28-day mortality. The findings are intended to guide the treatment of both HAIE and CAIE. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 131 IE patients treated at Kocaeli University Hospital from December 2016 to December 2022. Data were extracted from hospital records and patients were classified into HAIE and CAIE groups. Comparative analyses were performed between the groups, and risk factors for 28-day mortality in IE patients were determined. Among the 131 patients, 51.9% had CAIE and 48.1% had HAIE. Predisposing factors were present in 85.5% of cases, with degenerative heart valves most common in CAIE (30.9%) and hemodialysis (HD) in HAIE (60%). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was more common as a comorbidity in HAIE than in CAIE (65.1% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.001). Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), troponin, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) at admission correlated with increased 28-day mortality. Blood culture positivity was greater in HAIE (75%), with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) as the leading pathogen (38%). Mitral valve involvement was most common overall (38.9%), with aortic and mitral valve involvement higher in CAIE (p = 0.047 and p = 0.039, respectively). Complications such as valve insufficiency (64.1%), neurological events (33.6%), heart failure (27.5%), brain embolism (22.9%), and arrhythmia (8.4%) were associated with 28-day mortality, which was 11.5% across all IE patients. The incidence of HAIE is increasing, particularly in non-nosocomial cases, with HD emerging as a significant risk factor. This highlights the need for tailored empirical treatment strategies based on patient risk profiles. In our study, the high rate of CoNS as a causative agent is noteworthy. Although all cases met diagnostic criteria, the predominance of CoNS may have been influenced by local clinical practices. Therefore, local microbiological data should be taken into account when planning treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) contributed to around 8.9 million deaths and stroke accounting for about 6.2 million deaths each year. This study examines disparities in health services and outcomes for IHD and stroke among different membership types within the national health insurance. We analyzed over 30,000 inpatient claim data for IHD and stroke patients from 2017 to 2022 in Indonesia. The associations were assessed between National Health Insurance (Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial, BPJS) membership types and five dependent variables including treatment/diagnosis, severity, mortality, length of stay, and claim cost. Membership types included the poorest members subsidized by the national budget (Penerima Bantuan Iuran Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara, PBI APBN); near poor, subsidized by local governments (Penerima Bantuan Iuran Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah, PBI APBD); informal non-workers (Bukan Pekerja, BP), informal workers (Pekerja Bukan Penerima Upah, PBPU), and formal workers (Pekerja Penerima Upah, PPU). For treatment access, PBI APBN members with IHD had lower odds of receiving percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) compared to other groups, though this difference was not statistically significant in the multivariate models. For stroke patients, access to head computed tomography (CT) scans-critical for diagnosing stroke type-was similar across all membership types. Length of stay varied by condition; PBI APBN members experienced longer hospital stays for IHD but shorter stays for stroke. However, claim costs were significantly higher for non-subsidized groups (BP, PBPU, PPU) compared to the PBI APBN group for both IHD and stroke patients. Regarding health outcomes, non-subsidized IHD patients (BP, PBPU, PPU) had significantly lower odds of severe cases with adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of 0.70, 0.76, and 0.66, respectively, and mortality (AORs of 0.61 and 0.64 for BP and PPU) compared to the subsidized PBI APBN group. For stroke patients, although severity levels were comparable across membership types, non-subsidized patients (BP, PBPU, and PPU) had significantly lower odds of mortality, with AORs of 0.66, 0.73, and 0.54, respectively. Non-subsidized members had lower severity and mortality for IHD and stroke but higher treatment costs, while the poorest (PBI APBN) faced longer stays and worse outcomes-highlighting persistent disparities in Indonesia's national health insurance system. Addressing these inequities requires targeted policies to improve access, care efficiency, and quality for the poorest populations. Strengthening community-based lifestyle promotion and tobacco control can further reduce the burden of IHD and stroke and help close these gaps over time.",

        "abstract": "Multiple factors, including hypertension, affect left ventricular remodeling in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, this retrospective study used left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), an excellent method for detecting mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, to compare left ventricular systolic function in HD patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (HLVH). Participants were aged 60 years or older and had an LVEF of 60% or higher. We compared 20 HD patients (HD group) with 20 HLVH patients matched for age and sex (HLVH group) and 20 healthy control individuals (C group). GLS decline was defined as a GLS value greater than the GLS reference value, which was the mean value of + 2×standard deviation in the C group. LVEF was not significantly different between the 3 groups, but GLS was significantly worse in the HD group (-15.8%±1.4%) than in the C group (-19.3%±1.1%, p < 0.01) and HLVH group (-17.0%±1.4%, p < 0.05). Relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were significantly higher in the HLVH and HD groups than in the C group (p < 0.01), and hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly lower in the HD group than in the C and HLVH groups (p < 0.01). The frequency of GLS decline (i.e., GLS > -17.0%) was significantly higher in the HD group than in the HLVH group (p < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis of the 3 groups showed that increased RWT and LVMI and decreased Hb were significantly associated with GLS decline (p < 0.01). HD patients with preserved LVEF have a significantly greater decline in GLS than HLVH patients. Increased RWT and LVMI with renal anemia may contribute to GLS decline in HD patients with LVEF. 2023-01-02.",

In recent years, the incidence rate of KD has increased year by year worldwide, so it is particularly important to strengthen the diagnosis of KD and identify CAL early. This retrospective cohort study included a total of 436 children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and aimed to develop a predictive model for CAL using early clinical symptoms and laboratory features. To reduce potential confounding, propensity score matching (PSM) was applied, and both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of CAL. Subsequently, through machine learning, a predictive column chart model was constructed using clinical features and routine laboratory blood indicators, and the model was evaluated using ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA curves. This study found that gender, medical history, cough, diarrhea symptoms, and high CRP levels were independent risk factors for concurrent CAL. To further predict CAL risk, a column chart model was constructed based on LASSO regression and ten fold cross validation. The ROC curve in the training queue showed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.879), while the ROC curve in the validation queue showed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.859). This model exhibits good discriminative ability, high accuracy, and potential clinical benefits in both training and validation sets. Through this study, we provide clinicians with a new tool to more accurately predict and manage CAL risk in children with KD, which can help optimize treatment strategies and improve efficacy.",

Houttuynia cordata (HC) has antibacterial, antiviral, analgesic, antioxidant, diuretic, hypoglycemic, and immune-enhancing properties. To study the inhibitory effect of HC on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from tissue or pus specimens from patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Seventy-two patients with DFU were randomly divided into three groups and given treatment with methicillin (Met), meropenem (Mer), and HC, respectively. Analysis and identification of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the Orbitrap Exploris™ 480. The drug susceptibility of four isolates to HC was studied by bacteriostatic test. The MIC and MBC of Houttuynia cordata against four isolates were determined using the broth microdilution method. The growth and time-kill curves of the bacteria were studied by bacterial inhibition experiments.The effect of Houttuynia cordata on the viability of H6C7 cells was examined by MTT assay. HC treatment improved clinical parameters of DFUs patients. The inhibition zone of S08 (MSSA) was 15.45 ± 0.12 mm, which was highly sensitive to Houttuynia cordata. The inhibition zone sizes of R11 (MRSA), P10 (CRPA) and D22 (MDRPA) were 12.64 ± 0.09 mm,13.42 ± 0.11 mm and 11.23 ± 0.08 mm, respectively. All of them were moderately sensitive to Houttuynia cordata. The MIC of S08,R11,P10 and D22 were 31.25,62.5,62.5 and 125 µg/mL, respectively. The MBCS of S08,R11,P10 and D22 were 500,1000,1000 and 1000 µg/mLrespectively.Bacterial growth curves and time-kill curves demonstrated that Houttuynia cordata significantly inhibited the growth of both bacteria. Cytotoxicity assay showed that Houttuynia cordata effectively inhibited bacteria without cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells. Houttuynia cordata exhibits promising antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including drug-resistant strains, without cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic cells. These findings support its potential as an alternative therapeutic agent for DFU-associated infections.",

        "title": "Aortic valve stenosis and osteoporosis: insights from a mouse model.",
        "abstract": "Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most common heart valve disease requiring intervention. Osteoporosis, affecting ~ 10% of those over 50, is linked to aortic valve calcification and increased AVS risk. However, its direct role in AVS development or progression remains unclear. Using a mouse model, we examined whether estrogen-deficiency-induced osteoporosis modifies early hemodynamic and histological remodeling of the aortic valve after mechanical injury, and whether zoledronic acid (ZA) treatment alters these processes. Osteoporosis was induced in mice via bilateral ovariectomy (OVX), with sham-operated controls. To prevent bone loss, ZA or vehicle were administered weekly via intraperitoneal injection. Two weeks post-OVX, AVS was induced by mechanically injuring the aortic valve under echocardiographic guidance, with control procedures (CTR) in separate groups. After model validation, C57BL/6J mice were assigned to six groups: WI Sham Vehicle, WI OVX Vehicle, WI OVX ZA, WI Sham ZA, CTR OVX Vehicle, and CTR OVX ZA. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-injury. Bone density was assessed via micro-CT and histology, with peak aortic velocity as the primary endpoint. Mice were euthanized at 8 weeks for tissue analysis. OVX induced a significant reduction in trabecular bone mineral density (TBM, 50.6%, p = 0.0025). Treatment with ZA effectively reversed bone resorption in OVX mice (p < 0.0001) and even enhanced trabecular structures compared to sham-operated animals (increase of TBM by 130%, p < 0.0001). Mechanical injury to the aortic valve successfully induced AVS, as evidenced by increased peak velocity (1294 vs. 2157 mm/s, p < 0.0001) and mean pressure gradient 2 weeks post-procedure (1.58 vs. 4.19 mmHg, p < 0.0001). However, neither OVX nor ZA treatment influenced the severity of AVS. Histological analyses confirmed aortic valve thickening following injury. Picrosirius red and CD68 staining revealed no differences in collagen content or immune cell infiltration of the aortic valve between osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic animals. OVX-induced osteoporosis did not affect AVS severity after mechanical injury in our study. This suggests osteoporosis may not directly influence AVS in the early, pre-calcific stage that was studied in this model. However, to overcome limitations of the study, further studies with longer durations or refined models are needed to confirm these findings.",

        "title": "Transcatheter removal of a briefly penetrated inferior vena cava filter in an open abdomen: a case report.",
        "abstract": "The likelihood of inferior vena cava filter penetration increases with prolonged implantation. Despite the generally low risk associated with an ALN inferior vena cava filter (ALN IMPLANTS CHIRURGICAUX, Ghisonaccia, France), we present a case in which penetration occurred 43 days after implantation. At present, no consensus is available on the standardized approach for filter removal in such cases. In this report, we describe a secure and reliable method involving surgical access to the abdomen and transcatheter filter removal while directly observing the inferior vena cava. A 72-year-old Japanese male patient presented to our institution with complaints of pain and subsequent edema in his left lower limb. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombi spanning from the left common iliac vein to the external iliac vein, as well as in the right pulmonary artery and inferior vena cava. Upon admission, we promptly inserted an ALN inferior vena cava filter and initiated anticoagulation therapy. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT performed on day 13 after filter implantation demonstrated disappearance of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and inferior vena cava, and the patient was discharged on day 14 following implantation. However, due to the presence of a residual thrombus in the left common iliac vein, we decided against removing the inferior vena cava filter at that time. Contrast-enhanced CT performed on day 43 after implantation revealed signs suggestive of filter penetration with extension into the abdominal aorta, necessitating immediate filter removal. To address this, we performed transcatheter removal of the filter through open abdominal surgery. An ALN inferior vena cava filter, initially considered to pose a low risk of penetration, unexpectedly exhibited penetration during the brief indwelling period. Although a definitive consensus concerning the optimal removal approach for such cases remains elusive, our experience indicates that transcatheter removal via laparotomy represents a secure and reliable method.",

        "abstract": "The objective is to determine whether the tidal volume of mechanically ventilated patients following surgery for cerebral hemorrhage can serve as a reliable reference value for predicting patient outcomes. Patients who underwent surgery for cerebral hemorrhage and were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit (NSICU) at Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College, from April 2019 to June 2021 were prospectively included in this study. Each patient was continuously ventilated for 72 h using the Servo-i ventilator (Getinge Group, Gothenburg, Sweden). General data, including sex, age, APACHE II score, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and respiratory mechanics parameters such as tidal volume (VT), peak pressure (Peak), and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), were collected. Ninety postoperative patients with cerebral hemorrhage who received neurologically assisted ventilation were included and divided into two groups based on their Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores: the good prognosis group (GOS ≥ 4) and the poor prognosis group (GOS ≤ 3). Their ventilatory parameters were monitored throughout the study. The age of patients with poor prognosis was higher than that of patients with good prognosis. Additionally, the APACHE II score for patients with poor prognosis was significantly elevated compared to those with good prognosis, with a p-value of less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance. However, there were no significant differences in minute volume (MV), mean airway pressure (Pmean), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), peak pressure (Ppeak), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) between the two groups. Notably, the tidal volume of patients with poor prognosis was lower than that of patients with good prognosis, also with a p-value of less than 0.05, indicating statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the aforementioned quantitative data revealed significant differences in APACHE II score, heart rate, and tidal volume between the good prognosis group and the poor prognosis group, all with a p-value of less than 0.05. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis of these indicators confirmed that the difference in tidal volume was statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.05. There is a significant correlation between self-triggered tidal volume in neuromodulation-assisted ventilation and the prognosis of patients following intracerebral hemorrhage. The tidal volume of patients who receive neurologically assisted ventilation after cerebral hemorrhage surgery can serve as a reference for predicting outcomes in intensive care.",

        "abstract": "PPCS deficiency disorder (PPCS DD) is an ultra-rare, autosomal recessive form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) caused by pathogenic variants in PPCS, which encodes the enzyme catalyzing the second step in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway. To date, only six patients worldwide have been identified. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify pathogenic PPCS variants in affected individuals. Protein stability was assessed by Western blotting. CoA levels were quantified using a microplate-based assay in patient-derived fibroblasts, cardiac progenitor cells, and cardiomyocytes. Functional evaluation of cardiac cells and engineered heart patches was conducted to investigate contractile performance and arrhythmogenicity. Pantethine was tested as a potential therapeutic agent both in vitro and through long-term clinical follow-up in patients. Causative PPCS variants are identified in six individuals with DCM and variable associated features, including neuromuscular and neurological symptoms. Identified variants lead to reduced PPCS protein stability and decreased cellular CoA levels. Cardiac cells exhibit impaired contractility and arrhythmias, which are partially rescued by pantethine treatment. Clinically, patients receiving pantethine show sustained improvement over time. Our study expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of PPCS deficiency disorder, identifying six new cases with diverse phenotypes. Functional investigations reveal reduced CoA levels and dysfunction in patient-derived cardiac cells. Pantethine treatment shows promise in partially rescuing DCM phenotypes, both in vitro and in patients. However, complete reversal may require early intervention. These findings underscore the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment in PPCS DD. Future research should focus on optimizing pantethine supplementation and exploring additional therapies to enhance CoA levels and cardiac function in affected individuals.",

        "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), and effective lipid-lowering therapies are critical for reducing ASCVD risk. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the latest advancements in lipid-lowering therapies, focusing on emerging therapeutic targets and innovative biotechnological approaches that have shown promise in clinical research. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in lipid-lowering therapies beyond traditional statins and ezetimibe. Novel therapeutic targets, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, angiopoietin-like 3 protein inhibitors, APOC3 inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids, have demonstrated potent lipid-lowering efficacy. Additionally, advancements in biotechnology have led to the development of innovative agents, including monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering RNA, and cholesterol vaccines, all of which have shown encouraging results in clinical trials. These therapies offer new mechanisms of action and improved efficacy in managing dyslipidemia and reducing ASCVD risk. This article comprehensively reviews the latest clinical research on emerging lipid-lowering targets and cutting-edge therapies, emphasizing their mechanisms, efficacy, and potential impact on dyslipidemia and ASCVD management.

        "abstract": "Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common condition in pediatric age. Since there are significant genetic commonalities among idiopathic cases, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA), and Behçet's disease (BD), they were proposed to be considered in one clinical spectrum termed Behçet's Spectrum Disorders (BSDs). This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of colchicine on oral ulcers in children with BSD related RAS (BSD-RAS). Secondary aim was to compare the disease groups in terms of clinical and laboratory benefits. Data at admission and one year-after the treatment initiation were compared. A total of 317 patients with RAS were evaluated, and 186 patients classified as BSD-RAS (Female: n = 105, 56%). The median age at symptom onset was 5 (0.5-16.5) years. Colchicine was started to 142 (76%) patients. We observed a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of oral ulcers, as well as in the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores reported by patients/families and physicians, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate during symptom-free periods across all three groups. In patients with PFAPA, both difference between initial and final recorded values (Δ) patient/families and Δ physician VAS scores were significantly higher than in other groups (p < 0.001). Furthermore, both Δ duration (p = 0.005) and Δ frequency of oral aphthae (p = 0.012) were significantly higher in idiopathic cases than those with PFAPA. These findings demonstrate a substantial reduction in both clinical symptoms and laboratory markers following colchicine treatment, supporting its effectiveness as a therapeutic option for BSD-RAS. •Recurrent aphthous stomatitis, PFAPA, and Behçet's disease may manifest with similar oral ulcers in pediatric patients. •Colchicine is frequently used in this clinical spectrum known as Behçet's Spectrum Disorders, although there is a scarcity of pediatric data. •Colchicine treatment significantly improved clinical and laboratory outcomes across all groups. •Idiopathic group had greater reductions in oral ulcer frequency and duration while PFAPA associated cases showed highest improvement in visual analogue scale scores.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a frequent complication in dogs with heartworm disease caused by Dirofilaria immitis. Although echocardiography remains the main diagnostic tool, its operator- and preload-dependence may limit accuracy. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a cardiac biomarker that increases in response to ventricular wall stress and may be useful for monitoring right-sided heart disease. This study aimed to evaluate NT-proBNP concentrations in dogs with precapillary PH due to heartworm disease during adulticide treatment. In total, 90 dogs diagnosed with heartworm disease were prospectively enrolled and classified according to the presence of PH based on echocardiographic criteria. NT-proBNP concentrations were measured on days 0, 30, 60, and 90 of adulticide treatment. Additional data collected included the presence/absence of microfilariae, clinical signs, parasite burden, and renal values. Dogs received adulticidal therapy following current international guidelines. Statistical analyses assessed correlations between NT-proBNP levels, epidemiological, clinical and echocardiographic classification, and treatment progression. Dogs with PH had significantly higher NT-proBNP concentrations at baseline compared with those without PH (2038 ± 1671 versus 583 ± 185 pmol/L, P < 0.001). NT-proBNP levels were also positively correlated with parasite burden (r = 0.530, P < 0.05), presence of clinical signs (r = 0.456, P < 0.05), and age (r = 0.29, P < 0.05). During treatment, a progressive decrease in NT-proBNP concentrations was observed in dogs with PH, while levels remained stable in dogs without PH. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a cut-off of 1524.8 pmol/L for detecting moderate-to-severe PH (sensitivity: 99%, specificity: 87%). NT-proBNP is a valuable noninvasive biomarker for detecting and monitoring PH in dogs with heartworm disease. Its concentrations seem to reflect parasite burden, clinical status, and echocardiographic severity, and decline progressively with adulticide therapy. Integration of NT-proBNP into diagnostic and therapeutic protocols may enhance management of heartworm-infected dogs with suspected PH.",

Here we describe the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment and outcomes in patients, over the age of 16 years, with kidney biopsy proven cases seen in two regions of Aotearoa, New Zealand over an 18-year period. Potential cases were identified, in patients over the age of 16 years, who underwent kidney biopsy between 2003 and 2020. A retrospective review of all potential cases was performed. Thirty-four patients were identified, 10 females and 24 males, of whom 15 were European, 5 Māori, 7 Pacific Peoples, and 7 Asians. The incidence was 1.16 per 1,000,000 patient-years (95% CI: 0.82-1.61), there was an excess in males (RR = 2.42 95% CI 1.16-5.06, p = 0.016) with no excess by ethnicity. Mean age at presentation was 42.8 years (range 16.4-70.5). Mean creatinine at presentation was 118µmol/L (range 51-410). Twenty-six patents received corticosteroids, with two patients also receiving cyclophosphamide and five patients receiving azathioprine. Six patients (17.6%) needed long-term kidney replacement therapy, 12 were left with significant chronic kidney disease (35.3%) and 4 died (11.8%) at the end of study follow up. Elevated serum creatinine at presentation was predictive of need for kidney replacement therapy. Age was predictive of mortality.

However, incomplete reperfusion is common and leads to poorer patient outcomes. Intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) is a potential rescue therapy, but its efficacy and safety remain controversial. A comprehensive literature search was performed across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to January 2025. The search included terms related to stroke, thrombectomy, thrombolysis, and intra-arterial. Studies comparing IAT as rescue therapy following MT with MT alone in patients with incomplete reperfusion were included. The primary outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0-2 at 90 days). Pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. This meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251063825). Seven studies, totaling 1893 patients (374 in MT + IAT; 1519 in MT alone) were included. Pooled analysis indicated that IAT as a rescue therapy was associated with significantly higher odds of functional dependence at 90 days (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.83; p = 0.017) and lower 90-day mortality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.98; p = 0.036).

        "title": "A pilot study on the hemodynamic effects of negative pressure ventilation in patients after cardiac surgery focussing on right ventricular function.",
        "abstract": "Right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure are important complications in cardiac surgical patients and typically observed after complex surgical cases. Treatment options for optimizing the hemodynamic status in patients presenting with these complications are limited. Negative pressure ventilation has been shown to ameliorate the effects of conventional positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and to improve cardiac output in patients with Fontan circulation and patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. No data are available on the effects of negative pressure ventilation on systemic hemodynamics and right heart function after complex on-pump cardiac surgery. Hypothesis of the present study is that right ventricular function improves under condition of negative pressure ventilation after complex on-pump surgery. Thirty patients after complex cardiac surgery were examined using basic hemodynamic monitoring, transesophageal ultrasound, a 3rd generation pulmonary artery catheter, cerebral oximetry and arterial and venous blood gases. The first 15 patients were ventilated for 15 min using standard PPV followed by 15 min of extrathoracal continuous negative pressure ventilation (CNPV) combined with PPV, and 15 min of extrathoracal biphasic negative pressure ventilation (BCV, biphasic cuirass ventilation) combined with an as far as possible reduced PPV. In the second 15 patients, the sequence of negative pressure ventilation was changed and BCV was performed before CNPV. Finally, every patient was ventilated for 15 min with standard PPV again. A full dataset of hemodynamics and a respiratory dataset was collected during each observation period. CNPV und BCV reduced central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure by 2 mmHg. During BCV cardiac index increased by + 24% (+ 0.5 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI 0.2-0.8, p = 0.001) through an increase of stroke volume index by + 24% (p = 0.0003) without change of heart rate. This was accompanied by an increase of right ventricular ejection fraction (+ 18%, p = 0.008), pulmonary arterial pulsatility index (+ 30%, p = 0.0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (+ 15%, p = 0.01), and oxygen delivery DO<sub>2</sub> (+ 13%, p = 0.0006). Posthoc analysis in patients with reduced stroke volume index (< 27 ml/m<sup>2</sup> prior to the start of the study) revealed that mixed venous oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen saturation increased by 7% (p = 0.005/p = 0.006). No adverse effects were observed. While CNPV has only moderate hemodynamic effects by reducing cardiac filling pressure, BCV improves systemic and right ventricular hemodynamics as well as global oxygen balance in patients after complex cardiac surgery. During both negative pressure ventilation modes, no immediate adverse events could be observed. These findings justify investigations if these treatment modalities may impact clinical outcomes in patients with right ventricular dysfunction or failure.Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT06088966, registered October 3rd, 2023.",

        "abstract": "Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are first- and next-generation Bruton Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi), respectively, approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib has been associated with cardiovascular events, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension. Acalabrutinib has demonstrated non-inferior progression-free survival than ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory CLL patients, with a lower cardiovascular event incidence. These adverse events seem to be derived from off-targets rather than BTK inhibition. Machine learning algorithms were applied to identify targets likely to trigger AF and hypertension in simulated CLL patients receiving acalabrutinib or ibrutinib. Common ibrutinib and acalabrutinib off-targets showed association with AF through structural remodeling and electrophysiology/ectopic activity mechanisms (TEC and ERBB4). There was association with hypertension through inflammation (ERBB4) and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction (ERBB4 and RIPK2). Ibrutinib-specific off-targets showed association with AF through structural remodeling (HCK, FGR, LYN, FYN, YES1, and FLT3) and electrophysiology activity (LYN and SRC), and with hypertension through inflammation (LCK, JAK3, and FLT3) and oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction (ERBB2, BLK, SRC, and CSK). No acalabrutinib-specific off-targets were identified for AF or hypertension. This study supports that BTKi off-target selectivity may justify the different AF and hypertension incidences, suggesting their association with several ibrutinib-specific off-targets and identifying no acalabrutinib-specific ones.",

This was a proof-of-concept, phase II, parallel, open label clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of maraviroc (300 mg, bid), CCR5 antagonist, combined with standard of care (SoC) treatment compared to SoC alone during 14 days, in hospitalized people with mild COVID-19 with pneumonia and ambient air oxygen saturation >94 %. Demographical, clinical, and analytical data were assayed at day 0, 7, 14 and 28. Thirty-three participants were included, 17 in the control and 16 in the maraviroc group. The proportion of participants who experienced COVID-19 progression was 2.8 times higher in the control group than in the maraviroc group, with three participants admitted in intensive care unit versus none in the maraviroc group. The only variable associated with the time to severe COVID-19 progression was maraviroc treatment. The median time on oxygen therapy was 11 days in the control group, while the two participants in the maraviroc group had oxygen therapy for one and four days. Grade 3-4 events were only present in the control group. Maraviroc treatment was associated with a better neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6 and TNF-α levels at day 7.

        "abstract": "Predicting shorter life expectancy is crucial for prioritizing antifibrotic therapy in fibrotic lung diseases, where progression varies widely, from stability to rapid deterioration. This heterogeneity complicates treatment decisions, emphasizing the need for reliable baseline measures. This study focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence model to address heterogeneity in disease outcomes, focusing on mortality as the ultimate measure of disease trajectory. This retrospective study included 1744 anonymised patients who underwent high-resolution CT scanning. The AI model, SABRE (Smart Airway Biomarker Recognition Engine), was developed using data from patients with various lung diseases (n=460, including lung cancer, pneumonia, emphysema, and fibrosis). Then, 1284 high-resolution CT scans with evidence of diffuse FLD from the Australian IPF Registry and OSIC were used for clinical analyses. Airway branches were categorized and quantified by anatomic structures and volumes, followed by multivariable analysis to explore the associations between these categories and patients' progression and mortality, adjusting for disease severity or traditional measurements. Cox regression identified SABRE-based variables as independent predictors of mortality and progression, even adjusting for disease severity (fibrosis extent, traction bronchiectasis extent, and ILD extent), traditional measures (FVC%, DLCO%, and CPI), and previously reported deep learning algorithms for fibrosis quantification and morphological analysis. Combining SABRE with DLCO significantly improved prognosis utility, yielding an AUC of 0.852 at the first year and a C-index of 0.752. SABRE-based variables capture prognostic signals beyond that provided by traditional measurements, disease severity scores, and established AI-based methods, reflecting the progressiveness and pathogenesis of the disease.",

This study aims to determine whether a programme of personalised cardiac rehabilitation achieves better completion rates compared with a routine outpatient rehabilitation model post-type 1 MI. A secondary aim is to determine any differences in rates of major adverse cardiovascular events at 12 months. Secondary prevention for all in need (SPAN) is a prospective multisite single-blind comparative effectiveness randomised trial of personalised versus standard outpatient rehabilitation. Five hundred and thirty-two patients with a recent type 1 MI diagnosis will be randomised to either a personalised model of rehabilitation which includes flexibility in the components of rehabilitation and the time and location of contacts, or the standard outpatient model. Exclusion criteria include conditions associated with higher clinical risk to the participant, which introduce confounding to the study or interfere with a participant's ability to comply.The primary study endpoint is the proportion of patients who complete the assigned rehabilitation model. Completion of rehabilitation is defined as participation in ≥80% of all scheduled sessions, in either treatment arm. Assuming a power of 90% and an overall type 1 error of 5%, we expect that 50% of those randomised to usual care will meet the primary endpoint compared with 65% of those on personalised rehabilitation. To detect this difference of 15%, we require a sample size of 478 participants (239 per arm). Accounting for a conservative attrition rate of 10%, the total sample size required is 532.

The objective of this study was to complete a Delphi consensus study on these VGEI related issues. The Delphi methodology was used with a panel of 43 international experts (specialists in vascular or cardiovascular surgery, infectious diseases, nuclear medicine, and radiology). Four Delphi rounds were planned using an online questionnaire initially with 31 statements. Panellists rated the statements on a five point Likert scale. Comments on statements were analysed, statements were revised, added, or deleted, and the results were presented in iterative rounds. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% of the panel rating a statement as strongly agree or agree on the Likert scale, and consensus on the final assessment was defined as Cronbach's α > 0.80. Reporting was performed according to the ACcurate COnsensus Reporting Document (ACCORD) guideline. All 43 panellists fulfilled all four rounds, resulting in 100% participation. Cronbach's α increased through the rounds: round 1, 0.88; round 2, 0.89; round 3, 0.90; and round 4, 0.90.

        "abstract": "Post-translational modification through SUMOylation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, by modulating the interactions of target proteins and their cellular functionality. Our previous results indicated that chemerin stimulated monocyte adhesion by activating β2 integrin via its protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)-like activity. However, the downstream mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we observed a global increase in the SUMO2/3 conjugation of proteins in monocytes induced by chemerin via its receptor β2 integrin. To investigate the functional significance of SUMO2/3 in cellular activities, we examined the effects of the SUMOylation inhibitor ML-792 and observed that it effectively reversed chemerin-induced monocyte activation and adhesion. Moreover, our results demonstrated that chemerin enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a SUMOylation-dependent manner in monocytes. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed a direct interaction between HSP90AB1 and SUMO2/3, which is essential for chemerin-induced protein SUMOylation and subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that chemerin-induced protein SUMOylation via β2 integrin in monocytes promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation and monocyte activation and adhesion, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and identifying potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.",

Previous studies by our group had identified the p53/miR-200c-3p pathway as a key molecular mechanism in fluoride-triggered endothelial injury. This study aimed to investigate how fluoride induced vascular endothelial injury and to evaluate the protective role of Acy in counteracting these detrimental effects. We established both in vivo (fluoride exposed Wistar rats) and in vitro (ECs) models of fluoride toxicity, with Acy intervention. Fluoride exposure caused severe oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which were significantly mitigated by Acy treatment. Notably, Acy alleviated fluoride-induced pathological damage in the vascular endothelium. Mechanistically, Acy exerted its protective effects by suppressing the fluoride-activated p53/miR-200c-3p pathway. Fluoride exposure led to substantial cardiovascular injury, primarily through oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.

This study aimed to develop expert consensus on the management and follow-up of VGEI, with a focus on antimicrobial strategies. A modified Delphi method was conducted to reach consensus on key aspects of VGEI care, including antimicrobial treatment, surgical management, and follow-up. An expert panel representing infectious diseases, vascular and cardiothoracic surgery, microbiology, and nuclear medicine participated in four rounds of surveys. Ten general and 35 specific statements were rated using a five-point Likert scale. Statements with ≥75% agreement (agree/strongly agree) were considered to have achieved consensus. Internal consistency across rounds was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (>0.80). The panel agreed that empirical antimicrobial therapy should be initiated only in patients with complications (e.g., sepsis, bleeding) or when diagnostic intervention is delayed. Empirical therapy must be individualized based on graft location and risk factors. For abdominal VGEI without aorto-enteric fistula and unknown pathogens, initial coverage should target Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes, with consideration for MRSA/MRSE based on risk. For thoracic VGEI without fistula, Gram-positive coverage is prioritized, with optional MRSA coverage. Postoperative treatment duration should be individualized. In cases of complete graft removal and replacement with autologous veins, a 6-week antibiotic course is recommended, with early oral switch if bioavailable options are available. If prosthetic material remains, at least 4-6 weeks of intravenous therapy followed by oral treatment for a total of 12 weeks is advised. Prolonged therapy should be considered in cases with virulent pathogens, incomplete source control, or persistent inflammatory markers.

These findings imply that MAp44 could be a biomarker for disease conditions and a therapeutic target for reducing complement-mediated illness. Furthermore, recent findings reveal that MAp44 has a role in cancer genesis and progression. Its participation in tumor immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis has been revealed in studies, underlining its potential as a prognostic marker and a prospective target for cancer treatment. MAp44 targeting may boost immune surveillance, decrease tumor development, and improve patient outcomes in a variety of cancers. Recent research has revealed its participation in a variety of disease processes, indicating it as a possible contributor to disease etiology. The developing understanding of MAp44's role lays the groundwork for future study and development of targeted treatment approaches. Understanding the complicated processes behind its participation in autoimmune illnesses, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases opens up new possibilities for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy approaches.

        "abstract": "Limited research has investigated the influence of patient engagement on the long-term effects of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly among older adults. This study aimed to examine the long-term impact of a social media-driven mHealth intervention on blood pressure control among older Chinese individuals with hypertension, through repeated measurements of patient engagement and outcomes at 5 preset time points. The study included older Chinese individuals with hypertension between 2017 and 2022. Participants received a hypertension self-management program via the WeChat social media app (Tencent Holdings Ltd), which provided clinically based digital coaching. Blood pressure measurements were taken repeatedly using a home blood pressure monitor (HBPM) connected to the app at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patient engagement was evaluated based on the frequency of completed measurements at corresponding follow-ups. Latent growth curve models (LGCMs) served to assess the impact of patient engagement on blood pressure among older individuals with hypertension across preset points. A total of 1723 patients completed the 12-month follow-up (average age 70.1, SD 6.8 years; 890/1723, 51.7% female; and baseline systolic blood pressure 137.2 mm Hg). LGCMs revealed systolic blood pressure decreased significantly over 1 year, notably at 9 months (131 mm Hg, β9=3.244, P<.001), and continued up to 12 months (131.6mm Hg, β12=2.827, P<.001). In addition, a higher frequency of completed measurements was associated with better systolic blood pressure control at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (β3=-0.016, P=.002; β6=-0.006, P=.02; β9=-0.002, P=.44; β12=-0.003, P=.02). These results remained significant even after accounting for age, sex, and comorbidity status. This study, using LGCMs and repeated measures data, revealed a significant positive impact of patient engagement on long-term blood pressure control in mHealth interventions targeting older individuals with hypertension. These findings stress the importance of integration of patient-centered engagement approach into mHealth programs designed for chronic disease management in aging populations.",

        "abstract": "Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) stands as the predominant cause of brain injury with the incidence increasing with the decrease in birth weight and gestational age. In developed countries, a reduction in IVH incidence by implementing small baby neuroprotective protocols has been reported. The incidence of IVH within our setting is largely unexplored. This study aimed to fill this gap by determining the incidence and associated risk factors of IVH to guide in implementing a small baby neuroprotective protocol that could potentially reduce the incidence of IVH. A retrospective cohort study from January 2020 to December 2023 included all Preterm babies with gestation age < 32 weeks or birthweights of ≤1500g admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The primary outcome was the occurrence of IVH, while secondary outcomes were associated risk factors and short-term outcomes of IVH. A total of 526 babies were admitted to the NICU during the study period. Of these, 135 preterm infants were recruited, and 45 (33.3%) developed IVH, predominantly grade 1 IVH, which occurred predominantly between days 0-28 of life. Logistic regression analysis identified that exposure to antenatal steroids exhibited significantly lower odds of IVH occurrence (AOR 0.075, 95% CI 0.007-0.757). Resuscitation in the NICU had a 3 times higher risk of developing IVH (AOR 2.773, 95% CI 0.867-8.874). Treatment with normal saline bolus and inotropes had 4 times higher odds of IVH occurrence (OR 3.5, 95% CI: 1.043-11.885). A higher mortality rate was observed in preterms with IVH (26.6% vs 13.3%). Post-hemorrhagic ventricular dilation (22% vs 6.7%) and periventricular leukomalacia (20% vs 6.7%) were significantly higher among preterms with IVH. The findings elicited from this study lay a foundation for the implementation of neuroprotective protocols which may potentially reduce the magnitude of IVH in this highly vulnerable age group.",

        "abstract": "We sought to investigate the relationship between serum biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction, longitudinal strain on echocardiography, and all-cause mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis. This was an observational study using a biorepository of serum samples of patients with systemic sclerosis who underwent echocardiography. We investigated 3 biomarkers: periostin, galectin-3, and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide and applied a K-means clustering resulting in 3 patient clusters. We subsequently measured left ventricular and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain in each cluster. We then determined the association between each cluster and time to all-cause mortality compared to N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide, alone. The 125 patients with systemic sclerosis included in the study were divided into 3 clusters based on biomarker levels (Cluster 1: N = 75; Cluster 2: N = 39; Cluster 3: N = 11). Compared to Cluster 1, Cluster 2 had only elevated periostin levels whereas Cluster 3 had elevated levels of all 3 serum biomarkers and was characterized by reduced left ventricular and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain, regionally and globally. When adjusted for age, sex, systemic sclerosis disease duration, and forced vital capacity, patients in Cluster 3 had a HR of 14.42 (95% CI: 4.82, 43.18) for all-cause mortality compared to those in Cluster 1. In conclusion, combining N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide, periostin, and galectin-3 as serum biomarkers enhances risk stratification and sensitivity in detection of cardiac disease in patients with systemic sclerosis. However, before implementation in routine care, further prospective studies must refine biomarker sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy together with optimizing detection strategies and establishing clinical protocols for integration.",

        "abstract": "The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the immune response during cardiac arrest, as well as the role of the innate immune system-particularly neutrophils-in the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, remains underexplored. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the immune response in the pathology of post-cardiac arrest syndrome. This study included eight patients who experienced cardiogenic cardiopulmonary arrest and were treated for at least 1 week. Blood samples were collected immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation (day 0), as well as on days 1, 3, and 7. These patients formed the post-cardiac arrest syndrome group, and blood samples from five healthy volunteers served as controls. Neutrophil function over time was analyzed using CyTOF® mass cytometry. Furthermore, patients in the post-cardiac arrest syndrome group were divided into extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation groups according to whether they received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during resuscitation. Cytokine levels were compared between the two groups using LUMINEX®. Three patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Compared with the control group, the post-cardiac arrest syndrome group showed fewer CD177-negative neutrophils and fewer strongly leukotriene B4 receptor 1-positive neutrophils. The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group had more CD177-negative neutrophils and fewer CD16-seropositive neutrophils than the non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group. Differences in serum cytokine levels between the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation groups were noted, with certain cytokines, including interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, decreasing over time only in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group. As the first in-depth immunological investigation of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, including neutrophil phenotyping, this study may inform clinical practices related to patient management and treatment strategies following cardiac arrest.",

        "abstract": "It is essential to identify vascular anomalies of the thorax because of their potential association with congenital heart diseases and genetic abnormalities. Although some patients present with symptoms early in childhood, others remain asymptomatic until adulthood. However, certain anomalies can impact the prognosis significantly and necessitate tailored treatment strategies. Moreover, understanding the embryologic origins and anatomic variations of each vasculature is paramount because many of these anomalies arise from disruptions in the developmental process and can coexist simultaneously. The authors describe the embryology, anatomy, and specific imaging findings of each vascular anomaly in two primary systems: pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. Within the pulmonary circulation, conditions explored are unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery, aberrant pulmonary artery (pulmonary sling), partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, and anomalous unilateral single pulmonary vein. For systemic circulation, the anomalies reviewed are double aortic arch, aberrant right subclavian artery, right aortic arch, aberrant left subclavian artery, Kommerell diverticulum, patent ductus arteriosus, persistent left superior vena cava, and azygos continuation of the inferior vena cava. By thoroughly examining these conditions alongside their imaging findings and embryologic backgrounds, radiologists and clinicians can gain the expertise required for precise diagnosis and effective management in patients with thoracic vascular anomalies. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "abstract": "The climacteric period, particularly the postmenopausal phase, presents significant risks to women's cardiovascular and mental health due to hormonal changes. Effective interventions are needed to address these challenges and improve clinical outcomes. To evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular parameters (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, lipid profile, and triglycerides) and psychological outcomes (depression and anxiety) in postmenopausal women. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, four databases (PubMed, Embase, SportDiscus, and PsycINFO) were searched from inception to December 18, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing aerobic exercise interventions in postmenopausal women were included. Study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessments (using RoB 2) were performed by two independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. The review included 61 RCTs with 4,100 women (2,356 exercise and 1,744 control). Aerobic exercise reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.5 mm Hg (95% CI: -6.5 to -2.4) and diastolic blood pressure by 2.4 mm Hg (95% CI: -3.8 to -1.1). high-density lipoproteincholesterol increased by 2.4 mg/dL (95% CI: 1.0 to 3.8), while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by 3.6 mg/dL (95% CI: -6.1 to -1.1) and 7.7 mg/dL (95% CI: -11.9 to -3.5), respectively. No significant effect was found for total cholesterol. Aerobic exercise reduced anxiety scores by 0.2 SDs (95% CI: -0.3 to -0.03), but the effects on depression were not statistically significant. Aerobic exercise significantly improves cardiovascular health by reducing blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in postmenopausal women. Its positive effects on anxiety highlight its role in addressing mental health. These findings support aerobic exercise as a recommended intervention to mitigate health risks in this population and emphasize the need for further research on long-term, hard outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Williams syndrome is a rare congenital disorder affecting connective tissue and the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Pediatric patients diagnosed with Williams syndrome face significant risk for cardiac collapse and death when undergoing anesthesia. We sought to evaluate our institution's historical practices, evaluate individual risk stratification, and create detailed standardized perianesthesia guidelines for management of this population, particularly during noncardiac procedures. The study included a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with Williams syndrome who received anesthesia over a 10-year period at a single institution. A total of 23 patients underwent 46 procedures. At time of procedure, median age was 5.8 years (range, 0.4-17.6 yr), and the majority (n = 19) had a \"low\" Williams syndrome risk category and required anesthesia for noncardiac procedures. Most (61%) had no cardiac involvement beyond mild supravalvar or branch pulmonary artery stenosis. No intraprocedure adverse cardiac events were identified. One patient experienced an adverse cardiac event approximately 60 minutes postanesthesia emergence which included ST segment depression and development of refractory ventricular fibrillation, necessitating deployment of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This patient was eventually stabilized and was taken to the operating room 3 days later for definitive severe supravalvar aortic stenosis repair. Patients with Williams syndrome have a reported risk for sudden cardiac death that is 25 to 100 times greater than that of the age-matched general population. The incidence of adverse cardiac events in our cohort of patients with Williams syndrome undergoing anesthesia was lower compared with previous studies, which reported rates ranging from 4.2% to 11%. These findings support the idea that risk stratification and institutional practice guidelines can aid anesthesia providers in making informed decisions, and standardization of pre-, intra-, and postprocedural care according to existing guidelines may further reduce risks. Our review offers valuable insight into historical anesthesia management and contributes to a broader interdisciplinary understanding of care provision for this high-risk group.",

        "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has emerged as a common age-related phenomenon and a central concept linking somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells to both malignant and non-malignant diseases. While initially recognized in the context of hematologic neoplasms, CH is now known to contribute to increased all-cause mortality, particularly through heightened risk of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Frequent mutations in genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 alter epigenetic regulation and immune signaling, thereby promoting clonal expansion and systemic consequences. Longitudinal studies have illuminated the dynamics of clonal growth and revealed how germline variants influence somatic selection. VEXAS syndrome, driven by UBA1-mutated CH, exemplifies the broader clinical reach of clonal expansion beyond malignancy. CH occupies an intermediate biological state with far-reaching implications.

A total of 59,611 individuals accessed the survey, and eligible adults aged ≥ 18 years with a history of dyslipidemia and currently receiving statin treatment were included. Participants were categorized into primary (n = 110) or secondary (n = 415) prevention groups based on their history of coronary artery disease or cerebral infarction. In the secondary prevention group, out-of-pocket costs was the most significant attribute (relative importance, 64.2%), followed by injection frequency (18.4%), administration method (12.1%), and efficacy (5.2%). Consistent attribute rankings were observed across subgroups. In the primary prevention group, out-of-pocket costs remained the most critical attribute (66.7%), followed by injection frequency (19.5%), efficacy (7.0%), and administration method (6.8%). After educational intervention, out-of-pocket costs remained the most important attribute (59.6%) in the secondary prevention group, followed by injection frequency (19.2%), administration method (11.8%), and efficacy (9.4%).

        "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascade associated with both cardiovascular pathology and autoimmune conditions. While anti-TNF therapies have shown clinical efficacy in immune-mediated disorders, their use in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) has produced inconsistent adverse outcomes. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the inconsistent effects of TNF blockade in heart failure, with a particular focus on receptor-specific signalling, cytokine gene regulation, and intracellular consequences of TNF antagonism. This article highlights the divergent roles of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2 (TNFR1; TNFR2) in cardiac tissue, highlighting how non-selective TNF neutralisation disrupts the balance between apoptotic and regenerative pathways. Key signalling cascades such as NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and PI3K/Akt are discussed in the context of anti-TNF therapy and its effects on myocardial survival, remodelling, and vascular integrity. The review also addresses genetic polymorphisms (e.g. TNF - 308G > A) that may influence therapeutic response and susceptibility to adverse effects. Large-scale clinical trials are needed to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of receptor-selective TNF modulation. By integrating personalized medicine nanomedicine, biotechnology, and next-generation TNF-targeting strategies could help overcome previous therapeutic failures and lead to more effective treatments for heart disease patients. A deeper understanding of TNF signalling at the molecular level suggests that future therapeutic strategies should prioritise receptor-selective modulation and patient stratification based on genetic and inflammatory biomarkers. Such precision approaches may help overcome the limitations of broad TNF inhibition and enable safer, targeted interventions in CHF.",

        "abstract": "Aneurysm location is strongly related to the risk of aneurysm growth and rupture. Due to the unique anatomic features of internal carotid artery (ICA), unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) located in different segments of ICA may exhibit distinct instability risks. However, the natural instability risk of UIAs across ICA segments has not been extensively studied. This study included patients with ICA UIAs from two prospective, multicenter Chinese cohorts. All patients underwent regular follow-up for at least four years. The primary outcome was aneurysm instability (rupture, growth, and morphological change). ICA segments were classified per Bouthillier's. C7 bifurcation (Bifur), posterior communicating artery (Pcom), and others. The 4-year instability risk was analyzed by segment. Cox regression identified factors associated with instability. This study included 779 patients. During 3153 aneurysm-years of follow-up, aneurysm instability occurred in 21/29 (incidence rate [IR]: 25.94%; 95%CI, 15.63-36.26%) UIAs in the C7-Pcom, 18/62 (IR: 10.64%; 95%CI, 6.34-14.94%) UIAs in the C7-Bifur, 28/688 (IR: 0.97%; 95%CI, 0.61-1.32%) UIAs in other segments of ICAs. Multivariable analysis showed that UIAs located in the C7-Pcom(hazard ratio, 9.76; 95%CI, 5.39-17.67) and in the C7-Bifur (hazard ratio, 15.79; 95%CI, 8.54-29.19) were associated with instability of ICA UIAs. UIAs in the C7-Bifur/Pcom have substantially higher instability risks than those in other ICA segments. The precise anatomic location should be prioritized in risk evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a common complication in hepatic surgery, which seriously affects the surgical prognosis. Ferroptosis is a novel programmed cell death mode involved in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI). Recent studies have shown that nuclear receptor FXR can alleviate HIRI, but the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we explored the potential regulatory mechanism of FXR in HIRI by using wild-type mice, FXR knockout mice, and AML12 cells. Results show that FXR was negatively correlated with HIRI-induced ferroptosis, and deletion of FXR promotes ferroptosis induced by HIRI. Activation of FXR was able to promote GPX4 expression and inhibit ferroptosis. However, the co-treatment of GPX4 inhibitor and FXR ligand weakened the inhibitory effect of FXR on promoting GPX4 expression and ferroptosis. Luciferase and EMSA results suggest that FXR regulates GPX4 transcriptional expression by binding to DR5 upstream of the GPX4 initiation codon. Our results suggest that FXR can inhibit HIRI-induced ferroptosis by targeting the transcriptional expression of GPX4. It contributes to a better understanding of the role of FXR in HIRI. In addition, our findings provide potential therapeutic options for the intervention of ischemia-reperfusion injury in surgery.",

        "abstract": "During emergency surgery, patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) experience unfavourable outcomes throughout their hospital stay. The combination of total aortic arch replacement (TAR) and frozen elephant trunk (FET) implantation has become a dependable choice for surgical treatment. The objective of this research was to utilize a machine learning technique based on artificial intelligence to detect the factors that increase the risk of mortality within 30 days after surgery in patients who undergo TAR in combination with FET. From January 2015 to December 2020, a total of 640 patients with ATAAD who underwent TAR and FET were included in this study. The subjects were divided into a test group and a validation group in a random manner, with a ratio of 7 to 3. The objective of our research was to create predictive models by employing different supervised machine learning techniques, such as XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), to assess and compare their respective performances. Furthermore, we employed SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) measures to allocate interpretive attributional values. Among all the patients, 37 (5.78%) experienced perioperative mortality. Subsequently, a total 50 of 10 highly associated variables were selected for model construction. By implementing the new method, the AUC value significantly improved from 0.6981 using the XGBoost model to 0.8687 with the PSO-ELM-FLXGBoost model. In this study, machine learning methods were successfully established to predict ATAAD perioperative mortality, enabling the optimization of postoperative treatment strategies to minimize the postoperative complications following cardiac surgeries.",

        "abstract": "Increased myocardial stiffness can lead to diastolic dysfunction, resulting eventually in increased left ventricular filling pressures (LVFPs). The clinical assessment of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function is challenging. Shear wave elastography is a novel method based on tracking shear waves, such as those induced by mitral valve closure (MVC), using high frame rate (HFR) echocardiography. The propagation velocity of shear waves is directly related to myocardial stiffness. This study investigated whether shear wave velocity at MVC is related to invasively measured LVFP. Eighty-five patients were prospectively enrolled. Left ventricular mid-diastolic pressure (LVMDP) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were invasively measured. HFR (average frame rate: 1,050 ± 220 Hz) and conventional echocardiography were performed immediately after catheterization. Shear wave velocity at MVC was measured in the anteroseptal wall. The findings were compared with conventional echocardiographic parameters and the multiparametric 2021 guideline-recommended algorithm for the estimation of LVFP. The direct response of shear wave velocity at MVC on changing LV filling pressures was tested in a group of 16 patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (DHF) on admission and after diuretic therapy. Single conventional echocardiographic parameters correlated moderately with LVFP (Pearson r between 0.39 and 0.58) and had a moderate ability to detect elevated LVFP (AUC between 0.66 and 0.79). This was similar for the multiparametric guideline algorithm (LVMDP AUC: 0.78; LVEDP AUC: 0.60). In comparison, shear wave velocities at MVC as a single measure correlated strongly with LVEDP (r = 0.71; P < 0.001) and had an similar ability to predict elevated LVMDP (AUC: 0.79; sensitivity: 87%; specificity: 65%) and an excellent ability to predict elevated LVEDP (AUC: 0.95; sensitivity: 92%; specificity: 94%) when a cutoff value of 4.8 m/s was used. In DHF patients, we observed a significant decrease in shear wave velocity after diuretic therapy (7.1 ± 1.7 m/s vs 5.3 ± 1.3 m/s; P < 0.002). In comparison with the multivariable guideline approach, end-diastolic shear wave velocity as a single measure had similar accuracy in detecting elevated LVMDP and a higher accuracy for LVEDP. Shear wave elastography might therefore be a promising new tool for the noninvasive assessment of diastolic function.",

        "abstract": "Pharmacokinetic boosting can be a strategy to enhance osimertinib exposure and reduce treatment associated costs. The OSIBOOST trial demonstrated that it was feasible to boost low osimertinib plasma trough levels with cobicistat. The current study aims to establish the equivalent dose of cobicistat boosted osimertinib compared to osimertinib 80 mg once daily (QD) by population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling. A popPK model was developed on the pharmacokinetic data from the OSIBOOST study using NONMEM 7.4.4. Simulations were performed with cobicistat boosted osimertinib dosing regimens to evaluate their equivalence to the standard of osimertinib 80 mg QD. A dose level was assumed equivalent when the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric mean ratios (GMR) for the area under the curve over 144 h (AUC<sub>0-144h</sub>) and maximum osimertinib concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) were in the acceptance range of 0.8-1.25. Cobicistat decreased osimertinib CL/F by 29.6% compared to osimertinib monotherapy (p < .0001). Osimertinib 80 mg 2 days on, 1 day off, boosted with cobicistat 150 mg QD was equivalent for osimertinib AUC<sub>0-144h</sub> (GMR [90% CI] = 0.96 [0.94-0.98]) and C<sub>max</sub> (GMR [90% CI] = 1.06 [1.04-1.08]) compared to osimertinib 80 mg QD monotherapy. However, this regimen was not equivalent for AZ5104 AUC<sub>0-144h</sub> (GMR [90% CI] = 0.67 [0.66-0.68]) and C<sub>max</sub> (GMR [90% CI] = 0.74 [0.73-0.76]). Theoretically, this reduced dose of cobicistat boosted osimertinib can potentially save approximately 33% in osimertinib treatment associated costs whilst maintaining adequate osimertinib exposure.

Age, sex, and hometown-matched controls (n = 1067) were selected from the Finnish Population Information System. The analyses involved data on prescription drug purchases and reimbursements for chronic conditions derived from the registry of Social Insurance Institution, which covers all prescription medicine purchases in Finland. The SOT recipients had an average of 1.53 reimbursed chronic conditions beyond immunosuppression (median follow-up time:18.0 years, IQR 11.0-23.0), with the highest burden among kidney and lowest among liver transplant recipients. Compared to controls, SOT recipients had significantly more reimbursement for cardiovascular diseases, hormonal deficiencies, and epilepsy (p < 0.001). Kidney transplant recipients had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular-related reimbursements than liver transplant group (p < 0.001); no significant differences were observed between the transplant groups for other conditions. Young adults after pediatric SOT had an elevated need for chronic disease medications, with the highest burden observed in kidney transplant recipients and the lowest in liver transplant recipients.

Inflammatory cells and mediators induce local inflammation, enhance neuronal excitability, and alter pain transmission pathways. Different immune cells contribute variably to PHN, with some immune cells exhibiting dual roles. An understanding of the roles of different immune cells and inflammatory factors in PHN is therefore important and may aid in identifying new immunotherapeutic approaches. To investigate the effects of diverse cytokines and immune cell phenotypes on PHN. Materials & Methods: We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis utilizing publicly available genome-wide association study data. Instrumental variable selection adhered to stringent criteria to ensure robustness. We employed various analytical methods, including the Inverse Variance Weighted method, sensitivity analyses, and reverse MR, to assess causal relationships. Our study identified causal relationships between PHN and various cytokines and immune phenotypes using two-sample MR analysis. One cytokine and five immune phenotypes were shown to reduce the risk of PHN, notably CD8dim T cell absolute count (OR: 0.483, 95% CI: 0.239-0.976, p=0.043). Conversely, one cytokine and one immune phenotype were shown to increase the risk of PHN. SNP selection indicated robust instrumental variables, and sensitivity analyses confirmed no significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. Reverse MR revealed no causal effect of PHN on these factors, suggesting a unidirectional relationship. Our study provides insights into the role of immune factors in PHN, revealing potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore personalized treatment strategies for PHN management.",

Cardiac manifestations most often involve valvular dysfunction, but can also include myocarditis or pericarditis. Although advances in healthcare have reduced the prevalence of streptococcal pharyngitis, and subsequently ARF, individual cases and outbreaks can still occur. We present a case of rheumatic myopericarditis in a 60-year-old White male who initially presented to the emergency department with sore throat for 6 days. Initial workup was largely unremarkable, and no microbiological testing was performed at that time. He was diagnosed with presumed viral pharyngitis and discharged home with supportive care. He returned 1 week later with pleuritic mid-sternal chest pain and dyspnea. Laboratory tests were significant for elevated inflammatory markers, cardiac enzyme markers, anti-streptolysin O titers, and <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> bacteremia. Further evaluation revealed pericarditis, moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade, and reduced systolic function without valvular disease. The patient was diagnosed with rheumatic myopericarditis. Management included pericardial drainage, guideline-directed medical therapy for systolic heart failure and pericarditis, and primary treatment and secondary prevention of ARF with antibiotics. Currently, the patient's cardiac function has recovered, and he regularly follows up with his medical care team. Although less common in present times, clinicians are encouraged to consider streptococcal pharyngitis and ARF on the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with pharyngeal symptoms and subsequent cardiac manifestations, with or without valvular dysfunction. Primary and secondary prevention of ARF is paramount to maintaining the low incidence of this disease.",

Given the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in society and its comorbidities, especially renal failure, which significantly impairs the quality of life, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of ALA against renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic rats. Our aim was to develop preventive therapies for DM and diabetic renal failure. Forty-eight 3-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced by administering a single intraperitoneal dose of 50 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ). Rats were divided into four groups. Right nephrectomy was performed through dorsolateral incisions in all rats, followed by occlusion of the left renal vessels for 1 h to induce ischemia. Reperfusion of the left kidney was initiated by removing the clamp and allowing 24 h of reperfusion. Histopathological examination of the kidney tissues revealed necrotic changes and tubular dilatation in the I/R group, which were significantly reduced in the ALA + I/R group. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased immunoreactivity for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and caspase-3 in the I/R group, whereas the ALA + I/R group demonstrated significantly lower immunoreactivity for these markers. Liver histology showed irregular hepatocyte cords and sinusoidal dilatation in the I/R group, whereas the ALA + I/R group exhibited a preserved classical lobular structure with reduced histopathological changes. Blood parameters, serum biochemistry, and tissue findings were also analyzed. Our study demonstrated the protective effects of ALA on renal and liver tissues against damage induced by renal I/R injury in a diabetic background. Moreover, ALA exhibited protective effects against liver damage resulting from renal I/R injury.",

In this review, the literature evaluation of different signaling mechanisms including Wnt/β-catenin, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)- adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING), NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) pathway, histone deacetylase (HDAC), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), α-klotho, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and oxidative damage concerning the pathophysiological aspects of CRS were discussed. We highlighted a few new emerging pathways with a protective role, some with a disease-progressive role, and some with a diversified role in CRS. This scientific review can help researchers identify promising treatment strategies to manage CRS. As stated in this review, these pathways can be the basis for introducing potential inhibitor molecules of disease-progressing targets. Also, this scientific review will help identify molecules with agonistic properties as a protective way to transform current treatment strategies into more specific, effective treatment strategies against CRS with minimum side effects.",

        "abstract": "Acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (AAE-C1INH) is a rare condition characterized by the localized swelling of the deeper skin layers and mucous membranes, especially the face, lips, tongue, throat, and gastrointestinal tract. AAE-C1INH is strongly associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, although it can also be linked to autoimmune conditions, solid tumors, infections, or even occur without an identifiable cause. We present the case of a 45-year-old female patient with complaints of recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and joint swelling. Laboratory testing showed decreased C1q and C4 complement levels, and C1 esterase inhibitor levels, indicative of AAE-C1INH. Further work up confirmed a diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with involvement of the bone marrow and spleen. Treatment with rituximab led to resolution of angioedema symptoms and almost complete remission of underlying lymphoma. This case underscores the importance of evaluating an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder in AAE-C1INH. Therefore, the early participation of a multidisciplinary team including specialists in immunology, hematology, and oncology is necessary for appropriate management.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the prognosis of patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized treatment. However, existing models often lack the comprehensive integration of clinical and biological indicators necessary for accurate and interpretable predictions. This study aims to develop and validate a predictive model using a combination of clinical assessments and inflammatory biomarkers to improve the prognostication of ACI patients. This real-world, retrospective cohort study was conducted at Luhe Hospital, Beijing, and included 1,017 ACI patients admitted within 24 h of symptom onset. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). Twelve machine learning models were developed and evaluated, with the optimal model and feature set selected based on comprehensive performance metrics. To enhance interpretability, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed to quantify and visualize the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. The final model, utilizing the Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm, incorporated six key features: NIHSS at 24 h (NIHSS_24 h), NIHSS_change, D-dimer, neutrophil count (N), lymphocyte percentage at 24 h (L_pct_24 h), and length of stay (LOS). NIHSS_24 h emerged as a critical early prognostic indicator, effectively predicting three-month outcomes post-discharge. Inflammatory markers, including D-dimer, N, and L_pct_24 h, significantly enhanced the model's predictive performance. The SHAP method provided both global and local interpretability, elucidating the relative importance of each feature in the model's predictions. To facilitate clinical decision-making, a web-based application was developed for real-time prognostic assessment. This study developed a robust and interpretable predictive model for ACI prognosis by integrating clinical and inflammatory biomarkers. The model underscores the prognostic significance of NIHSS_24 h and inflammatory markers, highlighting the critical role of early assessment and personalized treatment strategies. Future research should focus on multi-center validation and the incorporation of additional predictive variables to further enhance the model's accuracy and generalizability.",

        "abstract": "We report a case of a 79-year-old female with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who demonstrated a delayed reduction in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient following endocardial radiofrequency ablation of septal hypertrophy (ERASH). The patient presented with diffuse interventricular septal thickening and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, with a markedly reduced six-minute walking distance of less than 50 meters. To minimize procedural risks, ERASH was performed using the CARTO3 (Biosense Webster, Inc., Irvine, California, USA) and CARTOSOUND systems (Biosense Webster, Inc., Irvine, California, USA). Intraoperatively, SAM resolved and the LVOT gradient showed an immediate decline (93 mmHg to 43 mmHg). The patient experienced gradual improvement in functional status and remained asymptomatic post-procedure. Interestingly, four days post-procedure, follow-up transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a delayed, further reduction in the LVOT gradient. This case highlights the potential for delayed hemodynamic improvement following ERASH, potentially attributable to transient post-ablation myocardial edema, as evidenced by the increase in end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness detected by TTE. Further studies are needed to assess procedural factors such as ablation power settings, ablation lesion size, and age-related myocardial degeneration.",

        "abstract": "Sheehan syndrome (SS) is a form of hypopituitarism caused by severe postpartum hemorrhage. It leads to premature dysfunction of the target organs affected by various hormone deficiencies, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations. The coexistence of SS and dilated cardiomyopathy is rare, and symptomatic treatment remains the main treatment approach. Here, we describe a case in which a MitraClip procedure was used to treat SS-associated cardiac insufficiency. A 50-year-old woman with a history of SS and dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted to the hospital owing to worsening shortness of breath for one month, which had aggravated over the past day. Her laboratory findings were as follows: potassium 5.92 mmol/L, chloride 96.56 mmol/L, magnesium 1.08 mmol/L, triiodothyronine 0.69 nmol/L, free thyrogenic ammonia 2.44 pmol/L, and B-type natriuretic peptide precursor 23,904 pg/mL. Medical imaging revealed left atrial and left ventricular enlargement (left atrial size 39 mm, left ventricular diameter 52 mm); severe regurgitation of the second and tricuspid valves; bilateral pleural effusion; abdominal, pelvic, and pericardial effusion Despite repeated pharmacological treatment, the patient's condition did not improve. Finally, she underwent atrial septal puncture followed by percutaneous mitral valve repair using a MitraClip. The left Atrial diameter (LAS) decreased from 39mm (pre-intervention) to 34mm (pre-discharge), and decreased to 24mm during the 9-month outpatient follow-up. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 31% (pre-intervention) to 46% during the 9-month outpatient follow-up, and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) decreased from 52 mmHg (pre-intervention) to 26 mmHg during the 9-month outpatient follow-up. The coexistence of Sheehan syndrome and dilated cardiomyopathy is rare. MitraClip intervention may be considered to treat severe mitral valve regurgitation due to dilated cardiomyopathy induced by Sheehan syndrome in cases where medical therapy is ineffective and the patient has significant symptoms of heart failure.",

A secondary analysis was conducted on data from a retrospective cohort study. A total of 128 eyes with PDR that underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and were followed up for at least 2 years were enrolled, including 65 eyes in the impaired renal function (IRF) group and 63 eyes in the normal renal function (NRF) group. No significant between-group differences were observed in the proportion of cataract surgery (p = 0.722), intraoperative retinal photocoagulation (p = 0.476), gas tamponade (p = 0.932), silicone oil tamponade (p = 0.254), retinal dialysis and/or iatrogenic retinal breaks (p = 0.447), and 23- or 25-gauge (G) microincision vitrectomy surgery (MIVS) (p = 0.160).

        "abstract": "Hypertension significantly contributes to cardiovascular events and global all-cause mortality. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, amarker of insulin resistance (IR), is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. This study examined the relationship between the TyG index and cardiovascular events in patients with controlled hypertension (SBP <140 mmHg). We performed a post-hoc analysis of data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), involving 9,323 participants with controlled hypertension. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index served as a surrogate marker for IR. Cox restricted cubic regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression models were employed to investigate the association between the TyG index and CVD outcomes, adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors. The impact of intensive versus standard BP control on CVD risk associated with high IR levels were also analyzed. Over a median follow-up of 3.33 years, 725 CVD events were recorded. The TyG index was independently linked to a heightened risk of CVD events,with the highest quartile (Q4:8.93≤TyG<12.47) exhibiting a significantly greater risk (HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.18-2.08) compared to the lowest quartile (Q1: 6.74 ≤ TyG < 8.21). The significantly trend was seen only in the standard treatment group (p for trend = 0.001). The TyG index is a robust predictor of CVD events in patients with controlled hypertension, and a stronger association between the TyG index and CVD risk was seen in the standard treatment group, but not in the intensive 1treatment group. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT01206062.",

        "title": "Impact of Myocardial Infarction on Cerebral Homeostasis: Exploring the Protective Role of Estrogen.",
        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, results from the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries, which triggers a series of pathological events including cardiomyocyte death, thrombus formation, and systemic inflammation. These pathological events lead to significant structural and functional changes in the heart, potentially precipitating heart failure. The ramifications of MI extend beyond cardiac dysfunction and impact cerebral health. Accordingly, this review examines the cerebral implications of MI, focusing on how systemic inflammation and reduced cardiac output post-MI affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain function. MI-induced changes in cardiac output can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, while neuroinflammation and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability contribute to cognitive decline and neuronal damage, with potential links to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, the review explores the role of estrogen in modulating cardiovascular and cerebral health, particularly in post-menopausal women who exhibit distinct cardiovascular risk profiles. Estrogen protects the heart by regulating local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems (RAAS) and has significant impacts on brain function. Declining estrogen levels during menopause exacerbate neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits, highlighting the importance of estrogen in maintaining cerebrovascular function. Experimental studies on estrogen replacement therapies, including 17β-estradiol and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), show potential in mitigating these detrimental effects, enhancing neurogenesis, and improving cognitive outcomes. Estrogen therapy is crucial in preventing cognitive decline and reducing amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's models. This review underscores the potential benefits of estrogen therapy in promoting brain recovery post-MI and improving functional outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Portal hypertension (PH) is a major complication of chronic liver disease and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established treatment for PH-related complications, including refractory ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic hydrothorax and Budd-Chiari syndrome. However, post-TIPS cardiac decompensation has been reported in up to 25% of patients, often due to haemodynamic shifts revealing occult cardiac dysfunction. Current approaches to pre-procedural cardiac assessment and risk stratification remain inconsistent. This systematic review examines current recommendations and emerging strategies for cardiovascular evaluation in patients with cirrhosis prior to a TIPS. To identify the key predictive factors for cardiac decompensation following a TIPS in patients with cirrhosis. A systematic review of available literature, using PubMed (including MEDLINE), Embase and Cochrane databases. Results were searched comprehensively, without exclusion criteria, from inception to May 2025. Given the predominance of retrospective cohort studies, risk of bias assessment was primarily performed using the ROBINS-E tool. Thirteen studies were included (<i>n</i> = 1674 patients), with a pulled mean decompensation rate of 8.8%. Due to the variability in TIPS timing, study quality and heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not feasible, therefore results were synthesised narratively. Multiple diastolic dysfunction parameters independently and integrated through the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines demonstrated predictive value. Newly validated risk score, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and biomarkers such as N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 125 pg/mL consistently highlight cardiac dysfunction amongst the literature. Our review also explored left-atrial strain imaging as well as recent advances in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and potential genetic contributors. Multiple predictors of cardiac decompensation following TIPS exist, however studies are of limited quality.

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating innovative diagnostic and prognostic strategies. Traditional biomarkers like C-reactive protein, uric acid, troponin, and natriuretic peptides play crucial roles in CVD management, yet they are often limited by sensitivity and specificity constraints. This narrative review critically examines the emerging landscape of cardiac biomarkers and advocates for a multiple-marker approach to enhance early detection, prognosis, and risk stratification of CVD. In recent years, several novel biomarkers have shown promise in revolutionizing CVD diagnostics. Gamma-glutamyltransferase, microRNAs, endothelial microparticles, placental growth factor, trimethylamine N-oxide, retinol-binding protein 4, copeptin, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, galectin-3, growth differentiation factor-15, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2, fibroblast growth factor 23, and adrenomedullin have emerged as significant indicators of CV health. These biomarkers provide insights into various pathophysiological processes, such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, and myocardial injury. The integration of these novel biomarkers with traditional ones offers a more comprehensive understanding of CVD mechanisms. This multiple-marker approach can improve diagnostic accuracy, allowing for better risk stratification and more personalized treatment strategies. This review underscores the need for continued research to validate the clinical utility of these biomarkers and their potential incorporation into routine clinical practice. By leveraging the strengths of both traditional and novel biomarkers, precise therapeutic plans can be developed, thereby improving the management and prognosis of patients with CVDs. The ongoing exploration and validation of these biomarkers are crucial for advancing CV care and addressing the limitations of current diagnostic tools.",

Using RevMan software (Version 5.4), a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of CHM in treating CHD patients with CIS. In the meta-analysis, 18 trails were analyzed, encompassing 2,202 patients in total. The aggregated findings indicated that the utilization of CHM improved the overall effective rate, ECG performance and TCM scores significantly. Furthermore, the CHM therapy demonstrated significant improvements in LVEF, MMSE, and NIHSS. Additionally, the CHMs therapy positively influenced lipid profiles, specifically TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C. Notably, the application of CHM during the intervention was particularly effective in reducing blood viscosity, fibrinogen and platelet aggregation. Importantly, the CHM therapy was found to provide comparable safety profile to that of conventional western medicine treatment (WM) alone. The CHM demonstrated superior efficacy in the management of CHD patients with CIS. Concurrently, the CHM showed potential for improving neurological damage, lipid profiles, and positively affecting hemorheological parameters, all while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.

Our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of berberine for MetS components through systematic review and meta-analysis, from the aspects of study characteristics, risk of bias, meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and publication bias. The results indicate that berberine significantly reduces triglycerides (TG) (WMD: -0.367 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.560 to -0.175; <i>p</i> < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (WMD: -0.515 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.847 to -0.183; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and waist circumference (WC) (WMD: -3.270 cm; 95% CI: -4.818 to -1.722; <i>p</i> < 0.001) among the components of MetS, but has no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Additionally, berberine also improves the secondary indicators of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD: -0.495 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.714 to -0.276; <i>p</i> < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (WMD: -0.451 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.631 to -0.271; <i>p</i> < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (WMD: -0.435 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI: -0.856 to -0.013; <i>p</i> = 0.043), and 2-h oral glucose tolerance (2hOGTT) (WMD: -1.606 mmol/L; 95% CI: -1.891 to -1.321; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Meta-regression and subgroup analyses indicate that short-term treatment (≤90 days) is more effective for HDL-C and LDL-C than long-term treatment. Regarding safety, no significant difference was observed between berberine and placebo. Berberine significantly improves glucose and lipid metabolism and has notable effects on components of MetS, including TG, FPG, and WC, with a favorable safety profile. It may serve as a beneficial supplement. Meanwhile, more high-quality, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed in the future to provide stronger evidence. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024588614.",

        "title": "Single Camera-Based Gait Analysis Using Pose Estimation for Ankle-Foot Orthosis Stiffness Adjustment on Individuals With Stroke.",
        "abstract": "Stroke is one of the most common causes of impaired gait. The use of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) is one of the recommended methods to improve gait function in stroke patients. Although the stiffness of the AFO is adjusted for each stroke patient, the effect of stiffness adjustment remains unclear due to the difficulty in measuring the gait parameters in a clinical setting. This study aimed to investigate the effect of adjusting the AFO stiffness based on the gait ability of stroke patients using a markerless gait analysis method. A total of 32 individuals with stroke were directed to walk under five conditions: no-AFO and AFO with four different levels of spring stiffness. These springs were used to resist the plantarflexion movements. Moreover, the best gait speed improvement condition (best condition) was determined from the five gait conditions for each participant and was compared with the other conditions, assuming a clinical setting. Spatiotemporal gait parameters such as the gait speed, cadence, step length, stance phase, and swing phase were measured from body keypoints in RGB images. The experimental results showed that the gait speed, cadence, step length on both sides, and stance time on both sides were significantly improved in the best condition compared with the other conditions. This study demonstrated the usefulness of the markerless gait analysis method using a single RGB camera and the effectiveness of AFO stiffness adjustment based on the gait ability of the users.",

        "title": "The global burden of lead exposure-related ischemic stroke: based on Bayesian age-period-cohort analysis.",
        "abstract": "The global burden of lead exposure-related ischemic stroke poses a significant concern for public health, and this study aimed to comprehensively analyze the current situation, the change patterns, and forecast potential future trends associated with this critical issue. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 dataset was analyzed to assess the burden of lead exposure-related ischemic stroke. Comparison of the 2019 disease burden was conducted across age, gender, Sociodemographic Index (SDI) regions, and GBD regions. Linear regression models were used to calculate the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) values, exploring trends from 1990 to 2019. Cluster analysis identified patterns of changing disease burden across GBD regions. Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) analysis was performed to predict future burden trends. In 2019, lead exposure-related ischemic stroke caused a significant disease burden, with males and middle-aged/older adults disproportionately affected. The highest burden was observed in middle/low-middle SDI regions. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized deaths rate (ASDR) of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) exhibited a rise-and-fall pattern, with absolute cases increasing. Males consistently carried a heavier burden, and age groups exhibited variable patterns but generally followed the overall trend. High SDI regions saw a decline in burden, whereas other regions mirrored the global pattern. Clustering analysis revealed region-specific variations. The BAPC model predicts differing global trends in lead exposure-related ischemic stroke burden genders, with females expecting stable cases but decreasing rates, while males anticipate declines in all indicators over the next 11 years. The global burden of lead exposure-related ischemic stroke is a pressing issue that requires urgent attention. Our findings underscore the need for enhanced surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies to mitigate this burden.",

        "abstract": "Guidelines support the switch to a two-drug regimen (2DR) in virologically suppressed people with HIV (PWH) on a three-drug regimen (3DR). Randomized clinical trials have not included clinical outcomes in study endpoints. We provide estimates of 3-year clinical risk by means of a target trial emulation using the data of a large cohort of PWH in Italy. PWH from the Icona Foundation Study who were virologically suppressed (HIV-RNA ≤50 copies/mL) for ≥6 months on a 3DR on or after November 2014, were enrolled (database closure on July 31, 2024). PWH were classified according to therapeutic strategies: switching to 2DR (protease inhibitors or dolutegravir plus lamivudine or dolutegravir plus rilpivirine) or remaining on 3DR (any combination). The primary endpoint was the time to the first clinical composite event (cardiovascular disease [CVD], cancer [AIDS and non-AIDS related], or death). We calculated the difference in 3-year risk between therapeutic strategies, estimated using a weighted non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator. 7672 participants entered the analysis: 629 (8.2%) switching to 2DR and 7043 (91.8%) remaining on 3DR. Over the 3-year follow-up, 408 events were registered (64 CVD, 234 cancer, and 110 deaths). The 3-year adjusted risk estimate was 2.55 (95% CI 1.72, 5.33) in 2DR vs. 4.69 (95% CI 4.48, 6.17) in 3DR. The difference (-2.15% [95% CI -3.56%, -0.20%]) in favor of 2DR was mainly driven by events of non-AIDS related cancer and mortality. This study provides evidence that virologically suppressed PWH can be safely switched to 2DR, and may slightly reduce the 3-year risk of a composite clinical outcome.

        "abstract": "Research has explored the link between psychological factors and cardiovascular diseases [CVDs], with a focus on identifying predictors of these disorders. Cardiac Rehabilitation [CR] is crucial for heart disease patients, particularly those with psychological comorbidities, as it helps in self-care and understanding their condition. This study aims to compare the psychological health of CVD patients - in terms of anxiety, depression, and illness perception - before (baseline, T0) and after (over time, T1) multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation treatment, considering the effects of different psychological interventions (psychoeducational group, progressive muscle relaxation training, and individual counseling). A total of 181 patients with acute coronary syndrome [ACS], cardiac decompensation [CD], or cardiac surgery [CS], participated in a rehabilitation program between January and August 2023. Self-report questionnaires were used to investigate levels of anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) at T0 and T1. Statistically significant changes were found over time. Individual counseling led to significant reductions in depression and anxiety, and improved illness perception. Anxiety levels were also influenced by the type of cardiovascular disease and by the presence or absence of physical comorbidity. The study highlights significant improvements in levels of anxiety, depression, and illness perception from T0 to T1. Individual counseling is the most high-impact psychological intervention. These findings show the importance of psychological interventions in enhancing CVD patients' psychological and physical well-being.",

        "title": "The Psychological Experience of Caregivers of Children With Neuroblastoma Undergoing Naxitamab Treatment: A Qualitative Study in China.",
        "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a prevalent malignant tumour affecting children. Due to its insidious onset, malignant nature and poor prognosis, the absence of effective treatments presents a significant challenge, profoundly impacting children and their families. Children embody the core and hope of a family, and when faced with sudden adversity, parents often undergo psychological crises marked by anxiety, depression and severe emotional distress. Fortunately, XXX Hospital serves as a testing ground for novel domestic medications, offering not only therapy but also instilling hope in children with NB and their families. Among these medications, naxitamab (hu3F8) has shown promising efficacy in treating NB. This qualitative study aims to investigate the psychological experiences of caregivers of children with NB undergoing naxitamab treatment at a hospital in China, a specialized institution. Subsequently, tailored psychological support for caregivers will be considered based on the findings. Employing phenomenological research techniques, we conducted face-to-face semistructured interviews with 14 caregivers of children diagnosed with NB. Colaizzi's seven-step analysis method was employed to analyse the interview data. The psychological experiences of caregivers of children with NB were categorized into three main themes and 11 subthemes: the pretreatment stage (challenges during diagnosis, shock and collapse upon diagnosis and persistent pursuit of hope); the in-treatment stage (treatment-related worries and fears, significant financial strain, renewed hope and expectations during treatment and reliance on medical staff for trust and hope); and the posttreatment stage (changes in perspectives following treatment, rethinking expectations for children, anticipating the development of novel therapeutic agents and expectations regarding financial support). Caregivers of children undergoing naxitamab treatment for NB encounter diverse psychological challenges throughout different stages. It is crucial for clinical medical professionals to provide tailored psychological support to both children and their families during various stages of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Intravenous iron has emerged as a guideline-recommended therapy in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency, but the potential sex-related differences in efficacy are unknown. We aimed to assess sex-specific outcomes in the Intravenous Iron in Patients with Systolic Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency to Improve Morbidity & Mortality (FAIR-HF2-DZHK05) trial. FAIR-HF2 included 1105 heart failure patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45% and iron deficiency. A total of 368 women (mean age 68.7 ± 13.0 years) and 737 men (mean age 70.5 ± 11.0 years) were randomized to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo. The three primary endpoints were (i) time to cardiovascular death or first heart failure hospitalization, (ii) total heart failure hospitalizations, and (iii) time-to-first event of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization only in patients with transferrin saturation <20% at baseline. The hazard ratio (HR) for the first primary outcome was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-1.82, p = 0.80) in women and 0.74 (95% CI 0.57-0.95, p = 0.016) in men, while the rate ratios (RRs) for the second primary outcome were 1.06 (95% CI 0.55-2.05, p = 0.86) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.58-1.08, p = 0.136), respectively, and the HRs for the third primary outcome event were 1.21 (95% CI 0.62-2.36, p = 0.58) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.55-0.97, p = 0.028), respectively. Regarding safety outcomes, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.46 (95% CI 0.78-2.76, p = 0.24) in women, suggesting increased mortality risk under iron supplementation, in contrast to 0.86 (95% CI 0.64-1.16, p = 0.33) in men (p for interaction = 0.13). This analysis indicates relevant differential efficacy of intravenous iron in heart failure across both sexes. While men receiving ferric carboxymaltose experienced a clinically relevant reduction in cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations, women did not derive similar benefits. The results are clinically relevant and prompt validation in other large outcome trials of intravenous iron supplementation in heart failure. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03036462.",
