        "abstract": "<i>Chaetomorpha aerea</i>, distributed in temperate and tropical coastal regions, is traditionally consumed as a nutrient-rich food source in coastal communities and is believed to possess medicinal properties. This study evaluated the sedative, anxiolytic, antidiarrheal, and antimicrobial activities of the acetone extract of <i>C. aerea</i> (AECA). Furthermore, GC-MS performed a quantitative phytochemical analysis of the AECA. Sedative activity was evaluated in mice using the open field test (OFT) and hole cross test (HCT); anxiolytic activity was assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM), hole board test (HBT), and light-dark box test (LDBT); and antidiarrheal activity was determined through castor oil-induced diarrhea and gastrointestinal motility test. The disc-diffusion method was employed to evaluate antibacterial activity. In both OFT and HCT models, AECA 400 mg/kg demonstrated a significant reduction of square crossed and hole crossed compared to diazepam, respectively. In the case of EPM and HBT, 400 mg/kg dose of AECA demonstrated significant dose-dependent activity. Both in the castor oil-induced diarrhea and gastrointestinal motility test, 400 mg/kg of AECA demonstrated moderate inhibition of diarrhea compared to standard loperamide. Antimicrobial assay of AECA showed considerable inhibition against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhi</i>, measuring inhibition zones of 14 mm and 13 mm. Bioactive metabolites from GC-MS analysis were investigated through molecular docking. Docking was performed against GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (6X3T), MAO-A (2Z5X), M3 muscarinic receptor (5ZHP), <i>E. coli</i> FabI (1LX6), and GyrA (5ZTJ). AECA showed notable sedative, anxiolytic, antidiarrheal, and antimicrobial activities. To evaluate the molecular pathways involved and isolate the bioactive ingredients, more research is required.",

        "title": "Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) factors and the incidence of communicable diseases in Urban Bangladesh: Evidence from municipal areas.",
        "abstract": "Safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are crucial for health and development, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where WASH-related diseases are prevalent. Bangladesh, with high poverty rates and a large population, faces significant WASH challenges. This study examines the association between hygiene-related factors and communicable diseases in two Bangladeshi municipalities. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to July 30, 2021, in Savar and Satkhira municipalities, chosen for their diverse socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. A stratified random sampling method targeted poor, marginalised, and socially excluded populations. A total of 607 interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire, collecting data on socio-demographics, hygiene practices, and disease history. Participants were included if they were adults (aged 18 or older), had resided in the municipality for at least one year, and provided informed consent to participate. Data were analysed using SPSS, employing chi-square tests and logistic regression to assess associations between variables. The study revealed that 24.1% of participants had a communicable disease, with diarrhoea being the most common. Significant predictors of communicable diseases included gender, with females being more likely affected (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.19 to 8.66, p = 0.003), and the source of drinking water, with tube well users at higher risk (OR: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.13 to 7.02, p = 0.015). Poor hand hygiene significantly increased disease risk (OR: 12.31, 95% CI: 2.86 to 53.03, p < 0.001). Communicable diseases are prevalent in Bangladeshi municipalities, primarily driven by poor WASH conditions. Enhancing access to safe drinking water and implementing community-based WASH interventions, such as hygiene education campaigns, improved sanitation infrastructure, and school-based awareness programs, are vital for reducing the disease burden. Further research should explore the effectiveness and scalability of these targeted strategies.",

We assessed if finished (e.g., concrete) floors are associated with lower E. coli contamination in the domestic environment in rural Bangladesh. We collected samples from 1864 households over 3.5 years, including stored drinking water, child and caregiver hand rinses, courtyard soil, food, and flies (n = 24,118 samples), and enumerated E. coli using IDEXX Quanti-Tray/2000.

        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of global child mortality continues to be diarrhoea where rotavirus contributed to about 24% of deaths among all diarrhoeal deaths, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Rotavirus vaccination programmes have contributed to the reduction of mortality from 24% to 19% in rotavirus infections among hospitalised children, but the burden of rotaviral diarrhoea remains high, especially in settings with undernutrition. We aimed to determine the association of rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology with prior vaccination, socioeconomic status and clinical factors in children to see their utility in clinical settings. We analysed secondary data from a multicentre clinical trial on antibiotic impact in children with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We used stored stool samples of 6697 children aged 2-23 months old, presenting to a health facility with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We determined rotavirus aetiology prevalence using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and looked at its association with the patient's rotaviral vaccination status, clinical symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models; if they did not converge, log-Poisson models were used. Rotavirus prevalence of 21.1% was observed. There was a weak and statistically non-significant inverse association between rotavirus vaccination and rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology (adjusted PR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03). Of the five tested clinical symptoms, shorter diarrhoea duration was associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.45). Of the seven tested socioeconomic characteristics, only maternal and paternal secondary education compared with no formal education were associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, PR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00 respectively). Rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology cannot accurately be determined with prior receipt of rotavirus vaccination among children presenting to facilities with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. Short diarrhoea duration and parental secondary education were associated with increased prevalence of rotaviral aetiology; however, their utility in clinical care remains unclear.",

This study analyzed the MICS Bangladesh 2019 dataset using a multivariable logistic regression model to assess diarrhea prevalence in low, moderate, and high multi-hazard risk zones, focusing on floods, tornadoes, cyclones, and earthquakes. Diarrhea prevalence was highest in high-risk zones (7.71 %), followed by moderate (5.98 %) and low-risk zones (4.67 %). Socioeconomic factors such as male gender, urban residence, extreme poverty, and lack of handwashing facilities were associated with a higher risk of diarrhea in high-risk zones, though this link was weaker in moderate and low-risk zones. Public health officials and aid organizations must mitigate increased diarrheal disease risks following extreme events. Interventions should prioritize high-risk areas through awareness campaigns, early warning systems, improved water sanitation and hygiene in moderate to high-risk zones, and vaccination, particularly for impoverished households in disaster-prone regions.",

We provide insight into ETEC epidemiology; we followed a population-based cohort in a vaccine trial. We analyzed data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of an oral cholera vaccine conducted in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study covers 90 geographical clusters with an average population of 2988 households/cluster (baseline population 268 896). Two cohort analyses were conducted, 1 as dynamic cohort that included all subjects at vaccination, in-migrants, and births over 4 years and a closed cohort, which included only individuals present at baseline. We evaluated individuals placed under treatment center-based diarrheal surveillance between 2011 and 2015. In the dynamic cohort, the ETEC incidence was 150/100 000 person-years (PY; 95% CI, 141-159), with seasonal peaks during warmer months, and in the closed cohort, the incidence was 153/100 000 PY (95% CI, 140, 166). The highest rate was seen in children aged <1 year (2007; 95% CI, 1664-2402), then in those aged 1-4 years (314; 95% CI, 252-386), and again the rate rose in those aged >45 years (219/100 000 PY; 95% CI, 177-267). The rate of severe ETEC was ≤35/100 000 PY for persons aged ≤45 years (95% CI, 27-44), but rose to 82 for adults aged >45 years (95% CI, 58-113).

We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs. 13%; p < 0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility. Our findings warrant that reducing unnecessary antibiotic consumption requires increasing public awareness and strengthening laws on the sale of over-the-counter antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading public health problems; they kill more children under five years of age than any other infectious disease. Approximately two-thirds of all deaths occur in 15 developing countries, including Bangladesh. To achieve the targets of childhood mortality, it is essential to reduce the current rate of under-5 mortality. In Bangladesh, healthcare utilization for childhood illnesses has increased in recent years, but not to a desirable level, and disparities among different groups remain a matter of concern. This study explores the determinants contributing to unequal access to healthcare-seeking behavior for childhood illnesses, namely diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), over the last decade and a half. This study extracted data from the latest three Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2006, 2012-13, and 2019). Children younger than five years with diarrhea and/or ARI 2 weeks prior to the survey were included in the study. The prevalence and association of care-seeking were investigated through a chi-square test and multivariate logistic model applied to identify the determinants of unequal access to healthcare services. Care seeking for diarrhea and symptoms of acute respiratory infections showed a downward trend from 2006 to 2012-13 (30% vs. 18.5%) and an upward trend from 2012 to 13 to 2019 (18.5% vs. 74.6%). Several socioeconomic and demographic factors such as gender, administrative division, children's age, mother's education, household head's education, wealth, and ethnicity were found to have significant associations with care-seeking behavior for children under 5. Gender, division, and age were significant predictors across the three study periods. This study identified some possible determinants of care-seeking behaviors in childhood illnesses. Based on the findings of this research, policymakers should revise the existing policy to increase the utilization rate and reduce inequality in health care seeking for children under the age of 5. Specifically, counseling slum residents provide a provision for subsidizing or providing free health care benefits to the poorest households and enhancing parents' counseling to remove gender bias.",

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are typically used directly on stool but are not considered sufficient for cholera confirmation. However, they may provide a practical alternative to the slide agglutination step of culture<i>,</i> as they are easy to use, store, and require minimal training. This study evaluates the concordance of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1/O139 detection from presumptive colonies by slide agglutination with RDTs. Patients (≥1 year) with acute watery diarrhea at the icddr,b Dhaka hospital were enrolled. Stool samples were cultured on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose medium, and presumptive colonies were subcultured on Gelatin Agar medium. Isolates were then tested by slide agglutination and four commercial cholera RDTs. From 4 February 2024 through 24 May 2025, 1,638 patients with acute watery diarrhea were enrolled, 1,140 (70%) had presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies, and 482 (29%) were culture-confirmed as <i>V. cholerae</i> O1. We tested suspected <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies using Cholkit (n=1,140), SD Bioline (n=693), Crystal VC O1/O139 (n=693), and Crystal VC O1 (n=655) RDT kits. RDTs showed near-perfect concordance with slide agglutination. Using slide agglutination as the reference, the sensitivity of the RDT kits ranged from 99.3% to 99.6% and the specificity from 99.3% to 99.7%. RDTs offer a practical and potentially easier alternative to slide agglutination of presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies within typical cholera culture protocols. This may help to provide a pathway to quick confirmation of outbreaks in settings where lab facilities and reagents may be limited.IMPORTANCEThis study demonstrated that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can effectively replace traditional slide agglutination methods to confirm suspected <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonies belonging to the O1 serogroup, which are responsible for the current seventh cholera pandemic. Comparing four RDTs to slide agglutination, we found almost perfect agreement, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 99%. Since RDTs are cheaper, easier to use and store, and require less technical training, adopting them could significantly speed up cholera outbreak confirmation, especially in areas with limited laboratory resources. This practical shift could lead to faster responses to cholera outbreaks, ultimately improving public health surveillance and disease control globally.",

        "abstract": "The burden of diarrhoeal diseases is considerable in South Asia, as well as in sub-Saharan Africa. Its economic impact is more profound in resource-limited settings like low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this study, we aimed to estimate the direct and indirect costs reported by the caregivers of participants from seven LMICs. The current study is a secondary analysis using data from the multicentre, Global Enteric Multicentre Study, which enrolled under-5 children. This prospective case-control study was conducted in seven sites, all of which were in LMICs. After adjustment for inflation, cost data were collected from the caregivers and converted into international dollar (I$). Quantile regression models were developed after adjusting for age, sex and country. This study analysed data from 4592 participants. The median (IQR) total direct cost (TDC) and total indirect cost (TIC) were I$8.4 (I$11.0) and I$10.2 (I$14.3), respectively. Statistically significant differences were found across continents for multiple variables. The highest median TDC and TIC were in Bangladesh (I$13.6 and I$23.2, respectively), while mozambique reported the lowest (I$0.4 and I$4.9, respectively), with medication accounting for 60.9% of TDC. Quantile regression analysis showed TDC was positively associated with factors like family size, urban residence, moderate-to-severe disease, caregiver education and use of rehydration methods, while treated drinking water and overweight status were negatively associated. TIC was significantly associated with seeking prior care. The indirect cost of diarrhoea was higher, which indicates the impact of lost productivity due to the disease. Bolstering the healthcare financing systems, ensuring affordable medication using pricing regulation, subsidising treatment packages, promoting the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) initiative, promoting and practising standard case management, and timely healthcare-seeking can reduce the economic burden.",

        "abstract": "Undernutrition in children is a major global health issue. Diarrhea exacerbates undernutrition, creating a vicious cycle of infection and malnutrition. This longitudinal study examined growth patterns and influencing factors among 138 children following diarrhea. Children under two seeking care for watery diarrhea at a rural hospital in Bangladesh were enrolled and followed for three months of home-based visits. Anthropometric measurements-length-for-age z-score (LAZ), weight- for-age z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length z-score (WLZ), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were taken at enrollment and follow-ups. Linear mixed-effects models assessed associations of clinical, sociodemographic, sanitation, hygiene, and food security factors with growth outcomes. Overall, LAZ declined over three months (-0.260, SD: 0.408), while WAZ, WLZ, and MUAC improved (0.100, SD: 0.484; 0.249, SD: 0.725; 0.672 cm, SD: 0.476). Children with malnutrition at enrollment strongly predicted persistent malnutrition (LAZ < -2, WAZ < -2, WLZ < - 2, MUAC < 12.5 cm) during follow-up compared to new incidence of malnutrition (RR: 3.8, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.80, 6.35). Poor growth outcomes were linked to longer diarrhea duration, more vomiting, and hospitalization. Hospitalization was associated with declines in LAZ (-0.095, p = 0.009) and MUAC (-0.098, p = 0.030). Children aged 7-12 months had greater declines in WAZ (- 0.109, p = 0.096) and WLZ (-0.181, p = 0.113). Improved sanitation and hygiene supported growth, while household hunger was linked to declines. This study highlights the multifactorial nature of post-diarrhea growth outcomes and emphasizes the need for integrated interventions addressing clinical care, sanitation, hygiene, and food security. Children under two years of age in low and middle-income countries are highly vulnerable to undernutrition, especially following diarrheal illness. This study shows that growth recovery after diarrhea is not guaranteed and is shaped by multiple factors, including the child's age, the severity of illness, household sanitation and hygiene practices, and food security. Children who were already malnourished at the time of illness were much more likely to remain so months later. Poor hygiene practices and limited access to protein-rich foods further reduced the likelihood of recovery. These findings are critical because they highlight the need for targeted follow-up and integrated interventions to support children after diarrhea. By identifying which children are at highest risk and which environmental and clinical conditions hinder growth, this study provides essential evidence to guide strategies for improving child nutrition and health in similar low-resource settings.",

Soil/dust ingestion directly from floors or indirectly via hands, drinking water and food can significantly contribute to children's ingestion of fecal organisms. We assessed if finished (e.g., concrete) floors are associated with lower <i>E. coli</i> contamination in the domestic environment in rural Bangladesh. We collected samples from 1864 households over 3.5 years, including stored drinking water, child and caregiver hand rinses, courtyard soil, food, and flies (n=24,118 samples), and enumerated <i>E. coli</i> using IDEXX Quanti-Tray/2000. Controlling for potential confounders (socio-demographics, water/sanitation status, animal ownership), households with finished floors had slightly lower log10-transformed <i>E. coli</i> counts (Δlog10= -0.10 (-0.20, 0.00)) and prevalence (prevalence ratio=0.90 (0.83, 0.98)) on child hands than households with soil floors; floor material was not associated with contamination levels in other sample types. Finished floors were associated with lower <i>E. coli</i> contamination of child hands, food and stored drinking water following periods of higher rainfall and temperature, and lower <i>E. coli</i> contamination of child hands in households with more domestic animals. Measures to control enteric infections in low-income countries should test flooring improvements to reduce exposure to fecal contamination.",

        "abstract": "Adenovirus (AdV) is a non-enveloped virus with a double-stranded DNA genome that can infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as cause conjunctivitis. The infection is influenced by the patient's age, environment, temperature, and immunocompromised individuals. Due to its wide range of symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, cough, and eye redness, the AdV virus presents a substantial health risk, particularly to children who are vulnerable due to their frequent touching of the mouth and face. Investigation of the epidemiology and economic impact of this infection is vital for public health. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data, underscoring the importance of shedding light on this subject. Most HAdV (Human adenovirus) infections in children and healthy individuals tend to resolve without medical intervention. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the virus from triggering severe epidemics by maintaining social and individual hygiene practices. Considering the COVID-19 situation, the emergence of another viral epidemic has the potential to present a substantial challenge to our healthcare system. This would lead to an increased burden on the general community, causing distress and health-related difficulties. It is imperative to establish and enhance the healthcare system's infrastructure and capacity to effectively manage future outbreaks. Neonates, immune-compromised individuals, and infants are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes from this virus. To summarize, resolving the issues posed by viral infections necessitates comprehensive preventative methods to mitigate their social and economic consequences.",

        "abstract": "We use machine learning to identify innovative strategies to target azithromycin to the children with watery diarrhea who are most likely to benefit. Using data from a randomized trial of azithromycin for watery diarrhea (NCT03130114), we develop personalized treatment rules given sets of diagnostic, child, and clinical characteristics, employing a robust ensemble machine learning-based procedure. This procedure estimates the child-level expected benefit for a given set of covariates by combining predictions from a library of statistical models. For each rule, we estimate the proportion treated under the rule and the average benefits of treatment. Among 6692 children, treatment under the most comprehensive rule is recommended on average for one third of children. The risk of diarrhea on day 3 is 10.1% lower (95% CI: 5.4, 14.9) with azithromycin compared to placebo among children recommended for treatment (NNT: 10). For day 90 re-hospitalization and death, risk is 2.4% lower (95% CI: 0.6, 4.1; NNT: 42). While pathogen diagnostics are strong determinants of azithromycin effects on diarrhea duration, host characteristics may better predict benefits for re-hospitalization or death. This suggests that targeting antibiotic treatment for severe outcomes among children with watery diarrhea may be possible without access to pathogen diagnostics.",

This study investigates the antidiarrheal effects of <i>L. chinensis</i> seed extract (LCSE). Ethanolic extract was prepared from dried, powdered <i>L. chinensis</i> seeds. Acute oral toxicity was conducted by administering a single 2,000 mg/kg dose to female Swiss albino mice. Mice were divided into five groups (control, positive control with Loperamide, and test groups receiving 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of LCSE) for the antidiarrheal assay. Diarrhea was induced with castor oil, and parameters such as onset of diarrhea, fecal output, gastrointestinal motility, and enteropooling were measured. The statistical analysis was conducted in GraphPad Prism version 10.1.2 using one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett multiple comparison test. <i>L. chinensis</i> seed extract (LCSE) significantly (p < 0.001) delayed the onset of diarrhea, reduced the frequency of defecation, and decreased fecal weight in the castor oil-induced diarrhea model at all doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg). Additionally, LCSE significantly (p < 0.001) reduced total and wet fecal output, inhibited gastrointestinal motility (p < 0.001) in the charcoal meal test, and notably (p < 0.001) decreased the volume and weight of intestinal contents in the enteropooling assay. The <i>in vivo</i> antidiarrheal index (ADI) showed a dose-dependent increase, with the highest ADI recorded at 400 mg/kg (189.42%), slightly surpassing the standard drug, loperamide (160.14%). The finding supports the antidiarrheal potential of LCSE holds potent antidiarrheal properties, positioning it as a promising, sustainable alternative to modern medications.",

We applied machine learning to identify and describe households of children that benefited most from WaSH and nutrition interventions. We used causal forests and baseline characteristics of pregnant women enroled in a trial in Bangladesh (2013-2015) to test for heterogenous treatment effects of the primary trial outcomes at two years (length-for-age Z-score [LAZ-score] and diarrhoea prevalence) and one secondary outcome (child development [EASQ Z-score]) for each treatment-outcome combination. We split households into three groups based on predicted treatment effect magnitude and compared characteristics of those that benefitted the most (Tercile 3) versus the least (Tercile 1). Heterogeneity was detected in the effect of Sanitation on EASQ Z-score, compared to Control; children in Tercile 3 were estimated to gain 0.51 SD (95% CI: 0.35, 0.67) whereas children in Tercile 1 were estimated to have no benefit. At baseline, households of children in Tercile 3 were more likely to report that chickens always entered the house (85% vs. 4%) and had animal feces observed in the child's play area (84% vs. 18%) when compared with Tercile 1. Tercile 3 households also owned less land and assets and lived further from Dhaka, any population center, or a market. We did not detect heterogeneity for any other treatment-outcome comparison. We did not detect heterogeneity in any treatment arms for the outcomes of diarrhoea or LAZ-score, showing that children from all backgrounds benefit from effective interventions equally based on household characteristics. We found heterogeneity in the effect of receiving sanitation improvements on child development, where poorer households located in more remote areas and potentially with higher levels of animal fecal contamination had the highest expected benefit.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) a life threatening condition, one of the most dreadful disease with a broad etiological profile, a challenging problem in our community and specially in critically ill patients and also associated with high morbidity and mortality. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of the cause of AKI is particularly important for selecting appropriate therapy. Measurement of renal indices is commonly used to differentiate prerenal AKI from ATN, often cannot be used and also may not be accurate in many conditions. As renal biopsy is gold standard but this invasive procedure may not be feasible in critically ill patients. Therefore, this cross sectional study was conducted among patients with AKI at Department of Nephrology in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from November 2017 to June 2019, to assess the ability of Resistive index (RI) to differentiate prerenal AKI and ATN. Mean age were 39.45±10.96 years, with male 65.0%. Among all, 19.0% of AKI patients were found to be sepsis followed by acute watery diarrhea (17.5%), when all causes of hypovolemia were combined, hypovolemia constituted the most prevalent cause. According to renal indices 47.0% patients had prerenal AKI and 53.0%, ATN. On the basis of RI, about 45.0% patients were as a case of prerenal AKI with mean RI 0.63±0.07 and 55.0% were ATN with Mean RI 0.77±0.71. But, type of AKI based on clinical diagnosis was considered as standard and were 46.0% prerenal AKI and 54.0% patients ATN. When compared with clinical diagnosis, RI was found to be more correlated with clinical diagnosis with p<0.001 than renal indices. RI had 91.89% sensitivity and 95.35% specificity to differentiate prerenal AKI and ATN. On the other hand, renal indices had low sensitivity (62.16%) and specificity (65.12%). Moreover, a statistically significant difference were noted between type of AKI diagnosed by RI and by renal indices (p<0.05). So, RI derived from Doppler ultrasound is superior to renal indices and can be used as a useful differentiating tool.",

        "abstract": "We previously identified genetic polymorphisms associated with <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>-positive diarrhea at the locus containing the transcription factor, cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>). Genetic association testing in birth cohorts of Bangladeshi children showed the previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the <i>CREM</i> locus associated with <i>E. histolytica-</i>positive diarrhea were independently associated with undernutrition at 1 year of age. The reference allele for both tested SNPs was associated with lower weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) at 1 year of age (rs2148483: 0.161 reduction in WAZ per allele, <i>P</i> = 0.007; rs58000832: 0.203 reduction in WAZ, <i>P</i> = 0.001). Small intestinal transcriptome data from Bangladeshi and American children revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for cAMP response element-binding sites. DEGs related to mitochondrial function were upregulated in the small intestine of children with the rs2148483 reference allele, while adaptive immune response processes were enriched among downregulated genes. Upregulation of mitochondrial function was mirrored by plasma metabolomics profiles concordant with a shift toward mitochondrial respiration. In mice, global conditional deletion of <i>Crem</i> resulted in reduced body weight, downregulation of genes related to innate immune function, and upregulation of metabolic gene expression in the intestine. Tissue-specific deletion of <i>Crem</i> in intestinal epithelial cells was sufficient to reduce overall body weight and alter intestinal expression of mitochondrial-related metabolic genes but not immune gene transcription. These data indicate that intestinal epithelial expression of <i>Crem</i> is linked to body weight, plausibly by regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, while <i>Crem</i> expression in other cell types influences the immune response to <i>E. histolytica</i>.IMPORTANCEUndernutrition and diarrheal disease are leading causes of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Undernutrition can present as a cause or consequence of diarrheal diseases, leading us to hypothesize these phenotypes share a common genetic basis. Our identification of cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>) as a transcriptional regulator that influences susceptibility to both undernutrition and diarrheal disease in children growing up in an impoverished Bangladeshi community advances our understanding of the interaction of two major causes of childhood illness and offers the potential of therapy targeted to the cAMP-regulated transcription factor, <i>CREM</i>.",

        "abstract": "Despite the global burden of stunting, data regarding the determinants of stunting observed on follow-up after discharge from health care facilities among children treated for severe diarrhoea are limited. We investigated factors influencing stunting during post-discharge follow-up among under-2 children treated for severe diarrhoea. We developed a predictive model to estimate stunting prevalence and identify risk factors without post-discharge anthropometry. We analysed data from two sites in Bangladesh participating in the multi-country, double-blind, randomised clinical trial on Antibiotics for Children with Severe Diarrhoea among children aged 2-23 months, from 2017 to 2019. Severe diarrhoea was defined as a child who had acute diarrhoea with severe/some dehydration, or moderate wasting, or severe stunting on admission. Multiple linear regression was constructed to predict the independent factors associated with stunting among the enrolled children who were followed for 180 days after hospital discharge. We developed a predictive model for stunting using 75% of the available data for training, with the remaining 25% reserved as a test set to evaluate model performance. We then applied this predictive model to the children not enrolled in the trial but admitted to the hospital for diarrhoea to estimate the predictive prevalence and determinants of post-discharge stunting at 180 days. Of the 1431 enrolled children, 589 (41.2%) were stunted at enrolment. By day 180, stunting increased to 698 (49.3%). Linear growth of diarrhoeal children over this follow-up period was positively associated with enrolment length-for-age z score (LAZ), maternal body mass index (BMI), maternal education, duration of diarrhoea, and breastfeeding. We applied the predictive model developed on the enrolled patients' data to the 33 341 children admitted for diarrhoea but not enrolled in the trial. The model estimated that 6142 children (18.4%) in this non-follow-up group would have been stunted at 180 days. Persistent stunting at 180 days for these not-followed children was predicted to be positively associated with dehydration on admission and a higher number of children in the household, while a negative association was predicted with formal parental education and increased maternal BMI. Our study highlights the need for targeted interventions to mitigate persistent stunting in this vulnerable group recovering from diarrhoea.",

Accurate etiological diagnosis is essential. This study used postmortem diagnostics to investigate the contribution of diarrhea to under-5 mortality and examine co-morbidities and co-infections in Africa and South Asia. Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) generates data on child deaths through minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical record review, and verbal autopsies. Multidisciplinary panels assign cause(s) of death using WHO International Classification of Diseases. This analysis included deaths among children aged 1-59 months enrolled from 18 December 2016-31 December 2023 across six African sites (Ethiopia, Mali, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Africa) and Bangladesh. Of 1517 deaths assessed, diarrhea was in the causal pathway in 240 (15.8%). The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%). No pathogen was identified in 49.6% (119/240) of diarrhea-related deaths; among these, diarrhea was underlying cause in 42.9%. Among the 121 pathogen-attributed deaths, the most frequent were EAEC (34.7%), typical EPEC (15.7%), Shigella/EIEC (14.0%), ST-ETEC (12.4%), rotavirus (26.4%), and adenovirus (non-40/41: 19.0%; 40/41: 5.0%).

We aimed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a dose-sparing IPV (ds-IPV) with a full-dose IPV in infants in Bangladesh. This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study was done at two field sites in Bangladesh (Kamlapur and Matlab). Eligible participants were healthy infants aged 6-8 weeks, with parents who intended to reside in the area during the study period. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive either ds-IPV from one of the three lots (lot A, B, or C; Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) or an IPV (Serum Institute of India). Three intramuscular doses (0·5 mL) were administered at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks in addition to other standard vaccines. The study staff involved in safety evaluation, study procedures, parents of the participants, and the laboratory personnel were masked to the treatment allocations. The primary endpoint was seroconversion for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 at 28 days after the third dose, assessed in the per-protocol and full analysis populations. Solicited adverse events were collected up to 4 days after each vaccine dose and unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events were collected up to 28 days after the third dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05163561, and is complete. Between Jan 9, 2022, and April 29, 2023, 1072 eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive ds-IPV (n=801) or IPV (n=267), of whom 1052 completed the study. 755 (96% [95% CI 94 to 97]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 256 (97% [94 to 98]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 1 (difference -0·55% [95% CI -3·05 to 1·95]). 744 (95% [93 to 96]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 261 (98% [96 to 100]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 2 (difference -3·83% [-6·48 to -1·19]). 765 (97% [96 to 98]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 260 (98% [96 to 99]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 3 (difference -0·78% [-2·73 to 1·16]). Solicited events were observed in 446 (56%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and 143 (54%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. Unsolicited events were observed in 746 (93%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and 250 (94%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. Serious adverse events were observed in 23 (3%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and five (2%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. The common serious adverse events were pneumonia (n=10 in the ds-IPV group; n=3 in the IPV group), bronchiolitis (n=3 in the ds-IPV group; n=1 in the IPV group), and diarrhoea (n=3 in the ds-IPV group; n=1 in the IPV group). None of the unsolicited events and serious adverse events were causally related to the study vaccines. Delivery of three intramuscular doses of the novel ds-IPV vaccine is safe and immunologically non-inferior to the delivery of three intramuscular doses of IPV, and the dose sparing formulation might therefore become an attractive option for some national immunisation programmes due to lower expected vaccine costs.

        "title": "Deep Tubewell Use and Child Diarrhea in Rural Bangladesh: Results from a Prospective Community Surveillance Study.",
        "abstract": "Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among under-five children in South Asia. In rural Bangladesh, deep tubewells that tap into low-arsenic deep aquifers have been installed to provide microbially safe and arsenic-free drinking-water at source. However, unlike more widely used shallow tubewells, deep tubwells are sparsely distributed, and households often travel farther for drinking-water consumption from such wells. Hence, benefits from deep tubewells may be abated by higher levels of microbial contamination during water handling and storage that could increase the risk of diarrheal diseases. We examined the association between deep tubewell use and diarrheal disease risk in under-five children and investigated the role of social and environmental factors on modifying the association. We implemented community diarrheal disease surveillance across households with under-five children using deep and shallow tubewells in Matlab, Bangladesh from March 2018 to October 2019. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to measure the association between deep tubewell use compared to shallow tubewell use on diarrheal disease prevalence. Children in households using deep tubewells had diarrheal disease prevalence 0.83 times that of children in households using shallow tubewells (95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.96). Protective effects of deep tubewell use on diarrhea risk were observed among children in households that drank from wells within their household compound (Risk ratio (RR) =0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91), were in flood-prone areas (RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.75-0.92), and used unimproved latrines (RR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.89). Deep tubewell use was more protective against diarrhea than shallow tubewell use during the dry season (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.97). Despite concerns, using deep tubewells may not translate to higher diarrhea risk among under-five children, and may reduce diarrhea further especially in social and environmental contexts associated with higher groundwater microbial contamination. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15725.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium is a cause of diarrhea morbidity and mortality in infants in low- and middle-income countries. A cohort of children was followed longitudinally in a high-transmission-intensity community in Bangladesh. Diarrhea attributed to Cryptosporidium (cryptosporidiosis) decreased from a peak of 0.19 episodes per child at 1-2 years to 0.05 episodes per child at 3-4 years of age (P = .0064). Notably, the decrease in cryptosporidiosis was not accompanied by a decline in subclinical infections. Using an episode-based analysis confirmed that the parasite burden declined with repeated infections (P < .0001 from the mixed-effects model included data from all infection frequencies; Cq value of the first and fourth infections (last reinfection with >10 cases): Cq 28.65 ± 5.533 versus 32.42 ± 4.046). There was also a decrease in the time required to clear a parasitic infection: longer infections (>1 month) occurred in 43% of the first infections compared to 24% in the fourth infections (P = .00017 from the mixed-effects model). The avidity of anti-Cp23 and anti-Cp17 plasma IgG increased in older children who had fewer diarrheal infections (ratio of the avidity index after the first infection versus that in the older repeatedly infected children: 1.81 ± 1.02 for anti-Cp23 IgG P > .0001 and 1.14 ± 0.35 anti-Cp17 IgG P = .0056). Our results are consistent with the development of an anti-Cryptosporidium adaptive immune response over repeated infections (average number of previous infections at 4 years, 2.42 ± 1.24) characterized by an increase in anti-Cryptosporidium antibody avidity that is associated with a decrease in cryptosporidiosis but not in subclinical Cryptosporidium infections.

        "abstract": "Beinaglutide, a short-acting glucagon-like polypeptide-1 receptor agonist, has shown variable efficacy in weight reduction and metabolic control in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To summarize the therapeutic effects of beinaglutide in patients with overweight/obesity with/without type 2 diabetes. RCTs involving patients receiving beinaglutide in the intervention arm and placebo or active comparator in the control arm were searched through multiple electronic databases. The change from baseline in body weight was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, glycemic parameters, lipids, and adverse events (AEs). RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as mean differences (MDs), odds ratios (ORs), or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Six RCTs (<i>n</i> = 800) with mostly some concerns about the risk of bias were included. Over 12-24 weeks, beinaglutide 0.1-0.2 mg thrice daily was superior to the control group in reducing total (MD = -3.25 kg, 95%CI: -4.52 to -1.98, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 84%, <i>P</i> < 0.00001) and percent (MD = -4.13%, 95%CI: -4.87 to -3.39, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 54%, <i>P</i> < 0.00001) body weight reduction. Beinaglutide also outperformed the control group in achieving weight loss by 5% (OR 4.61) and 10% (OR = 5.34). The superiority of beinaglutide <i>vs</i> the control group was also found in reducing BMI (MD = -1.22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95%CI: -1.67 to -0.77) and WC (MD = -2.47 cm, 95%CI: -3.74 to -1.19]). Beinaglutide and the control group had comparable impacts on blood pressure, glycemic parameters, insulin resistance, hepatic transaminases, and lipid profile. Beinaglutide posed higher risks of treatment discontinuation due to AEs (RR = 3.15), nausea (RR = 4.51), vomiting (RR = 8.19), palpitation (RR = 3.95), headache (RR = 2.87), and dizziness (RR = 6.07) than the control. However, the two groups had identical risks of total and serious AEs, diarrhea, fatigue, and hypoglycemia. Short-term data from RCTs suggested that beinaglutide causes modest benefits in reducing body weight, BMI, and WC, with no significant difference in glycemic and other metabolic endpoints compared to the control arm. Safety data were consistent with those of the other drugs in the glucagon-like polypeptide-1 receptor agonist class. Larger RCTs are warranted to prove the longer-term metabolic benefits of beinaglutide.",

        "abstract": "Since August 2017, approximately 960,000 Rohingya refugees have settled in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and programs were implemented across the camps to address the needs of the population and reduce the burden of linked infectious diseases. However, monitoring and maintenance of this infrastructure has been inconsistent. This study aimed to assess progress in WASH in the camps of Cox's Bazar since the early emergency phase in 2018, and to update the priorities for intervention. From January to March 2022, a lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) survey was conducted across 19 camps. Nineteen households were randomly selected per camp. Data on access to and quality of WASH services, household practices, and health outcomes including skin infections among children under five years of age were collected. Crude and weighted averages with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each indicator and compared with targets pre-defined based on Sphere guidelines and Médecins Sans Frontières WASH experts. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the results to a 2018 LQAS survey. More than half of the indicators (59%; 16/27) did not meet the pre-determined targets. Performance was adequate on three of five water quality and supply indicators, with less than half of households (44%, 95% CI: 39-49%) reporting that water was continuously available in the past week. Regarding water storage, performance on three indicators was considered adequate, as the proportion of households that keep water for less than one day was 27% (95% CI: 23-32%). Of six hygiene indicators, adequate performance was identified for only one. Performance on the sanitation indicators was inadequate, with 11% (95% CI: 8-15%) of households using an improved sanitation facility. In solid waste management, two of four indicators suggested adequate performance, and for health outcomes, the proportion of children who hadn't shown any skin infection was inadequate at 69% (95% CI: 64-73%). Improvements in the WASH situation in Cox's Bazar have been observed in 2022 compared to 2018. However, significant gaps remain in water supply, sanitation facilities, and hygiene services. LQAS can be an effective monitoring tool to support long-term multisectoral interventions in protracted emergencies.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is already prone to extreme weather events like heatwaves, leaving millions vulnerable. High ambient temperatures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality by infectious diseases, but the effect of these high temperatures indoors remains to be studied. This study investigated the effect of high indoor temperatures on the feelings of illness and heat coping mechanisms in vulnerable populations without heat mitigation. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 490 houses in rural villages in the coastal area of Chakaria, Bangladesh chosen through stratified cluster sampling. It assessed the feelings of illness and their adaptative behaviour to high temperatures. There were 49 temperature and humidity monitors placed indoors to obtain accurate measurements of these parameters in different areas and with different house materials. This information was used to determine the effect of high indoor temperatures on the symptoms that vulnerable populations reported. People living in hotter houses reported overall more symptoms, notably, diarrhoea, local site infections and sore throat. Temperatures were higher in houses made of bamboo compared to cement and having shade significantly decreased indoor temperature. Most women in the study reported performing adequate heat coping mechanisms. However, these did not show a protective effect against illness. This paper showed that high indoor temperatures could be associated with an increase in symptoms. Housing characteristics (material and environment) decreased indoor temperature. Having shading and a house made from cement was protective to reporting symptoms. Further studies into the compliance of coping behaviours are needed to assess their potential protective effect.",

        "abstract": "Effective cholera outbreak response requires accurate bedside rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) because access to laboratories is often limited. Formative studies suggest cholera diagnostics have multiple vulnerabilities, including antibiotics and predation by bacteriophage ('phage') specific to <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (<i>Vc</i>). We conducted a prospective nationwide study in Bangladesh among over 2000 patients with diarrhoeal disease to characterize how these vulnerabilities impact RDT performance. Assays included culture, qPCR and mass spectrometry. With the current gold standard of culture or qPCR <i>Vc</i> positivity, we found no effect of phage on RDT performance. When the diagnostic criteria were expanded to include phage, there was a small decrease in RDT sensitivity. In contrast, large increases in sensitivity and specificity were observed among patients with moderate and severe dehydration. Using the expanded definition, the odds of RDT positivity decreased among cholera patients with phage exposure. The effect was most robust among patients with severe dehydration. Antibiotic were detected in over 80% of samples by LC-MS/MS which limited testing for effects on RDTs. Applying these findings, we estimated that restricting RDT use to severe patients with no reported antibiotic exposure increases sensitivity by 50% compared to unrestricted use. If phage were a diagnostic proxy for <i>Vc</i>, we estimate RDT would miss an additional 17% of cholera cases. Cholera RDTs have critical limitations that require consideration in global deployments. Inclusion of phage detection in diagnostic criteria may improve case detection which requires further study. The impact of these findings likely extends to other diseases where diagnostics share similar vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "Multi-pathogen molecular diagnostics enhance our understanding of the pathogen-specific burden of diarrhea. However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities. Conversely, the absence of a similar response pattern for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, and EAEC is consistent with large-scale studies showing a limited association between their quantities and diarrhea.",

As mothers are considered to be the primary caregivers, they bear the responsibility of administering medications to their children. We aimed to evaluate maternal perceptions along with the barriers and facilitators in play that are affecting ORS administration among children in Bangladesh. The study was conducted at Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh through a qualitative approach. In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted on thirty-one mothers of under-5 children reporting to the hospital from February to April 2024. Qualitative content analysis method was used to describe and analyse the transcribed data. The mothers held several misconceptions regarding the administration of ORS. Majority of the participants thought their child could receive ORS through their breastmilk, which was an interesting finding. Along with this, mothers also lacked proper understanding regarding ORS preparation, storage, and use. Some of the key barriers were the lack of proper knowledge, motivation, and compliance, along with misdirection from the elders and pharmacy drug sellers. Additional key facilitators to ORS use were trust towards doctors, positive attitude towards learning about ORS, community education, instructions written on the packet, and support from the healthcare providers. A focused approach should be implemented to educate mothers on the correct preparation and administration of ORS for children, while also addressing and dispelling any misconceptions.",

        "abstract": "Litsea monopetala (LM) leaves are used in traditional medicine system in the South Asian region for treating ailments such as digestive issues, respiratory problems and skin disorders. In this study, we investigated the possible antioxidant, thrombolytic, analgesic and antidiarrheal properties of the methanolic extract of LM leaves. We assessed the antioxidant activity using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging and total phenolic content tests, while thrombolytic activity was evaluated by clot lysis assays. The in-vivo analgesic and antidiarrheal activities were tested by two standard methods, e.g., acetic acid-induced and castor oil-induced animal model, respectively. Prior to in vivo and in vitro evaluation of the pharmacological activities phytochemical screening was also performed to estimate the bioactive compounds (e.g., phenol, carbohydrates, reducing sugars, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins and steroids) present. Among the tested phytochemicals, our results reveal carbohydrates, alkaloids, flavonoids and tannins as the major phytocompounds present in the extract. Within the different solvent extractives, the methanolic extract exhibited DPPH free radical scavenging features with an IC50 of 8.99 µg/ml compared to ascorbic acid, an IC50 of 13.38 µg/ml. At 500 mg/kg dose, the extract produced 67.05% decrease in the frequency of acetic acid-induced writhing while diclofenac sodium showed decrease by 74.25%. The extract also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased the frequency of castor oil-induced diarrhea in compared to the standard drug of loperamide. Finally, the clot lysis assay with the methanolic extract demonstrated an increase in the thrombolytic activity by 40.79% compared to streptokinase, which increased by 69.52%. Overall, this study shows promise that the methanolic crude extract of LM leaves may contribute to the alternative or additive strategy to modulate conditions of oxidative stress, thrombolytic, inflammation and diarrhea. Further comprehensive investigation is necessary to clarify the exact mechanisms of action and the phytochemical composition of LM leaves.",

This study explores spatial variation and determinants of vitamin A and iron-rich food consumption among children aged 6-23 months. In this study, data from 2528 children from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 was used. BDHS 2022 employed a cross-sectional study design to collect data. The outcomes measured were vitamin A and iron-rich foods consumption within 24 h preceding the survey by including factors such as mother's age, education, occupation, child age, sex, Antenatal care (ANC) visits, medical illness (diarrhea, fever, cough), use of deworming drugs, wealth index, place of residence, division etc. Spatial patterns were analyzed with ArcGIS version 10.8 and associated factors were assessed using multilevel mixed effect logistic regression model. The prevalence of vitamin A and iron-rich foods consumption was 72% (95% CI 0.70-0.74) and 61.8% (95% CI 0.60-0.64) respectively. Clustering of vitamin A (Moran's I: 0.055, p < 0.001) and iron-rich food (I: 0.101, p < 0.001) consumption was observed, with hot spots in Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Khulna. From the mixed effects logistic regression analysis, maternal employment (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.0), maternal education (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.5), paternal education (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.4-3.0), ≥ 4 ANC visits (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.6), older children aged 18-23 months (aOR = 4.0; 95% CI 3.0-5.3), deworming drugs (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.2) and residing in Khulna (aOR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.5-3.5), Rajshahi (aOR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.2-2.9) have shown statistically significant association with increased consumption of vitamin A and iron-rich foods. Furthermore, a lower likelihood of iron-rich food consumption was observed among children having diarrhea (aOR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9), compared to children who didn't have diarrhea. Poor consumption of vitamin A-rich foods was found in Chittagong (aOR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.98) and Sylhet (aOR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.9). The findings revealed significant disparities both in regions and protective factors associated with vitamin A and iron-rich food intake among children in Bangladesh. Understanding these spatial variations and key determinants can guide targeted interventions, particularly in cold spot regions, to improve child nutrition in Bangladesh.",

Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance data were sourced from icddr,b, and meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Regression models adjusted for site and time variations were used for statistical analysis. Proportion of confirmed cholera cases among the diarrhoeal disease surveillance recruits were highest during post-monsoon (coef: 2.53; 95 % CI: 0.41 to 4.67; p = 0.029). V. cholerae log10 concentrations in wastewater were positively associated with pre-monsoon (coef: 0.93; 95 % CI: 0.26 to 1.58; p = 0.010), while SARS-CoV-2 peaked during monsoon (coef: 1.85; 95 % CI: 0.96 to 2.73; p < 0.001).

This study aimed to explore the burden, predictors, and outcomes associated with magnesium imbalances among critically ill patients admitted to critical care settings with diarrheal disease. A retrospective chart analysis was done among critically ill patients with diarrhea aged more than 18 years admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a specialized hospital who had their serum magnesium measured. Data were extracted from an electronic health record system. Serum magnesium levels were measured upon ICU admission. Multivariate multinomial logistic regression analysis was done to find out the associations with clinical variables. There was a higher incidence of hypomagnesemia (34%) than hypermagnesia (5.9%). On multivariate analysis, there were independent associations of hypomagnesemia with sepsis (mOR=6.25, 95% CI: 3.61 to 10.81, p < 0.001), H/O regular medicine intake prior admission (mOR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.18 to 3.18, p = 0.01). On the other hand, hypermagnesemia was independently associated with dehydration (mOR=4.78, p = 0.003, 95% CI: 1.6 to 14.3). Comparing with other electrolyte disorders, hypocalcemia (p < 0.001) was associated with hypomagnesemia. Hypermagnesemia was associated with hypochloremia (p = 0.017), metabolic acidosis (p = 0.014), and hypercalcemia (p = 0.002). The high occurrence of dysmagnesemia in our study highlights the need to closely monitor magnesium in critically ill ICU patients, particularly in resource limited settings. This could help prevent serious complications related to magnesium imbalances. Intensivists should remain alert to magnesium disturbances and conduct thorough patient evaluations.",

        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are major bacterial causes of childhood diarrhea. We explored the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of children aged <5 years associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD), asymptomatic ETEC or EPEC infections, and subsequent impact on growth reflected by z-score. Data from 9,439 MSD and 13,128 asymptomatic children were extracted from Global Enteric Multicenter Study, conducted between 2007 and 2011. Epidemiological risk factors and clinical characteristics of ETEC and EPEC infection were explored using multivariable logistic regression, and a paired t-test was used to investigate the impact of infection on nutritional status. Children aged 12-23 months were more affected by ETEC-positive MSD compared with 0-11 months, whereas children aged 0-11 months were more vulnerable to EPEC-positive MSD. ETEC- and EPEC-positive MSD children showed more characteristics of clinical dehydration like sunken eyes and loss of skin turgor preservation, and needed more intravenous rehydration than ETEC- and EPEC-negative MSD children. Among the other identified co-pathogen, presence of Campylobacter in the analyzed stool sample had higher likelihood to be associated with symptomatic MSD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.17-1.71) and asymptomatic children with ETEC infection (aOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.16-1.73) and asymptomatic EPEC infection (aOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.43). Significant growth faltering was noted in MSD children with ETEC (mean difference 0.22, 95% CI 0.10-0.34) and EPEC (mean difference 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.27) from baseline to ∼60 days (50-90 days).

        "abstract": "Many comparisons of statistical regression and machine learning algorithms to build clinical predictive models use inadequate methods to build regression models and do not have proper independent test sets on which to externally validate the models. Proper comparisons for models of ordinal categorical outcomes do not exist. We set out to compare model discrimination for four regression and machine learning methods in a case study predicting the ordinal outcome of severe, some, or no dehydration among patients with acute diarrhea presenting to a large medical center in Bangladesh using data from the NIRUDAK study derivation and validation cohorts. Proportional Odds Logistic Regression (POLR), penalized ordinal regression (RIDGE), classification trees (CART), and random forest (RF) models were built to predict dehydration severity and compared using three ordinal discrimination indices: ordinal c-index (ORC), generalized c-index (GC), and average dichotomous c-index (ADC). Performance was evaluated on models developed on the training data, on the same models applied to an external test set and through internal validation with three bootstrap algorithms to correct for overoptimism. RF had superior discrimination on the original training data set, but its performance was more similar to the other three methods after internal validation using the bootstrap. Performance for all models was lower on the prospective test dataset, with particularly large reduction for RF and RIDGE. POLR had the best performance in the test dataset and was also most efficient, with the smallest final model size. Clinical prediction models for ordinal outcomes, just like those for binary and continuous outcomes, need to be prospectively validated on external test sets if possible because internal validation may give a too optimistic picture of model performance. Regression methods can perform as well as more automated machine learning methods if constructed with attention to potential nonlinear associations. Because regression models are often more interpretable clinically, their use should be encouraged.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate healthcare utilization and compliance with the WHO treatment guidelines can significantly reduce diarrhea-related childhood mortality and morbidity, while overuse of antibiotics notably increases antibiotic resistance. We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p<0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs 13%; p<0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility. Our findings warrant that reducing unnecessary antibiotic consumption requires increasing public awareness and strengthening laws on the sale of over-the-counter antibiotics.",

Currently, the G6P[1]-type rotaviruses are prevalent in sheep or goat in Bangladesh, Turkey, and Uganda. However, this genotype has not been reported in Chinese sheep or goat. Therefore, 12 anal swabs were collected from diarrheal sheep in Gansu Province, China, in 2023 and tested for rotavirus using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pathological sections and immunohistochemistry were used to observe pathological changes and rotavirus antigens in the duodenum, respectively. The sheep rotavirus was isolated in MA-104 cells and characterized through indirect immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. The genes of the strain were obtained using the next-generation sequencing technology and analyzed phylogenetically. One sheep was positive for rotavirus by RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry revealed numerous rotavirus antigens in the apical portion of the duodenal villi. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the strain was characterized by virus particles that were \"wheel-shaped\" and measured 70-80 nm in size. The gene constellations of this strain is G6-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3. BLASTn and phylogenetic tree analyses suggest that this strain is likely a recombinant of human rotavirus, goat rotavirus, and bovine rotavirus. The comparison of amino acid similarities revealed three differences in the key antigenic epitopes of the VP7 and VP4 proteins between the GO34 strain and this study strain despite the identical gene constellations of the two strains. To date, this is the first report of this constellation of RVA being found in sheep.",

        "abstract": "Cinnamomum tamala belongs to the Lauraceae family, which has diverse traditional and pharmacological roles for treating toothache, diarrhea, gastrointestinal disorders, vomiting, fever, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and others. This research aims to evaluate its protective effects against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. For this, ethanolic leaf extract of C. tamala (ECT) at different doses was administered via oral gavage with or without the standard hepatoprotective drug silymarin, and liver biochemical and histopathological profiles were checked. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and molecular docking studies were performed to check the possible molecular mechanisms behind its hepatoprotective effect. Results suggest that ECT significantly enhances antioxidant capability with lower animal N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine metabolites. The histopathological slides showed minimum inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltrations, and vascular edematous congestion for the ECT individual and co-administration groups. Computational drug discovery approaches validated these results, and the identified compounds from the GC-MS study were subjected to molecular docking, with the top docking score found against the CYP2E1 protein. In molecular dynamics simulation, 1,3-dioxolane, 2-pentadecyl, and butyl 14-methylhexadecanoate showed more root mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation values than silymarin. In conclusion, ECT and its key compounds, butyl 14-methylhexadecanoate (CID 91693030) and 1,3-dioxolane, 2-pentadecyl (CID 552019), may potentially act against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in animals.",

This research aimed to investigate the phytochemicals and potential bioactivities, such as antimicrobial, thrombolytic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antidiarrheal properties of commonly available mandarin orange (<i>Citrus reticulata</i> Blanco) peel through experimental and computational techniques. Extensive chromatographic and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopic analysis was employed to isolate four purified compounds, which were characterized as tangeretin (A), nobiletin (B), limonin (C), and β-sitosterol (D). Furthermore, GC-MS/MS analysis detected over 90 compounds with a notable number of polymethoxyflavones, including nobiletin (29.04%), tangeretin (15.55%), artemetin (8.1%), 6-demethoxytangeretin (1.28%), sinensetin (0.95%), demethylnobiletin (0.14%), pebrellin (0.10%), and salvigenin (0.04%). Dichloromethane soluble fraction (DCMSF) exerted the highest antimicrobial potency <i>Candia albicans</i> against (20 mm zone of inhibition) in the disk diffusion assay method. The aqueous soluble fraction (AQSF) exhibited 34.71% and 48.14% inhibition in hypotonic solution-induced and heat-induced hemolysis in the membrane stabilizing assay. Similarly, the AQSF exhibited the highest anti-thrombotic property with 32.57% clot lysis. The investigated 3 doses of the methanolic extracts (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight) exerted statistically significant <i>in vivo</i> central analgesic effects in a tail-flicking method in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, all the doses exhibited significant efficacy in inhibiting acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing and castor oil-induced diarrheal episodes in mouse models. The molecular docking studies corroborated the existing in vitro and in vivo findings by demonstrating better or comparable binding affinities toward the respective receptors and favorable pharmacokinetic properties and toxicological profiles. The present findings indicate that <i>C. reticulata</i> is a rich source of polymethoxyflavones, demonstrating potential efficacy against microbial infections, thrombosis, inflammation, pain, and diarrhea.

Here, we intended to measure the possible association of these pathotypes with EED biomarkers and nutritional status of adults residing in a slum in Bangladesh. Fecal samples were collected from 524 malnourished adults (BMI ≤18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) living in a slum-setting in Dhaka from March 2016 to September 2019 and analyzed by TaqMan Array Card assays to evaluate the presence of E. coli pathotypes and other entero-pathogens. The multivariable linear regression model was used to assess the association. In these malnourished adults, the most prevalent pathotype of E. coli was EAEC (61.7%) and the least prevalent was STEC (6.7%). The prevalence of atypical EPEC, ETEC and Shigella/EIEC were 52%, 48.9% and 45.1% respectively. The infection with atypical EPEC had significant positive association with levels of Myeloperoxidase (b = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.11, 0.65; p-value = 0.006). Similarly, a significantly higher concentration of alpha-1-antitrypsin (b = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.22; p-value = 0.011) was found in the STEC-infected adults. However, no notable association was found between the <i>E. coli</i> pathotypes and nutritional status of these adult participants. Moreover, <i>Plesiomonas</i> infected adults were more likely to be infected with EAEC (p-value = 0.017), ETEC (p-value <0.001) and STEC (pvalue = 0.002). Significant coinfection was also detected among the pathotypes and other entero-pathogens such as <i>Giardia</i>, <i>Ascaris</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</i>, and <i>Adenovirus</i>. The study results imply that there is an influence of particular <i>E. coli</i> pathotypes (EPEC and STEC) on intestinal inflammation and gut permeability of the malnourished Bangladeshi adults, but no association with nutritional status is found.

This study aimed to identify and evaluate the probiotic and anti-diarrheal potential of Enterococcus faecium WFD-128, isolated from fermented yogurt, through in vitro, in silico, and in vivo approaches. The bacterium showed notable antibacterial activity, with inhibition zones measuring 21 mm and 19 mm against Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei, respectively. Additionally, it exhibited anti-biofilm effectiveness of 82 % and 80 % against these pathogens. It exhibited resistance to Amoxicillin, intermediate sensitivity to Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol, and tolerance to bile salts over 3-48h, and to acidic pH levels ranging from 2 to 8. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 68 volatile compounds, of which [1,1'-Bicyclohexyl]-4-carboxylic acid, 4'-propyl-, 4-fluorophenyl ester (-8.5) and Cholest-4-en-26-oic acid, 3-oxo-, methyl ester (-7.9) showed strong binding affinities to the diarrheal protein T3SS of Shigella sonnei (PDB: 6WRY) in molecular docking studies. These compounds exhibited favorable pharmaceutical properties in ADMET analysis, further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. In vivo experiments with albino mice validated the bacterium's therapeutic potential. Histopathological analysis revealed significant recovery of diarrhea-affected organs, including the kidney, liver, intestine, and spleen, following treatment with E. faecium. This aligns with in vitro and in silico findings, demonstrating the bacterium's therapeutic effectiveness. This study highlights the promise of E. faecium as a probiotic-based treatment against bacteria-induced diarrhea, offering a strong foundation for the development of innovative anti-diarrheal therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "The burden of childhood diarrhoea remains one of the most important public health problems in countries like Bangladesh, which can be reduced by effective preventive measures. We aimed to investigate the trends in preventive measures practised among under five children with diarrhoea over the last 12 years. Data was extracted from the Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance System at Dhaka Hospital for the period 2012-2023. STATA 15 was used for analysis. We used the Joncheere-Terpstra trend test to examine the trend in preventive measures against diarrhoea and the slope index of inequality (SII) to determine their association with the wealth index. Among 20 373 participants, 61.0% were male, with a median (IQR) age of 11 months (8.0-16.0). Most (88.3%) had access to sanitary latrines, and 40.3% of households consumed boiled or filtered water. We found that 50.3% children aged 6-59 months received vitamin A, and 88.4% of children >9 months had measles vaccination. Breastfeeding practices were observed in 17.8% of the children. Significant upward trends were observed for sanitary latrine use and measles vaccination (p<0.001). Receiving vitamin A supplementation and boiled/filtered water consumption showed a declining trend (p<0.001). Parental education and maternal media exposure were found to be significantly associated with the preventive measures (p<0.05). The wealth index showed a significant association with vitamin A supplementation (p<0.01). However, SII does not indicate inequality between the groups. We found that children from wealthier quintile families had a significantly higher rate of measles immunisation, as indicated by the SII (p value=0.039). Improving practices of preventive measures can significantly reduce diarrhoeal diseases among children under five. Emphasis should be placed on vitamin A supplementation and the consumption of boiled or filtered water.

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of liver cirrhosis worldwide. While hepatic complications are well-documented, extra-hepatic manifestations such as secondary amyloidosis are less common and can lead to diverse and complex clinical outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic hepatitis B who progressed to liver cirrhosis and presented with chronic, unexplained, intractable diarrhea unresponsive to standard treatments. He also experienced significant unintentional weight loss and generalized weakness. Further investigations revealed amyloid deposition in the duodenum, confirming secondary amyloidosis affecting the gastrointestinal tract as the cause of malabsorption. Persistent diarrhea and malabsorption necessitated nutritional support and symptomatic management. This case highlights the rare association between chronic liver disease (CLD), secondary amyloidosis, and malabsorption syndrome, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial to managing these complex cases, improving outcomes, and preventing further complications.",

        "title": "Clinical spectrum and risk factors of severe dengue infection: findings from the 2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Since the first detection of dengue in 2000, Bangladesh has been facing an increasing number of dengue patients and related deaths every year. This situation warrants the importance of quickly identifying severe dengue patients to expedite necessary medical interventions which could potentially reduce the adverse consequences. The aim of this study was to identify clinical features and laboratory parameters of the severe dengue patients in the 2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. This hospital based cross-sectional study included the demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 1313 Dengue patients from several secondary and tertiary hospitals across Bangladesh from August 2023 to December 2023. According to the 2009 WHO classification, dengue cases were classified into severe dengue and non-severe dengue (with and without warning signs). Chi-square test, Fischer's exact test and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify potential risk factors associated with severe dengue cases. Of the 1313 patients included in this study, nearly 20% had severe dengue, 36.71% of them were from the 16-25 year age bracket and nearly two-thirds were male. Fever (99.54%) was the most common clinical symptom followed by anorexia (69.54%) and severe headache (66.03%); whereas most common warning signs were severe lethargy (43.64%), persistent vomiting (27.57%), and severe abdominal pain and tenderness (20.03%) across all patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are significantly more common in severe dengue cases compared to non-severe ones. Among the laboratory parameters, decrease of platelet level and increased ALT level was more prominent in severe patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that severe abdominal pain, severe lethargy, respiratory distress, altered mental status, decreased urine output, pleural effusion and ascites were positively associated with the development of severe dengue. This study presents warning signs, clinical symptoms and trends of laboratory parameters associated with severe cases of dengue in Bangladesh that can be used in improving patient management in the future.",

        "abstract": "The exponential increase in obesity is responsible for the increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Weight loss is critical to improvement in OSA. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonism-based therapies (GLP1RA-BT) have been associated with significant weight loss. Several randomized controlled trials have been published evaluating the use of GLP1RA-BT on OSA. However, the literature review revealed that no systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) has been published evaluating the efficacy and safety of GLP1RA-BT in OSA. Electronic databases were searched for studies documenting the use of GLP1RA-BT in OSA. The primary outcome was to evaluate the impact on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the impact on percent change in AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Score, body weight, blood pressure, and side-effect profile. From initially screened 59 articles, data from 4 articles having 5 different randomized cohorts (937 patients) were analysed in this SRM. Use of GLP1RA-BT was associated with a significant reduction in AHI [MD-12.50 events/ hour (95% CI:-17.33 - -7.67); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup>=95%], percent-reduction in AHI [MD-52.17% (95% CI: -64.49 - -39.85); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], percent-reduction in body-weight [MD-12.46% (95% CI:-22.54 - -2.39); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99%] and systolic blood-pressure [MD -4.59 mm of Hg (95% CI:-6.61 - -2.58); P < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 67%]. The considerable heterogeneity was because of greater improvement in outcomes withtirzepatide compared to liraglutide. The occurrence of nausea [RR4.23 (95% CI: 2.73-6.55); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], vomiting [RR4.22 (95% CI: 2.12-8.41); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], diarrhoea [RR2.81 (95% CI: 1.84-4.31); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], and constipation [RR4.51 (95% CI: 2.47-8.26); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%] were significantly higher with GLP1RA-BT compared to placebo. This SRM provides encouraging data on the use of GLP1RA-BT in improving different respiratory aspects of OSA and reducing body weight and blood pressure.",

The sensitivity of widely used rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) varies due to factors like viral load, serotypes, secondary infections, and disease severity. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of RDTs compared to RT-PCR, identifying key factors affecting sensitivity. The study at Dhaka Medical College (DMC) involved 683 suspected dengue cases. Blood samples and metadata were collected, and RDTs (NS1, IgG, IgM) were performed on-site. Samples were analyzed at icddr,b using RT-PCR for viral RNA detection and serotyping. Diagnostic performance was assessed using MedCalc, while metadata and sensitivity differences were analyzed with SPSS. We found that vomiting was the most common symptom, followed by, diarrhea, restlessness, and abdominal tenderness. RDT sensitivity was highest in cases with high viral loads, reaching 94 % within 1-3 days of symptom onset and 82 % beyond three days. Moderate viral loads showed sensitivities of 70 % for NS1+IgM and 84 % for NS1+IgM+IgG within three days, decreasing thereafter. Sensitivity was low in low viral load cases but improved after three days with IgG incorporation. DENV-3 and secondary infections showed higher false-negative rates. The study emphasizes the importance of early testing in suspected dengue cases with symptoms like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal tenderness, offering critical insights to enhance diagnostics, patient care, and disease control.",

        "abstract": "Waste collectors face multi-faceted health risks including exposure to musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory diseases, and workplace injuries because of their hazardous work environment. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors that affect health of the waste collectors across Bangladesh. Data on a cross-sectional survey obtained information from 481 waste collectors about their demographics, housing conditions, hygiene practices, security measures, and disease prevalence. Descriptive analyses and multi-level models are used. As per univariate analysis, 81.3% did not have access to clean water, 58.4% did not have access to sanitation, and 65.9% of people lived in unhealthy housing. According to bivariate analysis, there is an association between unhealthy working conditions i.e., respiratory illnesses (19.1% asthma, 29.7% cough), gastrointestinal issues (59.3% discomfort, 24.1% diarrhea), musculoskeletal disorders, and dermatological diseases, and unsafe working conditions (i.e., 60% no masks, 71% no gloves, and 75% no boots). Considering geographic clustering, multi-level modeling examined how different factors affected particular illnesses. The following were significant protective factors: better housing (80% lower odds of acute irritation), security measures (50% lower odds of gastrointestinal diseases), good hygiene (62% lower odds of dermatological diseases), and younger age (2% higher odds of respiratory diseases per year). In summary, unsafe living and working conditions greatly push the risks of illness for waste collectors. These risks to occupational health can be reduced with targeted interventions that enhance housing, hygiene, security protocols, and working conditions.",

        "abstract": "The Ganges delta of the Bay of Bengal is a recognized hotspot for the emergence and spread of novel variants of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Despite being a diverse species, very little information is available concerning environmental and human-associated aspects of <i>V. cholerae</i> serogroups, other than the two major epidemic-related serogroups O1 and O139. This represents a crucial gap in understanding the spectrum of diversity, ecology, and epidemiology of the species influencing the dynamics of global cholera. In this study, we describe an emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i> displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in coastal Bangladesh where cholera has been endemic for centuries. This outbreak coincides with a rise in cases of cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O1, as well as frequency of isolation of serogroups O47 and O1 from the environment. The <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 isolates proved clonal in nature, and their genome biology revealed distinct features, with respect to multidrug resistance (MDR), serogroup-specific genes, genomic island combinations, and overall phylogenetic properties. Genome comparison confirmed the absence of canonical virulence factors of <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 and O139, namely, cholera toxin (CTX) and toxin-co-regulated pili (TCP), and the presence of putative virulence factors including type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and an MDR pseudo-compound transposon, carrying genes for macrolide resistance and extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Results of the study suggest that <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 could represent an emerging <i>Vibrio</i> pathogen with the potential to spread virulence and antimicrobial resistance traits impacting the management of cholera-like diseases.IMPORTANCEDespite the global insurgence of human diseases caused by Vibrios in recent years, most research focuses only on the O1 serogroup of <i>V. cholerae</i>, leaving a significant gap concerning the environmental and human-associated aspects of other serogroups found in nature. Although other serogroups are often found associated with sporadic diarrhea cases, in 1992-1993, a massive cholera-like diarrhea epidemic was initiated by a \"non-O1\" serogroup, namely, O139 that temporally displaced O1 from endemic cholera in the Bay of Bengal villages of Bangladesh and India, highlighting the potential threat they might pose. This study describes yet another emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i>, displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in a coastal locality in Bangladesh. Findings of the study offer critical insights into the genome biology of <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 and its potential implications for understanding their ecology and epidemiology of cholera-like diseases.",

        "abstract": "Most child deaths can be averted through prompt and appropriate treatment of child illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria. However, research has suggested that increases in care seeking do not necessarily mean that quality care is being received. We assessed the service readiness and process quality of curative healthcare during childhood and determined whether children are receiving health services with sufficient quality across countries. We linked data from household surveys including the standard Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to data from facility surveys including the Service Provision Assessment and Health Facility Assessment in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania to estimate the effective coverage of child illness treatment. We assessed the gaps in service availability and coverage, lack of service readiness, missed care opportunities, and inadequate service process, where service readiness and process quality were defined according to global standards with country-specific adaptations. We analysed the service readiness, quality of care, and effective coverage by individual illness and combined illnesses accounting for equity dimensions. Seven to 42% of children experienced at least one illness. An integrated management of child illnesses (IMCI) service was available in 58-85% of facilities. We found that 55-66% of health facilities in the countries were ready to deliver treatment to sick children. However, the readiness-adjusted contact suggested that child healthcare was mostly sought in facilities with low readiness score, ranging from 15% (Nepal) to 46.0% (Malawi). Health facilities had low diagnostics, supervision, and trained personnel capacity to manage child illnesses. Concerning the quality of care, only 51-60% of the procedures during clinical encounters were in line with standards. Counselling of caretakers had the lowest score, while treatment components had the highest process quality score. Hospitals had higher readiness and process quality scores compared to primary facilities and the private sector. There were, however, large gaps in service readiness and significant inadequate service processes in all countries; 35% (Haiti) to 79% (Bangladesh) of sick children sought care from a health facility, with only 7% (Nepal) to 29% (Malawi) of them actually receiving appropriate treatment. We found large inequalities in care seeking, quality of care, and effective coverage across levels of education and poverty, and places of residence. A large proportion of facilities did not meet the required capacity to provide IMCI services. The provision of health services has major quality gaps, highlighting the need for strengthening health service access, capacity and quality of care to reach universal child health coverage.",

Immune activation by eosinophils is thought to be one of the important mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia. The study aimed to evaluate the association of gastric eosinophilia with functional dyspepsia. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology, Sir Salimullah Medical College Mitford Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh from July 2019 to June 2020. Forty-six (46) adult patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by Rome-III criteria were enrolled. Forty patients not fulfilling the criteria of functional dyspepsia and also patients attending the department for endoscopy (evaluation of anemia, pre-ERCP screening, evaluation of chronic diarrhea, etc.) and having normal endoscopic features subsequently were taken as comparison group. After endoscopy, a biopsy was taken from the gastric body and antrum of each participant. Counting of eosinophil and histopathology was done by an expert senior histopathologist. It was expressed in per HPF. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS 22.0 and p<0.05 was set as statistically significant. Mean±SD age was 40.34±16.22 and 40.15±13.96 in functional dyspepsia patients and patients taken for comparison respectively. Females were slightly predominant with a female-male ratio of 1.2:1. Lower middle-class families were found to be the most vulnerable group suffering from functional dyspepsia. The mean eosinophil count of gastric body and antrum in functional dyspepsia patients was higher than that of the comparison group. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001). A statistically significant relation was found between gastric eosinophilia (p=0.015, 0.016) with functional dyspepsia (p<0.001). Eosinophil count of gastric mucosa was significantly higher in functional dyspepsia patients and had an association with it.

        "abstract": "Shigellosis is a leading cause of diarrhoea in children globally. We aimed to assess the burden of specific Shigella species and Shigella flexneri serotypes, characterise their clinical syndromes and natural immunity, and evaluate their relevance as causes of diarrhoea and linear growth faltering. In the MAL-ED birth cohort study, children younger than 17 days were enrolled from Nov 3, 2009, to Feb 29, 2012, in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Tanzania, and South Africa and were followed up for 2 years. In this retrospective substudy, we retested Shigella quantitative PCR-positive diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal stool samples with molecular subtyping assays. We estimated the prevalence of specific Shigella species and serotypes, estimated their associations with diarrhoea and clinical characteristics using generalised linear mixed models, estimated their associations with linear growth using linear regression, and used longitudinal infection data to estimate protection due to previous infection using the Andersen and Gill extension of the Cox model. 1715 children (874 [51·0%] male and 841 [49·0%] female) with complete follow-up to 2 years provided 45 835 stool samples collected between age 0 and 2 years. 1294 (75·5%) children had at least one Shigella detection in a non-diarrhoeal or asymptomatic stool and 507 (29·6%) had at least one Shigella-attributed diarrhoea episode. In this substudy, we were able to type 1202 samples. The most common species and serotypes were Shigella sonnei (366 [30·4%] of 1202), S flexneri 2a (250 [20·8%]), and S flexneri 6 (296 [24·6%]). The associations of S flexneri and S sonnei detection with diarrhoea versus asymptomatic control stools were similar. Compared with diarrhoea episodes attributable to S flexneri, those attributable to S sonnei were less likely to be bloody (prevalence ratio 0·36 [95% CI 0·23 to 0·56]) or severe (prevalence ratio 0·58 [0·35 to 0·96]). The associations between asymptomatic Shigella infections and impaired linear growth at age 2 years were stronger for S flexneri than S sonnei (S flexneri length-for-age Z score difference -0·18 [95% CI -0·29 to -0·07] and S sonnei length-for-age Z score difference -0·07 [-0·21 to 0·07]). Examination of longitudinal infections showed that previous S sonnei infection was associated with a lower hazard of subsequent S sonnei diarrhoea (calibrated hazard ratio 0·41 [95% CI 0·19 to 0·90]). Otherwise, evidence for homotypic or heterotypic natural immunity was not apparent. This study provides data on prevailing Shigella species and serotypes in settings with a high burden of disease, underscoring the importance of asymptomatic S flexneri infection on growth impairment and the severity of S flexneri diarrhoea. Upcoming Shigella vaccines might need to induce immune responses that improve upon those produced by natural infection. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "Low-cost, household-level water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and nutrition interventions can reduce pediatric antibiotic use, but the mechanism through which interventions reduce antibiotic use has not been investigated. We conducted a causal mediation analysis using data collected between September 2013 and October 2015 from a cohort nested within the WASH Benefits Bangladesh cluster-randomized trial (NCT01590095). Among a subsample of children within the WASH, nutrition, nutrition + WASH, and control arms (N = 1409 children; 267 clusters), we recorded caregiver-reported antibiotic use at ages 14 and 28 months and collected stool at age 14 months. Our primary outcome was any caregiver-reported antibiotic use by index children within the past 30 or 90 days measured at age 14 and 28 months. Mediators included caregiver-reported child diarrhea, acute respiratory infection (ARI), and fever; and enteric pathogen carriage in stool measured by qPCR. Both intervention-mediator and mediator-outcome models were controlled for mediator-outcome confounders. The receipt of any WASH or nutrition intervention reduced caregiver-reported antibiotic use through all pathways in the past month by 5.5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2, 9.9), from 49.5% (95% CI 45.9%, 53.0%) in the control group to 45.0% (95% CI 42.7%, 47.2%) in the pooled intervention group. When separating this effect into different pathways, we found that interventions reduced antibiotic use by 0.6 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.3) through reduced diarrhea, 0.7 percentage points (95% CI 0.1, 1.5) through reduced ARI with fever, and 1.5 percentage points (95% CI 0.4, 3.0) through reduced prevalence of enteric viruses. Interventions reduced antibiotic use through any of these measured mediators by 2.1 percentage points (95% CI -0.3, 4.5). WASH and nutrition interventions reduced pediatric antibiotic use through the prevention of enteric and respiratory infections in a rural, low-income population. Given that many of these infections are caused by viruses or parasites, WASH and nutrition interventions may help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in similar settings.

        "title": "Understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh using systematic review and government data repository.",
        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Typhoid fever remains a significant public health challenge, especially in developing countries where diagnostic resources are limited. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease containment. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This study aims to develop a lightweight machine learning-based diagnostic tool for the early and efficient detection of typhoid fever using clinical data. <b>Methods:</b> A custom dataset comprising 14 clinical and demographic parameters-including age, gender, headache, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, cough, fever range (°F), hemoglobin (g/dL), platelet count, urine culture bacteria, calcium (mg/dL), and potassium (mg/dL)-was analyzed. A machine learning metamodel, integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Decision Tree classifiers with a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), was trained and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). <b>Results:</b> The proposed metamodel demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, achieving a precision of 99%, recall of 100%, and an AUC of 1.00. It outperformed traditional diagnostic methods and other standalone machine learning algorithms, offering high accuracy and generalizability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The lightweight machine learning metamodel provides a cost-effective, non-invasive, and rapid diagnostic alternative for typhoid fever, particularly suited for resource-limited settings. Its reliance on accessible clinical parameters ensures practical applicability and scalability, potentially improving patient outcomes and aiding in disease control. Future work will focus on broader validation and integration into clinical workflows to further enhance its utility.",

        "title": "Clinical characterisation, treatment outcomes, and case fatality risk of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves. We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves. Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99). Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Early life soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and diarrhoea are associated with growth faltering, anaemia, impaired child development and mortality. Exposure to faecally contaminated soil inside the home may be a key contributor to enteric infections, and a large fraction of rural homes in low-income countries have soil floors. The objective of this study is to measure the effect of installing concrete floors in homes with soil floors on child STH infection and other maternal and child health outcomes in rural Bangladesh. The Cement-based flooRs AnD chiLd hEalth trial is an individually randomised trial in Sirajganj and Tangail districts, Bangladesh. Households with a pregnant woman, a soil floor, walls that are not made of mud and no plan to relocate for 3 years will be eligible. We will randomise 800 households to intervention or control (1:1) within geographical blocks of 10 households to account for strong geographical clustering of enteric infection. Laboratory staff and data analysts will be blinded; participants will be unblinded. We will instal concrete floors when the birth cohort is in utero and measure outcomes at child ages 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome is prevalence of any STH infection (<i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, <i>Necator americanus</i> or <i>Trichuris trichiura</i>) detected by quantitative PCR at 6, 12, 18 or 24 months follow-up in the birth cohort. Secondary outcomes include household floor and child hand contamination with <i>Escherichia coli</i>, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing <i>E. coli</i> and STH DNA; child diarrhoea, growth and cognitive development; and maternal stress and depression. Study protocols have been approved by institutional review boards at Stanford University and the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "The Cholera-Hospital-based-Intervention-for-7-Days (CHoBI7) mobile health (mHealth) program is a targeted water treatment and hygiene (WASH) program for the household members of diarrhea patients, initiated in the healthcare facility with a single in-person visit and reinforced through weekly voice and text messages for 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial of the CHoBI7 mHealth program in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, found that this intervention significantly increased WASH behaviors and reduced diarrhea prevalence. The objective of this present study was to conduct formative research using an implementation science framework to adapt the CHoBI7 mHealth program for scalable implementation in rural Bangladesh, and to promote construction of self-made handwashing stations (CHoBI7 Scale-up program). We conducted a 3-month multi-phase pilot with 275 recipients and 25 semi-structured interviews, 10 intervention planning workshops, and 2 focus group discussions with intervention recipients and program implementers. High appropriateness, acceptability, and adoption of the CHoBI7 Scale-up program was observed, with most recipients constructing self-made handwashing stations (90%) and chlorinating drinking water (63%) and 50% of participants observed handwashing with soap in the final pilot phase. At the recipient level, facilitators included weekly voice and text messages with videos on handwashing station construction, which served as reminders for the promoted water treatment and hand hygiene behaviors. Barriers included perceptions that self-made iron filters commonly used in households also removed microbial contamination from water and therefore chlorine treatment was not needed, and mobile messages not always being shared among household members. At the implementer level, facilitators for program implementation included follow-up phone calls to household members not present at the healthcare facility at the time of intervention delivery, and the promotion of multiple self-made handwashing station designs. Barriers included high patient volume in healthcare facilities, as well as the high iron in groundwater in the area that reduced chlorination effectiveness. These findings provide valuable evidence for adapting the CHoBI7 mHealth program for a rural setting, with a lower-cost, scalable design, and demonstrated the important role of formative research for tailoring WASH programs to new contexts.",

        "abstract": "Shigellosis is the second leading cause of diarrhoeal deaths among children worldwide. Oral azithromycin and intravenous ceftriaxone are the recommended first-line and second-line therapies for shigellosis in Bangladesh, respectively, but growing antibiotic resistance will require new antibiotic options. Tebipenem pivoxil, an orally administered carbapenem antibiotic with activity against many strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, may be a viable option. A phase IIb randomised controlled trial was planned to determine the efficacy and safety of oral tebipenem pivoxil, compared with intravenous ceftriaxone, for children with <i>Shigella</i> diarrhoea unresponsive to the first-line antibiotic therapy. We will enrol 132 children in the trial (66 in each arm). Children from Bangladesh aged 24-59 months suspected of having <i>Shigella</i> diarrhoea, with no clinical improvement within 48 hours of starting first-line therapy, will be randomised to a 3-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg, once a day) or a 3-day course of oral tebipenem pivoxil (4 mg/kg, three times a day). The children will be evaluated for key clinical, microbiological and safety outcomes during the subsequent 30-day period. Clinically, failure at day 3 will be defined as the presence of fever (axillary temperature ≥38°C), diarrhoea (three or more abnormally loose or watery stools in the last 24 hours), blood in stool, or abdominal pain/tenderness at day 3 of follow-up or death or hospitalisation prior to day 3. It is hypothesised that children treated with tebipenem pivoxil will have no worse clinical and microbiological failure rates compared with ceftriaxone. This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, which comprises a research review committee and an ethics review committee.

We aimed to examine the influence of hepcidin on the effects of supplementation with iron syrup and multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) on hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations and the incidence of diarrhea in young children. Participants included a subsample of 1281 8-mo-old children enrolled in a 3-arm, double-blind, double-dummy, individually randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of 3 mo of universal supplementation with daily iron syrup (12.5 mg iron), MNPs (containing 12.5 mg iron), or placebo in children living in Bangladesh. In all participants at baseline, immediately postintervention (month 3), and after a further 9 mo of follow-up (month 12), serum hepcidin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, venous hemoglobin by HemoCue 301, and incidence of diarrhea by caregiver report. We used a likelihood-based longitudinal data analysis model to examine effect modification from baseline hepcidin on the effects of iron syrup or MNPs on hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations and a log-binomial model on the incidence of diarrhea at months 3 and 12. Hepcidin modified the effect of MNPs, but not iron syrup, compared with placebo on hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations immediately postintervention. The treatment effect of MNPs compared with placebo in the change from baseline to month 3 was larger among children with low compared with not-low baseline hepcidin [hemoglobin: mean difference 11.6 g/L (7.2, 15.9) compared with 4.3 (3.09, 5.7), P-interaction = 0.002; ferritin: geometric mean ratio 2.4 (1.6, 3.6) compared with 1.5 (1.3, 1.7), P-interaction = 0.024]. This effect modification was not sustained at month 12. Hepcidin did not modify the effects of either intervention on the incidence of diarrhea. Immediate effects of MNPs on child hemoglobin and iron status are larger among those with low compared with not-low hepcidin, indicating that preintervention screening could help identify those who would benefit most from MNPs.

Antimicrobial resistance complicates shigellosis management. Understanding local disease epidemiology is crucial for developing effective preventive strategies, including vaccine use. We investigated antimicrobial resistance, risk factors (socioeconomic, behavioral, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), and clinical characteristics of <i>Shigella</i> diarrhea in Mukuru informal settlement and surrounding villages in Nairobi, Kenya. Patients presenting with diarrhea, fever, or both in treatment centers had stool or rectal swab samples cultured, and bacteria was identified through biochemical and serologic tests.

        "abstract": "One-third of all child deaths in this country are caused by diarrhea. The burden of the disease appears to be increasing in recent years in Bangladesh. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of diarrhea and identify the factors contributing to diarrheal diseases among children aged 0-5 years in Bangladesh from 2006 to 2019, to understand the recent increase in this serious health issue. In this study, using the data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), a total of 31,566, 23,402, and 24,686 children under five were included from, 2006, 2012, and 2019, respectively. Logistic regressions were applied to analyze the changes in factors influencing childhood diarrhea. The results revealed a decline in diarrhea prevalence from MICS 2006 (7.1%) to MICS 2012 (3.9%). However, there was a sharp increase to 6.9% in MICS 2019. Notably, children aged 12-23 months exhibited consistently 2.22 times (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI: 1.86-2.65), 5.24 times (CI: 2.51-10.95) and 3.36 times (CI: 2.67-4.22) higher likelihood of experiencing diarrhea compared to the older age group (48-59 months) in MICS 2006, 2012 and 2019, respectively. The mother's educational background also played a role, in MICS 2006, 2012, and 2019, children whose mothers had no or incomplete primary education had 1.48 (CI: 1.18-1.86), 1.07 (CI: 0.76-1.50), and 1.34 (CI: 1.06-1.69) times higher chances of diarrhea compared to children of mothers with secondary complete or higher education. Underweight status, geographical division, household wealth status, and unimproved and shared toilet facilities emerged as contributing factors of diarrhea among children aged 0-5 years. The findings underscore the importance of child nutrition, basic hygiene practices, and special care during the rainy season to mitigate the under-five mortality rate associated with diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of published data on growth among children with severe diarrhoea requiring readmission during post-discharge follow-up, we aimed to investigate the potential impact of post-discharge readmission at day-90 follow-up on growth in diarrheal children aged 2-23 months. We performed a secondary analysis using Bangladesh site data from the Antibiotic for Children with Diarrhea (ABCD) trial, a multi-country, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from July 2017 to July 2019. Children aged 2-23 months who had severe diarrhoea defined as having acute diarrhoea with some/severe dehydration, or severe stunting, or moderate wasting, were admitted to the facility. In this analysis, we classified children who were re-hospitalised within a 90-day post-discharge follow-up period as cases and randomly selected controls who did not require re-hospitalisation, matching them by similar ages and sexes in a 1:3 ratio. We gathered anthropometric data on enrolment and day 90 follow-up. The outcome variables were changes in nutritional indicators height-for-age (ΔHAZ), weight-for-age (ΔWAZ), weight-for-height (ΔWHZ), and mid-upper arm circumference (ΔMUAC). We assessed for growth changes at day 90 post-discharge follow-up using multivariate linear regression. Among 1431 diarrhoeal children enrolled, we identified 145 cases and 435 controls. In terms of the baseline admission characteristics, the cases were less likely to be immunised (81% vs. 72%; P = 0.031), vomit (11% vs. 22%; P = 0.001), and have dehydrating diarrhoea (26% vs. 36%; P = 0.026) than the controls. After adjusting for potential covariates, the cases had a significant reduction in growth than the controls at 90 days of post-discharge follow-up, according to anthropometric indices: ΔHAZ (β = -0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.21, -0.01; P = 0.029), ΔWAZ (β = -0.24; 95% CI = -0.35, -0.14; P < 0.001), ΔWHZ (β = -0.25; 95% CI = -0.39, -0.12; P < 0.001), and ΔMUAC (for children 6-23 months, β = -0.17; 95% CI = -0.29, -0.04; P = 0.011). Diarrhoeal children aged 2-23 months requiring readmission during the 90-day post-discharge follow-up period had a significant deterioration of ponderal and linear growth, compared with those who did not require readmission. This finding underscores the importance of early identification of children with risks of post-discharge readmission and designing a package of post-discharge trials, including social and nutritional interventions that may help to reduce post-discharge readmissions as well as subsequent growth faltering.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium spp. is a cause of diarrhea morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age. In addition, asymptomatic infections can have a negative impact on growth and development. In low- and middle-income countries where a greater number of infants may be malnourished, the results of treating cryptosporidiosis with the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) have been inconsistent. Malnutrition is both a risk factor for cryptosporidiosis and a consequence of infection with this parasite. Treatment with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has been shown to assist in nutritional recovery and the restoration of gut health. In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we examined whether combined probiotic and NTZ treatment could result in the reduction in parasitemia and infection-associated growth stunting in undernourished children. Cryptosporidium spp.-positive Bangladeshi children with a weight-for-length Z score between -1 and -3 were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 (n = 26) received NTZ and Lactobacillus, group 2 (n = 28) received NTZ along with a placebo, and the third control group (n = 10) received standard care. There was no difference in the duration of infection or improvement in child anthropometric measurements in any treatment group compared with control. Therefore, this pilot study does not provide support for treatment with NTZ, Lactobacillus, or the two in combination as an effective means of reducing the duration of Cryptosporidium spp. infection or improving growth in growth-stunted children.",

        "abstract": "Oral zinc is a proven effective treatment for diarrheal illness, and long-term monitoring is key to evaluating the success of efforts to scale up zinc treatment. We examine zinc coverage for diarrheal illness in Bangladesh since the conclusion of the Scaling Up Zinc for Young Children (SUZY) project in 2008 and provide an overview of other countries' zinc scale-up programs to compare the long-term effectiveness of SUZY. We used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys from 2005-2022 to examine the proportion of children under five receiving zinc treatment for diarrheal illness and evaluate disparities in zinc coverage by urbanicity and wealth quintile. We used a qualitative framework synthesis to compare the SUZY project with national or large-scale zinc scale-up programs in other low- and middle-income countries (Ghana, India, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Uganda). This method for synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data was used to break down components of the SUZY project and other national or large-scale zinc scale-up programs. In Bangladesh, zinc coverage has continued to increase since the conclusion of the SUZY project, disparities in coverage between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles have been resolved, and the prevalence of diarrheal illness has decreased from 10·8% in 2007 to 4·8% in 2022. The countries with the highest zinc coverage (Bangladesh, Kenya, Uganda) had national rather than regional scale-up campaigns. Our findings demonstrate the long-term success of the SUZY project and provide insights into best practices for impactful zinc scale-up programs including significant pre-launch implementation research addressing key knowledge gaps and partnering with research organizations. Long-term monitoring of scale-up campaigns is important to determine if these interventions can become socially embedded and self-sustaining, improving health outcomes in the long run.",

        "abstract": "Oleuropein (OLP), a compound predominantly found in olive leaves, has been known for its numerous biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Despite its established therapeutic potential, its role in treating diarrhea has not been extensively explored. This study aimed to evaluate the antidiarrheal effects of OLP in an in vivo model and to investigate its molecular interactions using in silico docking studies, pharmacokinetic predictions, and toxicity analysis. In the in vivo study, castor oil was used to induce diarrhea in 3-day-old chicks, and the antidiarrheal effect of OLP was tested at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg. The standard drug, loperamide (LOP) at 3 mg/kg, was used for comparison. The results showed that OLP at both doses significantly (p < 0.05) reduced diarrheal secretions and increased latency, with the 20 mg/kg dose demonstrating the most effective results. The combination of OLP (20 mg/kg) with LOP (3 mg/kg) further enhanced the antidiarrheal effect. In the in silico study, molecular docking revealed that both OLP and LOP exhibited strong binding affinities (BAs) to the key receptor, μ-opioid receptor associated with diarrhea, while OLP showed higher BA (‒8.9 kcal/mol) compared to LOP (‒8.7 kcal/mol). Pharmacokinetic analysis of OLP revealed favorable properties and toxicity studies revealed no acute toxicity, with an LD<sub>50</sub> of 2000 mg/kg. In conclusion, the findings suggest that OLP possesses significant antidiarrheal potential both in vivo and through receptor interaction, positioning it as a promising natural therapeutic agent for managing diarrhea. Further studies are warranted to fully elucidate its mechanisms of action and clinical applicability.",

We aimed to assess maternal knowledge, attitude and practice towards commercially available ORS and its use in treating under-5 children with diarrhoea. The study was conducted at the Dhaka Hospital, Bangladesh. We included 350 mothers of under-5 children suffering from diarrhoea. Data were collected using a pretested questionnaire and modified Bloom's cut-off was used to determine adequate knowledge (≥80%), positive attitude (≥90%) and proper practice (≥75%). Logistic regression models were developed after adjusting for confounding variables. Adjusted ORs (AORs) and their 95% CIs were reported. The prevalence of inadequate knowledge, negative attitude and improper practice was 88.0%, 59.1% and 72.5%, respectively. Participants with up to the higher secondary level of education had significantly higher odds of possessing adequate knowledge (AOR 7.47; 95% CI 2.76 to 20.12) and following proper practice (AOR 3.04; 95% CI 1.66 to 5.77). The majority (97.4%) reported being aware of the process of ORS preparation. Only 2.9% correctly knew all recommended steps. Approximately half (51.1%) knew the purpose of ORS use, and 24.6% believed that antibiotics are more helpful than ORS. The findings of the study emphasise the need for substantial improvements to the existing health education program with a focus on parental education. Emphasis should be given to reading instruction on the sachet and promoting access to information via mass media outlets.",

The study aims to investigate the antinociceptive and antidiarrheal effects of PRO, comparing its efficacy with diclofenac sodium (DFS) and loperamide (LOP) using in vivo and in silico methods. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated using the acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced paw licking tests, and antidiarrheal effects were assessed via castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice. Mice were divided into groups receiving PRO (2.5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), DFS (25 mg/kg, p.o.), LOP (3 mg/kg, p.o.), or combinations. Molecular docking studies were conducted on COX-1, COX-2 enzymes, and the Mu-opioid receptor (MOR), with toxicity predictions performed for safety profiling. In vivo results demonstrated that PRO significantly (p < 0.05) reduced pain and diarrhea in animals. PRO at 10 mg/kg, showed comparable efficacy to DFS and LOP (25 and 3 mg/kg) in both models. Molecular docking revealed that PRO had stronger binding affinities with COX-1 (‒10.0 kcal/mol), COX-2 (‒9.6 kcal/mol) enzymes, and MOR (‒7.7 kcal/mol) compared to standard drugs. Toxicity predictions indicate PRO is relatively safe in some toxicity parameters. PRO exhibits significant antinociceptive and antidiarrheal activities comparable to DFS and LOP, making it a promising natural alternative for managing pain and diarrhea. Additional clinical trials and pharmacokinetic assessments are required to evaluate its long-term safety for use.",

        "abstract": "Fasciolopsiasis, a food-borne intestinal disease is most common in Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Pigs are the reservoir host, and fasciolopsiasis is most widespread in locations where pigs are reared and aquatic plants are widely consumed. Human infection has been most commonly documented in China, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, and parts of India. It predominates in school-age children, and significant worm burdens are not uncommon. The causal organism is <i>Fasciolopsis buski</i>, a giant intestinal fluke that infects humans and causes diarrhoea, fever, ascites, and intestinal blockage. The increasing prevalence of medication resistance and the necessity for an effective vaccination make controlling these diseases challenging. Over the last decade, we have achieved major advances in our understanding of intestinal fluke biology by in-depth interrogation and analysis of evolving <i>F. buski</i> omics datasets. The creation of large omics datasets for <i>F. buski</i> by our group has accelerated the discovery of key molecules involved in intestinal fluke biology, toxicity, and virulence that can be targeted for vaccine development. Finding successful vaccination antigen combinations from these huge number of genes/proteins in the available omics datasets is the key in combating these neglected tropical diseases. In the present study, we developed an <i>in silico</i> workflow to select antigens for composing a chimeric vaccine, which could be a significant technique for developing a fasciolopsiasis vaccine that prevents the parasite from causing serious harm. This chimeric vaccine can now be tested experimentally and compared to other vaccine candidates to determine its potential influence on human health. Although the results are encouraging, additional validation is needed both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Considering the extensive genetic data available for intestinal flukes that has expanded with technological advancements, we may need to reassess our methods and suggest a more sophisticated technique in the future for identifying vaccine molecules.",

However, information on Euvichol-Plus's effectiveness is limited. Using this vaccine in a cholera epidemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh, provided the opportunity to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a test-negative design. A two-dose regimen of Euvichol-Plus was administered to individuals aged >1 year in a population of ca. 900 000 in two campaign rounds between June and August 2022, with prospective registration of all persons who received at least one dose. We conducted systematic surveillance in two key facilities, enrolling patients with acute watery diarrhoea who were eligible for vaccination from the campaign's start and who presented for care between 21 August 2022 and 20 August 2023. Faecal culture-positive cholera cases were matched to up to four faecal culture-negative controls by age, presentation date and facility. Vaccination status was documented without knowledge of culture results. Conditional logistic regression models estimated the OR for the vaccination-cholera association, and the VE of the two-dose regimen was calculated as [(1-OR) × 100]. The analysis included 226 cases and 552 matched controls. The adjusted VE of two doses of the Euvichol-Plus vaccine against medically attended cholera was 66% (99.5% CI: 30 to 83) for all recipients. Limited protection (12%; 95% CI: -95 to 60) was observed for children aged 1-4 years; whereas, protection was 79% (95% CI: 60 to 89) for those aged ≥5 years. VE against cholera with moderate to severe dehydration was 69% (95% CI: 44 to 83) overall but 6% (95% CI: -206 to 71) for children aged 1-4 years. Euvichol-Plus provided significant protection against medically attended cholera of any severity as well as cholera with moderate to severe dehydration.

The study explored to simultaneously detect the presence of ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV while considering relevant clinical and epidemiological risk factors, using a real-time multiplex RT-PCR system. Following this, it was planned to sequence the selected samples to identify genetic variations of the ZIKV infections within the population. This study was designed as a diagnostic evaluation, where participants meeting the inclusion criteria were prospectively recruited with written informed consent. A total of 399 febrile individuals were screened, with 185 meeting the inclusion criteria of having a fever onset within 2-5 days, along with one of the following clinical features, e.g. headache, myalgia, arthralgia or bone pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and 152 undergoing real-time RT-PCR testing. Five ZIKV-positive cases were identified, including one DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the ZIKV strains were part of the Asian lineage, closely related to Cambodian and Chinese strains from 2019. All ZIKV-positive cases were male, residing within a one-kilometer radius, with no prior travel history, suggesting community-level transmission. This study marks the first identification of ZIKV in Dhaka city and the first report of ZIKV-DENV co-infection in Bangladesh that highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by the symptomatic similarities between ZIKV and other arboviruses and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and public health interventions to mitigate the spread and impact of ZIKV in dengue-endemic regions.",

        "title": "Influence of Enterocytozoon bieneusi Infection on Child Growth: A Secondary Analysis of the MAL-ED Birth Cohort Study.",
        "abstract": "Malnutrition in the early days of life is a global public health concern that affects children's growth. It results from a variety of factors, including pathogenic infections. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a microsporidian parasite that can cause diarrhea and malnutrition in children. The study aimed to assess the impact of E. bieneusi on child growth. The MAL-ED study, a multicountry birth cohort research project, investigated the relationship between enteric infections and malnutrition in participating children from eight countries. A customized real-time polymerase chain reaction-based TaqMan array card was used in this study to identify enteropathogens from stool samples, where E. bieneusi was one of the target pathogens. The impacts of E. bieneusi infection on growth measures were assessed. Mixed-effect linear models were used to investigate the relationship between E. bieneusi and growth outcomes, including length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length (WLZ) Z scores. At the endpoint (last month of measurement), the infected group had significantly lower scores than the noninfected group for all outcomes. The adjusted difference-in-difference (D-in-D) values were -0.53 (95% CI: -0.67 to -0.38) for LAZ, -0.38 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.23) for WAZ, and -0.22 (95% CI: -0.38 to -0.06) for WLZ. Enterocytozoon bieneusi infection has been identified as a factor associated with reduced linear growth, weight gain, and weight gain relative to linear growth in children, underscoring the importance of treating this infection.",

        "abstract": "Heliotropium indicum is well-known for its diverse medicinal properties, traditionally utilized to treat ailments such as diabetes, obesity, bacterial infections, inflammation, and diarrhea. This study aims to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of the extract using in vitro methods and to assess its drug-likeness potential using docking, PASS and ADME. Fractionations of crude methanol extract (CME) were undertaken in n-hexane (NHF), chloroform (CHF), and ethyl acetate (EAF). GC-MS analysis was conducted using Agilent technologies. All fractions were evaluated for radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. Molecular docking was performed with PyRx and Biovia Discovery Studio, followed by drug-likeness analysis using Swiss ADME. The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) showed the highest DPPH scavenging activity (IC50: 4.3 μg/ml), followed by chloroform (CHF, IC50: 12.95 μg/ml) and n-hexane fractions (NHF, IC<sub>50</sub>: 17.6 μg/ml). Catechin had an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.5 μg/ml. EAF and CHF also exhibited the highest hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (51.69 μg/ml). EAF demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting heat-induced hemolysis (71.90%), hypotonicity-induced hemolysis (67.18%), and AAPH-induced hemolysis (72.52%) at 400 μg/ml. Six major phytoconstituents in EAF, identified by GC-MS, were docked with COX-2. ADME and drug-likeness evaluations using the Lipinski's \"rule of five\" confirmed all compounds had acceptable pharmacokinetic properties to fulfill the pharmaceutical formulations requirement. The study depicts the first and novel report of GC-MS compounds on in silico analysis. Both EAF and CHF exhibit significant anti-inflammatory activity, indicating their potential as a source for developing new therapeutic agents for treating inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Diarrheal infections continue to be a major public health concern in Bangladesh, especially in urban areas where population density and environmental variables increase dissemination risks. Identifying the intricate connections between weather variables and diarrhea epidemics is critical for developing effective public health remedies. We deploy the novel approach of Wavelet-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variable (WARIMAX) and the traditional Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variable (ARIMAX) technique to forecast the incidence of diarrhea by analyzing the influence of climate factors. Higher temperatures are associated with greater diarrheal occurrences, demonstrating the vulnerability of diarrheal epidemics to weather fluctuations. The Wavelet-ARIMAX method, which uses wavelet analysis within the ARIMAX structure, is better at forecasting performance and model fit than the standard ARIMAX model. Based on climatic variables, Wavelet-ARIMAX can accurately predict diarrheal occurrence, as indicated by the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE). The outcomes highlight the necessity of employing advanced time-series modeling tools such as Wavelet-ARIMAX to better understand and anticipate climate-health interactions. Wavelet-ARIMAX uses wavelet analysis to identify time-varying patterns in climate-disease interactions, providing useful insights for public health initiatives. The results of this research have implications for climate-adaptive health planning, emphasizing the need for focused actions to reduce the impact of climate change on diarrheal illness burdens in towns and cities.",

        "title": "First report of MDR virulent Pseudomonas aeruginosa in apparently healthy Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is a major pathogen associated conditions like septicaemia, respiratory disorders, and diarrhoea in poultry, particularly in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). The infection causes huge economical losses due to its high transmissibility, mortality and zoonotic potential. This study aimed to isolate, identify, detect virulence genes, and profile multidrug resistance (MDR) of P. aeruginosa from Japanese quail. Oral and rectal swabs were collected from 110 apparently healthy quail birds across various districts in Bangladesh. Bacterial isolation and identification were performed using cultural, morphological, biochemical, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed using the disc diffusion method, and virulence genes were detected through PCR. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for P. aeruginosa infection. Both conventional and PCR methods revealed that 25 (22.73%) of the quail birds were positive for P. aeruginosa. The results showed that quail birds in Narsingdi were five times more likely to harbor Pseudomonas species (OR: 5.02; 95% CI: 1.34-18.84) compared to those in Mymensingh Sadar. Additionally, quail birds younger than eight weeks had nearly six times higher odds (OR: 5.93; 95% CI: 1.96-17.91) of carrying Pseudomonas compared to older birds. Female quail birds had almost four times higher odds (OR: 3.77; 95% CI: 1.30-10.93) of harboring Pseudomonas species than males. All 25 P. aeruginosa isolates exhibited multi drug-resistance (MDR) patterns. Virulence gene analysis revealed the consistent presence of exoA and rhlR in all isolates, while exoS, exoY, rhlI, and rhlAB showed variable distribution. The high prevalence of MDR and virulent P. aeruginosa in apparently healthy quail birds particularly in Mymensingh and Dhaka divisions, highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive 'One Health' approach to proactively address and mitigate the potential risk this organism poses to both quail and human populations.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that frequently causes seasonal outbreaks in Bangladesh, particularly during the monsoon months from June to September. Recent outbreaks have shown significant shifts in clinical manifestations, including changes in the timeframe and serotype mixing. This study focused on the clinical and hematological profiles of patients during the 2022 outbreak, which was notably severe. This quantitative cross-sectional study at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital classified 67 dengue-positive patients as having dengue fever (DF), dengue fever with warning signs (DFWS), and severe dengue (SD). Fisher's exact test, Pearson's chi-squared test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were conducted for statistical analysis using the R software (version 4.2), with significance established at <i>p</i> < 0.05. Predominantly male patients (76%) aged 21-40 (63%) and middle-class patients from Dhaka (57%) formed the majority. Most patients (45%) lacked a regular drainage system. Laboratory tests showed 63% NS1 antigen (nonspecific antigen 1) positivity, and 16% tested positive for both NS1 and IgM (Immunoglobulin M). Symptoms included headache (84%), retroorbital pain (51%), joint pain (75%), myalgia (72%), vomiting (75%), abdominal pain (69%), diarrhea (39%), and shock (48%). Thrombocytopenia was present in 61% of patients, with 79% showing elevated hematocrit (HCT) levels. Pedal edema, pleural effusion, and ascites were observed in DF and DFWS cases, while SD cases exhibited distinct HCT level variations. Accurate clinical and laboratory assessments are vital for the treatment and prediction of dengue outcomes in Bangladesh, given the severe manifestations of dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is characterized by headache, muscle pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, and potential neurological complications or mortality. Severe cases involve critical plasma leakage, leading to DSS with fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and potential multiorgan involvement. Enhancing physician awareness regarding dengue case detection and management, along with routine dengue testing, are recommended for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The BioFire FilmArray® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel, a widely used diagnostic tool, is designed to detect the genetic material of 22 common pathogens responsible for gastroenteritis, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. It can detect human adenovirus (HAdV) species F, particularly serotypes F40 and F41, which are the major causes of diarrhea and mortality in children. However, its potential shortcomings in detecting other HAdV species limit its effectiveness in broader HAdV detection in clinical settings and outbreak investigations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the GI Panel to detect three clades of HAdV-F41 and other HAdV species (viz., A31, B3, C1, C2, C5, C2/6, and D56) in Japan. Eighteen stool samples were analyzed, five of which contained HAdV-F41, and 13 contained other HAdV species, as confirmed via PCR and sequencing. Although the GI Panel reliably detected all clades of HAdV-F41, it failed to detect any other species, highlighting its limited diagnostic utility beyond F40/41 serotypes. Considering the high false-negative rate for non-F40/41 species, integrating complementary diagnostic methods such as PCR is crucial for comprehensive HAdV detection. These findings underscore the limitations of the GI Panel in detecting non-F40/41 species, such as HAdV-C (commonly associated with pediatric gastroenteritis) and other species that are important in immunocompromised patients. Complementary diagnostic methods, such as PCR or immunochromatographic assays, are essential to ensure accurate HAdV detection, especially in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "In the Rutaceae family <i>Citrus maxima</i> is the biggest among all fruits, tradtionally used for several purposes due to its diverse ethnomedicinal, phytochemical, and pharmacological activities. Different portions of this plant have been used as sedatives and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as to treat coughs, fevers, asthma, diarrhea, ulcers, and diabetes. There is a scientific potential for the methanolic seed extract to contain bioactive compounds, similar to those found in other parts of the plant. The extract derived from the seeds has already demonstrated potential biological activity. Moreover, there weren't many in vivo and in vitro research works on these plants' seeds. Therefore, the current research work was undertaken to analyze anti-diarrheal and antipyretic potentials of the methanolic extract of <i>Citrus maxima</i> seeds (MCM). To evaluate MCM's effectiveness in treating diarrhea, castor oil-induced diarrhea model was utilized as an evaluating method. The antipyretic effect in mice was measured using brewer's yeast induced pyrexia model. The MCM at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses markedly reduced hyperpyrexia, induced by yeast. The effect remained persistent up to 4th hour after administration. In the castor oil induced diarrhea model, the methanolic seed extract showed high level of dose dependent inhibition of diarrhea for 4 h following castor oil administration. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate and clarify the specific causative agents responsible for the dose-dependent effects observed. The findings of the present study suggest that MCM seed extract may represent a promising alternative for the development of innovative anti-diarrheal and anti-pyretic compounds.",

        "abstract": "Poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are the primary risks of exposure to enteric viral infection. Our study aimed to describe the role of WASH conditions and practices as risk factors for enteric viral infections in children under 5. Literature on the risk factors associated with all-cause diarrhea masks the taxa-specific drivers of diarrhea from specific pathogens, limiting the application of relevant control strategies. We analyzed data from children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) across seven study sites between December 2007 and March 2011 as cases (moderate-to-severe diarrhea: MSD) and asymptomatic controls. MSD was defined as new and acute diarrhea, with at least one of the following criteria for MSD: dehydration based on the study clinician's assessment, dysentery, or hospitalization with diarrhea or dysentery. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the role of water quality, sanitation access, and hygiene facilities on the enteric viral pathogens adjusted for potential covariates. Among MSD symptomatic children (cases), longer water retrieval time (≥15 vs <15 min) was associated with increased Norovirus (aOR 1.33, 95 % CI 1.08-1.64) and Astrovirus (aOR 1.43, 95 % CI 1.01-2.02); scooping as drinking water retrieval method was associated with lower Rotavirus (aOR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.62-0.96), but higher Adenovirus (aOR 2.3, 95 % CI 1.32-4.11) infection compared to non-users. Among asymptomatic children (controls), consumption of non-tube well drinking water was associated with higher Norovirus infection (aOR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.89). Longer drinking water retrieval time (≥15 vs <15 min) increased Norovirus (aOR 1.47, 95 % CI 1.21-1.78) and Rotavirus (aOR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.20-1.89) infections. Pouring (aOR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.32-0.83) or scooping drinking water with a cup (aOR: 0.52; 95 % CI: 0.32, 0.86) lower Astrovirus infection; restricted water access (aOR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.21-2.02) higher Rotavirus infection. Handwashing before cooking was associated with lower Astrovirus (aOR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.47-0.88) infection in asymptomatic children. Our analysis did not find a significant effect of poor sanitation on different enteric viral pathogens examined. Norovirus and Astrovirus were detected more commonly in sub-Saharan Africa while Rotavirus was less prevalent than South Asia. Though we found statistically significant associations, we did not observe any overall pattern between WASH and enteric viral pathogens. Our findings provide insights to guide further research on targeted interventions for enteric viral pathogens, responsible for a major burden of pediatric diarrhea globally.",

Traditionally, various parts of D. discolor have been used in medicine for treating dysentery, diarrhea, and respiratory issues. Pharmacologically, the plant has exhibited diverse effects, including anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-asthmatic, antiaging, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and thrombolytic activities. These findings substantiate its traditional uses, particularly its potential as an antidiabetic, antidiarrheal, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and vasorelaxant agent. This plant is notable for its rich aromatic profile, containing 39 volatile compounds in the fruit and peel, with esters and α-farnesene being the predominant compounds. Volatile esters such as methyl butyrate and ethyl dominate the aroma. Nutritionally, the fruit contains dietary fiber, malic acid, vitamins, essential fatty acids, flavonoids, and triterpenes. Additionally, bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, triterpenes, and dimeric naphthoquinones (e.g., diospyrin), have been isolated from the plant. The essential oil derived from its flowers further enhances its bioeconomic and health benefits. Moreover, D. discolor holds bioeconomic potential as a biosorbent, a source of timber and edible fruits, and a material for synthesizing silver nanoparticles.

        "abstract": "Cholera rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vulnerable to virulent bacteriophage predation. We hypothesized that an enhanced cholera RDT that detects the common virulent bacteriophage ICP1 might serve as a proxy for pathogen detection. We previously developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the ICP1 major capsid protein. Our objective was to design and assemble a first-of-its-kind RDT that detects both a bacterial pathogen (<i>Vibrio cholerae</i>) and associated virulent bacteriophage (ICP1). Candidate mAbs were expanded to increase design options and evaluated by immunological assays (ELISA; western blot). A subset of mAbs were selected for gold conjugation and printing on the RDT. The detection limit of the prototype RDTs was determined in diarrheal stools with the addition of ICP1. Three mAb candidates were developed and evaluated for the capsid decoration protein (ORF123) and tail fiber protein (ORF93), and the prior mAb for the major capsid protein (ORF122). A single mAb sandwich RDT prototype for ORF122 was able to detect ICP1; RDTs with mAbs to ORF123 and ORF93 failed to detect ICP1 in single- or dual-sandwich configurations. Biologically relevant concentrations for ICP1 were detected only after boiling the stool with ICP1; analysis by electron microscopy (EM) suggested increased epitope availability after boiling. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept for a functional RDT that can detect both the primary pathogen and a common virulent bacteriophage as a proxy for pathogen detection. Further optimization is required before scaled production and implementation.IMPORTANCEThis paper represents an important step forward to address the vulnerability of cholera RDTs to the effects of phage predation on the target <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. The assembly and evaluation of an RDT that detects both the primary pathogen and a phage as a proxy for the primary pathogen is an innovative solution. When optimized and evaluated in clinical studies, this tool may become critical in the cholera response tool kit as well as represent a diagnostic proof-of-concept for other infectious agents.",

A qualitative phytochemical screening and assessment of the anthelmintic properties of LCSE were conducted using standard procedures. The time required for paralysis and death of adult earthworms (<i>Eisenia fetida</i>) was assessed by analyzing each test solution at five distinct dosages (5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/mL).

Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism version 10.1.2. Qualitative analysis revealed that LCSE is rich in phytochemicals, including alkaloids, anthraquinones, carbohydrates, flavonoid, glycosides, proteins and amino acids, phenols, terpenoids, and tannins. The anthelmintic activities of the LCSE and albendazole were dose-dependent, as the time required for paralysis and mortality decreased in proportion to the concentrations increased. LCSE exhibited strong anthelmintic efficacy at a concentration of 100 mg/mL (paralysis 12.67 ± 0.33, death 14 ± 0.58), which was significantly greater than that of albendazole (paralysis 15 ± 1.15, death 17.67 ± 1.15). This finding suggests that LCSE holds potent anthelmintic properties, making it a promising natural alternative to conventional treatments like albendazole.",

        "abstract": "With increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria, including those causing Shigellosis, evidence of safety and pharmacokinetics data on new oral antibiotics is crucial. We aimed to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of an oral carbapenem, tebipenem pivoxil, along with it's ability to produce desired results in childhood shigellosis. This randomized pilot clinical trial was conducted at Dhaka Hospital, icddr,b in 2022 between May and September. Thirty suspected shigellosis cases aged 24-59 months were randomized across two treatment groups equally: tebipenem pivoxil and azithromycin. Pharmacokinetics of tebipenem was assessed among fifteen children who received tebipenem pivoxil using Noncompartmental analysis (NCA). Clinical (absence of fever, abdominal pain/tenderness, diarrhoea, blood in stool, or death before Day-3) and microbiological (absence of Shigella on Day-7 culture) success after the antibiotic interventions were also evaluated. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the randomization arms. Twelve children, each in the azithromycin arm and tebipenem arm, were positive for Shigella by culture on enrolment. C<sub>max</sub> values of 5053.3, 2546.0, and 3759.2 ng/mL were observed for plasma tebipenem on Day-0, 1, and 2 respectively. Clinical success was observed among seven participants in each arm while two in the azithromycin arm and three in the tebipenem arm failed microbiologically. The tolerability and efficaciousness of tebipenem pivoxil appear to be comparable to azithromycin in treating childhood shigellosis in Bangladesh. We recommend a larger clinical trial to determine non-inferiority of tebipenem in regards to the current treatment guidelines.",

This study investigated the differential pathogenic profiles ETEC across various age groups, emphasizing the importance of selecting potential ETEC antigens tailored to infection patterns in infants and adults in Bangladesh. This study utilized the icddr,b's 2% systematic hospital surveillance data of diarrheal patients (<i>n</i> = 14,515) from 2017 to 2022 to examine the age-specific pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of ETEC infections. In total ETEC was identified in 1,371 (9.4%) of surveillance samples. ETEC-associated diarrhea was higher in children aged 0-2 years and decreased significantly in the 3-17 years age group. Among all ETEC cases, 56% were adults (<i>p</i> = 0.0079) with severe dehydration. Distinct age-specific distribution of ETEC toxin types and colonization factors (CFs) were observed: heat labile toxin (LT)-associated ETEC infections decreased with age (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), while heat stable toxin (ST)-associated-ETEC was prevalent across all ages. Adults exhibited significantly higher rates of ETEC diarrhea with strains secreting both types of toxins. A high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among ETEC strains, particularly in pediatric cases, with significant resistance observed against commonly used antibiotics such as azithromycin and in line with similar age specific toxin profiles. The most common CFs were CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and CS21. CFA/I positive ETEC infection was more common in children (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while CS5 and CS6 were more common in adults (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The findings provide valuable insights into ETEC epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations. These observations imply that age-related differences in host-pathogen interactions exist for ETEC infections and this may influence the development of targeted vaccines or therapeutics and use in specific populations.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is endowed with an abundance of excellent medicinal plant resources. A well-known traditional medicinal plant <i>Piper chaba</i> H. from the Piperaceae family is rich in bioactive phytochemicals that have antidiarrheal, antimicrobial, analgesic, antioxidant, anticancer, and cytotoxic effects. This plant is locally known as \"Chuijhal,\" and the stem is used as spices. In the current research program, the stems of the <i>P. chaba</i> plant were selected and its chemical and biological investigations such as antidiarrheal, antimicrobial, and analgesic effects were performed. Moreover, docking models were accomplished by exploiting PyRx-Virtual Screening software and implied that isolated compounds of <i>P. chaba</i> exert different pharmacological activity by inhibiting their targeted receptors. Phytochemical investigations revealed the isolation of Chingchengenamide A, a relatively rare alkaloid from the stems of <i>P. chaba</i>. Another alkaloid Chabamide I which is a piperine dimer was also isolated. Their structures were confirmed by comparing these compounds' spectral data (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR) with their previously published spectral data. Antidiarrheal activity shows a percent reduction of diarrhea by 46.67% and 40%, respectively, for Chabamide I and Chingchengenamide A (at 20 mg/kg b.w.) compared with an 80% reduction by standard loperamide. Similarly, the percent reduction of writhing was 53.06% and 42.86%, respectively, for Chabamide I and Chingchengenamide A at similar doses compared with an 80% reduction by diclofenac sodium considered as standard. Both the alkaloids showed auspicious outcomes against test microorganisms during disk diffusion antimicrobial assay. Molecular docking and ADME/T analysis of the alkaloids also validate a potent pharmacological basis for the traditional utilization of <i>P. chaba</i> in treating diarrhea, pain, and microbial infection. These results emphasize the need to investigate <i>P. chaba</i> as a potential source of natural therapies for common health issues, laying the foundation for future research.",

Acetone extracts of N. gracillima (ANG) were analyzed using both in vivo and in silico methods. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was conducted to identify bioactive compounds present in the extract. In vivo assessments, including the elevated plus maze, light-dark box, and hole board tests, showed that ANG at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg exhibited significant (p < 0.001) anxiolytic effects. Both doses also demonstrated antidepressant effects in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests by significantly (p < 0.001) reducing immobility time, with the 200 mg/kg dose showing more pronounced effects. Sedative activity was confirmed through open field and hole cross tests, where both doses exhibited significant (p < 0.001) sedative effects. ANG also demonstrated significant antidiarrheal effects at 400 mg/kg in castor oil-induced diarrhea (p < 0.05) and gastrointestinal motility tests (p < 0.01). Molecular docking simulations revealed that compounds from ANG had strong binding affinities to critical drug targets involved in anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and diarrhea.

        "abstract": "While water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions can reduce diarrheal disease, many large-scale trials have not found the expected health gains for young children in low-resource settings. Evidence-based guidance is needed to improve interventions and remove barriers to diarrheal disease reduction. We aimed to estimate how sensitive WASH intervention effectiveness was to underlying contextual and intervention factors in the WASH Benefits (WASH-B) Bangladesh cluster-randomized controlled trial. The investigators measured diarrheal prevalence in children enrolled in the WASH-B trial at three time points approximately 1 year apart (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>17,187</mn></mrow></math> observations). We developed a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model with transmission across multiple environmental pathways and evaluated each of four interventions [water (W), sanitation (S), hygiene (H), and nutrition (N) applied individually and in combination], compliance with interventions, and the impact of individuals not enrolled in the study. Leveraging a set of mechanistic parameter combinations fit to the WASH-B Bangladesh trial using a hybrid Bayesian sampling-importance resampling and maximum-likelihood estimation approach, we simulated trial outcomes under counterfactual scenarios to estimate how changes in six WASH factors (preexisting WASH conditions, disease transmission potential, intervention compliance, intervenable fraction of transmission, intervention efficacy, and community coverage) impacted intervention effectiveness. Increasing community coverage had the greatest impact on intervention effectiveness (e.g., median increases in effectiveness of 34.0 and 45.5 percentage points in the WSH and WSHN intervention arms when increasing coverage to 20%). The effect of community coverage on effectiveness depended on how much transmission was along pathways not modified by the interventions. Intervention effectiveness was reduced by lower levels of preexisting WASH conditions or increased baseline disease burden. Individual interventions had complementary but not synergistic effects when combined. To realize the expected health gains, future WASH interventions must address community coverage and transmission along pathways not traditionally covered by WASH. The effectiveness of individual-level WASH improvements is reduced more the further the community is from achieving the coverage needed for herd protection. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15200.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial infections leading to bacteremia and septicemic shock constitute an emerging public health concern globally, especially in areas where sanitation is poor and safe drinking water is scarce. Enteric pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae are responsible for many deaths caused by contaminated food and water in these areas. While cholera is the prominent clinical threat posed by V. cholerae, outcomes like bacteremia turning into sepsis and associated morbidity and mortality have been increasing globally in recent times. Here, we report an alarming case of fatal sepsis with a probable association of V. cholerae bacteremia in Bangladesh. In September 2023, a 30-year-old man with a pre-condition of beta-thalassemia presented to a tertiary care hospital with acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and fever and died within 36 h of admission with acute cholecystitis, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, pancytopenia, and refractory septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Blood culture detected V. cholerae, which was further characterized as hemolytic, carrying the hemolysin gene and genes for the virulence factor type-three secretion system. The isolate was confirmed as V. cholerae non-O1/O139 (NOVC), which differed in genetic properties from the few contemporary NOVC isolates associated with diarrheal cases in Bangladesh. To manage the diarrhea and septicemic condition, the patient was treated empirically with metronidazole and meropenem. However, antibiotic susceptibility testing showed the strain was susceptible to all the routinely prescribed drugs for V. cholerae infections. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation provides the first molecular description of a fatal case of V. cholerae-associated bacteremia in Bangladesh and underscores the need for comprehensive investigations on bacterial septicemia to prevent future casualties.",

        "abstract": "Background Globally, dengue fever (DF) is the leading cause of arthropod-borne viral illness, which considerably contributes to an atrocious death rate. The disease is now endemic in some parts of the world, including Bangladesh. The disorder exhibits a wide range of clinical and laboratory features in children. Judicial fluid resuscitation during the critical phase and prompt referral to the appropriate health facility can be lifesaving. Objectives This research appraised clinical and laboratory features and treatment outcomes of DF in pediatric cases. Methods This prospective investigative work was conducted at Islami Bank Hospital, Dhaka, India, from July to October 2023. The study included 135 admitted pediatric cases of DF, either dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) or anti-dengue antibody IgM or IgG positive. Results Among the selected cases, boys were more predominant than girls, and most patients were in the age group of 5 to 10 years (n=46, 34%), most of them belonging to lower-middle-class families (n=56, 41.5%). All of the study participants had raised body temperatures, and most had abdominal pain (n=82, 60.7%), vomiting (n=77, 57%), cough (n=43, 31.9%), headache (n=38, 28.2%), body aches (n=32, 23.7%), and diarrhea (n=23, 17%). Dengue NS1 was positive in 91.1% (n=123) of cases. Raised hematocrit was found in 36.3% (n=49) of cases, leukopenia in 47% (n=63), and thrombocytopenia in 69.6% (n=94) of cases. Most of our patients were categorized as having DF (68.1%, n=92), followed by dengue with warning signs (16.3%, n=22), and severe dengue was present in 15.6% (n=21) of patients. Most were treated with crystalloid, and some with crystalloid and colloid solution. Fortunately, most of them recovered with no death. Conclusion DF may manifest with varied clinical and laboratory features in children. Appropriate treatment of critical phases, depending on clinical and laboratory features, is crucial to reducing dengue-induced miseries and fatal clinical outcomes among the pediatric population.",

The objective of this study was to isolate bioactive phytochemicals from <i>C. affinis</i> and <i>C. gigantea</i> and elucidate their structure employing the NMR technique followed by bioactivity evaluation. Column chromatography was utilized to isolate phytochemicals, followed by NMR analysis for characterization. An <i>in vivo</i> analgesic test was performed through an acetic acid-induced writhing test, an anti-inflammatory test was performed through a formalin-induced licking test, and an antidiarrheal test was performed through a castor oil-induced diarrhea model.

We evaluated the frequency, characteristics and associated factors of pain and its impact on quality of life (QoL) among patients with GBS. We enrolled 644 patients with GBS from prospective cohort studies in Bangladesh conducted between 2010 and 2024. Data were collected at enrolment and at standard follow-up time points up to 26 weeks. Pain intensity was measured by a pain numeric rating scale. Group differences were tested using the χ² or Fisher's exact test, longitudinal changes were analysed with repeated-measures analysis of variance and correlations were analysed with Spearman's rank test. The median age of the patients was 31 years, with 70% men. During enrolment, 71% of patients reported pain, which persisted among 38% at week 13 and 26% at week 26. Pain was significantly associated with disease severity, muscle weakness and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin in both the acute and chronic stages. Patients with acute pain had a higher proportion of axonal GBS (p=0.000) than those without pain. Chronic pain was associated with higher age (p=0.006), male sex (p=0.000), preceding diarrhoea (p=0.033) and dysautonomia (p=0.000). Higher pain intensity was reported among women (p=0.027), patients with higher age (p=0.029) and severe form of GBS (p=0.038) compared with counter groups. Acute pain was significantly associated with the 'self-care' (p=0.023), 'usual activities' (p=0.049) and 'anxiety/depression' (p=0.048) domains of QoL, whereas chronic pain was associated with the 'anxiety/depression' (p=0.005) domain.

This study aims to explore MS mechanisms in treating AD through network pharmacology, molecular docking, and in vitro studies. Using network pharmacology, we identified 19 MS components that may affect 60 AD-related targets. The compound-target network highlighted significant interactions among 60 nodes and 470 edges, with an average node degree of 15.7. The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed Alzheimer's disease (hsa05010) as a relevant pathway. We connected 20 targets to tau and β-amyloid proteins through gene expression data from the AlzData database. Docking studies demonstrated high binding affinities of MS compounds like acetylursolic acid, beta-sitosterol, isomitraphylline, and speciophylline to AD-related proteins, such as AKT1, GSK3B, NFκB1, and BACE1. In vitro studies showed that ethanolic (EE), distilled water (DWE), and pressurized hot water (PHWE) extracts of MS-treated 100 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced SH-SY5Y cells significantly reduced oxidative damage. This research underscores the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway effects of MS on AD, providing insights for future research and potential clinical applications.",

        "title": "Indian Shot (<i>Canna Indica</i> L). Leaves Provide Valuable Insights into the Management of Inflammation and Other Associated Disorders Offering Health Benefits.",
        "abstract": "Throughout history, plants have played a crucial role in advancing medicinal treatments by providing a diverse range of compounds for the development of innovative therapies. <i>Canna indica</i> L. a tropical herb of the Cannaceae family, also known as Indian shot, has a rich history of traditional use in treating ailments like inflammation, malaria, dysentery, fever, dropsy, and diarrhea. This comprehensive research invesigates the extract preparation of <i>C. indica</i> leaves using multidisciplinary analytical approaches for this extract in order to shed light on its therapeutic potentials. The research, an international collaboration involving researchers from Bangladesh and China, utilized GC-MS/MS analysis to identify bioactive compounds across different <i>C. indica</i> extracts. Biological assays were conducted to assess antimicrobial activity using the disc diffusion method (in vitro), cytotoxicity through the brine shrimp lethality assay (in vitro), analgesic effects via the acetic acid-induced writhing test (in vivo), and antidiarrheal activity with the castor oil-induced diarrhea model (in vivo). Molecular docking studies were performed to determine binding affinities with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR), Delta Opioid Receptor (DOR), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) receptors. The GC-MS/MS analysis identified 35, 43, 27, and 20 compounds in dichloromethane, aqueous, petroleum ether, and ethyl acetate extracts, respectively. The aqueous (AQSF) and dichloromethane (DCMSF) extracts showed notable antimicrobial activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria. Cytotoxicity tests indicated that ethyl acetate (EASF) and dichloromethane (DCMSF) fractions were potent. Analgesic activity was highest in DCMSF, and antidiarrheal effects were dose-dependent, with DCMSF showing the greatest efficacy. Molecular docking revealed strong affinities of Ergostane-3,5,6,12,25-pentol, 25-acetate, (3.beta.,5.alpha.,6.beta.,12.beta).- for EGFR and Norgestrel for COX-2. This research provides valuable insights into the bioactivity evaluation of <i>C. indica</i>, bridging the gap between its chemical composition and diverse biological effects. The findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge in natural product-based drug discovery and underscore the significance of <i>C. indica</i> as a potential source of novel therapeutic agents to treat inflammation and other disease states.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) poses a major global healthcare challenge, highlighting the need for new treatments beyond current options. Currently available drugs have side effects including weight gain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, insulin resistance etc. Therefore, given the benefits of indole derivatives in diabetes and the lack of computational studies on bis-indole-based triazine derivatives with aldose reductase (AR), this study employs in-silico analysis to explore their potential as type-2 diabetes treatments. Based on the Differential Expression analysis, the human aldose reductase (HAR) encoding gene AKR1B1 showed overexpression in GSE30122 diabetes patients (Log2FC = 0.62, <i>P</i> < 0.01). Moreover, the compounds 2-((5,6-di(1H-indol-3-yl)-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)thio)-1-(3-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)ethan-1-one (4) and 2-((5,6-di(1H-indol-3-yl)-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)thio)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one (8) were identified as leading candidates, showing binding energies of - 62.12, - 81.73 kcal/mol and - 57.19, - 85.97 kcal/mol, respectively. Docking, MM/GBSA screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, PCA, and post-MM/GBSA analysis confirmed their stability and favorable binding compared to the apo protein and control. Further in-vitro, in-vivo, and clinical studies are required to validate their therapeutic potential.",

        "abstract": "Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the stomach and intestine. It is a rare disorder with bizarre presentations, making it difficult to diagnose and often leading to misdiagnoses. It can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, obstruction, ascites, etc. Here, we report a case of a middle-aged female who presented with severe abdominal pain and was initially suspected to have acute pancreatitis. She received conservative management, but symptoms did not improve. This led to further evaluation, which revealed peripheral blood eosinophilia. Although the mucosa appeared normal on esophagogastroduodenoscopy, biopsy from multiple sites revealed eosinophilic infiltration in the gastric and duodenal lamina propria. The patient was then successfully treated with oral steroid. Due to its varied presentations, eosinophilic gastroenteritis should be considered as the differential diagnosis in different abdominal presentations.",
