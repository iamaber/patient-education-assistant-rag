        "title": "Global inequities in the survival of extremely preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Despite the associated major morbidities, advances in neonatal care units have improved the survival rates of extremely preterm infants. However, the varying survival rates make it challenging to set policy decisions around the standardization of care. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the global survival rate of extremely preterm infants and to compare it across different income levels and over time during the last two decades. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google, to identify relevant articles. All peer-reviewed studies reported the survival rate of extremely preterm infants (born before 29 weeks' gestation) between January 1<sup>st,</sup> 2000, and June 25th, 2024, were included. Outcomes were compared between Epoch 1 (2000-2015, Millennium Developmental Goals period) and Epoch 2 (2016-2024, Sustainable Developmental Goals period). DerSimonian‒Laird random effects model was fitted to estimate the pooled weighted outcomes. A total of 217 studies involving 917,176 infants were included. Based on published data, 61.4% (95% CI: 58.13-64.81) of extremely preterm infants survived to discharge, and 51.7% (95% CI: 44.25-59.22) of survivors were discharged without major morbidity. Survival rate was significantly lower in low- and middle-income countries (44.3%) compared to high-income countries (69.3%). Among low- and middle-income countries, survival improved from 38% during the epoch 1 to 44.8% during the epoch 2. While in high-income countries it was 69.9% during epoch 1 and 64.2% during epoch 2. These findings are based on reported literature; may not fully reflect outcomes in low-resource settings where data are limited and underreported. Variability in the inclusion and care of borderline viable infants also contributes to the heterogeneity and uncertainty of the estimates. Survival of extremely preterm infants varies widely across settings, with fewer than half surviving in low- and middle-income countries. While some improvement was observed in these regions during the Sustainable Developmental Goals period, comparisons across epochs and regions should be interpreted cautiously due to differences in data availability and population characteristics. These variations underscore the need for context-specific strategies that balance available resources, cultural values, and ethical considerations. Further population-level data, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, are essential to inform equitable global neonatal care policies. PROSPERO (CDR42023447612 (PROSPERO (york.ac.uk)).

        "abstract": "Developing nations like Bangladesh face unique challenges in healthcare delivery system due to resource constraints, making it crucial to assess the responsiveness of healthcare authorities to citizen feedback. This study utilized data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's (MOHFW) Grievance Redress System (GRS) in Bangladesh, collected from January 1st to August 8th, 2023. A total of 11,604 anonymous messages received from health service takers were retrieved and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank tests were conducted to assess feedback response times. Feedback were mainly complaints (60.33%), followed by compliments (22.03%) and suggestions (14.48%). Complaints were primarily related to the health workforce, infrastructure, and service utilization. Responses included forwarding (67.02%) to the relevant department, closure (30.12%), resolution (2.55%), pending (0.05%), and overdue (0.25%). The median response time was 3.48 hours (IQR: 1.26 - 13.00). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that moderate and major complaints were significantly less likely to be resolved than minor complaints (p < 0.001). The status and responsiveness of the grievance redress process of the healthcare delivery system in Bangladesh highlighted in this study can be used to plan the enhancement of the redress system and, thereby, improve health service.",

        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "title": "Impact of mobile health-based nutritional education on hemoglobin levels in anemic adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh: a randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Anemia is a global public health concern, particularly among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh, owing to inadequate knowledge and insufficient nutritional intake. Mobile health (mHealth) education has the potential to solve these limitations. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of mHealth education on raising hemoglobin levels and reducing anemia among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh. This open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted at two schools in Chandpur district, Bangladesh from late May 2022 to January 2023. We randomly assigned one school to the intervention group and another to the control group and then performed simple random sampling to recruit 138 adolescent girls with anemia from the intervention (n = 69) and control (n = 69) groups. The intervention group received online counseling sessions and health education via mHealth technology, whereas the control group received usual care, and both groups were observed for 8 months. We performed mixed-effects model and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to evaluate the outcomes. The study analyzed 121 participants (intervention group, 62; control group, 59). After adjusting for covariates, mixed-effects model observed that body mass index (BMI) [coefficient: 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-1.76, P = 0.001], mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) (coefficient: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.27-1.26, P = 0.002), hip circumference (coefficient: 2.24, 95% CI: 0.62-3.87, P = 0.007), and waist circumference (coefficient: 2.20, 95% CI: 0.74-3.66, P = 0.003) were significantly improved in intervention group. Although hemoglobin levels improved in the intervention group, the change was not statistically significant. However, the intervention group experienced a higher anemia recovery than the control group (25.8% vs. 13.6%). The GEE showed improvement in knowledge (coefficient: 4.11, 95% CI: 3.63-4.58, p = < 0.001), attitude (coefficient: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.24-1.96, p = < 0.001), and practice (coefficient: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.13-0.66, p = 0.004) in the intervention group compared to the control group after adjusting for relevant covariates. The mHealth education led to improvements in knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores related to anemia among adolescent girls. Furthermore, the intervention resulted in improvements in BMI, MUAC, and hip and waist circumference measurements. Additionally, there were positive trends indicating a reduction in anemia prevalence, accompanied by an upward trend in hemoglobin levels. Therefore, implementing this strategy could enhance KAP and contribute to reducing adolescent girls' anemia in low-resource settings.

        "title": "Towards the Integration of an Anti-Contractile Compound Within Drug-Coated Balloon Therapy.",
        "abstract": "Drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy is a promising approach to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD), wherein lesion site preparation, balloon inflation, and the local delivery of anti-proliferative drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX) restores and retains lumen patency. Although largely successful in PAD applications, broader clinical deployment is in part limited by the occurrence of late lumen loss due to inward vessel remodeling at the treatment site, a maladaptive chronic response that has been clinically-observed to coincide with elevations in resident vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) tone. This study aims to explore a novel strategy to improve DCB efficacy via drug-based attenuation of vSMC tone at the treatment site. As a strategy to mitigate this post-DCB failure mode, we consider the local co-delivery of PTX and an additional drug that induces relaxation of vSMCs, specifically the clinically-approved anti-hypertensive drug valsartan (VAL). The potential benefit of drug-based regulation of vSMC tone is supported by recent theoretical studies that predict inward remodeling in the presence of hypertension and endothelial cell dysfunction, both common co-morbidities in PAD patients and established causes of elevated vSMC contractility. The specific selection of VAL as the anti-contractile payload constituent is motivated by its well-known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and the notion that current clinical use and familiarity could promote rapid translation in the context of DCBs. Our obtained results quantify the potency of VAL to induce local vSMC relaxation in arterial tissue, demonstrate the feasibility of PTX and VAL co-delivery using the canonical excipient urea for balloon coating formation, and elucidate key structure-function relations to facilitate efficient drug delivery with these novel coatings. Our study supports the continued evaluation of VAL for inclusion in DCB formulations due to its potential to redirect post-treatment arterial remodeling. Future in-vivo studies which examine the co-delivery of PTX and VAL in the context of DCBs are needed to establish both the safety and efficacy of this novel approach.",

        "abstract": "The international demand for shrimp from Bangladesh exhibits a Telecoupled system. Semi-intensive to intensive shrimp farming has changed vast coastal areas into saline zones by altering land use and land cover. While shrimp cultivation significantly contributes to foreign exchange earnings, it also leads to various social and environmental impacts that affect planetary health. This study sees shrimp farming as a result of these Telecoupled dynamics. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining both primary and secondary data to examine its effects on planetary health in Bangladesh's southwestern coastal areas. The findings reveal several important health and social issues associated with shrimp farming. These include (i) scarcity of drinking and household water, (ii) infectious diseases, (iii) non-infectious diseases, (iv) food and nutritional insecurity, (v) antimicrobial resistance and chemical contamination, (vi) mental pressure, (vii) disaster-related health vulnerability, (viii) social conflict, (ix) healthcare inequality, and (x) rural-urban migration. This analysis enhances our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and nature in shrimp farming systems and their evolving impacts on planetary health in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. The study stresses the urgent need for integrated, ecosystem-based agricultural practices to find a balance between economic benefits and sustainable health and environmental outcomes.",

We analysed nationally representative health system data from the Service Provision Assessment surveys for six selected LMICs - Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Nepal, Senegal, and Bangladesh. We recorded seven tracer items of standard precautions into binary elements. We calculated a readiness index based on the World Health Organization's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual. We utilised survey-weighted multivariable generalised estimating equations to identify factors associated with the readiness index. Among 6054 healthcare facilities, 55% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 53.1, 56.5) of necessary standard precautions were available, ranging from 48.1% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 65% in Nepal. Readiness varied by service area, with the tuberculosis service area being the least prepared at 38% and the general outpatient service area being the most prepared at 66%. Facilities in Nepal and the urban regions showed higher readiness, with mean (x̄) differences of 16% (95% CI = 13.6, 17.9) and 3% (95% CI = 1.8, 4.9) compared to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and rural areas, respectively. We revealed significant deficiencies in standard precautions within healthcare facilities across six LMICs, notably in rural areas. The findings underscore an urgent need for targeted interventions to improve IPC strategies, particularly in domains like tuberculosis care.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate healthcare utilization and compliance with the WHO treatment guidelines can significantly reduce diarrhea-related childhood mortality and morbidity, while overuse of antibiotics notably increases antibiotic resistance. We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs. 13%; p < 0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility. Our findings warrant that reducing unnecessary antibiotic consumption requires increasing public awareness and strengthening laws on the sale of over-the-counter antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading public health problems; they kill more children under five years of age than any other infectious disease. Approximately two-thirds of all deaths occur in 15 developing countries, including Bangladesh. To achieve the targets of childhood mortality, it is essential to reduce the current rate of under-5 mortality. In Bangladesh, healthcare utilization for childhood illnesses has increased in recent years, but not to a desirable level, and disparities among different groups remain a matter of concern. This study explores the determinants contributing to unequal access to healthcare-seeking behavior for childhood illnesses, namely diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), over the last decade and a half. This study extracted data from the latest three Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2006, 2012-13, and 2019). Children younger than five years with diarrhea and/or ARI 2 weeks prior to the survey were included in the study. The prevalence and association of care-seeking were investigated through a chi-square test and multivariate logistic model applied to identify the determinants of unequal access to healthcare services. Care seeking for diarrhea and symptoms of acute respiratory infections showed a downward trend from 2006 to 2012-13 (30% vs. 18.5%) and an upward trend from 2012 to 13 to 2019 (18.5% vs. 74.6%). Several socioeconomic and demographic factors such as gender, administrative division, children's age, mother's education, household head's education, wealth, and ethnicity were found to have significant associations with care-seeking behavior for children under 5. Gender, division, and age were significant predictors across the three study periods. This study identified some possible determinants of care-seeking behaviors in childhood illnesses. Based on the findings of this research, policymakers should revise the existing policy to increase the utilization rate and reduce inequality in health care seeking for children under the age of 5. Specifically, counseling slum residents provide a provision for subsidizing or providing free health care benefits to the poorest households and enhancing parents' counseling to remove gender bias.",

This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

The highest median TDC and TIC were in Bangladesh (I$13.6 and I$23.2, respectively), while mozambique reported the lowest (I$0.4 and I$4.9, respectively), with medication accounting for 60.9% of TDC. Quantile regression analysis showed TDC was positively associated with factors like family size, urban residence, moderate-to-severe disease, caregiver education and use of rehydration methods, while treated drinking water and overweight status were negatively associated. TIC was significantly associated with seeking prior care. The indirect cost of diarrhoea was higher, which indicates the impact of lost productivity due to the disease. Bolstering the healthcare financing systems, ensuring affordable medication using pricing regulation, subsidising treatment packages, promoting the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) initiative, promoting and practising standard case management, and timely healthcare-seeking can reduce the economic burden.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising healthcare for people with disabilities, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in the era of advanced technology. This work explicitly addresses the challenges posed by inconsistent data from various sources by developing and evaluating a robust deep ensemble learning system for the accurate and reliable classification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on facial images. <b>Methods:</b> We created a system that learns from two publicly accessible datasets of ASD images (Kaggle and YTUIA), each with unique demographics and image characteristics. Utilising a weighted ensemble strategy (FPPR), our innovative ASD-UANet ensemble combines the Xception and ResNet50V2 models to maximise model contributions. This methodology underwent extensive testing on a range of groups stratified by age and gender, including a critical assessment of an unseen, real-time dataset (UIFID) to determine how well it generalised to new domains. <b>Results:</b> The performance of the ASD-UANet ensemble was consistently better. It significantly outperformed individual transfer learning models (e.g., Xception alone on T1+T2 yielded an accuracy of 83%), achieving an impressive 96.0% accuracy and an AUC of 0.990 on the combined-domain dataset (T1+T2). Notably, the ASD-UANet ensemble demonstrated strong generalisation on the unseen real-time dataset (T3), achieving 90.6% accuracy and an AUC of 0.930. This demonstrates how well it generalises to new data distributions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings demonstrate significant potential for widespread, equitable, and clinically beneficial ASD screening using this promising, reasonably priced, and non-invasive method. This study establishes the foundation for more precise diagnoses and greater inclusion for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by integrating methods for diverse data and combining deep learning models.",

        "abstract": "This paper evaluates the impact of skill-based health education (SBHE) on children's hygiene practices and health in rural Bangladesh. Over one year, SBHE was delivered weekly to primary schools through a randomised-controlled trial (RCT) by locally recruited trained para-teachers. The SBHE and soap provision interventions, provided in a cross-cutting manner, were randomly assigned to 180 schools stratified by two school types. Data were collected at both the school and child levels, involving 40 students in grades 1-4 at baseline and expanding to 50 students in grades 1-5 at endline, ten students per grade. The study tracked the same pupils, supplemented by additional and replacement students, resulting in effective sample sizes of 7,192 at baseline and 8,992 at endline. The results indicate that SBHE significantly improved hygiene practices; the average treatment effects on overall hygiene practices was 0.22 SD [0.14-0.31] (p < 0.001), and those on health/hygiene knowledge was 0.44 SD [0.33-0.55] (p < 0.001). While improvements in cold-related symptoms among the SBHE school children were marginally significant (-0.05 SD [-0.10, -0.01], p = 0.09), the overall trends indicated general improvement in health as well as healthy behaviours across all schools, irrespective of treatment status. Additional analysis incorporating inter-school spillover effects provided robust evidence of beneficial healthy practice externalities, extending beyond treatment school children. A cross-cutting soap provision treatment, although implemented imperfectly, did not show any standalone positive health-related effects. Nonetheless, our cost-effectiveness analysis indicated the economic viability of SBHE, particularly when accounting for spillover effects. This study is registered in the AEA RCT registry (No.0004265) and the ISRCTN registry (No.18002856).",

        "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are essential for individuals' health, well-being, survival, and economic development. A stakeholder-led approach to research prioritisation was essential to guide SRHR-related research in Bangladesh. Accordingly, we conducted a research prioritisation exercise to identify health research priorities related to SRHR in Bangladesh. We adopted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method for this study. Five themes - adolescent Health (AH), fertility, gynaecological issues (GI), maternal and neonatal health (MNH), and SRH of key populations (SRHKP) - were selected from the broader field of SRHR. Seventy-six experts submitted 454 research questions (RQs), which were then condensed into 197 unique RQs and distributed to all experts for scoring based on five pre-selected criteria. Weighted and unweighted research priority scores (RPS) and average expert agreement (AEA) were calculated to compile a list of top-ranked RQs. The weighted RPSs for the 197 RQs ranged from 0.944 to 0.623, with a median of 0.848. Among the top 20 list, six RQs belonged to AH, one to Fertility, two to GI, six to MNH, and five to SRHKP. For AH, top ranked RQs included adolescent pregnancy, sexual health education, and mental health. Promoting proper birth spacing among newlywed and underaged married women were top RQs for fertility. GI priorities emphasised early detection of gynaecological cancers, including HPV testing for cervical cancer screening. The MNH research focused on Newborn Stabilizing Units at sub-district hospitals, PPH bundle approaches, and counselling on danger signs to prevent adverse birth outcomes. The top-ranked RQs in SRHKP addressed stigma and discrimination towards key populations (KPs) and their impact on SRH behaviours. There was significant overlap between the top 20 RQs ranked by RPS and AEA. The study emphasises the need for intervention research to address barriers, assess effectiveness, and enhance the uptake of evidence-based and innovative interventions for SRHR in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Adenovirus (AdV) is a non-enveloped virus with a double-stranded DNA genome that can infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as cause conjunctivitis. The infection is influenced by the patient's age, environment, temperature, and immunocompromised individuals. Due to its wide range of symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, cough, and eye redness, the AdV virus presents a substantial health risk, particularly to children who are vulnerable due to their frequent touching of the mouth and face. Investigation of the epidemiology and economic impact of this infection is vital for public health. However, there is a lack of comprehensive data, underscoring the importance of shedding light on this subject. Most HAdV (Human adenovirus) infections in children and healthy individuals tend to resolve without medical intervention. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the virus from triggering severe epidemics by maintaining social and individual hygiene practices. Considering the COVID-19 situation, the emergence of another viral epidemic has the potential to present a substantial challenge to our healthcare system. This would lead to an increased burden on the general community, causing distress and health-related difficulties. It is imperative to establish and enhance the healthcare system's infrastructure and capacity to effectively manage future outbreaks. Neonates, immune-compromised individuals, and infants are particularly vulnerable to severe outcomes from this virus. To summarize, resolving the issues posed by viral infections necessitates comprehensive preventative methods to mitigate their social and economic consequences.",

        "abstract": "Implementation fidelity is critical for the efficient delivery of health services including leprosy services. Healthcare providers are important in monitoring the disease's progression, managing complications, and cross-checking prescribed medications. This study explored implementation fidelity in leprosy care and support for disability prevention and management in Rupandehi district, Nepal. A qualitative case study design was adopted based on implementation research principles. From 25th February to 30th April 2024, data were collected through multiple sources and methods, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and observation. Semi-structured interview guidelines and qualitative checklists facilitated the data collection process. Participants were chosen using purposive and selective sampling methods. The data were inductively coded using qualitative analysis software. Thematic analysis was done with codes generated and aggregated to form sub-themes and develop themes. The study revealed that healthcare providers consistently adhered to national leprosy operational guidelines, ensuring sufficient fidelity by prompt multi-drug therapy, case diagnosis, complicated case referral, and regular follow-up. In contrast, poor adherence was demonstrated in the complication management of lepra reactions, ulcer cases, and self-care. The major barriers to leprosy services were financial hardship, complication management, pill burden, drug side effects, and institutional obstacles. In contrast, the facilitators to leprosy services included adequate human resources, treatment supporter's involvement, effective communications, external development partner's role, transportation incentives, and local government support. Healthcare providers demonstrated sufficient adherence to leprosy operational guidelines. While significant gaps were evident in complication management, addressing financial and systematic barriers and leveraging facilitators is essential to strengthening leprosy care and support for disability prevention and management.",

        "abstract": "Despite the disproportionate burden of cancer morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), little is known about patients' care experiences in these settings. This study assesses which aspects of physician communication and care coordination most influence patients' overall experience with care, and factors associated with patient experience ratings, to inform quality improvement and improve cancer care experiences in LMICs. In a cross-sectional study of 1933 patients with advanced cancer recruited at 10 major public hospitals in seven LMICs in Asia, patients rated their experience with physician communication, care coordination and overall. Physician communication mattered most in patients' assessment of overall experience with care. Patient use of traditional medicine was associated with poorer physician communication ratings (β: -1.38, 95% CI: -2.11 to 0.65), while outpatient care (0.91, 95% CI: 0.24 to 1.57) was associated with higher ratings. Patients who were unsure (-0.77, 95% CI: -1.43 to -0.10) of their cancer stage (relative to aware of late-stage), or indicated financial difficulty (sufficient money to cover their daily needs fairly well (-0.77, 95% CI: -1.50 to -0.04) or poorly (-1.20, 95% CI: -2.30 to -0.09) relative to very well) rated care coordination lower. Patient experience ratings differed by minority group status and cancer severity understanding. Respondents identifying as ethnic minorities who were unsure of their cancer stage rated physician communication significantly higher (1.64, 95% CI: 0.71 to 2.58) than non-minorities aware of their advanced cancer. Non-minorities unsure of their cancer stage rated care coordination significantly lower (-1.00, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.36) than non-minority patients aware of their cancer stage. This study provides new understanding of care priorities among patients with advanced cancer in LMICs. Our findings highlight the importance patients attribute to physician communication and considerations for improving patient-centred communication to support equitable and culturally appropriate care. This study also underscores the need for future work navigating prognostic discussions in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Maternity care satisfaction for pregnant women and recently delivered mothers is linked to both short- and long-term complications. For health care providers, dissatisfaction can lead to high turnover, reduced efficiency, and decreased service quality. Increased midwifery care coverage enhances satisfaction; however, the Government of Bangladesh-sanctioned midwife positions are limited to the primary health care level only, not extending to secondary or tertiary health tiers. We aimed to evaluate the impact of introducing midwifery care at secondary-level health care facilities in Bangladesh by comparing the satisfaction levels of both providers and patients with those receiving regular care. We conducted a quasi-experimental study from September 2021 to December 2023 at two secondary-level health facilities - Sunamganj District Hospital (DH) (intervention) and Khagrachari DH (control). The primary outcome was the mean (x̄) percentage score of maternal satisfaction with antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) services, along with providers' satisfaction regarding their working environment, training, logistical support, and overall patient and service satisfaction at both facilities. We screened for eligibility a total of 200 pregnant women or recently delivered mothers who visited the facility for ANC, delivery, or PNC services. The satisfaction scores were significantly higher among women who received midwifery care compared to those who received regular care. The scores were for ANC x̄ = 97.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 96.6-99.0) vs. x̄ = 71.0 (95% CI = 68.7-73.4), for delivery x̄ = 97.9 (95% CI = 97.4-98.3) vs. x̄ = 83.3 (95% CI = 80.2-86.3), and for PNC x̄ = 97.5 (95% CI = 96.5-98.4) vs. x̄ = 77.7 (95% CI = 73.8-81.6). Similarly, the satisfaction score among midwives was significantly higher than among providers in regular care facilities (x̄ = 88.7; 95% CI = 82.9-94.5 vs. x̄ = 77.7; 95% CI = 73.0-82.3).

        "abstract": "South Asian countries are highly vulnerable to anemia- a condition affecting numerous children, women, and adolescents. Early detection and effective treatment of anemia could significantly reduce its prevalence. Therefore, in this study, we leveraged clinical records from a Bangladeshi Hospital to develop an adaptive machine learning framework designed to predict anemia by analyzing patients' hematological parameters. Our research includes comprehensive data exploration and introduces XAI-enhanced Tree-based models, which comprises four traditional machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, and Extra Trees Classifier. We addressed key data analytics challenges using various statistical methods, including outlier management with the Z-score test, feature skewness (and kurtosis) analysis, feature correlation assessment via the Pearson correlation technique, feature importance evaluation with the Random Forest Classifier, and a Z-test to determine the p-value of anemia-related features. Besides, the machine learning models are optimized by applying Grid Search hyperparameter tuning. Our fine-tuned Tree-driven models, particularly Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, demonstrated exceptional predictive performance in all the evaluation metrics. We also performed stratified cross-validation, computed 95 % bootstrap confidence intervals, and conducted permutation-based validation, which yielded a minimal p-value-all to ensure a rigorous evaluation of our models. Furthermore, exploratory data analysis and SHAP explainable plots revealed that 'hemoglobin level' is the most important risk factor with substantial influence on anemia diagnosis and decision-making. We utilized a parallel open-source dataset to validate our model's performance, and the experimental results highlighted our proposed pipelines superiority. Moreover, to support adoption in clinical settings, we developed an intuitive real-time prediction interface that provides a clinical risk score along with SHAP-based model explanations, enabling healthcare professionals to understand the reasoning behind each prediction. To conclude, we believe the introduced framework could serve as an AI-driven decision support system for anemia diagnosis, potentially offering a significant contribution to automating the healthcare industry.",

The aim of this study is to identify socioeconomic predictors of disability and examine the utilization of healthcare services among people with disabilities in Bangladesh. We used the first national representative, the National Household Survey on Persons with Disabilities (NSPD) 2021 survey data. The data utilized in our analysis came from 100,859 people who were at least 18 years old. Standard of living (henceforth referred to as wealth) was our proxy indicator of SES. The variables of interest for the outcome were the respondents' disability status and frequency of use of healthcare services. Adjusted odds ratio, relative, and slope inequality index are three regression-based techniques we utilized to evaluate different aspects of SES disparities in use of healthcare services and disability status. The prevalence of disability of our study sample was 3.40% and about 74.06% of people with disabilities have used healthcare services in the past three months. When compared to people in the poor SES group, people in the rich and middle SES group had 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.78) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.78-0.95) times lower chance of developing disability. When compared to individuals in the poor SES group, those in the rich and middle SES groups were 2.12 times (95% CI 1.55-2.89) and 1.39 times (95% CI 1.12-1.72) more likely to use of healthcare services. SES should be a key consideration in designing public health programs aimed at improving healthcare access and reducing disability prevalence in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "This study seeks to investigate willingness to receive vaccination against NTDs using mRNA-based vaccines in various Asian countries, including China. Between June and December 2023, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was carried out in five countries. The survey assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding mRNA vaccines and their potential impact on vaccination acceptance. The majority indicated being somewhat willing (44.9%), 19.3% expressed extreme willingness. High knowledge scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-2.96] were associated with higher willingness to receive mRNA-based NTD vaccines. Participants from Bangladesh recorded the highest proportion expressed willingness (51.4%), followed by China (15.9%). Vietnam (15.4%) and Malaysia (14.8%). Pakistan (11.0%) and India (11.3%) recorded lowest proportions of willingness. Understanding the mechanism of mRNA vaccines and awareness of the difference between mRNA vaccines and conventional ones are knowledge items that significantly predict acceptance. Concerns regarding potential unknown side effects associated with mRNA-based approaches, and the perception that traditional vaccine development methods are safer, negatively correlate with willingness. Conversely, the belief in the advantages of mRNA-based approaches, such as rapid development, heightened potency, and reduced cost, positively correlates with willingness. High overall knowledge and attitudes scores were associated with a higher willingness to receive vaccines. The younger age group and females demonstrated a greater vaccination acceptance. Overall, the study highlights both opportunities and challenges in promoting the uptake of mRNA-based vaccines against NTDs in Asia countries. The study provides insights into enhancing knowledge and fostering positive attitudes toward mRNA-based vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-pocket (OOP) cost of cancer treatment has increased substantially globally. In low- and middle-income countries, many patients face financial distress due to cancer. For patients with cancers in Bangladesh, this study aimed to (1) estimate the annual OOP cost of cancers from households' perspective, (2) assess the coping strategies and financial distress, and (3) examine factors associated with OOP cost. We used data from a cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted in three randomly selected hospitals in Bangladesh. A bottom-up micro-costing approach was used to estimate the OOP cost components. We used the logistic regression model and the generalized linear model to examine the determinants of distress financing and OOP cost, respectively. The average annual OOP cost per cancer patient was US$ 6,504 (range, US$ 959 - 29,681), which was greater than 2 times the average annual household income. About 90% of households faced distress financing due to cancer. Having at least one comorbid condition, cancer stage 2 or higher, households having no elderly people, or having treatment abroad was significantly associated with a higher OOP cost compared to those without the condition. OOP cost of cancer treatment and the proportions of patients with distress financing and financial catastrophe are alarmingly high in Bangladesh. Earlier cancer diagnosis and implementation of Government financial health protection schemes are crucial and urgent to alleviate the enormous economic burden and ensure equitable access to care for the patients.",

        "title": "Investigating the psychometric properties of the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) among Bangladeshi adolescent girls.",
        "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) affect many reproductive-aged women and can significantly impact their quality of life, including academic performance, relationships, and mental health, perhaps even leading to suicidal behavior. However, there was no validated, robust, and psychometrically sound instrument to screen for symptoms in the Bangladeshi context. This study aimed to translate and adapt a widely used instrument, the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST) in the Bangladeshi context, and to assess the prevalence of PMS and PMDD among adolescent girls in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 939 adolescent girls in Bangladesh aged 11-19 years using the \"Konnect\" platform of a2i between April to October 2022. Data were collected through a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire that included informed consent, socio-demographic information, menstrual history, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), and the PSST scale. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics and confirmatory factor analysis, was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25.0) and IBM SPSS Amos (version 26.0). Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the Bangla version of the PSST with depression, anxiety, and stress subscales of the DASS-21. The prevalence estimates of moderate to severe PMS and PMDD were 33.16%, and 19.05%, respectively. Item-level analysis showed that the measurement items were normally distributed which suggested measurement of the same construct. The Bangla version of the PSST demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.96) and convergent validity. The total PSST score was positively and significantly correlated with depression (r = 0.54), anxiety (r = 0.50), and stress (r = 0.50), suggesting convergent validity. The scale-level psychometric properties were satisfactory, indicating an excellent fit to the data and supporting convergent validity. The Bangla version of the PSST was found to be a valid screening tool for assessing PMS in women in Bangladesh. It will help to identify and address their healthcare needs, promote well-being, and advance further research in the Bangladeshi context.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) regained its position as the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious disease agent in 2024. Delayed diagnosis and treatment hamper effective TB control. We investigated the duration of diagnostic and treatment delay along with the associated factors among people with pulmonary TB in Bangladesh. A mixed-method study was conducted between December'19 and March'21, at icddr,b TB Screening and Treatment Centres (TBSTCs), Dhaka. We interviewed people with TB (PWTB) seeking care at these TBSTCs using a structured questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare seeking behaviors. We used established frameworks to define stages of delay and associated factors. Qualitative interviews were conducted among a subset of participants to gain further insight into the factors associated with delay. We enrolled 895 PWTB with mean (±SD) age 36.6 (±16.1) years; majority of participants were males (69.9%) and living in urban areas (82.3%). The median (IQR) patient delay estimated was 47 (29-72) days, with diagnostic delay 45 (30-70) days and treatment delay 2 (2-4) days. The predictors of delay were those with diabetes (OR 2.0, 95% CI - 1.11, 3.42), who initially self-treated (OR 2.1, 95% CI - 1.09, 3.88), and were bacteriologically diagnosed (OR 3.7, 95% CI - 1.31, 10.46). Qualitative approach supported the quantitative findings and revealed the practice of visiting formal physicians during worsening illness, neglecting to acknowledge signs or symptoms consistent with TB, lack of TB related knowledge, and financial insolvency as major reasons for delay. Our findings showed that improper health-seeking behavior is one of the major drivers of patient delay. Thus, targeted programmatic intervention to raise community awareness on TB and its care services with a special focus on informal providers can help reduce this delay.",

        "abstract": "The health system is required to be safe, equitable, and accessible to all ages, gender, and vulnerable groups, including older persons and persons with disability, and address their specific needs and concerns. However, limited evidence is available on the effectiveness and practicality of gender and protection mainstreaming interventions in health response in humanitarian crises. The overall objective of the research was to explore practices, gaps, and challenges and generate recommendations regarding gender and protection mainstreaming in health response to the Rohingya refugee crisis in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The research employed a qualitative case study design to explore the practice of gender and protection mainstreaming in health response in Cox's Bazar. Data collection methods include an extensive literature review and in-depth interviews with professionals. The professionals interviewed from the area of health and protection, specifically gender, child protection, emergency health intervention, and primary health activities. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis related to gender and protection mainstreaming. Limitations were assessed as to researcher bias because the researcher did all the coding; however, an open recording process, inter-literature cross-potentiation, and ethical considerations of research helped add to the reliability of the research. Exclusion criteria were defined to ensure data consistency, removing insufficiently detailed responses not pertinent to the research objectives. The study found a range of good practices on gender and protection mainstreaming in health response, e.g., placement of a gender action plan, monitoring system for gender and disability inclusion, emergency preparedness and response system, availability of sex-segregated toilets and waiting spaces, availability of gender-based violence service and engagement of female community health workers. The study also revealed some best practices which have the potential to scale up, e,g. psychosocial spaces at health facilities for children, palliative care for terminally ill patients, integrated medical and protection services, and facilitation of community health facility support groups. Critical gaps were found in the areas of women's leadership, coordination, capacity building, targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, infrastructural adaptation and consultation with the community on their concerns. We urge policymakers, sector coordinators, health program management, healthcare workers, and global stakeholders to address the gaps and challenges, learn and scale up the best practices, and take action to implement the study's recommendations to maximise gender and protection mainstreaming in health response.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge and belief about antibiotic use are important modifiers of antibiotic-associated health practices and, thereby, its resistance. Rural people's knowledge and belief about antibiotic use and their determinants largely remained unexplored in Bangladesh. Hence, this study was aimed. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2016 to March 2017 in Upazila Health Complex, Matlab South, Chandpur, Bangladesh. Adult (≥18 years) residents of the study area coming for health service were approached and a total of 184 participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a pre-tested structured questionnaire including questions on knowledge and belief regarding antibiotic use. Informed verbal consent was taken before inclusion. The principles laid out by World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki were following during all the procedures of this study. Data analysis was done in STATA© Version 16.0. The average age of the participants was 37.45±13.32 years (SD) with a female predominance (61.4%). Of all, 63.0% knew about antibiotics, and out of them 59.5% self-prescribed the drug. Among participants who knew about antibiotics 63.9% (n=73) had good knowledge and 47.8% had appropriate belief. On multivariable logistic regression, higher education (SSC and above) (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.02 - 21.38) and use of the internet and social media (OR 8.27, 95% CI 1.51-45.33) were found to be significant predictors of good knowledge regarding antibiotic use. Moreover, belief regarding antibiotic use showed a significant positive linear association with knowledge (Spearman's rho=0.4797, p<0.001). The study found that nearly one-third of rural people had poor knowledge and more than half had inappropriate belief about antibiotic use among rural people in Bangladesh. Authorities and policymakers should urgently address the situation to resist the threat of widespread antibiotic resistance.",

It has an enormous impact on mothers, families, health care professionals and the community. Bangladesh has high stillbirth rate due to lack of access to antenatal care, home trial, high parity, social norms and customs etc. Multiple maternal and fetal risk factors have been identified that are associated with stillbirth. This study is intended to provide information for proper antepartum surveillance and also build up awareness in the community to prevent perinatal mortality. Objective of this study was evaluation of risk factors associated with stillbirth. This was cross-sectional observational study conducted from 10th February 2019 to 10th August 2019. Consecutive 100 pregnant women admitted in Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of MMCH and had delivered stillbirth baby were included in the study. Data was collected through a pre-designed questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS Version 26.0. In this study, 76.0% women were found between 20 to 30 years of age. Most of the women studied were gravida second and third (72.0%). Most stillbirth baby were preterm with gestational age between 35 to 36 weeks (60.0%). Maternal hypertensive disorder was the commonest medical disorder associated with stillbirth (34.0%), followed by DM (6.0%). Obstetric complications associated with stillbirth were PROM (12.0%), prolonged labour (8.0%), obstructed labour (5.0%), abruptio placentae (6.0%), placenta praevia (2.0%) and cord accident (6.0%). Fetal factor accounted for 8.0% of stillbirth of which majority was due to multiple congenital anomalies (6.0%). Apparently no identifiable risk factors were found in 8.0% cases. It was observed that maternal hypertensive disorders were the predominant risk factors of stillbirth. Majority of women had emergency admission and did not receive adequate antenatal care at all. Significant proportion of stillbirth was preventable by proper and regular antenatal checkup, timely referral and hospital delivery.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare at a fast pace, showing promising potential to enhance medical diagnosis, inform treatment strategies, and support patient care. These advancements have the potential to improve clinical outcomes, streamline workflows, and reduce errors. However, comprehending the level of acceptance among medical professionals and the institutional challenges involved in implementing AI is essential. This scoping review aimed to identify the acceptance of AI among medical professionals and to identify the institutional barriers that impede its widespread implementation. A scoping review methodology was applied to analyze studies published between 2015 and 2025. The review included peer-reviewed articles focusing on medical professionals' perspectives on AI adoption, including factors like acceptance, attitudes, benefits, and challenges. Key databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore were searched to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant research. Data were extracted and categorized into themes related to AI acceptance, barriers, and institutional challenges. Two major themes emerged: (1) medical professionals' acceptance of AI and (2) institutional challenges to implementation. AI tools used in diagnostic imaging, administrative support, and natural language processing were generally well accepted due to perceived efficiency and accuracy. Conversely, predictive models and clinical decision support systems received cautious responses, primarily due to concerns about interpretability, trust, and autonomy. Institutional barriers included limited infrastructure, lack of integration with existing health records, financial constraints, inadequate training opportunities, and regulatory ambiguities regarding liability, privacy, and fairness. While AI holds transformative potential for healthcare, its successful adoption requires addressing both human and systemic factors. Enhancing AI literacy, investing in infrastructure, and developing clear regulatory guidelines are critical to overcoming resistance and enabling meaningful integration.",

        "abstract": "The rate of caesarean sections (C-sections) is increasing globally, with many procedures being performed without clinical indication. We aimed to explore whether implementing the eight antenatal care visits that include health education and four ultrasonographic examinations (intervention group (IG)) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) would reduce unnecessary C-sections among Bangladeshi pregnant women in comparison to the usual four antenatal care and two ultrasonogram exams (comparison group (CG)) currently in use within the country's healthcare system. We designed a randomised controlled trial that included two tertiary and two non-tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. The randomisation was done at the hospital level, whereby we randomly allocated the hospitals to the IG or CG, with one tertiary and one non-tertiary hospital in each arm. We conducted this trial between November 2021 and December 2022. Pregnant women of all ages without any complications requiring C-sections were enrolled in the allocated IG and CG hospitals. The primary outcome was the reduction in the number of unnecessary C-sections. We considered unnecessary C-sections when there was no proper indication for caesarean delivery. Alongside descriptive analysis, we used adjusted log-linear regression models to investigate the relationship between unnecessary C-sections and various contributing factors. We enrolled 288 pregnant women from two intervention and two comparison hospitals, with 144 assigned to the IG and 144 to the CG (72 from each hospital). There were 183 complete, successful deliveries in total (50.27% in IG vs. 49.73% in CG; P = 0.903). Of these, 106 resulted in C-sections (39.62% in IG and 60.38% in CG; P = 0.001), with 70 assessed as being necessary (47.14% in IG and 52.86% in CG; P = 0.027) and 36 as being unnecessary (25% in IG and 75% in CG). There were significantly fewer unnecessary C-sections among the women in the IG (P = 0.027), who also had a significantly lower risk ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence interval = 0.54-0.77, P < 0.001) compared to the CG. Our findings indicate that the WHO-recommended antenatal visits and their interventions were effective in reducing unnecessary C-sections by 50%. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05135026.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory disorders cause approximately 4 million deaths annually worldwide, making them the third leading cause of mortality. Early detection is critical to improving survival rates and recovery outcomes. However, chest X-rays require expertise, and computational intelligence provides valuable support to improve diagnostic accuracy and support medical professionals in decision-making. This study presents an automated system to classify respiratory diseases using three diverse datasets comprising 18,000 chest X-ray images and masks, categorized into six classes. Image preprocessing techniques, such as resizing for input standardization and CLAHE for contrast enhancement, were applied to ensure uniformity and improve the visual quality of the images. Albumentations-based augmentation methods addressed class imbalances, while bitwise segmentation focused on extracting the region of interest (ROI). Furthermore, clinically handcrafted feature extraction enabled the accurate identification of 20 critical clinical features essential for disease classification. The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) graph construction technique was utilized to transform tabular data into graph structures for effective node classification. We employed feature analysis to identify critical attributes that contribute to class predictions within the graph structure. Additionally, the GNNExplainer was utilized to validate these findings by highlighting significant nodes, edges, and features that influence the model's decision-making process. The proposed model, Chest X-ray Graph Neural Network (CHXGNN), a robust Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture, incorporates advanced layers, batch normalization, dropout regularization, and optimization strategies. Extensive testing and ablation studies demonstrated the model's exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.56 %. Our CHXGNN model shows significant potential in detecting and classifying respiratory diseases, promising to enhance diagnostic efficiency and improve patient outcomes in respiratory healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is essential for reducing mortality rates and improving clinical outcomes. However, deep learning (DL) models used in healthcare face significant challenges, including concerns about data privacy, domain-specific overfitting, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose BreastSwinFedNetX, a federated learning (FL)-enabled ensemble system that combines four hierarchical variants of the Swin Transformer (Tiny, Small, Base, and Large) with a Random Forest (RF) meta-learner. By utilizing FL, our approach ensures collaborative model training across decentralized and institution-specific datasets while preserving data locality and preventing raw patient data exposure. The model exhibits strong generalization and performs exceptionally well across five benchmark datasets-BreakHis, BUSI, INbreast, CBIS-DDSM, and a Combined dataset-achieving an F1 score of 99.34% on BreakHis, a PR AUC of 98.89% on INbreast, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 99.61% on the Combined dataset. To enhance transparency and clinical adoption, we incorporate explainable AI (XAI) through Grad-CAM, which highlights class-discriminative features. Additionally, we deploy the model in a real-time web application that supports uncertainty-aware predictions and clinician interaction and ensures compliance with GDPR and HIPAA through secure federated deployment. Extensive ablation studies and paired statistical analyses further confirm the significance and robustness of each architectural component. By integrating transformer-based architectures, secure collaborative training, and explainable outputs, BreastSwinFedNetX provides a scalable and trustworthy AI solution for real-world breast cancer diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a pivotal role in preventing healthcare-associated infections by adhering to infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. This study assessed IPC knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among HCWs at tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. From September 2020 to January 2021, semistructured questionnaires were administered to physicians, nurses, and cleaning staff at 11 tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. KAP components were classified into \"good,\" \"fair,\" and \"poor\" based on the frequency of favorable responses (>75%, 50%-75%, <50%). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices. We enrolled 1728 HCWs, including 526 physicians (30.4%), 934 nurses (54.1%), and 268 cleaning staff (15.5%). Physicians and nurses demonstrated \"good\" IPC knowledge (median 94.8% and 96.6% favorable responses, respectively) and self-reported IPC practices (median 76.2% and 80.4% favorable responses). However, most cleaning staff exhibited \"poor\" IPC knowledge (median 47.3% favorable responses) and practices (21.3% favorable responses). Across all categories of HCWs, the median attitude score was \"fair\" (range 60.0%-71.2% favorable responses). Having a positive attitude toward IPC was associated with increased IPC knowledge (adjusted odds ratio 3.0, P < .001) and good IPC practices (adjusted odds ratio 16.3, P < .001). HCW's KAP toward IPC was found to be suboptimal, especially among cleaning staff. However, the strong association noted between favorable attitudes toward IPC and adherence to safe IPC practices demonstrates the need for hospital leadership to promote a positive IPC culture, in addition to training and resources, to improve IPC practices and enhance healthcare resiliency beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "Indigenous peoples across the world are at disproportionate risk of mental health problems. Colonial hegemony, cultural infiltration, language loss, land grabbing, limited access to healthcare services, including mental health, and geographical isolation - all in synergy - contribute to the heightened risk of developing mental health problems. Epistemic injustice, apparently unrelated, yet another major determinant - can also contribute to the higher prevalence of mental health problems among Indigenous peoples. Systemic exclusion and marginalization of Indigenous people from the generation, dissemination, and validation of knowledge - the central concept of epistemic injustice - provides an opportunity to reflect on the disproportionate rates of mental health problems. If epistemic injustice is left unaddressed, the impetus for Indigenous peoples to participate in conventional health practices would be greatly impeded. In this article, I present the case of Bangladesh, where the conventional mental healthcare system has historically been ignorant of the inclusion of Indigenous people's perspectives and lived experiences, eventually perpetuating epistemic injustice. Finally, I provide a framework to address epistemic injustices to reform mental healthcare in Bangladesh that can inform a system equipped with equitability, accessibility, cultural sensitivity, human rights, social justice, and collaborative alliance - key tenets of global mental health.",

        "abstract": "Digital phenotyping (DP), the process of using data from digital devices, such as smartphones and wearable technology to understand and monitor people's behavior, health, and daily activities, has shown significant promise in mental health care within high-income countries. However, its application in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited, particularly among impoverished populations such as slum residents. This study investigates the awareness, knowledge, acceptance, and implementation of DP, including willingness to share data, and concerns regarding privacy and data security, among residents of Dhaka's Korail slum, one of Bangladesh's largest and most densely populated informal settlements. Understanding awareness, acceptance, and privacy concerns surrounding DP in these settings is critical for its effective implementation. We conducted 8 focus group discussions with 79% (30/38) of female participants (mean age 37, SD 13.7 years). Participants included 20 individuals diagnosed with serious mental disorders and 18 caregivers. The focus group discussions also included a section explaining what DP is. Smartphone ownership was reported by 45% (17/38) of the participants, while 92% (35/38) of the participants had access to a smartphone through family members. There was a general lack of awareness about DP among the participants. Initially, 92% (35/38) of participants had no prior knowledge of DP, but after receiving an explanation, they acknowledged its potential applications and benefits. Participants recognized the use of DP for health monitoring, particularly in managing mental health conditions. Participants expressed willingness to share certain types of data, particularly phone usage and location data, provided that content-level information remained private. Despite these perceived benefits, significant concerns about privacy and data security emerged. Participants expressed fears about the potential misuse of their personal information, with some feeling resigned to the idea of already being constantly monitored. Trust in DP tools emerged as a critical factor for adoption, highlighting the need for transparent data protection policies and user control over data sharing. Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of adapting DP tools to local contexts, including cultural considerations and technological literacy. While DP presents a promising avenue for mental health support in underserved urban populations, its adoption in LMIC slum settings requires targeted educational initiatives, robust privacy safeguards, and community involvement to ensure trust and usability. DP tools should be adapted to fit the cultural context of the target population, possibly involving modifications to the types of data collected or the way data are interpreted. While DP holds potential to improve mental health care in underserved communities, addressing barriers related to awareness, privacy, culture, and usability is crucial. Focusing on educational initiatives, robust data protection, cultural adaptation, user-friendly design, and community engagement, DP can become a valuable tool in bridging the mental health care gap in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Evidence regarding the impact of the private health sector on healthcare outcomes is often fragmented. Knowledge gaps remain around the impact of private sector care on health outcomes. This systematic review examines the quality of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care delivery by private sector providers. The review aims to systematically assess the evidence from studies reporting outcome data on morbidity and mortality among mothers, newborns, and children. Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, EconLit, Excerpta Medica Database, International Bibliography of the Social Science, Popline, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) and two websites and supplemented with hand-searches and expert recommendations. We conducted the searches and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA method. For inclusion, studies in low- and middle-income countries must have examined at least one of the following primary outcomes: maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, newborn morbidity, newborn mortality, child morbidity, or child mortality. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 46 studies included, most studies were conducted in India, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Kenya. Thirty-six studies were quantitative, and over one-third implemented a specific intervention that went beyond the broad delivery of quality care in the private sector. Studies indicated that the outcomes of private sector delivery of MNCH care across health systems were mixed. Studies frequently reported on the utilization of health facilities for the treatment of morbidities. Interventions to improve MNCH care included improved coverage and contracting services, community-based training, and public-private partnerships. Studies often did not provide greater contextual detail, including the complexities and realities of people seeking care across provider types. Future research should disaggregate data on quality of care, as well as describe the methods and specific facility details in their sample.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically map available evidence on menopause-related knowledge, symptoms and management in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and identify critical gaps to inform research and policy. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies were those that reported on menopause-related knowledge, symptom prevalence or management in LMICs. Data were extracted and synthesised descriptively and thematically. From 10,758 records, 252 studies from 41 LMICs were included. Most were cross-sectional (85%) and relied on non-probability sampling (62%), with only 4% being nationally representative. Menopause classification methods were often inconsistent, with only 17.5% of studies using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) +10 or World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. National-level data on age at menopause are lacking across all LMICs. The prevalences of vasomotor symptoms, joint pain and sexual concerns were comparable with high-income countries. However, data on the severity and burden of symptoms were scarce. Knowledge about menopause and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was poor, especially in low-income and rural settings. Cultural stigma, misconceptions and healthcare provider knowledge gaps contributed to low uptake of evidence-based menopause care. MHT use was consistently low, with women predominantly using traditional remedies. Provider hesitancy, lack of training and structural health system barriers were key limitations in service delivery. Despite a growing population of postmenopausal women, menopause remains a neglected health issue across LMICs. There is an urgent need to integrate menopause into reproductive and non-communicable disease policies, invest in provider education and ensure equitable access to evidence-based menopause care, including MHT, for women in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Despite the significance of internal migration as an important social determinant of health that could potentially affect the utilization of maternal healthcare services, the magnitude of this relationship by different migration streams is yet to be fully explored in Bangladesh. This study using Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data, 2017-18 examined the effects of different migration streams on maternal healthcare service utilization, particularly four or more antenatal care (≥4 ANC) visits and institutional delivery (ID) care services. The analysis identified significant variations in using antenatal and institutional delivery care services between migrants and non-migrants. The rural non-migrants were found to be the most disadvantaged group, particularly when different forms of migration streams were considered. For instance, after adjusting for covariates, urban to urban migrants (≥4 ANC = 1.866, <i>p</i> < 0.01; ID = 2.247, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and urban to rural migrants (≥ 4 ANC = 1.24, <i>p</i> > 0.05; ID = 1.689, <i>p</i> < 0.05) were more likely to utilize both types of maternal healthcare services than rural non-migrants. However, migrants of all streams were less likely to use any type of maternal healthcare services when compared against the urban non-migrants. Addressing the effects of migration in designing and implementing maternal healthcare service delivery programs may address the needs and challenges faced by migrants.",

Home-based programmes provide an affordable model of delivery that can leverage a scalable increase in CR access in LMICs. ACROSS (Affordable Cardiac Rehabilitation: An Outreach Inter-disciplinary Strategic Study) seeks to co-develop (with patients, caregivers, clinicians, and service commissioners) a culturally and contextually applicable and affordable home-based programme for people with the multimorbidity of coronary heart disease and/or heart failure with co-existing depression and/or anxiety and evaluate the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of its implementation in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan and to determine its scalability and sustainability. Four linked work packages (WPs). WP1 (cultural adaptation/refinement of home-based rehabilitation): examine rehabilitation implementation barriers/enablers from multiple stakeholder perspectives and co-develop a feasible and acceptable culturally & contextually adapted home-based programme, extended to take account of co-existing depression and/or anxiety; WP2 (external pilot): assess feasibility/acceptability of the co-developed rehabilitation intervention and study design and processes necessary for a full-scale trial; WP3: (multicentre/multi-country hybrid effectiveness and implementation randomised trial) determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a culturally adapted home-based rehabilitation intervention for people with coronary heart disease and/or heart failure and depression and/or anxiety; WP4 (capacity building): build research and rehabilitation delivery capacity.

Although there have been notable advancements on this continent, progress in maternal healthcare access has been slow. Inequalities remain in different maternal health services across diverse population groups. The aim of this study is to better understand the socioeconomic inequalities in maternal healthcare access in South Asian countries. Two databases (MEDLINE and Google Scholar) were searched for identifying studies. Studies with data on socioeconomic factors, maternal healthcare, inequality, and South-Asian countries were included. Mixed method appraisal tool was used for quality assessment of the identified studies. A total of 55 studies from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan were included in the final analysis. Overall, quantitative study showed that maternal healthcare access is linked to economic status, education, occupation, and women's autonomy. Qualitative studies demonstrated poverty, lack of awareness of complication and service and inability in decision making on healthcare was the reason for not accessing maternal health care. Significant finding from this review includes effect of education mostly evident after secondary education and paternal occupation was significant rather than maternal occupation. Findings of this review indicates a large disparity in access to maternal health care services. Policymakers should create interventions and financial schemes that are tailored to the mothers from low socioeconomic background.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), a commonly diagnosed malignancy, is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To effectively lower the death rate from this disease, it is essential to create public health methods, including developing new biomarkers that facilitate screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response prediction. CRC-derived Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle that transport functional molecules like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and noncoding RNA), and other metabolites, which act as molecular cargos to facilitate transportation. Exosomes generated and secreted from cancer cells are key biomarkers for early, noninvasive cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response, with their biogenesis in CRC offering molecular insights. Their expression varies across time, tissues, and disease stages. Thus, the development of innovative and effective techniques for isolating and detecting exosomes holds great potential for tumor diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and developing techniques (MSC-derived exosome, DC-derived exosome, engineered exosome, etc.) and their contents to improve the specificity and efficacy of therapies for patients with CRC. This review explores the features and formation of CRC-derived exosomes, highlighting their diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance through a comprehensive analysis of exosome extraction, identification, purification, and documented biological roles in existing literature.",

        "abstract": "Dementia is a growing global public health concern, particularly in LMICs like Bangladesh. With population aging, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia; care facilities are limited. This scarcity of services places a significant responsibility on untrained family caregivers, impacting the health of persons with dementia and their caregivers. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving dementia care, especially in resource-constrained settings. Recognizing the urgency, the WHO developed an online self-training manual, iSupport, emphasizing education, skill development, and support for caregivers. This study aims to test feasibility of iSupport i) in improving knowledge about dementia and dementia care among family and formal caregivers, and ii) reducing family caregivers' stress and improving their caregiving skills, mental health, quality of life and relationship with the person with dementia cared for. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SAJIDA Foundation (2024-005-SFIRB). This non-randomized feasibility study aims to recruit 44 family caregivers and 132 formal caregivers from Dhaka, Bangladesh, using a purposive sampling technique. Participants will be provided access to iSupport for two months. Pre- and post-intervention surveys will be conducted to assess changes in knowledge about dementia care among both family and formal caregivers, as well as changes in psychological well-being among family caregivers. To assess knowledge retention, a follow-up survey will be conducted. Any differences in the outcomes from the pre-intervention period will be tested against the null hypothesis of zero mean difference using a two-sample paired t-test. Additionally, multivariable regression techniques will also be used to control for possible confounders. To understand the facilitators and barriers of implementing iSupport, a qualitative approach will be used to interview 15 family caregivers and conduct four FGDs with formal caregivers. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive content analysis approach.",

        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

        "title": "Awareness about cervical cancer and its socio-economic determinants among adults in Bangladesh: Results from a nationwide cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health issue now and is the second leading cancer among women in Bangladesh, caused primarily by Human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite effective vaccination and screening methods, awareness and access to preventive methods are limited in developing regions. This nationwide study aims to explore socio-economic and cultural factors affecting cervical cancer awareness in Bangladesh and generate evidence-based recommendations for tailoring suitable health promotion strategies for the country. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to evaluate cervical cancer awareness among adults aged 18 years and above. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed for this research, keeping in mind the local sociocultural contexts. Face-to-face interviews were conducted after getting the participants' consent and making sure they understood all the questions. After checking for data quality and consistency, responses of 2,151 participants were finally retained. The collected data was analyzed using STATA (Version 17) statistical software. The majority (80.15%) of the participants were aware of cervical cancer, with healthcare workers being the primary source of information. Higher awareness rates were noted among married individuals (80.88%), urban dwellers (83.24%), those with more education (average 11.96 ± 4.36 years), individuals with higher income (88.17%), and those belonging to nuclear families (82.86%). Healthcare professionals had significantly greater awareness (98.91%) compared to other occupations. Participants undergoing regular health checkups were more informed and the association was statistically significant (87.03%, p < 0.001). Univariate and multiple logistic regression models revealed that each additional year of education increased the probability of being aware by 16-20%. Men had significantly lower odds of being aware compared to women (Adjusted Odds Ratio AOR = 0.41, β = -0.895, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.70, p = 0.001 in the multiple logistic regression analysis). Similarly, respondents not cohabitating with their spouse were less aware than those who were living with partners (AOR = 0.47, β = -0.750, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.81, p = 0.006). Income levels conversely influenced awareness level, participants from the highest income group (earning 35,001-50,000 BDT) had 47% lower odds (AOR = 0.53, β = -0.629, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.80, p = 0.002) of awareness compared to the lowest income group (earning ≤20,000 BDT). Despite the widespread awareness of cervical cancer among most Bangladeshi adults, there remains a notable gap, particularly among certain demographics. Since the study identified healthcare workers, social media, and mass media as major sources of information, targeted educational campaigns through media channels and outreach activities by healthcare workers might effectively enhance nationwide awareness of cervical cancer.",

        "abstract": "Buprenorphine is a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for opioid use disorder. However, individuals with opioid use disorder often report information needs regarding buprenorphine treatment on social media platforms such as Reddit. The field lacks a systematic approach to organizing these data and characterizing treatment information needs that may be unique and unavailable elsewhere. In this study, we curated and analyzed large-scale data from social media to characterize self-reported buprenorphine treatment information needs using a qualitative analysis. We collected 15,253 Reddit posts from the subreddit r/Suboxone. Following a standard protocol and guidance from clinical experts, we first identified 5 main themes from the data and then manually coded 6000 posts based on these themes. Finally, we determined the most frequently appearing topics within each theme by analyzing samples from each group. Among the 6000 posts, 2417 (40.3%) contained a single theme, 2160 (36%) contained two themes, and 834 (13.9%) contained three themes. The most frequent topics found across these themes included reports of psychological and physical effects during recovery, complexities in accessing buprenorphine, and significant information gaps regarding medication administration, tapering, and substance use at different stages of recovery. Moreover, self-treatment strategies and peer-driven advice revealed potential rumors and misinformation. Our findings can guide the design of interventions to improve patient education and communication. They also help address knowledge gaps and misinformation related to treatment. Additionally, the results can support hypothesis generation for future clinical research on medication for opioid use disorder treatment.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the demographic, temporal, and spatial characteristics of animal bite (AB) cases in humans across 12 Upazilas within Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Retrospective hospital-based data from individual AB cases for 2022 and 2023 were collected from S.K Hospital. The dataset included information on victim demographics, bite details, vaccination information, and Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) administration. Additionally, monthly case counts from 2016 to 2024 were sourced and analyzed to identify trends. Descriptive statistics and time series analysis using the seasonal decomposition technique were conducted. Risk maps for animal bites in 2022 and 2023 were generated using a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) approach. An almost two-fold increase in the proportion of category 3 bites receiving RIG from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% in 2023 was noted. Only 9.7% (2022) and 16.9% (2023) of bite victims received PEP on the day of exposure, whereas 76.5% (2022) and 84.6% (2023) received PEP within 24 hours. Moreover, significant seasonal patterns and annual increasing trends in AB cases were observed. Males and children under 14 years old had a higher risk of being bitten. Dogs (48.2% in 2022) and cats (52.6% in 2023) were identified as the primary animals responsible for the bites. Notably, the legs were the body part most frequently bitten. The bites risk map identified four high risk Upazilas. Despite improvements in PEP coverage achieved within 24 hours, a critical gap remains in same-day PEP coverage in both years. The study results also suggest other potential improvements in healthcare practices or treatment protocols, and the need for a veterinary surveillance system. Increasing AB cases highlight the need to enhance surveillance and control measures. Targeted awareness campaigns tailored to high-risk groups such as males and children under 14 years of age, along with preventive programs focused on dogs are imperative. Coordinated One Health efforts among healthcare professionals, veterinarians, policymakers, and community stakeholders are crucial to effectively mitigate the incidence of AB cases, safeguarding public health and eliminate dog mediated rabies by 2030 in the region.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains high in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, driven by preventable causes such as inadequate health care access and delays in receiving care in health facilities, highlighting the need for improved support in health facilities. This study aimed to explore the opportunities and difficulties of introducing 'Welcome Persons', a hospital navigation and support cadre for pregnant women, from the perspectives of recipients, patients' attendance, health care providers, and facility managers. This qualitative study was conducted from 15 March to 30 April 2023, in the District Hospital of Gaibandha, Bangladesh. Data were collected through purposive sampling from health care providers, facility managers, 'Welcome Persons', pregnant and delivered women, and their attendants, utilising observations, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, and analytical approaches to ensure scientific rigour. Thematic analysis was performed. The study revealed the positive influence of 'Welcome Person' in maternal health care provision by ensuring timely services, preventing outsiders' interference, as well as contributing to prompt emergency management, specifically for educationally disadvantaged patients. The triangulated perspectives of the participants highlighted the overall acceptance and usefulness of the 'Welcome Persons' but also discovered challenges such as a lack of human resources on the night shift, logistical constraints, and potential gender insensitivity by the recipients. The study findings provided an explicit understanding of the 'Welcome Persons' intervention for facilitating maternal health care services and navigation among pregnant women. While they were well-received, addressing identified barriers is crucial for a sustainable positive impact on maternal health care in secondary health facility settings in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear family structures and lack of intimacy among household members, brief time for food preparation, along with other factors, have greatly altered consumers' food consumption and selection. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) level among street food consumers and vendors regarding food safety. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among street food consumers (n = 300) and vendors (n = 300) in Jashore district, Bangladesh. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore the factors associated with the KAP level of the respondents. The average knowledge mean (SD) score was found to be 17.23 (3.54) (good) among the vendors, and the average knowledge mean (SD) score was identified as 12.07 (2.83) (good) among the consumers. On the other hand, the average attitude score was found to be 26.59 (4.99) (medium) among the vendors, and the average attitude score was identified as 18.71 (4.08) (medium) among the consumers. We also observed that the vendors had an average practice score of 25.11 (6.25) (medium), while the consumers had an average practice score of 16.18 (4.82) (medium). Education level was found to be associated with the KAP level of the respondents. In conclusion, knowledge outweighs food safety attitudes and practices for both vendors and consumers. Awareness-raising campaigns might be conducted to enhance the food safety attitudes and practices of the respondents. However, the national education curriculum should also prioritize food safety-related issues and various concepts to enhance awareness among street food consumers and vendors.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare Waste Management (HCWM) contributes to environmental pollution and health hazards. There are several established approaches to measure environmental and health impacts from HCWM. Amidst, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one of the most popular tools to evaluate such impacts. This research was conducted to compare environmental impacts, and Microplastics (MPs) and Heavy Metals (HMs) emissions through LCA from HCWM between public and private Healthcare Facilities (HCFs) in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Five case studies were conducted based on the size of HCFs including one ideal scenario (developed with minimum impacts). The LCA was evaluated by SimaPro version 9.5.0.0 software and the ReCiPe 2016 method. Results revealed that private HCFs highly contributed to the eighteen studied impact categories. The main impact categories were human toxicity, global warming, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, acidification and resource scarcity. The existing common Healthcare Waste (HCW) disposal options were waste transport, open burning, recycling and dumping. The ranges of major impacts from HCWM were global warming (0.588-1.122 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq), followed by human non-carcinogenic toxicity (0.002-0.003 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.) and ecotoxicity (0.000-0.001 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.). It demonstrated that dumping of HCW, landfill leachate, open burning/ incineration ash and recycling processes along with wastewater of recycling plants are the potential sources of HMs (up to 14480 mg/kg waste) and MPs (1906-7223 items/kg waste) pollution. This study demonstrates the potential levels of environmental impacts along with HMs and MPs emissions from the HCWM system, which will facilitate the relevant authorities and policy makers to adopt the required strategies.",

        "title": "Growth monitoring and promotion program services utilization patterns between home-based and facility-based delivery methods: A comparative analysis.",
        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, utilization of government health facility-based growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services is notably low, prompting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate with the government to enhance GMP service utilization through home-based delivery. Despite this, there is limited information available on home-based GMP service utilization. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of GMP services between home-based and facility-based programs and identifying key factors and barriers to caregiver engagement with GMP services in rural Bangladesh. A descriptive mixed-method study was conducted across six sub-districts from August to December 2019. Three sub-districts with home-based GMP services provided by NGOs were compared with three neighboring sub-districts offering government facility-based GMP services. A total of 3038 randomly selected mothers and children under one year old were included in the quantitative part of the study. Quantitative surveys include information on household socio-demographic information, GMP service components, knowledge, utilization, barriers, and qualitative approaches were used for data collection on caregivers and service providers perspectives on GMP services. Descriptive statistics were conducted for sociodemographic characteristics, caregivers' knowledge, perception and barriers to utilization of GMP services. Student's t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare quantitative and qualitative variables between both GMP arms. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare GMP knowledge. Simple logistic regression identified GMP service use levels and related barriers. Multiple logistic regression was employed to determine statistically significant associations between GMP utilization and independent variables such as caregivers who heard about GMP or GMP cards, were members of an NGO, and lacked interest in GMP services at p-value <0.05 and adjusted risk ratio (ARR) values. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was performed. Results were triangulated across sources. Children's average age was 9.8 months, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio in both groups (home-based vs. facility-based: 51.9% vs. 50.0%). Home-based GMP services exhibited higher utilization rates, with more children receiving weight and length measurements and caregivers receiving counseling than facility-based services (40% vs. 0% utilization, respectively). Caregivers' utilization of GMP services in home-based areas was positively influenced by their knowledge of GMP or GMP cards (Adjusted risk ratio, ARR: 37.4) and their involvement with an NGO, association, or health program (ARR: 1.3). Caregivers in home-based GMP areas relied on NGO staff for service delivery, while those in facility-based areas reported no outreach from government health workers and lacked access to GMP cards due to supply issues. Across both areas, low awareness of GMP services and the absence of incentives contributed to limited utilization. GMP service utilization remains low in rural Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Home-based GMP service utilization was 40% but none of the caregivers utilized facility-based GMP services. Higher utilization in home-based areas was linked to caregiver awareness, access to GMP cards, and NGO involvement, while key barriers included lack of government outreach, supply gaps, and absence of incentives. To improve GMP coverage, government programs should enhance community level outreach, ensure consistent supply of growth cards, and consider integrating small incentives to motivate caregivers.",

These disparities hinder progress toward equitable health care access and quality outcomes. To evaluate the availability and quality of health care workforce and service coverage for children younger than 5 years in public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to identify gaps in infrastructure, workforce distribution, and adherence to pediatric care standards. This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 13, 2023, to May 24, 2024. Data collection included facility assessments, structured questionnaires, and direct observations using World Health Organization (WHO)-adapted tools. The study covered both private and public hospitals across 6 subdistricts in Bangladesh, representing a mix of urban and rural populations. Senior hospital staff and administrators were surveyed. Inclusion criteria were general inpatient and outpatient pediatric care delivered in hospitals. Diagnostic centers and specialized facilities were excluded. Availability of pediatric infrastructure, workforce, essential medications, and adherence to clinical guidelines assessed against WHO standards. The primary outcomes included the presence of pediatric-specific departments, neonatal care facilities, and trained personnel and adherence to WHO care standards. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests to highlight disparities. The study sample included 102 private and 7 public hospitals. A significantly higher proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals had pediatric inpatient departments (100% vs 39.2%), newborn wards (100% vs 12.8%), and trained nurses (100% vs 32.4%). Only private hospitals in the sample had neonatal intensive care units (6.9% vs 0%). Pediatricians were available for extended consultations at a greater proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals (71.4% vs 26.5%). These findings show substantial disparities in the availability of pediatric health care services between public and private hospitals in Bangladesh. Addressing these disparities through workforce investment and infrastructure improvements is crucial for equitable child health care and better health outcomes.",

However, the real-world impact of contemporary guidelines and trials on practising physicians in the Asia-Pacific region remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices among cardiovascular physicians in the region regarding stable CAD management. An anonymised cross-sectional electronic survey was administered to cardiovascular practitioners from the Asia Pacific, assessing 3 domains: 1) baseline knowledge on recent trials and society guideline, 2) attitudes towards stable CAD, and 3) case scenarios reflecting management preferences. Correlations among knowledge, attitudes and practice scores were assessed between physicians from developed and developing countries using Pearson correlation. Overall, 713 respondents from 21 countries completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 2.90±1.18 (out of 4), with 37.3% of respondents answering all questions correctly, while 74.6% noted that guidelines have significant impact on their practice. Despite guidelines recommending optimal medical therapy, majority chose revascularisation (range 53.4- 90.6%) as the preferred strategy for the case scenarios. Practitioners from developed regions had higher knowledge scores and lower attitude scores compared to developing regions, while practice scores were similar in both groups. Weakly positive correlations were noted between knowledge, attitude and practice scores. Variations exist in knowledge and attitudes towards guideline recommendations and correspondingly actual clinical practice in the Asia Pacific, with most practitioners choosing an upfront invasive strategy for the treatment of stable CAD. These differences reflect real-world disparities in guideline interpretation and clinical adoption.",

        "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) system is fundamental to human health, supporting digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. Disruptions in GI function, such as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and gastrointestinal polyps, can lead to significant health complications if not diagnosed and managed early. However, manual interpretation of endoscopic images is time-consuming and prone to human error, highlighting the need for automated diagnostic tools. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive dataset of 24,036 high-quality endoscopic images, categorized into four classes: GERD, GERD Normal, Polyp, and Polyp Normal. This dataset is designed to facilitate research in automated detection and classification of these conditions through machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of 4006 primary images collected following endoscopic procedures, which were augmented using six distinct techniques, expanding the total number of images to 24,036. It includes 5844 images of GERD cases (974primary images), 6618 images of GERD Normal (1103 primary images), 4674 images of Polyps (779 primary images), and 6900 images of Polyp Normal (1150 primary images). These images, pre-processed and resized to a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, were obtained from Zainul Haque Sikder Women's Medical College & Hospital (Pvt.) Ltd. and saved in JPG format. This dataset addresses a critical gap in the availability of large, diverse, and well-labelled medical image datasets for training AI-driven healthcare solutions. It provides an invaluable resource for developing machine learning models aimed at the automatic diagnosis, classification, and detection of GERD and polyps, potentially improving the speed and accuracy of clinical decision-making.

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired neonatal infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is unknown to what extent home-based births, which account for nearly a third of deliveries in Bangladesh, may also result in exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We enrolled mothers who delivered at home and their newborns from a rural community in Bangladesh during April-June, 2022. Within 2-7 days after delivery, we collected vaginal and rectal swabs from mothers and rectal swabs from the newborns. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic culture media selective for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL-PB) and carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB). Demographic and risk factor data were collected via surveys. Birth attendants who facilitated the deliveries were interviewed regarding infection prevention practices. We performed descriptive analyses to identify potential risk factors associated with colonization. Of the 50 mothers enrolled, the median age was 23 years (range 18 to 26). Thirty-eight (76%) mothers had at least one antenatal care visit. Only one mother reported hospitalization during pregnancy, and 4 reported antibiotic use during pregnancy. Following delivery, 47 (94%) mothers were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 37 (74%) were colonized with CRB. Of the newborns, 36 (72%) were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 27 (54%) were colonized with CRB. No associations were found with any perinatal exposures, though all households reported incomes below the international poverty level. Of the 9 birth attendants were able to be interviewed, 7 (78%) reported performing hand hygiene before delivery, and 8 (89%) reported glove use during the delivery. Attendants reported cleaning equipment shared across deliveries with soap and water and using boiled water for delivery (89%, n=8). Women and newborns in this rural population were frequently colonized with both ESBL-PB and CRB following home deliveries. This demonstrates the importance of community-based antibiotic-resistant bacterial transmission and need for further understanding community exposures driving antibiotic resistance.",

        "abstract": "Inequality in maternal healthcare service (MHS) utilization is a significant global health challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Recently, the literature on MHS inequality in LMICs has expanded. We conducted a scoping review to synthesize existing evidence and identify knowledge gaps. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Ultimate in June 2023 for literature published since January 1, 2015. We included empirical studies using nationally representative data to measure inequality in at least one of five MHS indicators: antenatal care (ANC), skilled birth attendance (SBA), facility-based delivery (FBD), caesarean-section (C-section) delivery, and postnatal care (PNC). Our review encompassed 132 peer-reviewed articles on MHS inequality in LMICs. ANC, FBD, and SBA were more frequently analyzed indicators for inequality measurement compared to PNC and C-section delivery. None of the 132 studies assessed all five MHS indicators together. The concentration index was the most frequently used inequality measure across all MHS indicators. Included studies were predominantly focused on economic (wealth) and geographic (residence, region) inequalities, while sociocultural factors (e.g., religion, ethnicity) remain underexplored. Inequality was most pronounced in low-income (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LwMICs). The extant literature mainly concentrates on India and Ethiopia as research settings. Our review highlights significant gaps in health inequality research, particularly in LICs and upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), with a heavy reliance on cross-sectional data, limited assessment of PNC and C-section delivery and lack of comprehensive analysis across all five common MHS indicators. Future research in LMICs should address the gaps identified in this review.",

        "abstract": "Although oral rehydration salt (ORS) solution is a lifesaving management for diarrhoea, its exertion is still surprisingly low among caregivers. As mothers are considered to be the primary caregivers, they bear the responsibility of administering medications to their children. We aimed to evaluate maternal perceptions along with the barriers and facilitators in play that are affecting ORS administration among children in Bangladesh. The study was conducted at Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh through a qualitative approach. In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted on thirty-one mothers of under-5 children reporting to the hospital from February to April 2024. Qualitative content analysis method was used to describe and analyse the transcribed data. The mothers held several misconceptions regarding the administration of ORS. Majority of the participants thought their child could receive ORS through their breastmilk, which was an interesting finding. Along with this, mothers also lacked proper understanding regarding ORS preparation, storage, and use. Some of the key barriers were the lack of proper knowledge, motivation, and compliance, along with misdirection from the elders and pharmacy drug sellers. Additional key facilitators to ORS use were trust towards doctors, positive attitude towards learning about ORS, community education, instructions written on the packet, and support from the healthcare providers. A focused approach should be implemented to educate mothers on the correct preparation and administration of ORS for children, while also addressing and dispelling any misconceptions.",

However, no validated stigma scales exist for use across outbreaks, and outbreak-specific scales are developed too slowly to guide timely interventions. To enable more real-time monitoring and mitigation of stigma across outbreak contexts, we developed and validated the (Re)-emerging and ePidemic Infectious Diseases (RAPID) Stigma Scales. Field testing and psychometric validation were conducted in communities affected by Ebola disease in Uganda, mpox in the UK, and Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh. Content validity was established through cognitive interviews and expert Delphi scoring. 1008 respondents were included across the three countries. The final RAPID Community Stigma Scale (12 items) captures initial social stigma, provider or authority-related stigma, structural stigma, and enduring social stigma. The RAPID Self Stigma Scale (4 items) is unidimensional. Both scales were found to have robust psychometric properties, including content validity, structural validity (factor loadings ≥0·6), and reliability (ordinal alphas 0·79-0·92). High scores on both scales predicted an increased hesitancy to report symptoms and seek care. The RAPID Stigma Scales are validated tools for real-time assessment of stigma across outbreak settings, enabling responders to design targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and promote equitable care.",

        "abstract": "Multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) in pregnancy reduces risk of infant low birthweight (LBW) and improves other maternal and infant outcomes compared with iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements alone. However, the impact of timing of initiation and adherence on the MMS effectiveness in real-world programs remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a 2-stage individual participant data meta-analysis that included 15 randomized trials (61,204 pregnant women) and assessed whether the relative effect of MMS differed by the following: adherence alone; adherence in combination with gestational age at initiation; and the total number of tablets taken. We also evaluated the observational association of these factors with outcomes among participants who received MMS. Compared with IFA supplements, the relative effect of MMS on the primary outcome of continuous birthweight was greater with higher adherence (P-interaction < 0.05). Among women who took ≥90% of supplements, MMS increased birthweight by 56 g (95% CI: 45, 67 g), whereas among women who took <60% of supplements, there was no difference in birthweight between MMS and IFA supplements [mean difference (MD): 9 g; 95% CI: -17, 35 g). Higher adherence was also associated with greater effect of MMS on LBW and birthweight-for-gestational age centile and women who took more supplements experienced a greater relative impact of MMS on birthweight-for-gestational age centile and small-for-gestational age births (SGA) as compared with IFA supplements. Observational analyses among participants who received MMS showed that ≥90% adherence was associated with increased birthweight (MD: 44 g; 95% CI: 31, 56 g) and lower risk of LBW [relative risk (RR): 0.93 g; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 g] and small-for-gestational age (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), whereas <75% adherence was associated with greater risk of stillbirth (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.83) and maternal anemia (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43) than 75%-90% adherence.

        "abstract": "Integrating family planning with nutrition could address unmet family planning needs and malnutrition in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Integrating family planning with sexual reproductive health (SRH) services may provide valuable insights as well. This scoping review synthesised evidence from published and grey literature on interventions integrating family planning with nutrition or SRH services in LMICs. We searched MEDLINE, EBSCO and Google Scholar for studies on integrated family planning, nutrition or SRH services, including codelivery or referral-based models. Evidence was analysed using narrative synthesis. We reviewed 109 articles; most family planning within broader health initiatives, particularly targeting maternal and child health and health system strengthening efforts. Integration strategies varied, generally involving codelivery of services or referral systems linking different service platforms and using diverse health providers. Outcomes were often reported by individual components, concentrating on specific services like family planning use and less so on nutrition or overall maternal and child health, thus limiting a complete understanding of the integrated intervention's impact. Qualitative and process evaluations primarily explored the acceptability and feasibility of integration, highlighting challenges in service delivery, stakeholder engagement and training and supervision gaps. Our findings suggest three evidence-based priorities for improving the integration of family planning, nutrition and SRH services: (1) standardising definitions and frameworks for integration typologies; (2) investing in workforce training and (3) strengthening supply chains. These align with implementation challenges recurrently observed across studies. The review also underscores the necessity for more rigorous research focused on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated approaches, providing critical insights for decision-makers aiming to optimise health service delivery in resource-limited settings.",

The most common post-COVID symptoms among the participants were fatigue (34.3%), muscle pain (20%), and dyspnea (12.2%). The comparison between pre- and postinfection symptoms revealed a notable increase in symptom severity and functional impairments. The study also found a significant relationship between symptom severity and place of residence (<i>p</i> < 0.5). The study found that the severity of symptoms was mild (30.5% (<i>n</i> = 90), moderate 55.3% (<i>n</i> = 186), and severe 14.2% (<i>n</i> = 94). We also looked for correlations between symptom severity, functional impairment, and health.

A cross-sectional, consumer-based survey was conducted in Bangladesh from September to November 2023, targeting 1100 participants aged 18 years and older across seven coastal districts. Convenience sampling and in-person interviews were used for the data collection. The average knowledge and attitude scores toward seafood safety and consumption were 48.2% and 63.5%, respectively. Several factors influenced seafood safety and consumption knowledge, including age, education level, family size, religion, and residence in coastal areas (all P < 0.05). In contrast, attitudes toward seafood safety and consumption were shaped by education level, family size, employment status, seafood allergies, and history of seafood poisoning (all P < 0.05). The most commonly consumed seafood was rupchanda, followed by shrimp. Most participants consumed seafood for its health benefits, with no significant seasonal impact on seafood consumption. Overfishing and climate change were recognised as the most alarming environmental dangers identified by the participants. Coastal communities in Bangladesh have demonstrated moderate attitudes, but relatively low knowledge of seafood safety and consumption. Targeted educational programmes, including community workshops on safe handling and storage, school-based programmes on marine conservation, and digital campaigns via SMS/social media, are needed to improve seafood safety knowledge, while promoting sustainable consumption practices is crucial for addressing environmental concerns like overfishing. Additionally, improving market accessibility and highlighting the health advantages of seafood can drive more informed and healthier consumption choices.",

        "abstract": "Equitable access to institutional delivery care is crucial for reducing maternal mortality. Although Bangladesh has made progress in this regard, significant challenges persist in achieving equitable access to institutional delivery care, particularly for economically disadvantaged populations. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution of public health financing benefits among women who delivered in public facilities in Bangladesh. This study was conducted based on the data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022, which includes a sample of 3360 women (age 15-49 years) who had a history of institutional delivery during two years preceding the survey. Descriptive and econometric analyses, including Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA), Concentration Curves (CC), and Concentration Indices (CIX), were employed to assess the distribution of public subsidies for delivery care among different socio-economic groups. Socioeconomic inequality in utilisation of delivery care services was evaluated using concentration curves, while BIA estimated the distribution of public healthcare benefits across wealth quintiles. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with distress financing-whether the household of the women had to sell their assets or had to resort of borrowing to avail services. Among the poorest quintile, 38% utilised public facilities, compared to 17% of the women with highest income. The concentration curve for public facility use indicated a pro-poor distribution (CIX -0.031). BIA revealed that the poorest quintile received 24.5% of public subsidies, whereas the wealthiest quintile received 13.7%. However, in tertiary care facilities and for caesarean delivery, the wealthiest group benefitted the most, receiving 23.5% and 26% of the subsidies, respectively. Odds of distress financing was significantly higher among women from poorer or poorest households compared to the richest group (aOR 4.35, 95% CI 3.16-6.03 for poorest and aOR 2.74, 95% CI 2.00-3.77 for poorer). Public health subsidies in Bangladesh equitably benefit women with lower income, though inequities remain, particularly in tertiary care facilities and for caesarean deliveries.

Disease X has gained significant attention due to its potential to cause a public health emergency in the future. This study aimed to investigate disease X, identify the key risk factors leading to its emergence and spread, and propose strategies to prevent future global pandemics. We performed a comprehensive literature review and identified relevant information for this study. Pandemic, public health emergency, and infectious disease were used as keywords for the literature search. Our study indicates that disease X could be a life-threatening or global pandemic. Among the various risk factors, climate change, increased animal-human contact, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance are some risk factors that may lead to a pandemic because they help in the transmission of zoonotic infections. Here, we have discussed some potential pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that are capable of causing disease X. Finally, we have indicated some necessary measures required for the prevention and management of any future global pandemic. Disease X has already posed a substantial threat to the global health system, warranting urgent attention and action.

A lack of both knowledge and compliance with treatment to control modifiable risk factors and unhealthy lifestyles increases the risk of stroke recurrence. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a health education program among patients with stroke postdischarge and their family caregivers in a tertiary specialized hospital in Bangladesh to reduce stroke recurrence by controlling modifiable risk factors. A parallel (1:1), open-label, prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in Bangladesh. A total of 432 patients with first-time stroke, aged ≥18 years and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-4, were randomly enrolled at the National Institute of Neuroscience & Hospital. We stratified the patients by age and type of stroke and randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG). We collected sociodemographic and clinical data by using a structured questionnaire. The IG received (self) management education, including monitoring blood pressure (BP), medication, diet, and exercise for 12 months, and the CG received usual care. The outcomes were (1) recurrence after 28 days of stroke and (2) all adverse events related to stroke after 12-month follow-up. Of 432 patients (n=216, 50%, in each group), stroke recurrence was observed 14 (6.5%) patients in the IG and 8 (3.7%) patients in the CG, and the difference was not significant (P=.19). Death was lower in the IG (n=39, 18.1%, vs n=56, 25.9%) compared to the CG. In Cox regression analysis, the unadjusted model showed death was significant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.531, 95% CI 1.017-2.304; P=.04); however, the difference was not significant after adjusting the mRS score at baseline (HR 0.818, 95% CI 0.540-1.238; P=.34). Patients' medication adherence significantly improved at 6-month (P<.001) and 12-month (P=.002) follow-up after the intervention. This study failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of health education in reducing recurrence, death, and stroke-related adverse events. However, health education enhanced medication adherence. Some causes of death could not be diagnosed due to inadequate health care systems. Further research with diagnostic facilities and a long observation period is necessary to explore the underlying cause of recurrence.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh faces one of the highest global burdens of maternal and newborn deaths, primarily caused by hemorrhage and eclampsia/preeclampsia. Despite reducing maternal mortality by 40%, comprehensive medical interventions remain insufficient in health facilities. This study assessed the readiness of sub-district hospitals in Bangladesh to provide Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) and analyzed the association between facility readiness and delivery rates. Using Health Facility Assessment Survey data from 140 hospitals in 2014 and 141 in 2017, facility readiness was measured based on nine signal functions: administering antibiotics, oxytocin, and anticonvulsants; providing blood transfusions; performing cesarean and assisted vaginal deliveries; managing retained placentas and products of conception; and neonatal resuscitation. Donabedian's model guided the analysis. Multiple linear regression examined associations between facility readiness and delivery rates using 2017 data. Between 2014 and 2017, the availability of signal functions such as oxytocin (85% to 95%), anticonvulsants (58% to 63%), and blood transfusions (22% to 38%) improved. In 2014, 77% of facilities had at least 5 signal functions, 49% had 7, and 6% had all 9. By 2017, these increased to 83%, 56%, and 8%, respectively. Despite these improvements, the mean readiness index remained nearly unchanged (0.67 in 2014 vs. 0.69 in 2017). Only 8% of facilities performed fewer than 52 deliveries annually in 2017, while 26% conducted over 500. Regression analysis revealed a significant association between readiness scores and delivery rates (p =  0.009). While certain indicators improved, overall readiness stagnated due to shortages of anesthetists, gynecologists, and essential supplies. With 64% of surveyed sub-district hospitals classified as comprehensive care facilities, resource and staffing investments are crucial to enhance readiness and reduce maternal and newborn mortality.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of paediatric hospital admissions worldwide, straining health systems. A lack of data on the burden of RSV infections and the impact on health systems in resource-limited settings hinders evidence-based policy decisions. Here, we aimed to assess RSV's burden on the health system in Bangladesh. From January to December, 2019, we conducted a prospective study at Bangladesh's largest paediatric hospital among children aged 0-59 months admitted with a possible respiratory infection, as guided by the WHO RSV hospital-based surveillance case definition. Outcomes for RSV-positive children younger than 5 years were analysed. We also followed up outcomes of children denied hospitalisation due to bed shortages. Adjusted hazard ratios for children denied admission versus admitted were estimated using survival analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with a queueing model were used to estimate the effects of RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab on admission denials and mortality. Of 40 664 children admitted, 31 692 were younger than 5 years; 19 940 were in study wards. Among 7191 admitted with possible respiratory infections, 6149 (85·5%) had nasopharyngeal swabs taken, with 1261 (20·5%) testing RSV-positive. The median age of children who tested positive for RSV was 3·0 months (IQR 1·0-8·0), with a median hospital stay of 5 days (IQR 4-8); 24 (1·9%) of 1261 died in hospital. 8274 (5·5%) of 151 110 bed days were for children who were positive for RSV. Additionally, of 9169 children denied admission, outcomes were tracked for 3928 and compared with 2845 admitted. The hazard ratio for death was 1·56 (95% CI 1·34 to 1·81) for children denied versus admitted, being highest for neonates at 2·27 (1·87 to 2·75). RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab could have reduced denials by 677 (95% prediction interval 63 to 1347) and 1289 (684 to 1865), respectively, potentially preventing 130 (-60 to 322) and 258 (32 to 469) deaths. RSV strains health care in Bangladesh, increasing mortality risks. Preventive interventions could lessen its impact, boosting health-care capacity and child health in resource-limited settings.

        "abstract": "Proper menstrual management is crucial for well-being and reproductive health. Despite global efforts to improve menstrual health, more than 2.3 billion girls and women still lack access to adequate menstrual hygiene facilities. This issue is exacerbated in physically demanding sports, where menstrual health can impact performance. This study examines the menstrual experiences and challenges adolescent female athletes face in Bangladesh. It seeks to identify their current menstruation management practices, assess physical, psychological, and sociocultural challenges during menstruation, and evaluate the facility improvements and support systems needed to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance. A qualitative research design was employed, focusing on a phenomenological approach to understand the lived experiences of adolescent athletes. The study was conducted at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports Education (BKSP), which serves approximately 1,500 female athletes. A purposive sampling strategy selected 32 adolescent athletes for in-depth interviews (IDIs) and two focus group discussions (FGDs), which were segmented by age. Additionally, six key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with coaches and administrative staff. The data were collected through audio-recorded interviews, and thematic analysis was performed. This study revealed that sociocultural taboos and misconceptions significantly affect menstrual management practices among athletes. Physical challenges include discomfort, irregular cycles, and limited access to menstrual hygiene products, contributing to increased absenteeism from training. Psychological impacts, such as concerns about reproductive health and inadequate guidance on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), further complicate the situation. Both athletes and coaches expressed a need for better education and resources. Addressing menstrual management challenges for adolescent female athletes requires a comprehensive approach. Enhanced knowledge and awareness, improved access to menstrual hygiene products, and targeted education for athletes and coaches are essential to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance.",

        "abstract": "Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents the third most common stroke type with unique etiologies, risk factors, diagnostics, and treatments. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

Forty in-depth students' interviews and 10 key informant interviews with medical and public health professionals were used to collect data using a qualitative study design and descriptive phenomenology research approach. Thematic analysis technique was conducted to analyse the collected data. The study found university students frequently seek, ask for and consume antibiotics from pharmacies to recover quickly and reduce the time-cost-visit of treatment. In certain instances, medical practitioners recommend antibiotics as a general treatment approach to enhance their popularity among patients and expedite their recovery from illness. However, they are being led into protracted illness due to poor knowledge and excessive usage of antibiotics. Students risk serious health issues by taking unnecessary antibiotics to recuperate quickly, which increases the nation's health burden.

Previous studies investigating healthcare utilization by the patients with NCDs lack nationally representative data. The present study examined healthcare utilization and factors associated with utilizing different types of health facilities (public/private/medicine shop /others/multiple providers). This study further tried to find out the linkage between utilizing different types of health facilities and the receipt of at least one lifestyle behaviour or more, and patient-related medication non-adherence. We analysed nationally representative cross-sectional STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPS) Survey 2018 in Bangladesh. Following Andersen's conceptual framework and applying multinomial logistic regression, we examined multiple types of healthcare utilization to estimate and identify predictors associated with the types of healthcare facilities accessed. Further relationships with the receipt of at least one lifestyle behaviour or more, and patient-related medication non-adherence were investigated using binary logistic regression. The majority of the participants used private facilities (41.0%) for curative care. For accessing medicine for NCDs, participants mostly used medicine shop (81.2%). In the fully adjusted model comparing public facilities vs. medicine shop respondents with no formal education (vs. university education or higher) were more likely to use medicine shop (adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR):3.9; confidence interval (CI):1.1,13.5). While comparing public facilities vs. other healthcare options (village doctor, alternative medicine practitioner (Homeo, Ayurveda, Unani) and traditional healer), respondents from rural area (vs. urban) more likely to utilize other healthcare options (aRRR: 3.5; CI: 1.8,6.8). The study findings are crucial for Bangladesh's ongoing effort to strengthen NCDs care. Further elucidation of the factors influencing the decision between types of health facility use could be provided by future mixed-method studies.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted in northern Bangladesh between May 25 and June 1, 2023, involving 448 adolescent girls in the flood-affected region. Data was collected through a self-administered descriptive questionnaire. The collected data was entered and analyzed using SPSS 26.0 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine significant variables through multivariate binary logistic regression models. The study found that more than half (69%) of the in-school adolescent girls had good knowledge about menstrual hygiene, while only one-fourth (28.6%) demonstrated good menstrual hygiene practices. Remarkably, only 1.6% of the girls disposed of their used sanitary napkins in dustbins. The results also indicated that girls aged 17 to 19 [AOR = 7.78, 95% CI: 1.83-32.99] and those from middle-class families [AOR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.31-0.85] showed a significant positive association with menstrual hygiene knowledge. Additionally, the study revealed that the respondents' mothers' education level, particularly having secondary or higher education [AOR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.04-2.77], was significantly associated with better menstrual hygiene practices. The findings underscore the low level of menstrual hygiene practices among the respondents, emphasizing the urgent need for action. This highlights the urgency of enhancing awareness about the significance of adopting good menstrual hygiene practices. Therefore, it is imperative to incorporate menstrual hygiene knowledge and practices into school curricula and to organize meetings and sessions with schoolgirls' parents, stressing the importance of community support in addressing this issue.",

This study aims to determine the prevalence of antihypertensive medication adherence and its associated factors among patients with hypertension receiving treatments at a Hypertension Center in Bangladesh. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 352 adult patients with hypertension registered in the Rangpur Hypertension and Research Center. The outcome variable for the study was medication adherence to the antihypertensive drug, which was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Descriptive analysis was conducted to show the distribution of the study participants, Pearson's chi-square test was applied to explore associations between categorical response and explanatory variables, and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore factors associated with medication adherence. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 17.0. The prevalence of good medication adherence among patients with hypertension in the HRC, R was 54.83%. Among various reasons for taking the medicine irregularly, forgetfulness (20.29%) was the most common cause reported by the participants, followed by a busy work schedule (7.71%). Among the study participants, married patients were found to have higher medicine adherence (AOR= 3.81; 95% CI: 1.34-10.89) than unmarried patients.

Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is indispensable for supervising and enhancing the health of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. It helps to reduce the risks of complications and ensures better pregnancy outcomes. This study investigates the aspects that influence antenatal care (ANC) visits in Bangladesh, focusing on sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. The study used nationally representative data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted for bivariate analysis. The Boruta algorithm was utilized for variable selection. After employing various regression models, including Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-inflated Poisson Regression, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB), we evaluated their performance and selected Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) for parameter estimation and interpretation. Our results reveal that less than 50% of women meet the WHO-recommended minimum of four ANC visits. Rural women were 12% less likely than urban women to receive antenatal care (ANC) visits, indicating an urban-rural discrepancy. Women with secondary and higher education levels were significantly more likely to have frequent visits, with incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.51), respectively. Similarly, women from households with rich wealth status (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) and those exposed to media coverage (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14-1.25) were more likely to attend frequent ANC visits. Conversely, women with higher birth order (IRR: 0.95 & 0.84, 95% CI: 0.90-1.00 & 0.76-0.92), unintentional pregnancy (IRR: 0.91 & 0.83, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96 & 0.77-0.91) were less likely to have ANC visits. This study underscores a critical gap in ANC access, particularly among rural women, which poses challenges to achieving national and global maternal health targets. Addressing these disparities and making relevant policy implications such as expanding community-based ANC programs, integrating services into primary healthcare, and increasing awareness through mass media are required to enhance ANC accessibility and utilization in underserved populations.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains critical in Bangladesh, driven by delays in accessing timely care at health care facilities. Globally, a woman dies every two minutes from pregnancy or childbirth, often due to systemic inefficiencies in health care. In Bangladesh, high maternal mortality rates are worsened by overcrowded facilities, limited resources, and complex procedures. The 'three delays' model identifies barriers to care, with the third delay - receiving timely treatment - being a major contributor to maternal deaths. This study aims to generate evidence on how the 'Welcome Person' can improve maternity care at the facility level in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study from April to December 2022 among pregnant women at three selected health care facilities in Gaibandha District, Bangladesh. We deployed 20 'Welcome Persons' to navigate and assist pregnant women, enhancing maternal health care. The Welcome Persons provided round-the-clock support, guiding mothers from the moment they entered the hospital through their admission, treatment, and any necessary referrals. The Welcome Persons maintained detailed time-stamped records, tracking patient movements and service timelines. In this study of 5260 mothers, 47% presented with complications, with 52% arriving after office hours. The median time from entry to treatment was 15 minutes, with those without complications taking 14 minutes and those with complications 15 minutes. Entry-to-admission took a median of nine minutes, varying by age, with younger patients completing faster. Admission-to-treatment had a median time of six minutes, with severely complicated patients experiencing shorter times. Only 1% completed within five minutes, while 63% finished within 15 minutes. Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) showed better performance in completing procedures within median times compared to the District Hospital (DH). Future study plans should include measuring maternal and neonatal outcomes as well. This study demonstrates that timely maternal care is achievable by deploying a support person. Using the 'Welcome Person' model to address admission bottlenecks, health care facilities can enhance patient experiences and outcomes. Despite a few limitations, evidence generated from this study can be utilised for scaling up decisions and can contribute to the health policy.",

        "abstract": "Using remote monitoring technology in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) care presents exciting new opportunities to lessen caregiver stress and improve patient care quality. The application of wearables, environmental sensors, and smart home systems designed specifically for patients with AD represents a promising interdisciplinary approach that integrates advanced technology with health care to enhance patient safety, monitor health parameters in real time, and provide comprehensive support to caregivers. The objectives of this study included evaluating the effectiveness of various remote sensing technologies in enhancing patient outcomes and identifying strategies to alleviate the burden on health care professionals and caregivers. Critical elements such as regulatory compliance, user-centered design, privacy and security considerations, and the overall efficacy of relevant technologies were comprehensively examined. Ultimately, this study aimed to propose a comprehensive remote monitoring framework tailored to the needs of patients with AD and related dementias. Guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, we conducted a systematic review on remote monitoring for patients with AD and related dementias. Our search spanned 4 major electronic databases-Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and DBLP on February 20, 2024, with an updated search on May 18, 2024. A total of 31 publications met the inclusion criteria, highlighting 4 key research areas: existing remote monitoring technologies, balancing practicality and empathy, security and privacy in monitoring, and technology design for AD care. The studies revealed a strong focus on various remote monitoring methods for capturing behavioral, physiological, and environmental data yet showed a gap in evaluating these methods for patient and caregiver needs, privacy, and usability. The findings also indicated that many studies lacked robust reference standards and did not consistently apply critical appraisal criteria, underlining the need for comprehensive frameworks that better integrate these essential considerations. This comprehensive literature review of remote monitoring technologies for patients with AD provides an understanding of remote monitoring technologies, trends, and gaps in the current research and the significance of novel strategies for remote monitoring to enhance patient outcomes and reduce the burden among health professionals and caregivers. The proposed remote monitoring framework aims to inspire the development of new interdisciplinary research models that advance care for patients with AD.",

        "abstract": "This qualitative study explores how family therapists (n = 15) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, assist couples in navigating divorce decision-making, addressing a gap in research on divorce ideation in non-Western contexts. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed four key themes: (1) Therapists as experts, (2) Respect for client autonomy, (3) Therapist neutrality, and (4) Clarity in the decision as the goal. Each of the themes is situated in the social context of Dhaka, the capital city, where couple therapy is a fairly new mental health practice and beliefs about marriage and divorce are culturally informed. These cultural beliefs include ideas that divorce is shameful, is not religiously sanctioned, and is harder on women. Future research could focus on the experiences of therapists or other community helpers (i.e., religious or kinship networks) in rural areas and among less-educated populations to better understand the broader landscape of divorce decision-making in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Women in urban slums are particularly susceptible due to a lack of knowledge about sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and abortion is frequently performed. Our study investigates the level and predictors of SRH knowledge among the reproductive-aged women who have had abortions and lived in urban slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We adopted a cross-sectional survey among the reproductive-aged women who experienced any kind of abortion from July 2020 to January 2022 living in the UHDSS sites, applying a predefined interviewer-assisted survey questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard error, and 95% confidence interval (CI)) for continuous and percentage distribution for categorical variables. Bi-variate analysis was used to examine for associations. After checking the assumptions, multinomial regression analysis was used to confirm the determinants with 95% CIs. A total of 338 women participated (221 spontaneous abortions and 117 induced abortions) with an average age of 26.59 ± 0.355, age at first marriage of 16.69 ± 0.173, and marital length of 9.45 ± 0.386. Except for the use of emergency contraceptives (32%), many women correctly identified condom effectiveness for preventing pregnancy (89%), STDs and HIV/AIDS prevention (79-80%), and abortion (98%). About 34 to 64% of them experienced stigmas attached to sexually explicit items. Few of them knew about abortion complications (9 to 57%), with the exception of bleeding associated with abortion (91.7%). Overall, 3 out of 4 women lacked sufficient SRH knowledge, with a mean score of 58.28 (95% CI: 56.70, 59.87), which was slightly higher for women who had spontaneous abortions 58.90 (95% CI: 57.02, 60.78) and lower for women who had induced abortions 57.69 (95% CI: 54.94, 60.45). Women aged 20-29 and 30 + years had high level of SRH knowledge than those of under 20 years. Women with higher education, longer marriages, and who availed post abortion care had high level of SRH knowledge than respective counterparts. However, employed slum women other than garment workers had lower levels of SRH knowledge than housewives. Our findings can be used in the abortion policies and strategies for vulnerable women and we recommend an intervention to increase awareness and knowledge on SRH, which is essential for those women to achieve the maternal reproductive health parameters.",

        "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a recognised global public health concern, substantially impacting women's well-being. While there is growing research on how IPV victim-survivors seek mental health support in the Global North, it remains understudied in the Global South, particularly for those residing in slums in low-income countries like Bangladesh. Through interviews and group discussions with different stakeholders, this study explored the mental healthcare-seeking behaviour of victim-survivors of IPV residing in urban slums, barriers to service utilisation, and recommendations to strengthen care pathways. Stakeholders perceived IPV as normalised in slums, indicating sociocultural norms and interpersonal causes as significant contributors to mental health issues and events of IPV. Seeking healthcare and moral support for IPV from local dispensaries and informal sources was common; however, IPV victim-survivors had no knowledge about mental-health-related services. Low mental health literacy and lack of financial support prevented them from seeking the necessary care. Social stigma regarding accessing mental healthcare, coupled with the absence of professional service providers and community-based services, represent critical systemic challenges. Recommendations included promoting community-level awareness of IPV and mental health issues, increasing mental healthcare services, training health workers, and fostering positive masculinities in community-based interventions. Stakeholders emphasised the need to adopt culturally relevant interventions for tackling IPV and improving mental healthcare pathways, especially for the low-income population of Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The global burden of chronic diseases is increasing and becoming a public health issue throughout the world. The use of telenursing is increasing significantly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to treat and prevent chronic diseases. Telenursing is growing in many countries to reduce health care costs, increase the number of aging and chronically ill populations, and increase health care coverage to distant, rural, small, or sporadically populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help to solve increasing shortages of nurses, reduce distances, save travel time, and keep patients out of the hospital. The objective of this study is to apply the self-management telenursing program and telenursing system developed by the researchers to Bangladesh and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy (improved diabetes control in participants). This is a pilot, quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study. Diabetes patients who will attend the Grameen Primary Health Centers (PHCs) in Bangladesh will be enrolled between September 2024 and August 2025. We include patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, both sexes, ages 18-75 years old, all types of treatment, willing to participate and give us consent. We exclude patients who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, diabetes as a secondary cause, complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is less than 7% for the past 1 year with CKD stage 1 or 2, no complications or complications with good control, having enough knowledge (had education before) and implemented good practice regarding diabetes management assessed by the research nurses, and disabled persons who need other person's support for daily living. The sample size was calculated and found 70. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The study protocol got approval from the National Research Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC/NREC/2022-2025/336) on September 08, 2024. The outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of telenursing intervention by controlling HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The project was funded in 2024. The enrollment of the participants started on October 26, 2024, and the required sample (n=70) enrollment was completed in February 2025. Data analysis will be started after completion of data collection and results will be expected to be submitted for publication in 2026. Diabetic patients will acquire disease-specific management skills. Setting and monitoring goals ensures the continuation of the desired behavior and gives the patients control over their lifestyle. After developing self-management skills, patients assess their lab data and lifestyles including diet, and understand their condition so that they can work with their physiological data by acquiring knowledge of both the disease and self-care. By making self-supported decisions, the patients will be able to manage their diet, exercise, and medication. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06632652; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06632652.

        "abstract": "Childhood severe pneumonia is the leading cause of under-five deaths in Bangladesh. A new day-care management approach (DCA) was implemented in primary-level healthcare facilities in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. Reliable cost estimates are important to determine the economic viability of the new management approach. The objective of this study were to estimate the mean societal cost per patient for a new Day-care approach (DCA) in managing childhood severe pneumonia, to assess cost variation in urban and rural healthcare settings, and to determine important cost predictors. This study was conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh Children diagnosed with severe pneumonia were enrolled between November 2015 and March 2019. Employing a bottom-up micro-costing approach from a societal perspective, detailed household and provider cost data were collected from sixteen intervention facilities (n = 16). Data collection involved structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with facility staff, interviews with parents/caregivers, and patient record reviews. Analysis measured mean cost and cost variation across socio-economic groups, facility location, clinical variables, and determined cost-sensitive parameters. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant level. 1,745 children were enrolled, 63% were male, and 57% were less than a year old. The mean societal cost per patient was US$94.2 (95% CI: US$92.2, US$96.3) with a mean length-of-stay (LoS) of 4.1 days (SD ± 3.0). Costs of medical personnel (US$32.6), caregiver's productivity loss (US$26) and medicines (US$22) were the major cost contributors. Mean cost was significantly higher for urban-located facilities compared to rural (difference US$17, 95% CI: US$12.6, US$20.8). No cost variation was found by age, sex, and clinical variables. Findings suggest that this novel DCA management approach is a low-cost management option, and particularly beneficial for rural residences and therefore has the potential to reduce the overall cost burden for childhood severe pneumonia management. These findings have implications for policy-making decisions in resource-poor settings for childhood pneumonia management.",

This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Mental health disparities persist as a pressing public health concern globally. Gender disparities in mental health are evident, with women disproportionately affected by conditions such as depression and anxiety. Despite the apparent need, studies from Bangladesh indicate that women are less likely to seek mental healthcare compared with men. This study aims to investigate gender differences in mental health help-seeking behaviour in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 15 to 30 October 2021, targeting individuals with perceived mental health problems through the Facebook page of LifeSpring, a mental health and well-being organisation based in Bangladesh. Data (n=3031; women: 2140; men: 891) were collected using the JotForm online survey tool and analysed using descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses and multinomial logistic regression. The majority of participants were female (70.6%), aged between 18 and 34 years (87.3%), and from urban areas (85.4%). Overall, 28.4% received non-professional help, with females at 30.9% and males at 22.3%. Additionally, 22.9% received help from professionals, with females at 20.8% and males at 28.1%. Notable disparities were observed in mental health help-seeking behaviour between genders. While females exhibit higher odds of seeking non-professional support (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.84, p value <0.001), they have lower odds of obtaining professional assistance compared with males (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.86, p value 0.001). Factors such as stigma, financial constraints and marital status significantly influenced help-seeking behaviours. This study contributes to our understanding of gender disparities in mental healthcare utilisation in Bangladesh, highlighting the need for gender-sensitive approaches in mental healthcare service delivery.",

        "abstract": "Gynaecological health and its related service delivery have long been neglected in Bangladesh. In response to the high burden and improvements in the provision of gynaecological health care, the Essential Gynaecological Skills (EGS) implementation package was developed. It includes comprehensive in-service training for upskilling the non-specialised health care providers and introduces the first structured data recording system for gynaecology in the outdoor of public health facilities in Bangladesh. We outline how the stakeholder engagement process was integrated into the implementation research related to this pioneering initiative. Based on literature review, expert consultation and prior experience, we adopted the identification, sensitisation, involvement, and engagement (ISIE) framework of stakeholder engagement and process documentation. After identifying national and local level stakeholders via a power-interest mapping exercise, we sensitised them to the gaps in gynaecological health service delivery. High-power and high-interest stakeholders were involved and engaged in developing the EGS implementation package, which was then introduced in selected public health facilities and evaluated through implementation research. Acknowledging the urgent need for gynaecological health care services, the identified and sensitised stakeholders supported the development of the EGS implementation package. This resulted in the development and implementation of the EGS implementation package under the Government of Bangladesh's leadership, highlighting government ownership. These outcomes reflected the potential for scalability and sustainability of the package. However, stakeholder engagement remains a time and resource-intensive process that requires an innovative, research-backed approach with committed implementation. Our experience of using the ISIE framework showcased the potential of this framework in achieving sustainability and scalability at the national level. However, further initiatives from the government can ensure nationwide scale-up, setting an example for other lower and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) bacterial infections are an urgent health threat, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where they are rarely detected and might not be treated appropriately given inadequate health system capacity. To understand this treatment gap, we estimated the total number of CRGN bacterial infections requiring an active agent and the number of individuals potentially initiated on appropriate treatment in eight large LMICs. For eight selected countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan, and South Africa), we estimated deaths associated with CRGN bacterial infections (that were not susceptible to other antibiotics) in 2019 using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study on antimicrobial resistance. We used estimates from the literature to establish infection type-specific case fatality rates and an overall case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. The total number of CRGN bacterial infections requiring an active agent could then be calculated by dividing the total number of CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths by the overall case fatality rate. We estimated the treatment gap (ie, the number of individuals with CRGN bacterial infections who were not appropriately treated) by subtracting from the total number of infections the number of individuals who initiated appropriate treatment, which was estimated using 2019 IQVIA sales data for six antibiotics active against CRGN bacteria, corrected to account for IQVIA's partial data coverage for each country and dose-adjusted by age. In 2019, in the eight selected countries, we estimated that there were 1 496 219 CRGN bacterial infections (95% CI 1 365 392-1 627 047) but that only 103 647 treatment courses were procured. The resulting treatment gap (1 392 572 cases [95% CI 1 261 745-1 523 400]) meant that only 6·9% of patients were treated appropriately. The treatment gap persisted even when we used more restrictive assumptions. The most-procured antibiotic was tigecycline (intravenous; 47 531 [45·9%] of 103 647 courses). India procured most of the treatment courses (83 468 [80·5%] courses), with 7·8% of infections treated appropriately (treatment gap 982 848 cases [95% CI 909 291-1 056 405]). The rates of appropriate treatment coverage were highest in Mexico (5634 [5·4%] courses procured; treatment gap 32 141 cases [30 416-33 867]) and Egypt (7572 [7·3%] courses procured; treatment gap 43 258 cases [38 742-47 774]), both with 14·9% of infections treated appropriately. Infections caused by CRGN bacteria are likely to be significantly undertreated in LMICs. To close this treatment gap, improved access to diagnostics and antibiotics, strengthening of health systems, and research to identify gaps in the treatment pathway are needed.

        "abstract": "Timely initiation and adequate number of antenatal care (ANC) visits are crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of both pregnant women and their unborn children. Despite recent progress, Bangladesh continues to face challenges in achieving sustainable development goal (SDG-3) related to maternal and neonatal health. This study examines the factors contributing to delayed initiation and a low number of ANC visits, while also evaluating the association between the timing and overall number of ANC visits. Nationally representative data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS) conducted in 2007 (n = 3050) and 2017-18 (n = 4544) on women aged 15-49 years. We investigated two binary outcome variables: late ANC, defined as the initiation of ANC visits after 12 weeks of gestation, and low ANC, defined as having less than four ANC visits. Geospatial mapping was employed to visualize spatial patterns, followed by survey-weighted logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with late initiation of ANC and low ANC visit frequency. Additionally, classification tree analysis was utilized to explore interactions between predictors and outcomes. Logistic regression modeling revealed that late ANC was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the odds of having fewer than four ANC visits (AOR: 4.60 [95% CI: 3.69-5.73] in 2007 and AOR: 4.68 [95% CI: 4.00-5.48] in 2017-18). Classification tree analysis further confirmed that late ANC initiation was the most critical predictor of total number of ANC attendance, underscoring the necessity of early ANC initiation to ensure sufficient coverage. Early initiation of ANC is essential for achieving an adequate number of ANC visits. Notably, the same set of sociodemographic factors remained statistically significant predictors in both 2007 and 2017, highlighting the persistent nature of these disparities and underscoring the urgent need for targeted policies and health interventions.",

        "abstract": "Provision of quality antenatal care (QANC) services and delivery care by skilled health professionals can effectively reduce and manage complications throughout pregnancy and childbirth, leading to better maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The WHO recently updated its recommendation to at least eight antenatal care (ANC) visits. However, little is known about how QANC services and completion of eight or more ANC visits interact with skilled delivery care utilization. This study utilized data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, including 4,457 pregnant women aged 15-49 years who had given birth three years preceding the survey. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the study population's characteristics and the proportion of skilled birth attendance (SBA) and facility delivery (FD) in Bangladesh. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were used to determine the strength of association of QANC services and completion of eight or more ANC visits with skilled delivery care utilization. Only one in five women received good QANC services, and one in eight completed eight or more ANC visits. The overall proportions of SBA and FD were 56.74% [95% CI: 55.27-58.20] and 53.85% [52.37-55.32] respectively. Women with eight or more ANC visits had significantly higher odds of utilizing SBA (OR: 2.11 [1.60-2.77]) and FD (OR: 2.19 [1.68-2.85]) compared to those with only 1-3 ANC visits. Likewise, good QANC services were associated with higher odds of SBA (OR: 1.72 [1.38-2.15]) and FD (OR: 1.56 [1.26-1.93]). This study highlights the significant positive association of QANC services and adherence to the WHO-recommended eight or more ANC visits with increased skilled delivery care utilization in Bangladesh. Strengthening policies and programs to enhance the quality and frequency of ANC services can promote skilled delivery care, ensuring safe motherhood and childbirth.",

However, there are gaps in assessing the quality of ANC, leading to the proposal of standards by the World Health Organization. The study aims to examine the impact of quality ANC on delivery services and PNC compliance in Bangladesh using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), providing insights for policymakers to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. This study used data from 2017 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) to investigate the impact of quality antenatal care (qANC) on delivery services and PNC in Bangladesh. The study population included ever-married women aged 15-49 years who had experienced a recent pregnancy. The analysis assessed the relationship between qANC and facility delivery, skilled birth attendant (SBA)-assisted delivery, and PNC services within 48 hours of delivery. The study employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design, and data analysis was conducted using generalized linear models and considered various demographic and socioeconomic factors. Key findings include a low rate of qANC services (18%), with pregnancy-related counseling being the lowest component. About 82% received at least one ANC visit, but only 18.3% received a quality visit. Higher compliance with facility delivery (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.27-1.41), SBA-conducted delivery (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.24-1.35), and PNC services for both mother (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.24-1.35) and child (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.23-1.35) within 48 hours were observed when quality ANC was received. Factors such as completing secondary education, engaging in skilled/unskilled manual labor and higher wealth quintile were associated with better delivery and post-delivery outcomes. Ensuring qANC and expanding PNC service use remain challenging in Bangladesh. Increasing the provision of qANC is crucial, as it is associated with higher adherence to PNC.",

Adolescent pregnancy poses significant health risks for both mothers and infants globally, yet its specific impact on infant mortality in Bangladesh remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between adolescent pregnancy and infant mortality in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, focusing on 8,759 infants born to women aged 15-49 years. Adolescent pregnancies were categorized into four groups: <16 years, 16-17 years, 18-19 years, and >19 years. Potential covariates included sociodemographic factors (mothers' age, fathers' occupation, religion), contextual factors (place of delivery, access to media and technology), and healthcare utilization (antenatal and postnatal care). Bivariate logistic regression assessed associations between adolescent pregnancy and infant mortality, presenting adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) while controlling for these covariates. The mean age of mothers at first birth was 18.53 years. Among the 8,759 infants studied, 328 (3.74%) died before reaching 12 months of age. Infants born to mothers younger than 16 years initially showed higher odds of mortality (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05-2.01); this association persisted even after adjusting for sociodemographic and contextual factors (AOR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.01-1.96). However, after controlling for healthcare utilization, the relationship was no longer statistically significant (AOR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.56-1.99). Delaying childbirth from adolescence to adulthood may reduce infant mortality in Bangladesh. However, adolescent pregnancy alone does not increase infant mortality risk after accounting for healthcare utilization, such as antenatal and postnatal care. Improving access to quality healthcare is crucial for lowering infant mortality. Future cohort studies are needed to better understand the relationship between maternal age and infant health outcomes.",

In resource-limited settings, cancer diagnosis is often challenging due to shortages of expert pathologists. We assess the effectiveness of general-purpose pathology foundation models (FM) for the diagnosis and annotation of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in resource-limited settings. We evaluated three pathology FMs (UNI, PRISM, and Prov-GigaPath) using deidentified NMSC histology images from the Bangladesh Vitamin E and Selenium Trial to predict cancer subtype based on zero-shot whole-slide embeddings. In addition, we evaluated tile aggregation methods and machine learning models for prediction. Lastly, we employed few-shot learning of PRISM tile embeddings to perform whole-slide annotation. We found that the best model used PRISM's aggregated tile embeddings to train a multilayer perceptron model to predict NMSC subtype [mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.925, P < 0.001]. Within the other FMs, we found that using attention-based multi-instance learning to aggregate tile embeddings to train a multilayer perceptron model was optimal (UNI: mean AUROC = 0.913, P < 0.001; Prov-GigaPath: mean AUROC = 0.908, P < 0.001). We finally exemplify the utility of few-shot annotation in computation- and expertise-limited settings. Our study highlights the important role FMs may play in confronting public health challenges and exhibits a real-world potential for machine learning-aided cancer diagnosis. Pathology FMs offer a promising pathway to improve early and precise NMSC diagnosis, especially in resource-limited environments. These tools could also facilitate patient stratification and recruitment for prospective clinical trials aimed at improving NMSC management.",

        "abstract": "The majority of maternal mortality occurs during the postpartum period worldwide. Therefore, postnatal care (PNC) is crucial for both mother's and newborn's survival. Unfortunately, PNC is underutilized in Bangladesh and well below any admissible level. The purpose of this study is not only to identify the potential factors associated with PNC but also to explore the more intriguing aspect of finding the most important determinants of PNC receipt among mothers in Bangladesh. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the factors associated with PNC receipt using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18. The BDHS 2017-18 utilized a two-stage stratified sampling method, selecting 675 enumeration areas (EAs) in the first stage with probability proportional to size and then choosing a systematic sample of 30 households from each EA in the second stage. The analysis considered mothers with a most recent child under three years of age at the time of the survey, leading to a total of 4899 women. The response variable of interest is the receipt of PNC from a medically trained provider (MTP) within two days of delivery. It is observed that 52.8% of mothers received PNC from MTP within two days of childbirth. The variables mother's age at birth, birth order, mother's education level, place of residence, wealth index, media exposure, antenatal care (ANC) visits, working status, and region are all found to be significantly associated with PNC seeking behavior. General dominance (GD) analysis was employed to assess variable importance because complete, and conditional dominances rarely occur. GD is the simplest among the three dominances and can be computed without computing the other two by using a simpler subset model structure. Considering the two-stage stratified sampling design, the analysis reveals that ANC visits, family wealth status, and the mother's education level were the three most dominant predictors of PNC visits, explaining approximately 68% of the total variance. The results suggest that policymakers and stakeholders should intensify the existing facilities to increase awareness of taking ANC visits, which would eventually encourage women to take PNC. Additionally, efforts should be made to help economically disadvantaged women overcome the barriers that prevent them from accessing maternal health care. Finally, the government of Bangladesh should stimulate women to complete at least their secondary education.",

        "abstract": "Burns are a global issue that can result in lifelong multimorbidities and disproportionately affect people in low-resource settings. Prioritising research of importance to patients and health-care professionals improves evidence-based care. This prioritisation setting partnership was undertaken in global burn care (focusing on thermal non-electrical burns) by establishing a James Lind Alliance research priority setting partnership. Over 2 years, two online multilingual surveys with patients, carers, and clinicians, 16 interviews, and a virtual priority setting workshop were conducted to identify and prioritise questions for research. Survey responses were received from participants in 88 countries (1617 survey one respondents; 630 survey two respondents). A short-list of 19 research priorities were ranked at an online workshop attended by 28 participants (14 health-care professionals, ten burn survivors, and four carers or advocates) from 15 countries to produce the final top ten research priorities. These priorities provide opportunities for researchers, funders, and clinicians to shape the future of burns research and improve burns care globally.",

        "title": "Healthy lifestyle knowledge and age at hypertension diagnosis: a primary health care based survey in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between knowledge of healthy lifestyles and the age of hypertension diagnosis among hypertensive individuals within Bangladeshi rural population. This cross-section study was conducted among hypertensive adults (18-80 years) in a rural population. We obtained data from 3600 adults with hypertension from 40 randomly selected community pharmacies. We gathered data on demographics, health knowledge, and measured vital signs, including hypertension diagnosis year. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the lifestyle and knowledge factors about hypertension with the age of diagnosis of hypertension. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis was 45.84 years. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis of male participants was higher than female (48.1 vs 44.4 years). Our study found that males and individuals with primary education are more likely to receive a later hypertension diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-3.10 and odds ratio = 5.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.09-11.48 respectively) for those aged ≥65. The poorest and those lacking physical exercise faced higher odds of later diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.15 and odds ratio = 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.78-3.17 respectively). Conversely, a family history of hypertension reduces the odds (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.55). Increased knowledge of healthy lifestyle factors and engagement with health-related media correlate with later diagnosis, highlighting the influence of education and awareness on hypertension detection age. Our study reveals that knowledge of a healthy lifestyle is associated with the age of hypertension diagnosis. Targeting specific age groups based on health education programs may reduce hypertension-related complications.",
