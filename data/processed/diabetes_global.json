        "title": "Obesity and male infertility - a tenuous relationship: Facts discerned for the busy clinicians.",
        "abstract": "Obesity is a common health problem affecting over a third of the population worldwide. Obesity has been correlated with many diseases, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer, brain degeneration, and premature aging. In men, obesity can also cause issues like erectile dysfunction, poor sperm quality, and prostate problems. Factors like high insulin levels, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress may play a role in how obesity affects male fertility. Obesity can disrupt the male reproductive system by changing hormone levels, affecting sperm production, and causing problems with metabolism. This can result in a reduction of sperm count, motility, and normal forms. Obesity can also cause sperm DNA fragmentation, increase cell death, and impact the genetic information that can be passed on to future generations. This narrative review explores how obesity impacts male reproductive health and fertility, as well as possible treatment options like weight management, lifestyle changes, medications, and alternative therapies.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a growing global health concern and a major risk factor for conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and atherosclerosis. It is marked by chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Dietary interventions, including carbohydrate-controlled diets, have shown potential in improving metabolic outcomes. <i>Cuminum cyminum</i> (cumin), containing the bioactive compound cuminaldehyde, is known for its hypoglycemic and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effect of a carbohydrate-controlled diet and cumin herbal infusion on metabolic and biochemical parameters in patients with metabolic syndrome. A pre- and post-interventional study was conducted on 132 patients (aged 18-60 years) diagnosed with MetS based on the ATP III criteria. Participants were recruited from the University of Lahore Teaching Hospital (ULTH) through purposive sampling and were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups (<i>n</i> = 66 each). The intervention group (INEG) received a carbohydrate-controlled diet and cumin herbal infusion for 8 weeks. Anthropometric, biochemical, and physiological parameters were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Significant improvements were observed in body mass index (BMI), body weight, and lipid profile parameters (<i>p</i> < 0.005). The intervention group showed notable reductions in triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and fasting blood glucose levels compared to the control group (CG). A carbohydrate-controlled diet combined with cumin herbal infusion may support glycemic control and improve lipid metabolism in individuals with metabolic syndrome. This combined approach shows potential as an adjunct dietary strategy for managing cardiometabolic risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator, ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia. We investigated the effects of pemafibrate on steatotic liver disease (SLD) in relation to various atherogenic lipid profiles. Thirty-nine Japanese patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertriglyceridemia (men/women: 24/15, mean age: 58.2 years, median duration of diabetes: 5.0 years) were treated with 0.2 mg/day of pemafibrate for 12 months (M). SLD was estimated by fatty liver index (FLI), which is calculated by using waist circumference, body mass index and levels of triglycerides and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. Treatment with pemafibrate significantly increased mean levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (baseline/3M/6M/12M: 46/55/55/54 mg/dL) and decreased median levels of triglycerides (baseline/3M/6M/12M: 211/112/99/98 mg/dL), non-HDL-C (146/128/125/121 mg/dL), small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (45/33/30/30 mg/dL) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (8.1/2.6/2.3/2.4 mg/dL). There was no significant change in hemoglobin A1c level over time. FLI (mean ± standard deviation: 68.1 ± 21.9 <i>vs</i>. 39.6 ± 25.0, P < 0.001), but not FIB-4 index as a marker of hepatic fibrosis (median [interquartile range]: 1.04 [0.78-1.39] <i>vs</i>. 1.01 [0.68-1.36], P = 0.909), was significantly decreased by treatment with pemafibrate for 12M, and the proportion of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated SLD (MASLD) was significantly decreased from 92.3% (baseline) to 61.5% (12M). Pemafibrate ameliorates MASLD estimated by FLI in addition to various atherogenic lipid profiles in Japanese hypertriglyceridemia patients with T2DM in the past mean 5 years. An early intervention with pemafibrate might contribute to prevention of the development of MASLD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "PGC-1α is induced by hypoxia and interacts with the receptor ERR-α to stimulate angiogenic factors expression and promote angiogenesis. We investigated the possible role of the PGC-1α/ERR-α pathway in regulating angiogenic factors expression in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). We analysed vitreous fluid samples from PDR and non-diabetic patients and epiretinal fibrovascular membranes from PDR patients. Streptozotocin-treated rats were used as a model of diabetic retinopathy. Vitreous samples, epiretinal membranes, rat retinas, human retinal Müller glial cells and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) were studied by Western blot analysis, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined with spectrofluorometric analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated co-expression of PGC-1α and ERR-α in endothelial cells and leukocytes in epiretinal membranes. Angiogenic activity, determined by the numbers of CD31-positive vessels, correlated significantly with PGC-1α and ERR-α expression levels. PGC-1α, ERR-α and the angiogenic biomarkers vascular endothelial growth (VEGF) and angiopoietin 2 were significantly increased in PDR vitreous samples. Diabetes induced upregulation of PGC-1α and ERR-α immunoreactive proteoforms in rat retinas. Cultured Müller cells and HRMECs constitutively expressed PGC-1α and ERR-α. In Müller cells, the PGC-1α inhibitor SR-18292 and the ERR-α selective inverse agonist XCT790 significantly attenuated VEGF, angiopoietin 2 and MCP-1/CCL2 upregulation induced by diabetic mimetic conditions. Treatment of Müller cells with the PGC-1α activator XLN005 induced significant upregulation of VEGF and attenuated ROS production induced by diabetic mimetic conditions. Our findings suggest that suppression of the PGC-1α/ERR-α pathway might impair the upregulation of angiogenic factors in PDR.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common and serious complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 40% of patients with the condition. The pathogenesis of DKD is complex, involving multiple processes such as metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis. Given its increasing incidence and associated mortality, there is an urgent need to identify novel pathogenic genes and therapeutic targets. This study systematically identified hub DKD-associated genes and their potential molecular mechanisms through bioinformatic analysis. Gene expression datasets from DKD patients and healthy controls were obtained from the GEO database. Hub genes were screened using differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), LASSO regression, random forest (RF) algorithms, and consensus clustering for DKD patient classification. Additionally, immune cell infiltration analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes to explore the relationship between hub genes and the immune microenvironment. Potential drugs targeting LPL were predicted based on gene-drug interaction analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify the expression of LPL and TNF-α in kidney tissues from patients with varying degrees of DKD severity, as well as their relationship with kidney function impairment. This study revealed that LPL, a lipoprotein metabolism gene, plays a crucial role in DKD, participating in cholesterol and glycerolipid metabolism as well as PPAR signaling. LPL expression was negatively correlated with pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and various subsets of T cells, including naïve CD4 T cells and gamma delta T cells, while positively correlated with follicular helper T cells, suggesting its immune-regulation effects in DKD progression. Potential LPL-targeting drugs, such as Ibrolipim, anabolic steroid, and acarbose, might mitigate DKD. LPL expression was decreased with DKD severity and was correlated with TNF-α and kidney dysfunction markers, indicating its key role in DKD progression. LPL is a pivotal regulator of lipid metabolism and immune inflammation in DKD. Potential drugs targeting LPL offer new candidates for precision treatment of DKD. These findings lay a theoretical foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of DKD and developing LPL-based therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "This meta-analysis aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight loss, including its dose-response relationship and adverse event profile. Studies were retrieved from high-impact journals and included phase 1 to phase 3 trials. Participants received tirzepatide at 5,10, or 15 mg doses or a placebo control. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate treatment effects, and heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistic. Tirzepatide induced a mean weight reduction of -10.39 kg versus placebo (95% CI: -10.80 to -9.99; p < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses by diabetes status showed that patients with type 2 diabetes lost -6.17 kg (95% CI: -7.16 to -5.17; p < 0.00001) at 5 mg, -8.57 kg (95% CI: -9.41 to -7.74; p < 0.00001) at 10 mg, and -9.60 kg (95% CI: -10.32 to -8.89; p < 0.00001) at 15 mg. Non-diabetic participants experienced greater absolute losses of -12.10 kg (95% CI: -13.47 to -10.72; p < 0.00001), -15.94 kg (95% CI: -17.25 to -14.62; p < 0.00001), and -17.86 kg (95% CI: -19.19 to -16.54; p < 0.00001) at the respective doses. Tirzepatide also markedly increased the odds of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss: ≥ 5% (OR=11.32; p < 0.0001), ≥ 10% (OR=14.77; p < 0.0001), and ≥ 15% (OR=18.07; p < 0.0001. Adverse events were more frequent with tirzepatide than placebo (OR=1.34; p < 0.0001), largely driven by gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas serious adverse events did not differ. Discontinuations due to side effects increased at higher doses (OR=2.31; p < 0.0001). Tirzepatide induces significant, dose-dependent weight loss, with higher doses yielding greater reductions. While gastrointestinal side effects were common, they were generally mild to moderate and did not increase serious adverse events. These findings support tirzepatide as an effective weight management therapy, though strategies to mitigate gastrointestinal symptoms may improve adherence.",

Insulin regulates cellular metabolism and growth under normal conditions by activating downstream signaling pathways through its receptors. Nonetheless, insulin resistance, which compromises the insulin signaling pathway and impairs cardiovascular system performance, is common in individuals with T2DM. The key insulin signaling genes include IRS1, IRS2, PIK3R1, and GLUT4 play important roles in insulin receptor signaling, PI3K complex assembly, and glucose transport, respectively. Mutations or abnormal expression of these genes may lead to disorders in the insulin signaling pathway, affecting the normal regulation of glucose metabolism and impairment of myocardial function, thereby promoting the development of DCM.

        "abstract": "Patients with diabetes exhibit high frequencies of psychological burden and diabetes-related distress. Child maltreatment has been independently linked to both diabetes and psychological burden. We aimed 1) to explore the association between child maltreatment and diabetes-related distress, and between child maltreatment and psychological burden, and 2) to investigate the mediating role of personality functioning (psychological abilities with regard to the self and others) in this association. We included epistemic trust (openness for social learning) and its impairments mistrust (the tendency to consider information sources as unreliable or ill-intended) and credulity (lack of vigilance and discrimination between trustworthy and untrustworthy information) as covariates. In a sample of n=119 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes aged 18-69, self-report questionnaires assessed diabetes-related distress (PAID-5), psychological burden (PHQ-D, PHQ-9, PHQ-15), child maltreatment (CTQ), personality functioning (OPD-SQS), and epistemic trust, mistrust, and credulity (ETMCQ). Mediation analyses assessed the role of personality functioning in the association between child maltreatment, diabetes-related distress, and psychological burden, including epistemic trust, mistrust, and credulity as covariates. Patients with child maltreatment compared to those without showed higher diabetes-related distress (<i>t</i> <sub>(112)</sub>=4.033, <i>p</i><.001, <i>d</i>=.756) and higher frequencies of major depressive syndrome (χ<sup>2</sup> <sub>(1)</sub>=10.968, <i>p</i><.001, φ=.310) with medium effect sizes.

Impairments in personality functioning were more severe (<i>t</i> <sub>(100,857)</sub>=5.136, <i>p</i><.001, d=.967), with a large effect size. Epistemic mistrust and credulity were significantly higher (mistrust: <i>t</i> <sub>(111)</sub>=3.677, <i>p</i><.001, d=.692; credulity: <i>t</i> <sub>(111)</sub>=5.000, <i>p</i><.001, d=.941), with medium and large effect sizes. No differences regarding epistemic trust were found (<i>t</i> <sub>(111)</sub>=.409, <i>p=</i>.683, d=.077), with the effect size below the threshold for small effects. Personality functioning mediated the association between child maltreatment and diabetes-related distress (b=.03, 95%-CI [.005,.053]), depressive symptoms (b=.08, 95%-CI [.030,.129]), and somatic symptoms (b=.06, 95%-CI [.020,.122]). In a clinical diabetes sample, diabetes-related distress and psychological burden are frequently reported, and personality functioning is impaired, particularly after child maltreatment.

The evidence of the impact of multimorbidity on dementia among elderly people in China is scarce in detail. This study was performed to examine the association between the prevalence of suspected dementia and multimorbidity, as well as pattern of multimorbidity among the elderly in Shanghai. This was a cross-sectional study, with 5040 elderly individuals from 21 communities enrolled. The prevalence of suspected dementia was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In addition, the diagnosed chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) were investigated such that multimorbidity was defined as individuals suffering from two or more chronic diseases at the same time. Binary logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the impact of multimorbidity and its patterns on suspected dementia. Data of 4945 older adults were analyzed. The overall prevalence of suspected dementia and multimorbidity were 15.73% and 35.98%.

To analyze the changes of EGG in patients with MASLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to elucidate whether ultrasound-diagnosed MASLD is an independent risk factor for diabetic gastric motility disorders (DGMD). A total of 272 patients with T2DM hospitalized at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from December 2020 to December 2021 and the Affiliated Suqian Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from November 2023 to June 2024 were included in the cross-sectional study. General information, clinical data, and medical history of all study subjects, including name, age, gender, body mass index, and duration of diabetes were collected. Laboratory tests included biochemical parameters, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting C-peptide, 2h postprandial C-peptide and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. EGG, fundus examination and carotid artery ultrasonography were performed and results were recorded. According to the results of EGG, the subjects were divided into the DGMD group and non-DGMD group. The duration of diabetes, fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, 25(OH)D and the prevalence of MASLD were significantly higher in the DGMD group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the duration, FBG, 25(OH)D and the presence of MASLD were independent influencing factors. MASLD is strongly associated with an increased incidence of DGMD. Timely treatment of MASLD is effective to prevent diabetic gastroparesis.",

In Viet Nam, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rising in prevalence and there is an urgent need for better clinical management, particularly in early detection methods that will improve overall prognosis. To examine M2BPGi cut-off values for staging liver fibrosis in patients with MASLD and risk factors associated with disease progression. A total of 301 individuals with ultrasound-confirmed or FibroScan-confirmed diagnosis of fatty liver were enrolled in the study. The participants were stratified according to fibrosis stage, measured <i>via</i> magnetic resonance elastography. M2BPGi, Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index score, and routine parameters of liver function were assessed to statistically investigate the correlation of M2BPGi levels in various fibrosis stages and to identify risk factors associated with fibrosis severity. M2BPGi levels positively correlated with fibrosis stages, with cut-off indexes of 0.57 for F0-1, 0.68 for F2-3, and 0.78 for F4. M2BPGi levels in the F0-1 group were significantly different from those in both the F2-3 group (<i>P</i> = 0.038) and the F4 group (<i>P</i> = 0.0051); the F2-3 and F4 groups did not show a significant difference (<i>P</i> = 0.39). Females exhibited significantly higher M2BPGi levels than males for all fibrosis stages, particularly in the F2-3 group (<i>P</i> = 0.01) and F4 group (<i>P</i> = 0.0006). In the F4 (cirrhosis) group, individuals with diabetes had significantly higher M2BPGi levels than those without. M2BPGi, hemoglobin A1c, and FIB-4 score were identified as independent risk factors for greater fibrosis and cirrhosis. M2BPGi levels varied significantly throughout fibrosis progression, from early MASLD to cirrhosis, with sex correlation. M2BPGi holds promise as an early biomarker for fibrosis characterization in MASLD adult patient populations.",

        "abstract": "The search for reliable biomarkers to predict metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains a key research focus. Traditional anthropometric parameters, such as triglycerides, glucose, and waist circumference (WC), have proven to be robust tools for diagnosing, stratifying, and predicting health outcomes. These measures facilitate early detection, personalized treatment strategies, and long-term risk assessment in metabolic health. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and related parameters, particularly the TyG-WC index, are gaining recognition as reliable biomarkers for MASLD, with consistently high diagnostic accuracy across diverse populations. The TyG-WC index is associated with MASLD and an increased likelihood of all-cause, cardiovascular, and diabetes-related mortality, highlighting its importance in stratification and patient management. This opinion review summarizes key findings on the TyG-WC index across different MASLD populations and provides nutritional recommendations aimed at reducing this index. The TyG-WC index stands out as a practical and scalable biomarker for identifying and stratifying the risk of MASLD, particularly in resource-limited environments where access to advanced diagnostic tools is restricted. However, before the TyG-WC index can be integrated into routine clinical practice, rigorous, longitudinal studies involving ethnically diverse cohorts must validate its prognostic performance. It should be viewed as a complementary tool within a comprehensive metabolic risk assessment framework, supporting preventive strategies while awaiting formal endorsement in clinical guidelines.",

Although DKA is a frequent complication in children, this triad is rare. We report a 10-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) for 10 months, who presented with DKA, severe HTG, and AP. Her serum was lipemic. She had HTG (1733 mg/dl, 19.5 mmol/L; reference range, 90-129 mg/dl, 1,016-1,456 mmol/L) and severe abdominal pain that did not improve despite treatment for ketoacidosis. She had high lipase levels (1581 U/L, reference range 28-100 U/L), and pancreatitis was detected on abdominal tomography. She recovered with a combination of hydration and insulin therapy. A heterozygous p.N318S (c.953A>G) variant was detected in her lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene. Her apolipoprotein B (ApoB) was elevated at 1.44 g/L (reference range, 0.6-1.17 g/L, 60-117 mg/dl). It is well established that both the likely pathogenic LPL variants and high ApoB concentrations contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications.

        "abstract": "Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice. The differential diagnosis is vast and requires a methodical approach to determining the cause. Hypotonic hyponatremia is the commonest form and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a typical cause, especially in patients who have cancer. On the other hand, hyponatremia with elevated serum osmolality (hypertonic hyponatremia) is not common, and as such, clinicians are less familiar with this clinical scenario. Clinicians are even less familiar with the use of calculated osmolality and the osmolar gap in such scenarios. Therefore, it is easy to misdiagnose a patient with SIADH in the presence of cancer if a thorough biochemical analysis is not performed. We describe the case of a 56-year-old man who presented with episodes of dizziness and was demonstrated to have chronic hypertonic hyponatremia. Because of a previous diagnosis of mild SIADH several months prior, the presence of severe hyponatremia on a background of cancer, and relatively elevated urine osmolality, the elevated serum osmolality was not appreciated and the serum osmolar gap was not calculated. This resulted in a misdiagnosis of chronic SIADH. It was only after the osmolar gap was calculated and found to be significantly elevated that the markedly elevated serum ethanol level was discovered, and a diagnosis of alcohol-related hypertonic hyponatremia was made. On reassessment, the patient admitted to drinking large quantities of high alcohol-containing drinks for over the preceding three months. On gradual alcohol cessation, his blood results returned to normal. This case report highlights the importance of thorough assessment and the use of osmolar gap when navigating through the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia.",

To examine the association between adherence to a Diabetes Risk Reduction Diet (DRRD) and mortality from CLD in a prospective adult cohort. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute, Lahore, Pakistan, and the DHQ (District Headquarter) Hospital, Bagh, AJK, Pakistan, from January 2023 to June 2023. Data were collected from a large, population-based health and nutrition survey that incorporated detailed dietary intake assessments, clinical parameters, and long-term mortality follow-up. Participants were enrolled at baseline and followed over time to observe liver-specific mortality outcomes. A total of 435 adult participants were included in the study. Participants aged more than 18 years with complete dietary data, as well as relevant clinical and demographic information, were included. During the follow-up period, 48 liver-related deaths were recorded. Participants in the highest DRRD adherence tertile had a significantly lower risk of CLD mortality (adjusted HR (hazard ratio) 0.31; 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.13-0.72; p = 0.006) compared to the lowest tertile. A dose-response trend was observed (p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding diabetic participants yielded consistent findings. High DRRD adherence was also associated with lower ALT levels and healthier baseline profiles. High adherence to a DRRD is significantly associated with reduced mortality from CLD. These findings underscore the potential of metabolic-focused dietary interventions in mitigating liver-related outcomes.",

After a nondiagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram, she underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), during which topical benzocaine spray was administered for oro-esophageal anesthesia. Following the procedure, she developed asymptomatic but profound hypoxemia, requiring rapid escalation from room air to 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask, despite denying dyspnea. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a methemoglobin level of 31.8%, confirming benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia. She was promptly treated with methylene blue, resulting in rapid clinical improvement and return to room air the next morning.

        "abstract": "Background and objectives The global burden of prediabetes and diabetes is rising rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, where lifestyle and nutritional transitions are accelerating. Economically disadvantaged rural populations often lack awareness and access to care, making them highly vulnerable. Measuring the prevalence and identifying associated factors is essential for guiding public health strategies and resource allocation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi community to inform targeted prevention and control strategies. Methodology We recruited 891 adults for this cross-sectional study in January-June 2020 through random sampling from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System in Bangladesh, ensuring at least five years of residency. Trained Community Health Workers collected sociodemographic data using a semi-structured questionnaire and performed physical examination and anthropometric measurements. We used fasting blood sugar to screen patients for prediabetes and diabetes, and measured serum creatinine and urine albumin to creatinine ratio to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also collected blood samples to measure serum albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood and urine samples were tested in an accredited laboratory. Results Prevalence of prediabetes was 38% (n=343), and diabetes was 17% (n=151). Age-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 5%, 12% and 22%, and of diabetes were 1%, 3% and 13%, for the age groups of 18-30, 31-45, and ≥46 years, respectively. Sex-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 22% and 17%, and diabetes were 9% and 8%, for female and male participants, respectively. In multiple multinomial logistic regression, for prediabetes, significant risk factor was age ≥31 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.84, 95%CI 1.64-4.92), and protective factors were smokeless tobacco use (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.94) and hypoalbuminemia (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.24-0.99), and for diabetes, significant risk factors were age ≥31 years (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 1.37-11.95), abdominal obesity (aOR 2.80, 95%CI 1.49-5.30), CKD (aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.70-4.62), hypercholesterolemia (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.17-3.30) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.44-3.79), and protective factors were being female (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.066-0.68), and smokeless tobacco user (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.63). Conclusion This study reveals a high burden of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi population. The findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen community-based screening and targeted prevention strategies to address the growing diabetes burden in underserved areas.",

Its intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics limits treatment options and contributes to adverse clinical outcomes. Aim and objective The study aimed to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of <i>E. meningoseptica</i> infections among ICU/NICU patients and to explore potential environmental sources through hospital-based surveillance. The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical and demographic profiles of ICU/NICU patients with <i>E. meningoseptica</i> infection; to assess the associated risk factors contributing to these infections; to analyze the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolated strains using standardized microbiological methods; to evaluate treatment outcomes including morbidity, mortality, and duration of ICU/NICU stay; and to identify potential environmental reservoirs of <i>E. meningoseptica</i> through surveillance activities coordinated by the Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC). Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted over 18 months (July 2023 to October 2024) at a tertiary care hospital. A total of 15 patients with culture-confirmed <i>E. meningoseptica</i> infection were included. Demographic, clinical, microbiological, and treatment data were collected. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using the Vitek-2 automated identification system (bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France). HICC conducted routine and targeted environmental sampling as per policy protocol. Results Among the 15 patients with <i>E. meningoseptica</i> infection, nine (60.0%) were adults, and 11 (73.3%) were male individuals. Sepsis was reported in nine (60.0%), and both ventilator-associated pneumonia and septic shock occurred in six patients each (40.0%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were present in six (40.0%) and three (20.0%) patients, respectively. Two neonates (13.3%) with low birth weight and prematurity required NICU admission. Outcomes included mortality in six patients (40.0%), discharge in five (33.3%), and four (26.7%) leaving against medical advice. Endotracheal secretions were the most frequent specimen (46.7%), followed by tracheostomy secretions (33.3%) and blood cultures (13.3%). All isolates (100%) were resistant to carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Resistance to gentamicin, colistin, and cotrimoxazole was observed in 73.3%, 66.7%, and 46.7% of isolates, respectively. Highest susceptibility was seen with minocycline (66.7%), vancomycin (60.0%), and fluoroquinolones (53.3%). Environmental surveillance, conducted from January to March 2023 as part of routine as well as targeted HICC monitoring (as an outbreak of suspected pathogens was suspected from the NICU and ICU), included 98 samples from high-risk ICU/NICU sites such as sinks, ventilators, humidifiers, and suction units. <i>E. meningoseptica</i> was identified in one sample (1.02%), isolated from a NICU sink. Conclusion <i>E. meningoseptica</i> infections are associated with high resistance and mortality. Minocycline, vancomycin, and fluoroquinolones may be effective. Early detection, targeted therapy, and HICC-led surveillance are essential for control.",

Diabetes, once considered a predominantly urban condition, is increasingly being reported from rural populations as well, reflecting broader lifestyle and epidemiological transitions. National reports highlight a growing prevalence of high blood glucose levels, particularly among adults, with a rising trend in both awareness and disease burden. India is now among the countries with the highest number of individuals living with diabetes, necessitating urgent public health attention. This study examines the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors among adults in a rural area of Haryana, contributing to the evidence base required for targeted NCD prevention and control strategies in similar settings. The study was conducted among 910 adults aged ≥18 years from villages under the Primary Health Center (PHC) Garhi Harsaru, Haryana, India. Cluster random sampling, using probability proportional to size (PPS), was employed to recruit study participants. All the study participants were subjected to the WHO STEPS questionnaire, and random blood glucose estimation was done. Apart from these, demographic, socioeconomic, and anthropometric details, along with blood pressure and physical activity, were recorded, and their association with the prevalence of diabetes was studied. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 26.0 (Chicago, IL: IBM Corp.). Pearson's chi-squared test was used to evaluate differences between groups for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the independent associations.  The prevalence of newly detected diabetes was 6.2%. Adults aged 50-59 years (OR: 3.4), overweight, and obesity (OR: 5.80) were found to be the independent risk factors significantly associated with diabetes mellitus in the study population.  The prevalence of diabetes is rising, even in the rural population of Haryana. Targeted preventive strategies focusing on lifestyle modification and education should be prioritized in primary care settings to address this growing rural health challenge.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rapid surge in cases of mucormycosis, leading to the origin of the term COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Although several studies described its outcomes after treatment, very few described both short-term and long-term outcomes. This study aims to describe the immediate and long-term outcomes of the treatment of CAM at NRI General Hospital (NRIGH), a tertiary care COVID-19 hospital, to identify the factors that affect the outcomes of treatment. Methodology This is a retrospective chart review of CAM patients treated at the Department of ENT, NRIGH, from November 2020 to January 2022. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, symptomatology, extent of disease, extent of surgery, antifungal therapy, and outcomes of treatment after one, three, six, and 12 months were collected. Cure and stable disease were defined as successful outcomes. Unstable disease or mortality due to disease was defined as unsuccessful outcomes. Univariate and multivariate longitudinal ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between time, clinical characteristics, and treatment-related factors with an ordinal outcome measured longitudinally (baseline, three, six, and 12 months). Results There was no statistically significant association between age, sex, duration of symptoms, laterality of disease, steroid use, and CAM outcomes. There was a statistically significant association between diabetes, hypertension, baseline extent of disease, particularly intracranial extension, and outcomes of CAM treatment (p < 0.05). Extent of surgery exhibited a time-dependent trend, with strong associations only in univariate analysis at one month (p = 0.001) and three months (p = 0.005), but weakening associations at six and 12 months (p = 0.33). Longitudinal regression model showed that antifungal therapy with amphotericin B (AMB) was related to much poorer outcomes (odds ratio = 23.2, p = 0.001). Posaconazole (PCZ) alone or AMB followed by PCZ therapy showed trends toward better outcomes, with the latter regimen showing borderline statistical significance (p = 0.05), well-supported by univariate analyses at three, six, and 12 months (all p = 0.001). The all-cause mortality rate was 14.28%. Short-term (three months) and long-term (one year) treatment success was 85.71%. Conclusions Diabetes and the extent of baseline disease adversely affect the outcomes of treatment. Surgical technique likely plays a determining role in early recovery patterns, but becomes less determinant of long-term outcomes. Drug regimens and comorbidity burden may affect outcomes, but require larger studies for confirmation.",

The present study describes the cases of 3 patients with hyperkalemia that occurred during RAASi therapy and describes the therapeutic approach used for this serious complication. The clinical/laboratory findings of hospitalized patients with hyperkalemia within a short time period (within 30 days) and treatment were recorded. Acute hyperkalemia developed due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and spironolactone in 3 patients, whose cases are reported herein. Insulin glucose infusion (IGI) + salbutamol + potassium binders were used for the treatment of severe hyperkalemia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) regressed in all patients. Hyperkalemia was corrected within 6 h in 1 patient who was treated with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate in addition to IGI. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that hyperkalemia may be symptomatic/asymptomatic and may develop during the earlier or later period of RAASi therapy for cardiovascular-renal disease, particularly in older patients. AKI improved with the correction of hyperkalemia and the discontinuation of ACEi/ARB and spironolactone. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate may be the preferred treatment in emergency cases of hyperkalemia due to its rapid effects. On the other hand, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists may also be used to avoid the development of hyperkalemia in patients undergoing RAASi therapy.",

The infection's tendency to spread from the sinuses to the orbit and central nervous system (CNS) significantly increases morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to identify clinical risk factors and outcomes associated with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM), with a focus on disease progression to orbital and CNS involvement. A total of 180 confirmed CAM patients were enrolled and classified into three groups based on disease extent: sinus-only, sinus with orbital involvement, and sinus with both orbital and CNS involvement. Data were collected on demographics, clinical history, laboratory findings, imaging results, treatment modalities, and outcomes. Of the 180 patients, 63.3% had sinus-only involvement, 23.9% had sinus and orbital involvement, and 12.8% had sinus, orbital, and CNS involvement. Uncontrolled diabetes was observed in 38% of patients and was more prevalent in those with extensive disease. Corticosteroid use was significantly associated with disease severity (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Invasive procedures, such as orbital exenteration, were significantly linked to CNS progression (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 31% (55 of 180 patients). Uncontrolled diabetes and corticosteroid therapy are major risk factors for severe CAM. Extension of mucormycosis beyond the sinuses, particularly to the orbit and CNS, is associated with poor clinical outcomes and often requires aggressive surgical management. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention are essential to improve survival in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) plays an important role in the innate immune response and is depleted during SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increased turnover. It is unknown whether treatment with NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors can safely raise NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in patients with COVID-19. To determine whether MIB-626 (<i>β-</i>nicotinamide mononucleotide), an NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, can safely increase blood NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and attenuate acute kidney injury (AKI) and inflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 42 adults, ≥ 18 years, hospitalized with COVID-19 and AKI, were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to MIB-626 1.0-g or placebo tablets twice daily for 14 days. Circulating NAD<sup>+</sup> and its metabolites, markers of AKI, inflammation, and disease severity, were assessed. MIB-626 treatment significantly but gradually raised blood NAD<sup>+</sup> levels to a peak between 5 to 14 days (16.0 ± 6.9, 25.5 ± 12.6, and 42.6 ± 25.6 μg/mL at baseline, days 5 and 14) and raised plasma concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites 1-methylnicotinamide, N-methyl, 2-pyridone, 4-carboxamide rapidly to a peak by day 3. Changes in serum creatinine, cystatin-C, and serum markers of AKI did not differ significantly between groups. Serum CRP, IL-6, and TNFα and indices of disease severity also did not differ between groups. MIB-626 treatment of patients with COVID-19 and AKI safely and substantially raised blood NAD<sup>+</sup> and plasma concentrations of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites. Markers of AKI, inflammation, and disease severity did not differ between groups, likely due to the slow rise in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. Future studies should assess whether a rapid increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> by parenteral administration can attenuate disease severity and AKI. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05038488.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a hybrid deep learning model for classifying multiple fundus diseases using ultra-widefield (UWF) images, thereby improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy while providing an auxiliary tool for clinical decision-making. In this retrospective study, 10,612 UWF fundus images were collected from the JiuJiang No. 1 People's Hospital and the Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between 2020 and 2025, covering 16 fundus diseases, including normal fundus, nine common eye diseases, and six rare retinal conditions. The model employed DenseNet121 as a feature extractor combined with an XGBoost classifier. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to visualize the model's decision-making process. Performance was evaluated on validation and external test sets using accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. The model's diagnostic accuracy was also compared with that of junior and intermediate ophthalmologists. The model demonstrated exceptional diagnostic performance. For common diseases such as retinal vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, AUC values exceeded 0.975, with accuracy rates above 0.980. For rare diseases, AUC values were above 0.970, and accuracy rates surpassed 0.998. Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed that the model's focus areas aligned with clinical pathological features. Compared to ophthalmologists, the model achieved significantly higher accuracy across all diagnostic tasks. The proposed deep learning model can automatically identify and classify multiple ophthalmic diseases using UWF images. It holds promise for enhancing clinical diagnostic efficiency, assisting ophthalmologists in optimizing workflows, and improving patient care quality.",

        "abstract": "Adequate hydration is essential for overall health; however, data on hydration status among Malaysian adults are limited. This study aimed to compare the hydration status of urban and rural adults in Selangor, Malaysia. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving participants from urban (n=189) and rural (n=188) areas near Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), selected through purposive sampling. The study included 377 healthy adults aged 18-59 years (mean {SD}: 31.34 {11.64} years). Participants with health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, gastrointestinal diseases, kidney disorders, and cardiovascular issues, were excluded. Additionally, individuals taking prescription medications, food supplements, consuming high levels of caffeine or alcohol, smoking heavily, or engaging in intense aerobic training were also excluded. Sociodemographic data were collected, and hydration status was assessed using urine samples (first-morning and 24-hour) and blood tests (plasma osmolality, blood count, and renal function). Urine measurements included specific gravity (USG), osmolality (UOSM), volume (UVOL), and colour (UCOL), which were compared against hydration biomarkers. Chi-square tests and independent t-tests (p<0.05) were employed to compare sociodemographic characteristics and hydration status between urban and rural adults. Factor analysis was used to assess the reliability of hydration measurements. Significant differences were observed in USG, UOSM, and UVOL of first-morning urine samples (χ²{2}=6.537, p=0.038; χ²{1}=6.465, p=0.011; t{375}=-2.10, p=0.036). Additionally, significant differences in USG and UOSM of 24-hour urine samples were noted between urban and rural adults (χ²{2}=27.686, p=0.000; χ²{2}=11.030, p=0.000). Blood tests revealed significant differences in hematocrit (HCT) (t{375}=-1.987, p=0.048), sodium concentration (Na) (t{375}=-4.468, p=0.000), potassium concentration (K) (t{375}=3.563, p=0.000), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (t{371.96}=-4.247, p=0.000) between urban and rural adults. The results indicated that rural adults are less hydrated than their urban counterparts. Factor analysis confirmed that urine measurements are strong indicators of hydration status (quality scores >1), with USG and UOSM in first-morning urine (FMU) showing a strong positive correlation with 24-hour urine samples (0.999), indicating that urine tests are more reliable than blood tests for assessing hydration status. This study found significant differences in hydration status between urban and rural adults in Selangor, Malaysia, based on both urine and blood measurements; however, urine tests proved to be more reliable for assessing hydration levels. These findings may inform strategies to improve hydration among Malaysian adults. Further research is warranted to investigate factors influencing hydration status.",

However, transitioning from insulin therapy to these agents can lead to rare complications, such as diabetic ketoalkalosis, a metabolic disturbance marked by simultaneous ketosis and alkalosis. We report an unusual case of diabetic ketoalkalosis, a mixed acid-base disorder, in a 57-year-old female patient with insulin-dependent T2DM following a switch to Mounjaro (tirzepatide). The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, elevated anion gap, ketosis, and a slightly alkalotic venous pH. This was attributed to insulin deficiency and vomiting-induced acid loss and bicarbonate retention. Management with fluids, electrolytes, and insulin led to rapid recovery. This case highlights the need for gradual insulin tapering and close monitoring while transitioning from insulin therapy to GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists.",

        "title": "Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With Oral Lichen Planus in a Cohort From Casablanca, Morocco.",
        "abstract": "Background Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the oral mucosa and is more frequently observed in women. OLP presents in various forms, including reticular, papular, plaque-like, erosive, atrophic, and bullous. The etiology remains unclear, though immune dysregulation is thought to be a key factor. OLP has the potential to transform into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Department of Oral Surgery and Pathology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca. Over a period of 46 months, patients diagnosed with OLP were followed. Data were collected using a standardized form that covered demographic, clinical, biological, and histological criteria, as well as follow-up information. Blood tests included complete blood count, glucose levels, and liver function tests. Biopsies were performed for diagnostic confirmation and follow-up, with direct immunofluorescence (DIF) used in complex cases. Patients with suspected cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) were referred to the dermatology department for evaluation. Treatment involved the removal of irritants, with corticosteroid therapy tailored to the severity of the lesion. Systemic corticosteroids were used for severe or treatment-resistant cases. Diabetic patients requiring systemic therapy were managed in collaboration with endocrinologists. Results Out of 9,841 consultations, 44 cases of OLP were identified, resulting in a prevalence rate of 4.5‰. The mean age of patients was 54.5 ± 13.5 years, with a predominance of women. Comorbidities included diabetes and hypertension in some cases. The reticular form was most common, followed by the bullous form. The buccal mucosa was the primary site of involvement. CLP co-occurred in 22.7% of cases. Malignant transformation was observed in one patient. Discussion The study, conducted at a single center with a focus on oral pathology, aligns with international findings, demonstrating a higher prevalence in women aged 50 to 60 years and a predominance of reticular forms with involvement of the buccal mucosa. A higher incidence of bullous lesions was observed compared to previous reports. Anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus) testing was systematically performed due to Morocco's moderate HCV prevalence. The association between OLP and diabetes may be influenced by the high diabetes prevalence in Morocco. Although treatment provided symptom relief, therapeutic options remain limited. The rate of malignant transformation was consistent with that reported in prior studies. Conclusion This study confirms a higher prevalence of OLP in women aged 50 to 60 years, with reticular forms and involvement of the buccal mucosa. Diabetes was the most commonly associated condition, and chronic HCV infection, while infrequent, may pose an increased risk. Regular monitoring is crucial due to the potential for malignant transformation, particularly in women and those with erosive or atrophic subtypes.",

        "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue, is a novel medication with comparable pharmacological characteristics and has demonstrated promising weight reduction outcomes in its antidiabetic trials following the approval of liraglutide and semaglutide for long-term weight control. Nonetheless, this efficacy has not been fully explored, so this meta-analysis was aimed to measure the weight loss efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in adults with overweight or obesity. <b>Methods:</b> We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for RCTs of once-weekly tirzepatide vs. placebo or GLP-1 receptor agonists. We included studies involving adult participants who were overweight or obese despite T2DM or OHA use, with a trial duration of at least 20 weeks. The primary outcomes accounted for the mean difference in weight from baseline in the three doses of tirzepatide compared to placebo and GLP-1 receptor agonists, separately. The secondary outcomes included safety profiles and achievement of categorical weight loss of 5%, 10% and 15%. We performed the statistical analysis on RevMan 5.4, GRADE assessment using GRADEpro GDT and the quality of the included studies assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (Version 2) tool. <b>Results:</b> We identified six RCTs in which the data of 6266 subjects were analysed. Once-weekly doses (5, 10 and 15 mg) of tirzepatide were more effective than placebo and GLP-1 RAs. Also, the proportion of patients achieving categorical weight loss goals was higher in the tirzepatide groups than in others. GRADE assessment also indicated high-certainty evidence for ≥ 15% weight loss with tirzepatide and moderate-to-low certainty for lower thresholds. Gastrointestinal side effects appeared similar between the three doses of tirzepatide and GLP-1 RAs, but they were significantly higher than placebo might impact tolerability for certain patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> A dose-dependent tirzepatide was superior to placebo and GLP-1 RAs in weight reduction. However, the lean mass reduction and tolerability require further investigation. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04255433.",

Identifying and understanding the risk factors associated with SSIs in these patients is crucial for improving surgical outcomes and patient care. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library on September 19, 2023, without restrictions on publication period or language. The inclusion criteria comprised observational studies and randomized controlled trials that investigated risk factors for SSIs following ORIF for ankle fractures. Exclusion criteria included non-empirical studies, studies without specific outcomes on SSIs, non-ORIF surgeries, and studies with incomplete data. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and statistical analyses were performed using Stata 17. Out of 1,255 initially identified articles, eight studies met the inclusion criteria after deduplication, screening, and full-text review. These studies highlighted several risk factors for SSIs, including diabetes, open fractures, high-energy injuries, and smoking, with diabetes and open fractures significantly increasing the risk. Antibiotic prophylaxis emerged as a protective factor. The quality assessment revealed a high standard of research quality among the included studies, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the findings. This meta-analysis underscores the importance of recognizing diabetes, open fractures, high-energy injuries, smoking, and a BMI exceeding 30 as significant risk factors for SSIs following ORIF for ankle fractures. The administration of antibiotic prophylaxis serves as a protective measure. Healthcare providers should incorporate strategies to mitigate these risks, enhancing postoperative care and reducing the incidence of surgical site infections.",

Although pharmacological treatments exist, there is a growing interest in complementary therapies to improve glycaemic control and attenuate disease progression. Bovine colostrum, a nutrient-rich secretion produced after parturition, contains bioactive compounds such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), lactoferrin, cytokines and immunoglobulins, which have potential therapeutic effects on diabetes. The aim of the review is to report on the various molecular mechanisms through which bovine colostrum is involved in diabetes management. The review analyzes, through clinical studies and potential therapeutic effects, the influence of colostrum on glucose metabolism, insulin sensibility, oxidative stress, and inflammatory processes. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that bovine colostrum supplementation can lower blood glucose levels, improve lipid profiles and enhance immune modulation in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, its role in healing wounds and injuries has been demonstrated in a number of studies that have demonstrated the efficacy of bovine colostrum. Furthermore, its role in wound healing and regulation of the gut microbiota highlights its potential as an adjunctive therapy for diabetes management.

This clinical guideline covers the postpartum period, with specific references to prevention, screening, diagnosis, and management of T2DM in mothers with a history of GDM and their children. The present research is a clinical guideline for women who experienced GDM. Clinical questions were created based on the PICO framework at the outset, and appropriate evidence was searched in electronic databases like PubMed, Scopus, and WOS. Two rounds of the Delphi technique were employed to achieve consensus among experts and led to the final draft of the guideline, which consisted of six guiding questions and 37 clinical recommendations. Quality appraisal of the guidelines was conducted by the AGREE instrument, an instrument for assessing six domains of guideline quality based on 23 confirmed criteria. The final guideline includes 37 recommendations that are divided into six separate modules: risk factors, prevention, screening, diagnosis, and diagnostic measures, postpartum follow-up, education, and care, recurrent pregnancy, and pharmacologic interventions. The key recommendations in this guideline include lifestyle changes, commencement of metformin, and a structured postpartum follow-up plan to lower the risk of T2DM.

        "abstract": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a key metabolite derived from the gut microbial metabolism of choline, has recently been implicated as a significant contributor to the development of several chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Its detrimental effects have garnered widespread attention in the scientific community. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), marked by persistent and recurring gastrointestinal inflammation, is a significant global health issue. Emerging evidence highlights a critical role for TMAO in the pathogenesis of IBD. This review comprehensively summarizes current research on the association between TMAO and IBD, with a particular focus on the mechanisms by which TMAO regulates immunometabolism in diseases.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that the innate immune system possesses the capacity to develop \"trained immunity\" via metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, leading to non-specific memory responses distinct from the memory traditionally attributed exclusively to adaptive immunity. Hyperglycemia, acting as an initiating stimulus, drives myeloid progenitor cell proliferation and monocyte-derived macrophage expansion, which leads to a sustained pro-inflammatory phenotype that is closely associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes and its related complications. The paradigm of trained immunity provides a novel perspective on explaining the \"metabolic memory\" phenomenon in diabetes. Here, we summarize the research progress on trained immunity, diabetes, and related complications to explore novel insights into diabetes prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is closely associated with metabolic health and cardiac function in prediabetic patients, yet its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the role of VD intervention in prediabetic cardiac injury through <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> models, with particular focus on the ErbB4/ferroptosis axis. Using a high-fat diet-induced KKAy prediabetic mouse model, we observed significant metabolic abnormalities (increased body weight, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance) and cardiac remodeling (cardiac hypertrophy and functional impairment) (<i>P</i><0.05). Remarkably, 16-week vitamin D (VD<sub>3</sub>) supplementation substantially ameliorated these pathological changes and reduced serum cardiac injury markers (<i>P</i><0.05). Mechanistic studies revealed that VD<sub>3</sub> downregulated myocardial NRG1 expression, inhibited ErbB4 phosphorylation (p-ErbB4) and YAP activation (p-YAP), while reversing the abnormal expression of ferroptosis-related proteins. <i>In vitro</i> experiments confirmed that high glucose combined with palmitic acid (HGPA) induced ferroptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, which was alleviated by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> intervention through suppression of ErbB4 phosphorylation. Notably, combined treatment with 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and the ErbB4 phosphorylation inhibitor dacomitinib demonstrated synergistic protective effects. Our findings not only expand the understanding of the association between prediabetes and VD, but also reveal a relationship between ErbB4 and cardiac ferroptosis in prediabetic conditions.",

        "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the role of circulating plasma inflammatory factors as predictors for the clinical response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). An observational clinical study was conducted with 58 participants confirmed to have DME involving the foveal center. Participants with a central retinal thickness (CRT) of 320 µm or greater were treated with intravitreal Ranibizumab. CRT, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and vessel density were assessed at 3-month intervals during follow-up. The mean LogMAR BCVA significantly improved from 0.88±0.50 at baseline to 0.681±0.491 at month 3 (P<0.001), while the CRT value decreased from 568.66±105.87 µm at baseline to 450.26±90.22 µm at month 3 (P<0.001). Of the cases, 62.07% showed a favorable anatomic response and 46.55% exhibited a favorable visual acuity response. IL-17 was linked to a limited anatomic response (P=0.02) and also negatively correlated with a favorable BCVA response (P=0.018). Similar associations were observed for IL-8, which was associated with a limited anatomic response (P<0.001) and was negatively associated with a favorable BCVA response (P=0.023). Cases that improved by at least two visual acuity lines had notably lower intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 concentrations (P=0.046). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified IL-17 and IL-8 as independent risk factors significantly associated with CRT (IL-17, P=0.003; IL-8, P=0.043), while IL-17 and ICAM-1 were independent risk factors significantly associated with BCVA (IL-17, P=0.030; ICAM-1, P=0.029). In conclusion, elevated levels of serum IL-17, IL-8 and ICAM-1 at baseline are linked to a restricted clinical response to anti-VEGF therapy for DME.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is a known risk factor for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the diabetes population is characterized by considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. This study aimed to describe the complex clinical risk profile and associated risk of PJI after TKA in patients with and without diabetes. We used Danish National Registry data to identify 75,141 TKA cases, including 9,879 patients with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), defined by International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization diagnosis codes and glucose-lowering drug prescriptions. Patients were classified by diabetes, patient, health, and social factors. We estimated PJI revision incidences five years postoperatively both overall and across various clinical profiles, considering combinations of sex, age, body weight, and the presence of vascular disease, as well as sex and severity of diabetes. The five-year PJI incidence was 1.7% (95% CI 1.5 to 2) for diabetes patients and 1.4% (95% CI 1.3 to 1.5) for non-diabetes patients. Diabetes patients were slightly older, more obese, and had poorer health and social status than non-diabetes patients. Among diabetes patients, the five-year PJI incidence ranged from 0.4% (in females, aged > 68 years, with no vascular diseases, and weight < 90 kg) to 3.7% (in males, aged < 68 years, vascular disease, and weight > 100 kg). Non-diabetes patients with the same clinical profiles had five-year PJI incidences of 0.7% and 3.4%, respectively. Females with diabetes and body weight < 90 kg but without vascular diseases had a lower PJI incidence than their non-diabetic counterparts. The risk of PJI after TKA varies highly by clinical profile in patients both with and without diabetes. These findings highlight the importance of individualized preoperative risk assessments for patients undergoing TKA.",

Identifying the best predictive tool may help clinicians select the most appropriate personalized treatment based on individual risk scores to prevent NOAF complicating AMI. A total of 2,206 patients diagnosed with AMI between June 2021 and January 2023 were included in this study. After excluding cases with missing data, univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted on 1,672 patients to assess the association between baseline characteristics and the development of atrial fibrillation. The CHA2DS2-VASC (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Age 65-74 years, Sex category), C2HEST (Coronary artery disease, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Hypertension, Elderly [age ≥ 75], Systolic heart failure, Thyroid disease), HAT2CH2 (Hypertension, Age > 75, Stroke/TIA, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Heart failure), SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery), GRACE 2.0 (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events), and SYNTAX II scores were calculated for each patient. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the SYNTAX score (SxS) had the highest predictive value for NOAF during AMI, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.785 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.767-0.802, P < 0.001), followed by the SYNTAX II score (SxSII) with an AUC of 0.747 (95% CI: 0.728-0.765, P < 0.001), and the GRACE 2.0 risk score (RS) with an AUC of 0.740 (95% CI: 0.721-0.758, P < 0.001). It was shown that the modified scores (created by incorporating hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] levels), the primary independent predictive parameter in this study, into the existing risk models demonstrated higher predictive value for NOAF (C-statistic: 0.784-0.794). Combining HbA1c levels with SxS yielded the highest diagnostic performance for predicting NOAF during AMI. In this study, while SxS outperformed other risk models, the GRACE 2.0 and SxSII scores also demonstrated relatively strong predictive value and were superior to the CHA2DS2-VASC, C2HEST, and HAT2CH2 scores for predicting NOAF in the setting of AMI.",

        "abstract": "Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes, chronic weight management and obstructive sleep apnoea (in the US). To assess the contribution of weight loss (WL) to the observed glycaemic effect, we performed mediation analysis of three randomized, controlled, parallel, 4-arm SURPASS(S)-trials; 1, 2 and 5, for a total of 2831 participants. WL dependent (WL-D) and WL independent (WL-IND) effects on comparator-adjusted glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction at Week 40 were estimated using mediation analysis, adjusted for baseline HbA1c and study-specific stratification factors. The difference in mean HbA1c change from baseline at 40 weeks (total effect) between tirzepatide and the placebo group ranged from -20.0 to -14.6 mmol/mol, and that between tirzepatide and semaglutide (1 mg) ranged from -5.1 to -1.9 mmol/mol. In the placebo-controlled trials, 12%-27% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide dose arms and placebo was estimated as being mediated through WL when given as monotherapy (S1), and 25%-45% when on the background of insulin with or without metformin (S5). Compared with semaglutide, 54%-71% of the difference in HbA1c change between tirzepatide and semaglutide was estimated as being WL-D. The tirzepatide-induced HbA1c reductions from baseline, compared with placebo or semaglutide, were mediated through both WL-D and WL-IND effects. Estimated contributions of WL to the difference in glycaemic efficacy varied and were highest when tirzepatide was compared with semaglutide and less pronounced when compared with placebo. These results help to understand that other factors beyond weight reduction contribute to HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide.",

We evaluated the anti-diabetic and myocardial-salvaging effects of a novel polyherbal combination (PHC) containing Terminalia arjuna, Commiphora mukul and Emblica officinalis in rats. Male Wistar rats weighing 150-200 g and 8-10 weeks were randomised to negative control (NC; no disease induction/treatment), disease control (DC; disease induction but no treatment), vildagliptin (disease induction and treatment with vildagliptin 10 mg/kg) or PHC1000 (disease induction and treatment with PHC 1000 mg/kg). Diabetes was induced using the standard streptozotocin method while myocardial necrosis was induced using isoproterenol. All the data were represented descriptively. We used analysis of variance and Bonferroni's test to evaluate the difference between the study groups; a P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Thirty rats were randomised (six in the NC group and eight each in the remaining three groups). Treatment with PHC1000 and vildagliptin significantly lowered the elevated blood glucose (P < 0.001). The creatine phosphokinase myocardial band levels were significantly lower in the PHC1000 and vildagliptin-treated rats versus the DC group (P < 0.001). The cardioprotective effect of PHC1000 was superior to that of vildagliptin (P < 0.05). PHC and vildagliptin treatment showed statistically significant DPP-4 inhibitory activity (P < 0.001). The biochemical parameters and histopathological observations endorsed the safety of PHC. The PHC exhibited significant antidiabetic and cardioprotective efficacy.

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is a cell surface glycoprotein that primarily facilitates leucocyte recruitment from circulation to inflammation sites. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the significance of circulatory irisin and ICAM-1 levels in DR. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry, India. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with retinopathy (n = 60) and without retinopathy (n = 60) were recruited. Apart from anthropometric data, blood samples were collected for routine biochemical tests and estimation of serum irisin and ICAM-1 by ELISA. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 20.0. The variables were compared using Independent Student's-t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, one-way analysis of variance, or Chi-square test. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis evaluated irisin and ICAM-1 in differentiating proliferative DR (PDR) and non-proliferative DR (NPDR). Compared to T2DM patients without DR, Serum irisin was higher in those with DR, but no difference was observed in ICAM-1 between the 2 groups. Both irisin and ICAM-1 were decreased in vision-threatening DR (VTDR) compared to non-vision-threatening DR (non-VTDR). Decreased levels of irisin (P = 0.84) and ICAM-1 (P ≤ 0.001) were seen across DR stages. ROC analysis showed irisin differentiated NPDR and PDR (AUC = 0.7, P = 0.01). Serum irisin and ICAM-1 increased in earlier stages of DR but decreased in later stages. They were decreased in pre-proliferative and proliferative stages of DR, suggesting roles in leucocyte migration and angiogenesis.

Effective self-management is key to improving health outcomes, yet gender plays a crucial role in shaping patients' experiences and approaches to managing chronic conditions. This study aimed to explore gender differences in self-management among individuals living with multiple chronic diseases. We conducted a qualitative phenomenological study using in-depth semi-structured interviews with 43 patients, purposively sampled to capture variation in age, socioeconomic background, and healthcare setting. Interviews explored experiences of self-management among both women and men, and data were analysed thematically to identify patterns across narratives. Thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data, and findings were interpreted in alignment with the domains of the Patient Activation Measure-13 (PAM-13). Six main themes emerged: personal responsibility, health literacy, self-management and decision-making, communication with healthcare professionals, adherence and treatment monitoring, prevention of complications, and lifestyle modifications. Importantly, gender differences significantly shaped patients' engagement with self-management across all thematic areas. Women generally demonstrated a more proactive approach, while men were more likely to depend on external support. This study highlights distinct gendered approaches to chronic illness management. Women tended to actively engage in self-care and frequently took on informal caregiving responsibilities, pointing to the need for interventions that support shared decision-making and alleviate caregiver burden. In contrast, men were generally more reliant on others and less inclined to seek help, emphasizing the importance of fostering autonomy, enhancing health literacy, and encouraging early engagement with healthcare services. These findings underscore the value of gender-sensitive, patient-centred approaches in chronic disease management to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with a significantly elevated incidence among individuals with hypertension. Conventional risk assessment methods primarily rely on a limited set of clinical parameters and often exclude imaging-derived structural features, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based multimodal stroke risk prediction model by integrating carotid ultrasound imaging with multidimensional clinical data to enable precise identification of high-risk individuals among hypertensive patients. A total of 2,176 carotid artery ultrasound images from 1,088 hypertensive patients were collected. ResNet50 was employed to automatically segment the carotid intima-media and extract key structural features. These imaging features, along with clinical variables such as age, blood pressure, and smoking history, were fused using a Vision Transformer (ViT) and fed into a Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) for risk stratification. The model's performance was systematically evaluated using metrics including AUC, Dice coefficient, IoU, and Precision-Recall curves. The proposed multimodal fusion model achieved outstanding performance on the test set, with an AUC of 0.97, a Dice coefficient of 0.90, and an IoU of 0.80. Ablation studies demonstrated that the inclusion of ViT and RBPNN modules significantly enhanced predictive accuracy. Subgroup analysis further confirmed the model's robust performance in high-risk populations, such as those with diabetes or smoking history. The deep learning-based multimodal fusion model effectively integrates carotid ultrasound imaging and clinical features, significantly improving the accuracy of stroke risk prediction in hypertensive patients. The model demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical application potential, offering a valuable tool for early screening and personalized intervention planning for stroke prevention.

        "abstract": "Misuse of antibiotics makes it very easy for bacteria to become resistant to drugs. Houttuynia cordata (HC) has antibacterial, antiviral, analgesic, antioxidant, diuretic, hypoglycemic, and immune-enhancing properties. To study the inhibitory effect of HC on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from tissue or pus specimens from patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Seventy-two patients with DFU were randomly divided into three groups and given treatment with methicillin (Met), meropenem (Mer), and HC, respectively. Analysis and identification of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the Orbitrap Exploris™ 480. The drug susceptibility of four isolates to HC was studied by bacteriostatic test. The MIC and MBC of Houttuynia cordata against four isolates were determined using the broth microdilution method. The growth and time-kill curves of the bacteria were studied by bacterial inhibition experiments.The effect of Houttuynia cordata on the viability of H6C7 cells was examined by MTT assay. HC treatment improved clinical parameters of DFUs patients. The inhibition zone of S08 (MSSA) was 15.45 ± 0.12 mm, which was highly sensitive to Houttuynia cordata. The inhibition zone sizes of R11 (MRSA), P10 (CRPA) and D22 (MDRPA) were 12.64 ± 0.09 mm,13.42 ± 0.11 mm and 11.23 ± 0.08 mm, respectively. All of them were moderately sensitive to Houttuynia cordata. The MIC of S08,R11,P10 and D22 were 31.25,62.5,62.5 and 125 µg/mL, respectively. The MBCS of S08,R11,P10 and D22 were 500,1000,1000 and 1000 µg/mLrespectively.Bacterial growth curves and time-kill curves demonstrated that Houttuynia cordata significantly inhibited the growth of both bacteria. Cytotoxicity assay showed that Houttuynia cordata effectively inhibited bacteria without cytotoxicity to eukaryotic cells. Houttuynia cordata exhibits promising antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including drug-resistant strains, without cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic cells. These findings support its potential as an alternative therapeutic agent for DFU-associated infections.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the lipid metabolism and anatomical risk factors of post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM) and their value in individualized prediction. A continuous retrospective analysis was conducted on 241 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) treated in our hospital from January 2017 to December 2021. The type and angle of the pancreaticobiliary junction were measured on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) images, and baseline lipid metabolism indicators were collected. We evaluated the risk factors of PPDM using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, established quantitative prediction models for PPDM, and evaluated the predictive value of lipid metabolism and features of the pancreaticobiliary junction. Overall, 85 of 241 eligible patients (35.27%) ultimately developed PPDM. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed B-P type in pancreaticobiliary junction (p = 0.017), the angle of junction (p = 0.041), non-high-density lipoprotein (p = 0.029), alcohol index (p < 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.042), inflammatory frequency (p = 0.016), fasting blood glucose (p = 0.002), concomitant hypertension (p < 0.001) were important predictive factors for the occurrence of PPDM. The model that integrated imaging features of the pancreaticobiliary junction has a higher predictive performance than models without imaging features, with an AUC of 0.882 (95% CI, 0.836-0.930). The AUC of the combined model was 0.886 (95% CI, 0.841-0.932), and there was no statistical difference in AUC between the combined model and the pancreaticobiliary junction model (p = 0.340). The lipid metabolism and morphological characteristics of the pancreaticobiliary junction are additional risk factors for PPDM, and the quantitative prediction model shows moderate predictive performance. The type and angle of the pancreaticobiliary junction based on MRCP are independent predictors of PPDM, which can quantitatively predict risk in the early stage. PPDM has an increasing incidence and poor prognosis, which requires early monitoring. Larger angles and B-P type in the pancreaticobiliary junction are risk factors for PPDM. Quantitative prediction of PPDM risk allows for early personalized prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Metformin efficiently lowers blood glucose levels but leads to gastrointestinal side effects. However, whether dietary interventions can improve metformin tolerability and glucose-lowering efficacy remains unknown. Here we investigate the effects of pretreatment with a diet rich in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) in combination with metformin on postprandial glycaemia and gut microbiota in people with prediabetes. In a double-blind, randomised, crossover trial, 26 individuals with prediabetes received an isocaloric diet with moderate or low FODMAPs for 10 d, concomitantly with metformin for 5 d, separated by a washout period of 2 weeks. The primary endpoint is the difference in postprandial glycaemia assessed by total postprandial incremental area under the curve through continuous glucose monitoring. Secondary endpoints are differences in glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels after an oral glucose tolerance test, gut microbiota, gastrointestinal symptoms and body weight. We show that moderate FODMAPs with metformin, as compared with low FODMAPs with metformin, result in lower postprandial glycaemia, higher GLP-1 secretion and higher Butyricimonas virosa abundance. We also show that a higher baseline abundance of Dorea formicigenerans predicts gastrointestinal intolerance to metformin.

Current diagnostic and monitoring methods based on episodic assays like glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) fail to capture its full complexity. Here, in a prospective cohort of 1,137 participants in the United States, we analyzed multimodal data from 347 deeply phenotyped individuals (174 normoglycemic, 79 prediabetic and 94 T2D). We found significant differences in the distribution of glucose spike metrics among different diabetes states, with longer expected time for spike resolution and higher values of nocturnal hypoglycemia in T2D. We identified significant correlations between mean glucose level and gut microbiome diversity, and between expected time for spike resolution and resting heart rate. Our multimodal glycemic risk profiles, validated in 1,955 normoglycemic and 114 prediabetic individuals from an independent cohort, improved risk stratification by highlighting substantial variability among individuals with the same value of HbA1c. Such a multimodal approach provides a detailed phenotype that can potentially improve T2D prevention, diagnosis and treatment, and is more informative than HbA1c.",

        "abstract": "As the sixth complication of diabetes, periodontitis interacts with diabetes to form a vicious circle. Periodontal health interventions can improve periodontal health and the quality of life in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to explore the effect of periodontal health interventions based on the Pender Health Promotion Model on periodontal outcome index and quality of life in this patient population. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 108 patients with T2DM from the endocrine and metabolism department of a tertiary hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group or a control group. The control group received routine diabetes health education and periodontal health-related knowledge education, they were general diabetes management and standard dental hygiene instructions. While the experimental group underwent a periodontal health intervention program in addition to the routine health interventions, it focuses on a combination of individualized and targeted comprehensive assessments, professional training, patient education, and behavioral interventions. Relevant outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of intervention. The main outcomes were oral hygiene-related measures, including dental plaque, debris and calculus conditions, the secondary outcomes included subjective assessment of oral health and self-assessment of knowledge, attitude and behavior. Demographic questionnaires, Plaque Index (PLI), Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI), Periodontal Health Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior Questionnaire, as well as the Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified (OHI-S) (including Debris Index-Simplified (DI-S) and the Calculus Index-Simplified (CI-S)) were used to collect data. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, and SPSS software version 27. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Following the intervention, significant differences were identified between the groups in PLI, OHI-S, and Periodontal Health Knowledge, Attitude, and Behavior (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in GOHAI scores between the groups (P > 0.05). Based on the results of this study, it can effectively prevent the occurrence or progression of periodontitis, as well as enhance periodontal health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors while positively impacting the oral health index and quality of life of older patients with T2DM. This approach holds significant value in medical practice and provides strong support for the widespread promotion of periodontal health maintenance strategies.",

However, there is insufficient information on the barriers and facilitators of PA and SB in Ethiopia, particularly at multiple socioecological levels, to inform behavior change interventions that promote active living among office-based working adults. This qualitative formative study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to increasing PA and reducing SB in Ethiopian office employees using the social-ecological model (SEM) as a conceptual framework. A total of twenty-six office workers (19 physically inactive/sedentary, 7 physically active) and seven key informants participated in in-depth interviews conducted between April and June 2023 in Hawassa, southern Ethiopia. The interviews were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, translated into English, and iteratively coded. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, and the barriers and facilitators generated were mapped onto the SEM categories. The findings were organized into thirteen themes that belong to the five levels of the SEM. Six themes were categorized to the intrapersonal level (sociodemographic and economic status; knowledge, experience and misperceptions; attitudes, beliefs and values; motivational challenges; sitting habit; and physical competence/skill); one theme belonged to the interpersonal level (social support); two themes were classified to the organizational level (work-related factors; organizational support); three themes were categorized to the environmental/community level (physical environment; social norm associated with walking; and PA promotional initiatives); and one theme belonged to the policy level (workplace health promotion policies). A complex interplay of multiple factors contributes to office workers' PA and SB engagement. Interventions should consider multi-component behavior change strategies that target barriers and facilitators at multiple levels, including individually tailored approaches, in order to effectively influence these physical behaviors.",

The sample included 165 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who attended the endocrinology outpatient clinic of a public hospital in Istanbul, Türkiye, between November 2023 and May 2024. Data were collected using the Patient Information Form, the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treatment Patient Compliance Scale, and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale. The participants had a mean age of 56.30 ± 11.82 years and a mean treatment duration of 9.33 ± 7.07 years; 58.2% were female. The mean treatment compliance score was 86.68 ± 5.69.

Systematic reviews have also shown that DPP-4i are associated with reduced dementia risk via unknown mechanisms. To examine vildagliptin (DPP-4i) effects on the intestinal microbiota in T2D patients, plasma metabolomics were conducted and inflammatory profiles collected to investigate correlations with potential neuroprotective effects. We examined 29 patients with T2D (not well controlled with metformin) before, and at 30 and 60 days after vildagliptin was introduced, and investigated intestinal microbiota, plasma metabolomic, and inflammatory profiles. In patients after 2 months, vildagliptin induced mild microbiota changes, represented by significant increases in Bariatricus and Butyricimonas genera and the Marinifilaceae family (short-chain fatty acids producers), reduced insulin, HOMA-IR, MCP1, and interferon (IFN)-γ levels, and elevated interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 levels, all of which represented an anti-inflammatory profile. Metabolomics results showed that leucine, 2-oxoisocaproate (branched-chain amino acid metabolite), and inosine were significantly reduced after vildagliptin was introduced. Additionally, choline, dimethylamine, and betaine levels were significantly higher, which may contribute to explain DPP-4i protective effects against dementia, as these metabolites are neuroprotective. In our T2D patient cohort (not well controlled with metformin), vildagliptin, in addition to improved glucose control and improved insulin resistance, modulated the intestinal microbiota, anti-inflammatory cytokine profiles, and metabolomics, and when combined, may contribute to explain DPP-4i's neuroprotective effects.",

The study involved 83 young people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (aged 6-18 years; 45% girls, mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> 57.54 ± 9.22 mmol/mol (7.4 ± 0.8%); median interstitial glucose 9.37 mmol/l [IQR 8.68-10.31]) from the Diactive-1 cohort study, followed up for 2 years. A triaxial accelerometer was used to objectively measure 24 h movement behaviours for 9 days. HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were obtained from medical records, and interstitial glucose data were collected through continuous glucose monitoring. Linear mixed models were used to quantify associations between movement behaviours, interstitial glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub>, maintaining the relative nature of the data based on the 24 h day. A higher daily amount of sedentary behaviour, at the expense of sleep time, light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, was positively associated with HbA<sub>1c</sub> (unstandardised beta coefficient [B]=14.077 [95% CI 4.244, 23.956]; standardised beta coefficient [β]=0.368) and interstitial glucose (B=1.988; 95% CI 0.153, 3.880; β=0.261), while more sleep time, at the expense of sedentary behaviour, light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, was associated with a significant reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (B=-12.712; 95% CI -25.204, -0.520; β=-0.197). Furthermore, reductions in both interstitial glucose (B=-1.580; 95% CI -2.800, -0.388; β=-0.283) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> (B=-9.361; 95% CI -15.856, -2.881; β=-0.330) were observed with increased daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at the expense of sedentary behaviour. Overall, the standardised beta coefficients indicated small to moderate effect sizes. Our findings indicate that lower sedentary behaviour and more optimal sleep and physical activity patterns are associated with greater metabolic stability in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. These findings support the need for further research on balancing these behaviours for better diabetes management, and encourage adoption of a 24 h movement approach in clinical care.",

Disruption of ER-organelle communication contributes to the development and progression of various kidney diseases, including diabetic kidney disease, acute kidney injury and polycystic kidney disease. Accordingly, ER-organelle communication has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Pharmacological agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors, AMPK activators, mTOR inhibitors and RAAS blockers have been shown to restore ER-mitochondria communication and alleviate kidney injury in experimental models. Advancing our understanding of ER-organelle crosstalk may offer new mechanistic insights and contribute to the optimization of current treatment strategies for kidney disease.",

        "abstract": "The human gut microbiota has the potential to synthesize proteins that may influence host metabolism. Here we report two polypeptides, RUMTOR-derived peptide (RORDEP) 1 and RORDEP2, circulating in human blood and synthesized by specific strains of gut commensal Ruminococcus torques that correlate inversely with adiposity in humans. Oral gavage with RORDEP-expressing strains improved glucose tolerance, increased bone density and reduced fat mass with an enhanced expression of genes and proteins involved in thermogenesis and lipolysis in lean mice on a high-fat diet and diet-induced obese mice. Recombinant RORDEP1 given to rats intraperitoneally decreased plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide but increased glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY and insulin. Intestinal delivery of recombinant RORDEP1 to rats potentiated insulin-mediated inhibition of hepatic glucose production by downregulating genes and proteins controlling liver gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and lipogenesis but upregulating those involved in insulin signalling, glycogenesis and glycolysis. These preclinical findings warrant the exploration of RORDEPs for the prevention and treatment of human metabolic disorders.",

        "title": "Mechanisms of metabolic surgery effectiveness in obesity and type 2 diabetes: a puzzle with some known pieces.",
        "abstract": "Metabolic surgery is currently the most effective available treatment for obesity and diabetes. However, it cannot be practiced widely, as some potential candidate patients do not have access to this procedure, primarily because it is expensive, necessitates experience on the part of operators, and requires adequate hospital facilities. Furthermore, side effects, although rare, remain a problem. Consequently, an ideal approach would be to reproduce the mechanisms of action of metabolic surgery through a noninvasive pharmacological treatment. To accomplish this, it is necessary to determine the exact mechanisms involved. Despite numerous studies in this field, a definitive conclusion has not yet been reached. Some of the known effects of metabolic surgery on organisms are described herein. Upon in-depth examination, all can be traced back to a functional modification of the autonomic GI-brain axis, mediated by afferent vagal fibers, establishing a constant relationship with brain centers to control food intake. These mechanisms act through the postsynaptic receptors of certain neurotransmitters. A viable path for implementing a pharmacological therapy for obesity may therefore be to identify drugs that act on these receptors to achieve adequate therapeutic responses. Possible candidates include substances that modulate various subtypes of NMDA glutamate receptors or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. In conclusion, autonomic modifications which have so far been shown to be activated by metabolic surgery represent the pieces of a puzzle which, when put together, allow us to identify the functional modification of the GI-brain vagal axis as the primary cause of this treatment's positive effects. These findings suggest the plausibility of an alternative pharmacological mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Available therapies show inconsistent results on fibrosis, probably due to heterogeneity in disease trajectory or incomplete understanding of molecular determinants. Here we identified increased KCTD17 levels in patients with MASH, and in dietary rodent models of MASH-such as those fed a diet high in palmitate, sucrose and cholesterol coupled with fructose-containing drinking water or a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet-which showed an inverse correlation with the expression of serine protease inhibitor a3k (SERPINA3 in humans, Serpina3k in mice). KCTD17 depletion increased SERPINA3 levels and reduced liver fibrosis in mice fed a MASH-inducing diet by inhibiting Par2/TGFβ-mediated activation of hepatic stellate cells. Mechanistically, Kctd17 regulates Serpina3k expression by facilitating the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Zbtb7b, which in turn diminishes Serpina3k secretion. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of Kctd17 effectively reverses MASH-induced liver fibrosis. In summary, these findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting KCTD17 for the treatment of MASH-induced liver fibrosis.",

        "title": "A pilot study on the hemodynamic effects of negative pressure ventilation in patients after cardiac surgery focussing on right ventricular function.",
        "abstract": "Right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure are important complications in cardiac surgical patients and typically observed after complex surgical cases. Treatment options for optimizing the hemodynamic status in patients presenting with these complications are limited. Negative pressure ventilation has been shown to ameliorate the effects of conventional positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and to improve cardiac output in patients with Fontan circulation and patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. No data are available on the effects of negative pressure ventilation on systemic hemodynamics and right heart function after complex on-pump cardiac surgery. Hypothesis of the present study is that right ventricular function improves under condition of negative pressure ventilation after complex on-pump surgery. Thirty patients after complex cardiac surgery were examined using basic hemodynamic monitoring, transesophageal ultrasound, a 3rd generation pulmonary artery catheter, cerebral oximetry and arterial and venous blood gases. The first 15 patients were ventilated for 15 min using standard PPV followed by 15 min of extrathoracal continuous negative pressure ventilation (CNPV) combined with PPV, and 15 min of extrathoracal biphasic negative pressure ventilation (BCV, biphasic cuirass ventilation) combined with an as far as possible reduced PPV. In the second 15 patients, the sequence of negative pressure ventilation was changed and BCV was performed before CNPV. Finally, every patient was ventilated for 15 min with standard PPV again. A full dataset of hemodynamics and a respiratory dataset was collected during each observation period. CNPV und BCV reduced central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure by 2 mmHg. During BCV cardiac index increased by + 24% (+ 0.5 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI 0.2-0.8, p = 0.001) through an increase of stroke volume index by + 24% (p = 0.0003) without change of heart rate. This was accompanied by an increase of right ventricular ejection fraction (+ 18%, p = 0.008), pulmonary arterial pulsatility index (+ 30%, p = 0.0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (+ 15%, p = 0.01), and oxygen delivery DO<sub>2</sub> (+ 13%, p = 0.0006). Posthoc analysis in patients with reduced stroke volume index (< 27 ml/m<sup>2</sup> prior to the start of the study) revealed that mixed venous oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen saturation increased by 7% (p = 0.005/p = 0.006). No adverse effects were observed. While CNPV has only moderate hemodynamic effects by reducing cardiac filling pressure, BCV improves systemic and right ventricular hemodynamics as well as global oxygen balance in patients after complex cardiac surgery. During both negative pressure ventilation modes, no immediate adverse events could be observed. These findings justify investigations if these treatment modalities may impact clinical outcomes in patients with right ventricular dysfunction or failure.Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT06088966, registered October 3rd, 2023.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram model for predicting 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit.MethodsThe health care records of 613 patients with sepsis who were hospitalized at the Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University from 2022 to 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were randomly divided into training and testing sets in a 7:3 ratio. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was used to identify potential prognostic factors for sepsis, followed by multivariate logistic regression to construct a nomogram prediction model. The predictive performance of the developed model was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analysis, and calibration curves.ResultsThe predictive factors included the platelet distribution width to count ratio, mean platelet volume, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level, lactate level, respiratory tract infections, and diabetes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the nomogram model in the training set was 0.907, with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.846 and 0.831, respectively. The calibration curve demonstrated that the prediction results were consistent with the actual findings. Decision curve analysis revealed that the model showed robust performance in practical applications.ConclusionsPlatelet distribution width to count ratio, mean platelet volume, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide level, lactate level, respiratory tract infection, and diabetes are closely associated with sepsis. A nomogram model based on these six variables demonstrates remarkable predictive performance and may assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients and optimizing personalized therapy.",

        "abstract": "Burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continues to rise in low- and middle-income countries like Kenya. People with HIV (PWH) may be at greater risk for obesity and NCDs. National health policies recommend integrated approaches to manage these conditions, but have not been widely implemented. To inform implementation, we characterised PWH's knowledge, attitudes and practices related to NCDs, perceptions of body size and NCD risk, and experiences of weight-related stigma and discrimination. We conducted a cross-sectional, sequential explanatory, mixed-methods study among PWH attending the Comprehensive Care Centre of Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. We surveyed 101 patients and interviewed 24 based on body mass index, NCD status and sex. We conducted descriptive statistics and Student's t-tests with the survey data and employed a rapid qualitative analysis approach to the interview data. We triangulated quantitative and qualitative results using joint displays. Participants had high levels of awareness and concern about NCDs. Women reported greater worry about NCDs than men; this difference was significant for cancer and hypertension (p<0.05). Participants were aware that higher weight can increase NCD risk, though often did not think of themselves as at risk. Additionally, 50% of participants underestimated their actual body size, and most (74%) tried gaining or losing weight within the last year. Weight-related discrimination and stigma were low overall, though underweight individuals expressed these concerns most. Some participants expressed a desire for integrated HIV-NCD care. Our results provide context for future weight management and HIV-NCD service integration initiatives in Kenya. NCDs are a major health concern for PWH. Many participants did not think of themselves as at risk, perhaps because half underestimated their actual body size. Future work should focus on understanding motivations for weight management to improve efforts to address HIV and NCDs in clinics and health systems.",

A discussion guide with four open-ended questions was developed to facilitate the interviews. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using NVivo V.12 Plus software. Thematic analysis highlighted three core themes: (1) Objective of DCs; (2) Planning and implementation of DCs and (3) Challenges and future expectations. All participants reported that DCs were fun and improved understanding of self-management of T1DM. However, organisers indicated that they encountered some challenges, such as establishing the content of the activities, testing the effectiveness and safety issues. Our findings emphasise that ensuring the safety of DC activities while fostering collaboration with healthcare professionals and researchers is essential for the sustainable development of DCs.

Building on the success of the inaugural event in 2022, this gathering served as a pivotal platform for attendees to delve into the latest scientific and clinical developments in hyperphagia and early-onset obesity caused by rare melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway disease. The central objective of the meeting was to explore the complexities of MC4R pathway-related diseases and generate opportunities for collaborative dialogue among delegates for the advancement of this field. The event unfolded across three distinct sessions, with a dedicated focus on monogenic MC4R pathway disease, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and hypothalamic obesity, together with a discussion on the future of the field. Additionally, the agenda featured three insightful workshops designed to facilitate in-depth discussions. One workshop focused on the genetics of monogenic MC4R pathway diseases, another scrutinised the genetics of BBS and the final workshop examined patient management through the exploration of clinical cases. As we reflect on the wealth of information disseminated and the collaborative spirit that permeated the meeting, it becomes clear that IMPROVE 2023 was not merely an assembly of professionals; it was a forum where the future of research in rare MC4R pathway diseases and patient care took centre stage.

Clinical questions were formulated using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) framework, focusing on the effectiveness and safety of European Medicines Agency-approved obesity management medications (OMM), including orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted using Medline and Embase, including randomized controlled trials with a minimum duration of 48 weeks. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses will be conducted to compare treatment effectiveness and safety profiles across various patient subgroups. The guidelines will target adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m² and at least one weight-related comorbidity or a BMI ≥30 kg/m². The primary endpoint will be total body weight loss (TBWL%). Secondary outcomes will be changes in body composition (i.e., fat mass, fat-free mass), metabolic improvements (i.e., glucose levels, HbA1c, lipid profile), remission of obesity-related comorbidities (i.e., type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and knee osteoarthritis), and improvements in mental health and quality of life. Preliminary analyses suggest that this framework will provide structured, individualized treatment recommendations based on the latest evidence.

The pathophysiology of PCOS involves insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, leading to abnormal gonadotropin secretion, hyperandrogenism and anovulation. PCOS is seen more commonly in women with obesity, and obesity is more common in women with PCOS. Obesity plays a role in the development of PCOS and especially insulin resistance that is central to the development of PCOS, may contribute to weight gain and prevent effective weight loss. As mentioned in the latest international guidelines, ameliorating insulin resistance and enabling weight loss are important components in the management of PCOS. GLP-1 receptor analogs (GLP-1 RAs) are a group of agents that have been developed for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus to lower blood glucose, in addition to being indicated in the treatment of obesity. Thus GLP-1 RAs may have a role in the management of PCOS, both due to their effect on weight loss, and through pleiotropic effects like ameliorating insulin resistance, decreasing inflammation and modulation of adiposity. Considering these effects, the purpose of this review was to conduct a systematic search and a narrative synthesis on the effect of GLP-1 RAs regarding the metabolic and reproductive outcomes of PCOS, trying to provide the mechanistic link between the mechanism of action of GLP-RAs and the pathophysiology of PCOS.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore the relationships between glucose control, psychological well-being, and diabetes-related distress in a population of adolescents with T1D. We conducted a cross-sectional study on adolescents with T1D attending a Pediatric Diabetes Unit. Demographic, clinical, and glycemic data were collected, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics. Psychological well-being was assessed using the PERMA-Profiler, while diabetes-related distress was measured using the Problem Areas in Diabetes-Teen Version (PAID-T) questionnaire. Among 133 enrolled adolescents, those with HbA1c ≤ 7 % exhibited significantly higher well-being scores (p = 0.007) and lower distress scores (p = 0.035). Higher time in range was positively associated with well-being (p = 0.002), while glycemic variability negatively impacted psychological outcomes (p = 0.023). Female sex (p = 0.021), longer disease duration (p = 0.022), and the absence of insulin pump therapy (p = 0.032) were significantly associated to higher diabetes-related distress. Glycemic control is closely related to psychological well-being of adolescents living with T1D. The adoption of diabetes technologies may play a crucial role in reducing diabetes-related distress. Future longitudinal studies should investigate the impact of psychological interventions on CGM outcomes and overall quality of life in adolescents with T1D.",

Subsequently, a detailed analysis of the nanoparticles was conducted using a series of characterization tools, as well as in vivo and in vitro experiments. The research results show that the diameter of the nanoparticles is about 116 nm, which is in line with the theory of oral drugs. The loading efficiency of nanoparticles reached 88.25 %, and the release of Naringin in simulated intestinal fluid environment was as high as 94.75 %, indicating that nanoparticles have certain intestinal permeability and significantly improve the oral bioavailability of Naringin. This eco-friendly synthesis process yields food-grade nanoparticles that have the potential to be used as food additives or pharmaceuticals, and may even pave the way for treatments targeting type 2 diabetes and hepatic steatosis.",

        "abstract": "Esophageal perforation is a rare condition with high mortality. Spontaneous perforations may be associated with worse outcomes because of the degree of mediastinal contamination when compared with \"clean\" iatrogenic perforations, with different timings for intervention. This study aims to assess the differences in treatment and outcomes between these 2 groups. Data were collected retrospectively from a tertiary center from 2009 to 2021 using the electronic patient record (n = 73, 42 spontaneous, 31 iatrogenic). Complications were quantified using the Comprehensive Complication Index. Univariate analysis was used to determine statistical significance. Spontaneous perforations had a significantly greater 30-day mortality compared with iatrogenic perforations (21.4% vs 3.2% P = .025), although not at 90 days and 1 year (21.4% vs 16.1% P = .570 and 21.4% vs 19.4% P = .828). Iatrogenic perforations were more commonly managed nonoperatively (73.8% iatrogenic vs 22.6% spontaneous perforations P < .001). All of the iatrogenic deaths that occurred between 30 days to 1 year had been managed nonoperatively. Median length of intensive care stay was greater in spontaneous perforations (15 days vs 6 days P = .047), with no significant difference in median overall length of stay (48 days spontaneous perforations vs 38 days iatrogenic P = .885). Median Comprehensive Complication Index score was greater in those with spontaneous perforations (53.9 vs 29.6 P = .002) CONCLUSION: Although Comprehensive Complication Index and 30-day mortality were greater in spontaneous perforations, there was no difference in 90-day and 1-year mortality, suggesting that long-term survival is not dictated by etiology of the perforation. Most iatrogenic perforations were managed nonoperatively, which raises the question whether iatrogenic perforation should be managed more aggressively.",

The study involved 57 PwT1D from five diabetology centers. To be included in the study, each participant had to be at least 26 years old, have a minimum of two years of diabetes history. Participants completed a set of validated questionnaires including the FSH-II, DDS, PSS10, DTSQs, WHO-5, PAID, DBQ, and a sociodemographic survey. They also downloaded pump/glucometer data and underwent HbA1c measurement at the beginning and again at the end of the study. PwT1D reported higher treatment satisfaction measured by DTSQs. Well-being assessment according to WHO-5 was also higher, and the level of diabetes burnout measured by DBQ, fear of hypoglycemia assessed by HFS-II significantly decreased. Diabetic distress measured by means of total score of DDS lowered. Participants scored also lower on PAID upon follow up. The HbA1c level after three months of using the CGM system was significantly lower.

Consecutive patients admitted to a German heart centre between 2006 and 2022 for STEMI were categorized into five BMI groups according to the World Health Organization classification. Among the 11 629 STEMI patients, 269 (2.3%) had severe obesity. These patients were more likely to be female, have diabetes, and were on average 8.6 years younger than normal-weight patients (57.8 ± 12 vs. 66.4 ± 14 years, P < 0.01). The prevalence of severe obesity increased from 1.9 to 2.6% (2006-13 vs. 2013-22, P = 0.014), with the increase being a greater in females than in males (2.5-3.7%, P = 0.052). In younger patients (<55 years), prevalence rates increased by 128% in females (4.9-11.3%, P < 0.01) and 71% in men (2.2-3.7%, P < 0.01).

During weeks 0-4, 22-26, and 48-52, time in range (TIR; 3.9-10.0 mmol/L), time above range (TAR; >10.0 mmol/L), and time below range (TBR; <3.9 and <3.0 mmol/L) were assessed by treatment day after icodec injection or degludec titration. Rates of CGM-based clinically significant hypoglycemic episodes (<3.0 mmol/L for ≥15 consecutive min) and durations of CGM-based hypoglycemic episodes (<3.9 mmol/L) and CGM-based periods <3.0 mmol/L were reported (baseline to weeks 26 and 57). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Although rates of overall CGM-based clinically significant hypoglycemia were statistically significantly higher with icodec than degludec from baseline to week 26 and week 57, estimated rate ratios (icodec/degludec) for CGM-based clinically significant hypoglycemic episodes were lower than those estimated from self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) data from baseline to week 26 (1.38 vs. 1.88) and to week 57 (1.28 vs. 1.79). Observed percentage of TIR was highest on days 2-4 after icodec injection with a concomitant reduction in TAR and an increase in TBR.

However, these clinical trials typically have limitations and may not sufficiently assess the performance of pemafibrate in the real-world setting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of pemafibrate in patients with hyperlipidemia in Japan. This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, observational post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study. Patients with hyperlipidemia were observed for 24 months from the start of pemafibrate treatment. Safety evaluations included the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), subgroup analysis of ADRs, and changes in laboratory test values. Efficacy was determined by the changes in lipid test values from baseline. A total of 3672 cases were registered from 612 facilities in Japan. In the safety analysis, 68.1% of patients were male, mean age was 60.8 years, and 37.8% were switched to pemafibrate from other dyslipidemia agents. In total, 147 patients (4.07%) experienced ADRs; serious ADRs were reported in 8 patients (0.22%). The most common ADRs included abnormalities in laboratory tests (n = 60; 1.66%), hepatobiliary disorders (n = 24, 0.66%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (n = 14, 0.39%), and metabolic and nutritional disorders (n = 14, 0.39%). No incidents of rhabdomyolysis occurred, and 37 (1.02%) patients experienced rhabdomyolysis-related ADRs. Renal-related ADRs occurred in 13 patients (0.36%). When subdivided by patient background, the incidence of ADRs was significantly higher in patients aged ≥ 75 years than < 75 years (P = 0.028). There were no significant differences in other subgroups. The mean percent change in mixed fasting and non-fasting triglyceride levels was - 35.2% (P < 0.001).

BMD gains over 12 months were similar to those in patients (n = 99) completing the full 12-month course. Romosozumab is typically administered for a duration of 12 months before transitioning to antiresorptive therapies. This study analysed the bone mineral density (BMD) changes of patients who were prematurely switched to an antiresorptive regimen. This multicentre, retrospective case series investigated the BMD response to romosozumab administered for 3 to 10 months, followed by subsequent antiresorptive therapy, across four bone centres in Switzerland. BMD measurements at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck were conducted at the initiation of romosozumab and again 12 months later. The study compared the BMD changes in patients who received short-term romosozumab with those in a cohort of patients who completed the full 12-month course. Twenty-six patients (25 postmenopausal women and one man, median age 73 years [interquartile range: 65, 81]) were enrolled from February 2022 to December 2024. They received a median of six romosozumab injections (range: 3 to 10) and were prematurely switched to antiresorptives (14 to denosumab, 11 to zoledronate and one to alendronate) due to possible side effects or adverse events. Over 12 months, BMD increased by 13.5% [8.6, 16.6] at the lumbar spine, 2.9% [0.3, 7.3] at the total hip and 3.2% [0.4, 7.8] at the femoral neck, without significant differences compared with the cohort of 99 patients who received 12 months of romosozumab therapy. In both the short- and full-duration romosozumab treatment groups, significantly lower BMD responses were observed in patients who were pretreated with antiresorptives compared with those who were treatment naïve. In patients who underwent an early switch from romosozumab to antiresorptive therapy, BMD responses during the first year were similar to those in patients who completed the full 12-month romosozumab treatment.

        "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a common complication in hepatic surgery, which seriously affects the surgical prognosis. Ferroptosis is a novel programmed cell death mode involved in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI). Recent studies have shown that nuclear receptor FXR can alleviate HIRI, but the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we explored the potential regulatory mechanism of FXR in HIRI by using wild-type mice, FXR knockout mice, and AML12 cells. Results show that FXR was negatively correlated with HIRI-induced ferroptosis, and deletion of FXR promotes ferroptosis induced by HIRI. Activation of FXR was able to promote GPX4 expression and inhibit ferroptosis. However, the co-treatment of GPX4 inhibitor and FXR ligand weakened the inhibitory effect of FXR on promoting GPX4 expression and ferroptosis. Luciferase and EMSA results suggest that FXR regulates GPX4 transcriptional expression by binding to DR5 upstream of the GPX4 initiation codon. Our results suggest that FXR can inhibit HIRI-induced ferroptosis by targeting the transcriptional expression of GPX4. It contributes to a better understanding of the role of FXR in HIRI. In addition, our findings provide potential therapeutic options for the intervention of ischemia-reperfusion injury in surgery.",

        "title": "Role of the microbiome in diabetic wound healing: implications for new therapeutic approaches.",
        "abstract": "Diabetic wounds present a persistent clinical challenge due to delayed healing and an increased risk of infection and complications. The rising global prevalence of diabetes and the associated burden of chronic, non-healing wounds highlight the urgent need for innovative and effective therapeutic strategies. Recent research has underscored the critical yet often overlooked role of the skin microbiome in modulating wound healing outcomes. This review explores the complex interactions between the skin microbiome and diabetic wound healing, aiming to inform the development of microbiome-based interventions. The review begins by outlining the composition and physiological functions of the skin microbiome, emphasizing its roles in maintaining cutaneous homeostasis, immune regulation, and barrier integrity. It then examines how diabetes-induced hyperglycemia disrupts microbial balance, leading to dysbiosis, impaired immune responses, and increased colonization by opportunistic pathogens. These alterations contribute to the formation of persistent biofilms, chronic inflammation, impaired angiogenesis, and ultimately, delayed wound repair. Mechanisms by which the microbiome exacerbates wound pathology are discussed, alongside emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the wound microbiota. These include probiotics, prebiotics, bacteriophage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and microbiome-responsive dressings. Innovative approaches such as photoimmuno-antimicrobial therapies and advanced drug delivery systems are also considered for their potential to enhance treatment efficacy. Despite these promising developments, significant challenges remain in deciphering the full complexity of microbiome-host interactions and translating this knowledge into clinical practice. The review emphasizes the future potential of personalized, microbiome-based therapies tailored to individual microbial profiles and advocates for a precision medicine approach to diabetic wound care.

        "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a key contributor to the progression of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications. Recently, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) has shown promise in mitigating oxidative stress and improving glucose metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SAM supplementation on biochemical parameters, oxidative stress markers, and histopathological alterations in the kidneys and liver of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Eighteen male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6 per group): non-diabetic control, diabetic control, and diabetic rats treated with SAM (10 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally) for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, renal and hepatic biochemical markers (urea, creatinine, ALT, AST), and oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, total antioxidant capacity) were measured. Histopathological changes in kidney and liver tissues were also assessed. Diabetic rats treated with SAM exhibited minor, non-significant changes in fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, ALT, and AST levels. In contrast, treatment with SAM in diabetic rats significantly reduced malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels in both kidney and liver tissues compared to the diabetic control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, histopathological analysis revealed improved tissue architecture and reduced pathological changes in the diabetic group treated with SAM. Our findings demonstrated that SAM supplementation exerts significant antioxidant and histopathological protective effects against diabetes-induced damage in kidney and liver tissues.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a prevalent and serious complication of diabetes, characterized by high incidence and significant morbidity. Despite growing evidence that the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle plays a crucial role in DN progression, the diagnostic potential of TCA-related genes has yet to be fully explored. This study began by analyzing the GSE131882 dataset to reveal the expression patterns of TCA-related genes in various renal cell types and to identify genes that differ in expression between high and low subgroups. The GSE30122 dataset was then examined to identify genes with differential expression in DN. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were applied to pinpoint TCA-related gene modules. Following this, multiple machine learning techniques were employed to analyze the TCA gene set that showed differential expression at both cellular and sample levels, allowing us to identify the hub genes. A diagnostic model was constructed, with its effectiveness validated through ROC analysis. The immune landscape of DN was assessed using ssGSEA. GeneMANIA and NetworkAnalyst were also utilized to predict genes with similar functions, as well as miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) that may regulate these diagnostic genes. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data confirmed the expression patterns of these genes. Two TCA-related genes, HPGD and G6PC, were identified as potential diagnostic markers for DN. ROC analysis demonstrated that these genes and their predictive model exhibited strong diagnostic performance in both training and validation cohorts. Immune landscape analysis revealed a more active immune microenvironment in DN patients compared to controls. Additionally, 59 miRNAs and 15 TFs were predicted to regulate the expression of HPGD and G6PC, along with 20 functionally related genes. scRNA-seq data highlighted that HPGD and G6PC are predominantly expressed in glomerular and proximal tubular cells. Two reliable TCA-related biomarkers were pinpointed, potentially advancing early diagnosis and management of DN.",

        "abstract": "The present investigation aims to establish the mechanism of curcumin in targeting diabetes and obesity, specifically through its effects on Adipoq, Il-6, and Tnf-α, using network pharmacology-based in silico analysis, followed by in silico validation. Target genes associated with diabetes and obesity were identified using GeneCards and SwissTargetPrediction, revealing that curcumin modulates Adipoq, Il-6, and Tnf-α within the adipocytokine signaling pathway, suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism. In this study, the effects of curcumin on diabetic rats were evaluated by assessing blood sugar levels (BSL), HbA1c, insulin levels, and adipocytokine expression. Diabetes was induced, and rats were treated with curcumin or pioglitazone for 4 weeks, followed by biochemical analysis. The in silico experimental findings demonstrate that curcumin is more effective than pioglitazone in managing obesity-induced diabetes by modulating the mRNA expression of adipocytokines. These results align with the predictions from in silico analysis, supporting the hypothesis that curcumin targets Adipoq, Il-6, and Tnf-α within the adipocytokine signaling pathway. This study introduces a targeted approach for diabetes management by modulating adipocytokines with curcumin. The integration of in silico analysis with in silico validation provides a comprehensive framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies against obesity-induced diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Bone infections in diabetic patients often result in devastating outcomes, highlighting the need for effective treatment strategies. Our study aims to explore how <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> adapts to the diabetic microenvironment. This study found increased bacterial resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a higher expression of the crtOPQMN operon among strains isolated from diabetic patients. Mechanistically, <i>S. aureus</i> was found to increase its staphyloxanthin (STX) level through genomic changes in the locus of rsbU, rsbW, and sigB. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that genomic changes were due to bacterial adaptation to the ROS pressure. Moreover, by adopting simvastatin, a representative STX synthesis inhibitor, we found that statins can inhibit the frequency of <i>S. aureus</i> genomic changes under the pressure of ROS. A mouse infection model demonstrated that simvastatin can reduce bacterial loads, alleviate bone infection outcomes, and increase the cure rate of vancomycin in treating bone infections. These findings suggest that by inhibiting bacterial adaptation toward ROS pressure, simvastatins could be a promising adjunctive therapy for bone infection treatment, especially among diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "The BRAFV600E mutation drives papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) progression and therapy resistance, yet its downstream effectors remain incompletely characterized. Here, we identify secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) as a novel dedifferentiation biomarker in BRAFV600E-mutant PTC through integrated multi-omics analyses and functional validation. SLPI expression was significantly elevated in BRAFV600E-mutant tumors and correlated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival. Its overexpression was caused, mechanistically, by AP-1 transactivation and SLPI promoter hypomethylation. SLPI knockdown in PTC cells suppressed proliferation, increased anoikis sensitivity, and reduced FAK/AKT phosphorylation. Enrichment analysis linked high SLPI expression to PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Drug sensitivity prediction revealed that SLPI-high tumors were vulnerable to MAPK/AKT inhibitors. Notably, SLPI positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a potential immunosuppressive role. Our findings establish SLPI as a BRAFV600E-AP-1-FAK/AKT axis effector and propose its targeting as a strategy for PTC therapy.",

Blood glucose, cytokines, and nitric oxide levels were measured, along with cardiac function via echocardiography and direct blood pressure recordings. <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> reduced blood glucose and increased cardiac IL-10 in diabetic mice, restoring nitric oxide levels. These effects were associated to reduced collagen deposition, preventing vascular damage and ventricular fibrosis, and were accompanied by improved systolic/diastolic function and autonomic control. <i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i> improved cardiac structure, function, and autonomic control in diabetic mice, supporting its potential as adjunct therapy for diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

        "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Exercise benefits individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) but is often hindered by the risk of hypoglycemia. While guidelines provide strategies to mitigate this risk, adherence to recommendations on exercise remains low. Bolus calculators, such as Hedia Diabetes Assistant (HDA), offer a potential way to address this challenge by integrating exercise-related insulin adjustments into daily routines. This trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of HDA in improving glycemic control during exercise. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This randomized, controlled crossover pilot study included 20 adults diagnosed with T1D for >1 year using multiple daily insulin injections and HbA1c between 42 and 72 mmol/mol (6.0-8.6%). Participants were randomized to first use either HDA (arm A) or their habitual diabetes management (arm B) before and after performing a 45-min moderate-intensity session on an exercise bike and subsequently crossover. The primary outcome was change in time in range (TIR) over the two 24 h periods. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The mean differences (95% confidence interval [CI]) in TIR and time above range (>10.0 mmol/L) were -2.3% (-13.1%, 8.5%) and 3.93% (-5.7%, 13.5%), respectively, and the median difference in time below range (<3.9 mmol/L) was -0.87% (-2.8%, 0.5%). The incidence rate ratio (95% CI) for total hypoglycemic episodes using HDA was -0.56 (-1.41, 0.29). Safety outcomes revealed fewer adverse events when using HDA. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The HDA insulin bolus calculator with an integrated exercise feature appears safe to use when compared with habitual insulin management in people with T1D during moderate-intensity exercise.",
