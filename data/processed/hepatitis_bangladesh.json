        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes significant morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as pregnant women. HEV239 (Hecolin<sup>®</sup>), a recombinant vaccine containing the immunodominant protruding (E2) domain of the HEV capsid protein, has demonstrated effectiveness, yet detailed human cellular immune responses remain understudied. This study characterized humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with HEV239 or natural HEV infection in healthy Bangladeshi women aged 16-39 years. Using dual IFNγ and IL-4 ELISpot assays, we found robust, predominantly Th1-mediated cellular responses at 30 days after the third vaccine dose, comparable to responses during acute infection. Longitudinal antibody assessments confirmed sustained antibody production, primarily against the E2 domain of genotypes 1 and 3, persisting up to two years post-vaccination. Despite limitations related to sample size and assay sensitivity, our findings underscore the immunogenic potential of HEV239 and support a broader use in HEV-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "abstract": "In 2023, the VAS international working group on Buerger's Disease (BD) recommended two diagnostic criteria based on a prior Delphi study: \"definitive\" and \"suspected\". The \"definitive\" criteria are history of smoking, typical angiography, and typical histopathological features. All three features are mandatory to confirm a \"definitive\" diagnosis of BD. The conundrum is-what features should be considered typical of BD angiography? According to this review, segmental occlusion of infrapopliteal arteries, corkscrew collaterals that appear to continue the occluded arterial segment (Martorell's sign) or bypass the segmental occlusion, absence of atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm could differentiate BD from ASO. Hence, for \"typical\" BD angiography, these manifestations should certainly be considered. However, data for differentiating angiography patterns of BD from the small- and medium-sized vasculitis including Behcet's disease, scleroderma, hepatitis associated vasculitis, and anti-phospholipid syndrome are limited. Further studies for investigating the angiography pattern in BD patients in early and late presentation of BD, particularly in the patients with long-term follow up, are highly recommended.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this review is to identify which environmental toxicants are linked to infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by synthesizing available evidence. It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants. Findings advocate for reducing environmental pollution exposure in LMICs to mitigate infectious disease risk.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

        "abstract": "In February-March 2024, an outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice with multiple fatalities was reported in Goalpara District, Assam, India. This study aimed to identify the etiological agents responsible for the outbreak to guide public health interventions. Clinical samples from 30 individuals were collected and analyzed using serological and molecular techniques. Serological testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), and Leptospira was performed using IgM ELISA kits. Leptospira DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for further analysis. The results revealed HAV IgM antibodies in 23.33 % of cases (7/30), while 40 % (12/30) tested positive for Leptospira-specific IgM by ELISA. Additionally, PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Leptospira DNA in 53.33 % of the urine samples (8/15). Notably, 16.67 % (5/30) of cases exhibited coinfection with both HAV and Leptospira spp., challenging the clinical outcome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-positive samples identified Leptospira wolffii (L. wolffii) as the causative agent, marking the first report of L. wolffii in human clinical samples from Northeastern India. Recently, L. wolffii, a member of the P2 subclade of Leptospira, has garnered attention due to its pathogenic potential. The findings along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of L. wolffii and its likely introduction into the region, via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent. This study highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and research to monitor emerging Leptospira strains, particularly L. wolffii, in both human and animal populations, to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health implications.",

This retrospective observational study was conducted in a single tertiary care center from July 2023 to June 2024. The study was done among inpatients of the Department of Hepatology. About 30 Cases were recorded with confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma over this period. Among 30 patients, 53.33% of patients were above 60 years of age and 76.66% were HBsAg positive. 90.0% of patients were symptomatic among which abdominal pain was the most common. Features of cirrhosis with hepatomegaly were the main physical findings. Normal alpha-fetoprotein levels were in 13.33% of patients; 96.66% of patients were in advanced age where curative treatment was not feasible. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a significant concern. It is crucial to identify high-risk patients, which should lead to screening using both serum alpha-fetoprotein level and ultrasonography of the liver.

The burden is especially high in low-income regions, where early diagnosis and treatment are critical for mitigating its impact. This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting patient outcomes in HBV infection. The Chi-squared test was used for feature selection to find the most important factors, which were later applied to train and evaluate various ML models. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the data. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used to improve the models' interpretability. Among individual models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) each achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. By implementing a Voting Classifier that combined SVM and LR, the overall accuracy was improved to 95%. The results showed that higher levels of some risk factors, especially in older patients, greatly raise the risk of death.

This study investigated the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women and cord blood Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity of their newborns in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, and South Africa. Randomly selected paired maternal and cord blood samples (n = 101 each site) taken at delivery were tested for HBsAg and Hepatitis B extractable antigen (HBeAg) in the women using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Similarly, cord blood sample of newborn was assessed for HBsAg reactivity. HBV DNA was quantified using the Xpert® HBV viral load assay, followed by genotyping. The overall prevalence of maternal HBsAg positivity was 5.5 % (95 %CI: 0.4 %-7.1 %; n = 50/909). HBsAg positivity was higher in African countries (7.3 %; 95 %CI: 5.4 %-9.6 %; n = 44/606) compared to South Asian countries (2.0 %; 95 %CI: 0.8 %-4.3 %; n = 6/303; p = 0.002).

This study investigated the synergistic potential of two anthranilamide-based peptide mimics (RK610 and RK758) in combination, and one peptide mimic (RK610) in combination with the cationic peptides Mel4 and melimine, against murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus; MHV-1), influenza virus (H1N1), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Checkerboard assays demonstrated RK610+RK758 had synergy against MHV-1 and H1N1 (∑FICI values of 0.14 and 0.5, respectively), while RK610+Mel4 showed potent synergy against HSV-1 (∑FICI = 0.18). Co-treatment outperformed sequential application. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed structural damage to virions, while cytotoxicity assays indicated that all tested combinations were non-toxic in MDCK, A9, and Vero cells, except for melimine and RK610+melimine with A9 cells. Biophysical analyses using DOPC (100 %) and DOPC: POPS (70:30) lipids provided mechanistic ideas into peptide-mimic interactions with lipid envelopes. Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) in conjunction with electrical impedance spectroscopy revealed that both peptide mimics and their combinations reduced membrane conductance, regardless of lipid composition. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) revealed that RK610 and RK758 induced mass addition at the outer layer, significantly increasing with POPS. In DOPC, RK610 increased the surface pressure in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough while RK758 reduced it. The 610 + 758 and 610+Mel4 combinations raised maximum pressures. In DOPC + POPS, RK758 destabilized the monolayer (35 mN/m, no plateau), whereas combinations restored stability. These findings highlight peptide mimics as broad-spectrum antiviral agents that show synergy to target viral envelopes, paving the way for safer and low-resistance therapeutics.",

Limited data have shown unusually high HCV seroprevalence among Rohingya refugees residing in camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HCV seropositivity and active infection and identify risk factors to inform the HCV response. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 10 and June 14, 2023, in adult (≥18 years) residents of seven camps in Cox's Bazar. Households were selected by simple random geosampling and one participant per household was selected at random. Participants were screened for HCV antibodies with a rapid finger prick blood test and, if seropositive, venous samples were tested for HCV viral load. A structured questionnaire collected information about demographics, HCV knowledge, and exposure risks. Survey-adjusted prevalence estimates of HCV seropositivity and active infection were generated by applying sampling weights. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity were identified using univariable and multivariable current status analysis and those associated with active infection via logistic regression. The survey included 641 participants, of whom 425 (66%) were women and for whom the median age was 34 years (IQR 28-46). 191 individuals tested positive for HCV antibodies. 187 of these individuals were tested for active infection and 124 had a detectable HCV viral load. The survey-adjusted prevalence estimate of HCV seropositivity was 30·4% (95% CI 26·5-34·5), and that of active infection 19·8% (95% CI 16·5-23·4). Current status analysis identified higher odds of HCV seropositivity among individuals reporting medical injection(s) (adjusted odds ratio 1·8 [95% CI 1·2-2·8]) or surgery (5·9 [1·9-18·4]), and among women (2·1 [1·3-3·2]). 328 (51%) of 641 participants had never heard of hepatitis C. Five (4%) of 124 participants with HCV viraemia reported previous HCV treatment. There is a substantial burden of active HCV infection among adult Rohingya camp residents, highlighting the urgent need to scale up testing and treatment capacities. The survey had constraints in identifying risk factors and could not provide data on HCV incidence. Reassessing infection prevalence after mass interventions and prospective surveillance are recommended to monitor ongoing transmission. A well-concerted multi-stakeholder action plan is needed to prevent future large-scale burden of severe liver disease and halt ongoing transmission. Médecins Sans Frontières.",

A better understanding of how ROS contributes to viral pathogenesis is critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on ROS production and its effects across various viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, influenza A virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus infections, to improve future therapeutic and preventive strategies for these infections.",

While hepatic complications are well-documented, extra-hepatic manifestations such as secondary amyloidosis are less common and can lead to diverse and complex clinical outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic hepatitis B who progressed to liver cirrhosis and presented with chronic, unexplained, intractable diarrhea unresponsive to standard treatments. He also experienced significant unintentional weight loss and generalized weakness. Further investigations revealed amyloid deposition in the duodenum, confirming secondary amyloidosis affecting the gastrointestinal tract as the cause of malabsorption. Persistent diarrhea and malabsorption necessitated nutritional support and symptomatic management. This case highlights the rare association between chronic liver disease (CLD), secondary amyloidosis, and malabsorption syndrome, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial to managing these complex cases, improving outcomes, and preventing further complications.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis is a widespread inflammatory condition of the liver, presenting a formidable global health challenge. Accurate and timely detection of hepatitis is crucial for effective patient management, yet existing methods exhibit limitations that underscore the need for innovative approaches. Early-stage detection of hepatitis is now possible with the recent adoption of machine learning and deep learning approaches. With this in mind, the study investigates the use of traditional machine learning models, specifically classifiers such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and other models, to predict hepatitis infections. After extensive data preprocessing including outlier detection, dataset balancing, and feature engineering, we evaluated the performance of these models. We explored three modeling approaches: machine learning with default hyperparameters, hyperparameter-tuned models using GridSearchCV, and ensemble modeling techniques. The SVM model demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving 99.25% accuracy and a perfect AUC score of 1.00 with consistency in other metrics with 99.27% precision, and 99.24% for both recall and F1-measure. The MLP and Random Forest proved to be in pace with the superior performance of SVM exhibiting an accuracy of 99.00%. To ensure robustness, we employed a 5-fold cross-validation technique. For deeper insight into model interpretability and validation, we employed an explainability analysis of our best-performed models to identify the most effective feature for hepatitis detection. Our proposed model, particularly SVM, exhibits better prediction performance regarding different performance metrics compared to existing literature.",

Vaccination against Hepatitis B is an effective means of prevention. However, studies have reported variable vaccination rates among medical students from different regions of South Asia. Understanding vaccination rates and barriers can guide effective interventions to protect future doctors. Therefore, we aimed to find out the vaccination rate among medical students in South Asia. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and other sources) beginning from inception to July 15, 2024. Observational studies reporting vaccination rates among Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.) students in South Asia were included. Two reviewers independently screened and performed the quality assessment. Pooled vaccination rates were calculated and visualized using a random-effects model in R Studio (Version 2023.12.0). Subgroup analysis was performed based on country and year of publication of the studies. Fifty studies from the South Asian region, including 12,231 participants, were included in the quantitative analysis. The overall pooled Hepatitis B vaccination rate using the random-effects model was 56% (CI: 49-63%), with significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 98%; P = 0). Subgroup analysis based on country revealed a significant regional variation in vaccination rate (59% in Pakistan, 57% in India, 55% in Nepal, and 41% in Bangladesh; P < 0.01). Lack of awareness, perceived low risk or necessity, concerns about side effects, logistical challenges, and lack of motivation have been reported as barriers to vaccination. The overall vaccination rate was relatively low in South Asia, with significant regional variation. Based on the reported barriers, we recommend that relevant authorities focus on vaccination awareness, motivation, cost-effectiveness, logistics management, policy formulation, and monitoring.",

Understanding the burden of AHE in this region is crucial for targeted interventions. We used Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data to assess the burden of AHE across eight South Asian countries from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze temporal trends and Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify trends. The relationship between age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) and socio-demographic index (SDI) was assessed using smoothing spline model and Spearman rank correlation. Rates are expressed per 100,000 population. Bangladesh had highest age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) [33.27 (95 % Uncertainty Interval: 27.64 to 39.95)] and age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) [433.01 (359.61 to 519.76)], while India had highest ASDR [9.52 (4.33 to 18.42)]. Males had higher ASIR and ASPR than females in most South Asian countries, except Bhutan and India, and higher ASDR except in Nepal and Pakistan. Bhutan had the highest EAPC for both sexes in ASPR and ASIR, while India had the highest EAPC in ASDR, closely followed by Bhutan for both sexes. Age group 5-9 had the highest ASPR and ASIR whereas <1-year age group had the highest ASDR. There was an inverse relationship between ASDR and SDI (R = -0.49, p < 0.01). South Asia bears a high burden of AHE, with variations across countries. Improvements in Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services are needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 6.",

Recently, we reported that there are distinct virological and clinical profiles between chronic patients with subgenotype C2 with the rt269I polymorphism and those with the rt269L polymorphism, with the latter being more closely related to liver disease severity. This study explored the phylogenetic and geographic distributions, as well as the mutation frequencies, of precore (T1858C/G1896A) and basal core promoter (BCP) (A1762T/G1764A) mutations between these two types within the HBV subgenotype C1. Analysis of 408 HBV/C1 full-genome sequences from GenBank revealed clear phylogenetic separation between rt269L and rt269I in subgenotype C1. Geographically, rt269I strains within subgenotype C1 are predominant in Southwest Asia (e.g., Thailand and Bangladesh), whereas rt269L strains are more common in East Asia and Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam, China, and Hong Kong). Notably, compared with rt269L in subgenotype C2, rt269I presented higher frequencies of the C1858 and BCP mutations but lower frequencies of the G1896A mutation. These findings suggest significantly distinct phylogeographic and mutational characteristics of the rt269L and rt269I types of subgenotype C1, impacting clinical outcomes and evolutionary trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in many resource-poor countries. Despite an available vaccine, data on HEV-associated mortality are scarce, hindering informed decisions. This study aims to estimate the population-based rate of HEV-specific mortality in Bangladesh. During December 2014 to September 2017, we conducted surveillance in 6 tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Patients aged ≥14 years with acute jaundice were recruited, tested for IgM anti-HEV, and followed up postdischarge. A mortality survey in the hospital catchment areas identified deaths associated with acute jaundice, including maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths delivered by a mother with acute jaundice during pregnancy, as confirmed by 2 independent physicians reviewing verbal autopsy data. Out of 1925 patients with acute jaundice enrolled in the surveillance hospitals, 302 died, with 28 (9%) testing positive for IgM anti-HEV. In the hospital catchment areas, the team identified 587 jaundice-associated deaths, including 25 maternal deaths. Combining hospital-based surveillance and mortality survey data, the study estimated 986 (95% CI, 599-1338) HEV-associated deaths annually among individuals aged ≥14 years in Bangladesh, including 163 (95% CI, 57-395) maternal deaths. Additionally, 279 (95% CI, 101-664) stillbirths and 780 (95% CI, 365-1297) neonatal deaths were attributed to HEV infection annually. Prior Global Burden of Disease studies presented wildly varying modeling estimates of HEV-associated annual deaths, ranging from 50 000 in 2013 to 1932 in 2019. This study is the first to directly measure population-based estimates of mortality in Bangladesh, which can be used to determine the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis E vaccination and other interventions.",

        "abstract": "T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, <i>LAG-3</i>, <i>PDCD1</i>, <i>TIGIT</i>, <i>HAVCR2</i>, <i>CXCL13</i>, and <i>LAYN</i> was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients' survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.",

Age-standardised rates per 100,000 population for prevalence, annual incidence and YLDs were compared across regions and countries, as well as the socio-demographic index (SDI). Trends were expressed as percentage changes (PC) and estimates were reported with uncertainty intervals (UI). Globally, in 2021, the age-standardised rates per 100,000 population for the prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, MASLD and cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were 3583.6 (95%UI 3293.6-3887.7), 1717.8 (1385.5-2075.3), 15018.1 (13756.5-16361.4) and 20302.6 (18845.2-21791.9) respectively. From 2010 to 2021, the PC in age-standardised prevalence rates were-20.4% for hepatitis B, -5.1% for hepatitis C, +11.2% for MASLD and + 2.6% for cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases. Over the same period, the PC in age-standardized incidence rates were -24.7%, -6.8%, +3.2%, and +3.0%, respectively. Generally, negative associations, but with fluctuations, were found between age-standardised prevalence rates for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and the SDI at a global level. However, MASLD prevalence peaked at moderate SDI levels. The global burden of chronic liver diseases remains substantial. Hepatitis B and C have decreased in prevalence and incidence in the last decade, while MASLD, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases have increased, necessitating targeted public health strategies and resource allocation.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health issue with limited therapeutic options given the persistence of viral episomal DNA (cccDNA). Previously, we investigated the effects of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vector-mediated delivery of three guide (g)RNAs/Cas9 selected from 16 gRNAs. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 effectively suppressed HBV replication in vitro and in humanized chimeric mouse livers. In the present study, we examined the effect of AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 on the acute phase of HBV genotype F infection in an immunocompetent northern tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri; hereafter, \"tupaia\") model. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treatment significantly reduced the HBV viral load in serum at 1, 7, 10, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). HBV-F infection caused enlargement of hepatocytes and mild lymphocytic infiltration in the interlobular connective tissue. Thus, the virus damages hepatocytes and drives infection progression and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) accumulation, which were not observed in AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treated and normal liver tissues. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treatment reduced HBV DNA and cccDNA in liver tissues, as well as serum levels of HBV surface antigen and HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), including HBcAg and HBeAg at 14 dpi. Anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and anti-AAV Abs production was also detected. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treatment suppressed inflammatory cytokines and TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, and TLR9 mRNA levels. Thus, WJ11/Cas9 delivered by AAV2 vectors may provide a new therapeutic approach for inhibiting HBV infection in immunocompetent animal models, which could be developed for use in humans through further translational research.",

        "abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition associated with high mortality in the absence of liver transplantation. There have been various definitions proposed worldwide. The first consensus report of the working party of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set in 2004 on ACLF was published in 2009, and the \"APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC)\" was formed in 2012. The AARC database has prospectively collected nearly 10,500 cases of ACLF from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This database has been instrumental in developing the AARC score and grade of ACLF, the concept of the 'Golden Therapeutic Window', the 'transplant window', and plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. Also, the data has been key to identifying pediatric ACLF. The European Association for the Study of Liver-Chronic Liver Failure (EASL CLIF) and the North American Association for the Study of the End Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) from the West added the concepts of organ failure and infection as precipitants for the development of ACLF and CLIF-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and NACSELD scores for prognostication. The Chinese Group on the Study of Severe Hepatitis B (COSSH) added COSSH-ACLF criteria to manage hepatitis b virus-ACLF with and without cirrhosis. The literature supports these definitions to be equally effective in their respective cohorts in identifying patients with high mortality. To overcome the differences and to develop a global consensus, APASL took the initiative and invited the global stakeholders, including opinion leaders from Asia, EASL and AASLD, and other researchers in the field of ACLF to identify the key issues and develop an evidence-based consensus document. The consensus document was presented in a hybrid format at the APASL annual meeting in Kyoto in March 2024. The 'Kyoto APASL Consensus' presented below carries the final recommendations along with the relevant background information and areas requiring future studies.",

        "abstract": "<i>Houttuynia cordata</i> Thunb. holds a longstanding reputation as a traditional folk remedy in East Asia, where it has been employed to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, nephritis, hepatitis and cancer. Despite its extensive use, there exists a paucity of research examining its efficacy in managing thyroid disorders and diabetes. Moreover, the bioactive components responsible for modulating the molecular pathways remain elusive. This research aimed to determine the key bioactive components in the ethanolic extract of <i>H. cordata</i> Thunb. (HCEE) responsible for its thyroid-modifying properties and examine its effects on rats with experimentally induced hypothyroidism and diabetes. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the possible mechanisms of thyroid regulation of HCEE constituents. Researchers induced hypothyroidism in rats by adding 6-propyl-2-thiouracil to their drinking water for a period of four weeks. To induce diabetes, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The animals were then given daily oral doses of HCEE (500 mg/kg b.w.), levothyroxine (50 mg/kg b.w.), or glibenclamide (5 mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days. Following this treatment, standard methods were employed to measure biochemical parameters in the rats' serum. The results demonstrate that HCEE ameliorated hypothyroidism by increasing serum T3 (14.38%) and T4 (125.96%) levels and decreasing TSH (<i>p</i> < 0.01; -41.75%) levels. In diabetic rats with induced hypothyroidism, HCEE significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001) increased T3 (149.51%) and T4 (73.54%) levels with reduced TSH (-64.39%) levels. In silico analysis demonstrated that the identified bioactive compounds from HCEE may enhance thyroid hormone function through interaction with the thyroid hormone receptor protein TRβ1 (PDB:3GWS), similar to the conventional pharmaceuticals levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3). HCEE exhibits potential as a natural alternative to synthetic medications in the prevention and treatment of thyroid dysfunctions.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge in mitigating waterborne diseases risk exacerbated by climate change. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of these diseases at the district level remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern and identifying the best tree-based ML models for determining the meteorological factors associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh. This study used district-level reported cases of waterborne diseases (cholera, amoebiasis, typhoid and hepatitis A) obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) sourced from NASA for the period spanning 2017 to 2020. Exploratory spatial analysis, spatial regression and tree-based machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 and 2020, Bangladesh reported 73, 606 cholera, 38, 472 typhoid, 2, 510 hepatitis A and 1, 643 amoebiasis disease cases. Among the waterborne diseases cholera showed higher incidence rates in Chapai-Nawabganj (456.23), Brahmanbaria (417.44), Faridpur (225.07), Nilphamari (188.62) and Pirojpur (171.62) districts. The spatial regression model identified mean temperature (β = 12.16, s.e: 3.91) as the significant risk factor of waterborne diseases. The optimal XGBoost model highlighted mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation as determinants associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2020. The findings from the study, incorporating the One Health perspective, provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat waterborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries. Precautionary measures and intensified surveillance need to be implemented in certain high-risk districts for waterborne diseases across the country.",

Herein, we present Japan's experience in training medical coordinators to combat NCDs, with a focus on hepatitis, early-onset dementia, and children with medical complexity. Coordinators play an important role in bridging the gap between patients and healthcare services. We examined the training and roles of the coordinators. In the Japanese model, medical coordinators, including both medical and non-medical personnel, have successfully strengthened the delivery of healthcare services for specific diseases. However, challenges persist, including the uneven distribution of coordinators, inconsistencies in training programs, the program's relatively recent establishment, and limited awareness of coordinators' roles and activities. Training medical coordinators can strengthen comprehensive patient support in managing NCDs. Despite its limitations, this model provides valuable insights for developing interventional strategies in other Asian countries facing similar medical human resource shortages. Collaboration among governments, hospitals, and related organisations in training coordinators holds promise in addressing the growing prevalence of NCDs in these regions.",

        "abstract": "Cholestatic jaundice is a potentially serious condition that requires early diagnosis for proper management. Fat-soluble vitamin (FSV) deficiency develops as a consequence of cholestasis. Vitamin D deficiency is common and remains a challenge in patients with cholestasis. Objectives of the study were to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in infants with cholestatic jaundice. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2017 to June 2018 on purposively sampled infants. Infants who developed jaundice before three months of age, had direct bilirubin of more than 20.0% of the total bilirubin if total bilirubin is ≥5 mg/dl or more than 1.0 mg/dl if total bilirubin is <5 mg/dl, with pale stool and dark urine were included as cases while infants who visited hospital with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease and acute viral infection but no evidence of liver, gastrointestinal disease or renal disease checked by means of medical history, physical examination and a review of medical records were included as controls. Blood was collected from patients with cholestatic liver disease for liver biochemistries, prothrombin time, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium. Blood was also collected from controls for 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <15, 15 to 20 and >20 ng/ml were defined as vitamin D \"deficiency\", \"insufficiency\" and \"sufficiency\" respectively. Thirty patients and 30 controls were evaluated. Mean age in cases and controls were 113.43±74.08 and 145.50±88.62 days respectively (p=0.134). Biliary atresia was found to be the commonest cause, 18(60.0%), followed by idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) 7(23.3%), choledochal cyst 4(13.3%) and 1 case of neonatal hepatitis (NH) due to CMV infection. The mean serum bilirubin (total) was 12.07±3.92 mg/dl, mean serum bilirubin (direct) 6.51±2.03 mg/dl, serum ALT 130.7±67.81 U/L, serum AST 135.07±52.54 U/L, prothrombin time 17.36±11.88 seconds, serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 700.3±555.89 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 560.37±283.12 U/L and serum albumin was 3.6±0.4 gm/dl. Mean serum calcium was 9.18±0.84 mg/dl. Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in cholestatic patients was 14.7±5.75 ng/ml, compared to 27.68±10.44 ng/ml in controls (p=0.001). Vitamin D deficiency was found in 43.3% patients. The correlation between age at presentation and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was not significant (r = 0.051; p = 0.784). Statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.389; p=0.034) was found between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Serum calcium was found to have statistically significant positive correlation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r=0.692; p=0.001). Blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with cholestasis were lower than those of controls. So, adequate vitamin D supplementation and monitoring in this population is of great importance.",

The risk of transmission is more common among health care personnels and medical students during their professional health trainings. Vaccination is the most effective means of prevention. The main objective of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding Hepatitis B and vaccination among pre-clinical students in a medical college. A web-based, single-center, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among pre-clinical medical students in Bangladesh from April 28, 2024, to May 4, 2024. The whole sampling technique method was used taking the entire population for our study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using JMP Pro V17 Statistical Software. Sixty-one (34%) students were vaccinated against Hepatitis B, of whom 18% received all three doses with a booster dose. The most common reason for non-vaccination was lack of awareness of one's vaccination status (43%). The median knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores were 54 (50-60), 19 (17-21) and 20 (19-23) respectively, and they were moderately positively correlated. Forty-six (25.98%) students had a good overall KAP score (≥ 102). Only one-third of the students had been vaccinated, and the commonest reason for non-vaccination was lack of awareness of one's vaccination status. Nearly one-fourth of the participants had good knowledge, attitude, and practice related to Hepatitis B. Therefore, education regarding Hepatitis B infection, risk factors, and importance of vaccination is a must among pre-clinical medical students in Bangladesh.",

Clinically, the major unmet needs are recurrence after curative-intent surgery, liver transplantation or local ablation and disease progression in those with hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for resection or failed locoregional therapy. In the recent few years, new targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors have been registered as systemic therapy to address these issues. Notably, new forms of systemic therapy, either as first-line or second-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular or those not eligible for locoregional therapy, are now available. New data is also emerging with the use of systemic therapy to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after curative-intent resection or local ablation therapy and to retard disease progression after locoregional therapy. In the future, further implementation of immune-checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy are expected to bring a new paradigm to the management of hepatocellular carcinoma. New insight related to immune-related adverse events with the use of immunotherapy has allso enabled optimization of the therapeutic approach to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide an up-to-date recommendation based on clinical evidence and experience from expert Asia-Pacific key opinion leaders in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma. Three key questions will be addressed, namely: (1) Which patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered for systemic therapy? (2) Which systemic therapy should be used? (3) How should a patient planned for immune checkpoint-based systemic therapy be managed and monitored?",

This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

Improved diagnostic accuracy can drastically influence patient outcomes, emphasizing the need for innovative, non-invasive biomarkers. This study utilized a cohort of 402 participants, including healthy controls, chronic hepatitis patients, and HCC patients from Bangladesh, to evaluate DNA methylation signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We performed targeted next-generation sequencing on selected genes previously identified to assess their methylation dynamics. The development of M8 and M4 scores was based on these dynamics, using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine their effectiveness in detecting early-stage HCC alongside existing markers such as epiLiver and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Integration of M8 and M4 scores with epiLiver and AFP significantly enhances diagnostic sensitivity for early-stage HCC. The M4+epiLiver score achieves a sensitivity of 79.4% in Stage A HCC, while combining M4 with AFP increases sensitivity to 88.2-95.7% across all stages, indicating a superior diagnostic performance compared to each marker used alone. Our study confirms that combining gene methylation profiles with established diagnostic markers substantially improves the sensitivity of detecting early-stage HCC. This integrated diagnostic approach holds promise for advancing non-invasive cancer diagnostics, potentially leading to earlier treatment interventions and improved survival rates for high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

        "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection affects the hepatic, neurologic, hematopoietic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other organs, resulting in a high mortality rate and long-term sequelae. It may cause acute or chronic hepatitis, or even lead to hepatic cirrhosis. Valganciclovir (VGCV) is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for congenital CMV infection, without any serious adverse effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical, biochemical, and virological profiles of infants with CMV with intrahepatic cholestasis and to determine the outcomes with or without treatment with VGCV. Twenty infants aged <6 months diagnosed with congenital CMV infection with evidence of intrahepatic cholestasis were included in this study. Randomization was used to divide the study participants into 2 groups. The control group (n=10) was treated with only supportive management, and the intervention group (n=10) was treated with oral VGCV at 16 mg/kg/dose 12 hours a day for 6 weeks plus supportive treatments. Physical examinations and biochemical, serological, and virological tests were performed at the time of diagnosis and at the end of 6 weeks and 6 months. The control and intervention groups were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters such as jaundice, dark urine, pale stool, hepatomegaly, total bilirubin, aminotransferases, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and CMV polymerase chain reaction load, which showed a significant reduction after treatment in the intervention group (<i>p</i><0.05) with oral VGCV, with very few side effects, whereas the control group showed no significant changes. Oral VGCV can be used to effectively treat CMV infection with intrahepatic cholestasis without notable side effects.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV), resistant to several antiviral drugs due to viral genomic mutations, has been reported, which aggravates chronic infection and leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, host cellular factors/signaling modulation might be an alternative way of treatment for drug-resistant HBV. Here, we investigated the viral protein expression, replication, and virion production using endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-modulating chemicals, tunicamycin (an ER-stress inducer), and salubrinal (an ER-stress inhibitor). We found that ER-stress could be induced by HBV replication in transfected HepG2 cells as well as by tunicamycin as demonstrated by dual luciferase assay. HBV intracellular core-associated DNA quantified by qPCR has been significantly increased by tunicamycin in transfected HepG2 cells. Inversely, intracellular core associated and extracellular particle DNA has been significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in salubrinal-treated HepG2 cells transfected with HBV-replicating plasmid pHBI. Similar results were found in stably HBV-expressing hepatoblastoma (HB611) cells treated with salubrinal. However, increased or decreased ER-stress by tunicamycin or salubrinal treatment, respectively, has been confirmed by expression analysis of grp78 using Western blot. In addition, Western blot results demonstrated that the expression of HBV core protein and large HBsAg is increased and decreased by tunicamycin and salubrinal, respectively. In conclusion, the sal-mediated inhibition of the HBV replication and virion production might be due to the simultaneous reduction of core and large HBsAg expression and maintaining the ER homeostasis. These results of HBV replication regulation by modulation of ER-stress dynamics would be useful for designing/identifying anti-HBV drugs targeting cellular signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The people who inject drugs (PWID) are attributed to high-risk groups for transmission of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study assessed the prevalence and associated factors of current HCV infection (CHI) among U.S. general population and PWID of ages between 20 and 59 years old. This study utilized cross-sectional data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducting separate analyses for the U.S. general population, including PWID and non-PWID, as well as specific analyses focusing solely on PWID. The analytical methods included the estimation of CHI prevalence, Rao-Scott chi-square test to compare CHI-positive and CHI-negative groups, and univariate and multivariable logistic regressions models to evaluate the associated risk factors of CHI. The prevalence of CHI among general population and PWID were 1% and 19%, respectively. Compared to non-PWID, the odds of CHI were significantly higher among PWID (OR = 32.6, 95% CI = 17.7-60.3) in general population. Among PWID, male vs. female (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-5.9), adults aged 40-59 vs. 20-39 years old (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.2-7.3), Non-Hispanic Black vs. White (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.5-13.6), with high school diploma or less educational attainment vs. above college degree (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.4-9.2) showed higher odds of having CHI. The prevalence of CHI was found to be higher among PWID especially those who were male, aged 40-59 years old, Non-Hispanic Black, and had lower educational attainment. Targeted intervention such as screening and awareness program among PWID population is recommended to reduce the burden of new HCV infections in the U.S.",

Several studies have shown the association of microRNA (miRNA) in the progression of CLD in regulating cell proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis as well as in carcinogenesis. <b>Objectives:</b> The study was aimed at determining the expression of miRNA-221 among different stages of fibrosis in CLD patients due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and thus evaluate its role as an early biomarker in CLD. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 100 participants (75 CLD patients and 25 healthy control) were recruited in this cross-sectional study and divided into four groups, of which 25 as healthy control, 25 in CLD without fibrosis, 25 were CLD with fibrosis, and 25 were CLD with cirrhosis. Total RNA was extracted from plasma followed by cDNA synthesis, and finally, the expression of miRNA-221 was analyzed for its diagnostic potential as a single biomarker using the qRT-PCR method. <b>Results:</b> The plasma level of miRNA-221 was significantly upregulated in different fibrosis stages of CLD (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and this upregulation was positively correlated with the progression of fibrosis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Significantly increased expression of miRNA-221 was found in NAFLD patients compared to HBV patients in the CLD without fibrosis patient group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while expression of miRNA-221 was significantly upregulated among HBV patients in the CLD with the fibrosis group. miRNA-221 showed high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating different stages of fibrosis from healthy control (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> miRNA-221 may be used as a potential plasma biomarker for early prediction of fibrosis progression in CLD patients.",

        "abstract": "This immunoinformatic study identified potential epitopes from the envelopment polyprotein (Gn/Gc) of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a pathogenic virus causing severe fever in humans and livestock. Effective vaccination is crucial for controlling RVFV outbreaks. The identification of suitable epitopes is crucial for the development of safe and effective vaccines. Protein sequences were obtained from the UniProt database, and evaluated through VaxiJen v2.0 to predict the B and T-cell epitopes within the RVFV glycoprotein. Gn/Gc protein sequences were analyzed with bioinformatics tools and algorithms. The predicted T-cell and B-cell epitopes were evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity by the VaxiJen v2.0 system, AllerTop v2.0, and ToxinPred server, respectively. We employed computational methods to screen the RVFV envelopment polyprotein encompassing N-terminal and C-terminal glycoprotein segments, to discover antigenic T- and B-cell epitopes. Our analysis unveiled multiple potential epitopes within the RVFV glycoprotein, specifically within the Gn/Gc protein sequences. Subsequently, we selected eleven cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and four helper T-lymphocytes (HTL) for population coverage analysis, which collectively extended to cover 97.04% of the world's population, representing diverse ethnicities and regions. Notably, the CTL epitope VQADLTLMF exhibited binding affinity to numerous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. The identification of glycoprotein (Gn/Gc) epitopes through this immunoinformatic study bears significant implications for advancing the development of an effective RVFV vaccine. These findings provide valuable insights into the immunological aspects of the disease and may contribute towards the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies targeting other RNA viruses with similar polymerase enzymes.",

        "abstract": "Vaccination constitutes an attractive control measure for hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality globally. Analysis of pregnant participants in an effectiveness trial of the HEV vaccine HEV239 showed possible HEV239-associated fetal losses. We aimed to conduct a detailed analysis of this safety signal. In a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial, 67 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomly allocated (1:1) to two vaccine groups, in which non-pregnant women aged 16-39 years received either HEV239 (HEV239 group) or Hepa-B (a hepatitis B vaccine; control group). We implemented weekly surveillance for pregnancy detection, and follow-up of pregnancies once every 2 weeks, using physician-confirmed diagnoses to evaluate fetal loss outcomes (miscarriage [spontaneous abortion], stillbirth, and elective termination). Data from a parallel system of reproductive health surveillance in Matlab were used to clarify study diagnoses when necessary. Miscarriage was assessed only among participants whose first positive pregnancy test and vaccination date (for whichever dose was closest to the date of last menstrual period [LMP]) were before 20 weeks' gestation. We defined the following analysis periods of interest: from 90 days before the LMP until the pregnancy outcome (the proximal period); from the LMP date until the pregnancy outcome (the pregnancy period); from 90 days before the LMP until the LMP date (90 days pre-LMP period); and from enrolment until 90 days before the LMP (the distal period). Both Poisson and Cox regression models were used to assess the associations between receipt of HEV239 and fetal loss outcomes. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02759991). Among the 19 460 non-pregnant participants enrolled in the trial, 5011 were identified as having pregnancies within 2 years following vaccination and met the criteria for analysis (2407 in the HEV239 group and 2604 in the control group). Among participants vaccinated in the proximal period and evaluated for miscarriage, miscarriage occurred in 54 (8·9%) of 607 in the HEV239 group and 32 (4·5%) of 719 in the control group (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 2·0 [95% CI 1·3-3·1], p=0·0009). Similarly, the risk of miscarriages was increased in the HEV239 group versus the control group among participants inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy (22 [10·5%] miscarriages among 209 participants in the HEV239 group vs 14 [5·3%] of 266 in the control group; aRR 2·1 [95% CI 1·1-4·1], p=0·036) and among those vaccinated within 90 days pre-LMP (32 [8·0%] of 398 vs 18 [4·0%] of 453; 1·9 [1·1-3·2], p=0·013). No increased risk of miscarriage was observed in those who received HEV239 in the distal period (93 [5·6%] of 1647 vs 80 [4·5%] of 1773; 1·3 [0·8-1·9], p=0·295). Stillbirth and elective termination showed no increased risk among women administered HEV239 versus those administered Hepa-B in any of the analysis periods. HEV239 given shortly before or during pregnancy was associated with an elevated risk of miscarriage. This association poses a possible safety concern for programmatic use of HEV239 in women of childbearing age. Research Council of Norway and Innovax.",

We aimed to evaluate the safety of a HEV vaccine and its effectiveness in preventing hepatitis E during pregnancy. In this phase 4, double-blind, cluster-randomised trial, 67 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomised 1:1 to receive HEV239 (a recombinant HEV vaccine) or a control vaccine (Hepa-B, a hepatitis B vaccine), using block randomisation with random number tables and blocks of size eight, stratified by cluster population size. Eligible non-pregnant women (aged 16-39 years) were vaccinated intramuscularly on day 0, at 1 month, and at 6 months, and followed up for 2 years after the last immunisation. The primary endpoint was hepatitis E in the pregnant, per-protocol population (those who received all three doses within 2 days of the scheduled dates), while safety was a secondary endpoint, assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (participants who received at least one dose). Solicited adverse events were recorded for the first 7 days after each dose, and unsolicited events until 2 years after a participant's final dose. Pregnancy-related safety outcomes were assessed in the pregnant ITT population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02759991). Between Oct 2, 2017, and Feb 28, 2019, 19 460 participants were enrolled and received either HEV239 (9478 [48·7%] participants, 33 clusters) or Hepa-B (9982 [51·3%] participants, 34 clusters), of whom 17 937 (92·2%) participants received three doses and 17 613 (90·5%) were vaccinated according to protocol (8524 [48·4%] in the HEV239 group and 9089 [51·6%] in the control group). No pregnant participants were confirmed to have hepatitis E in either treatment group. HEV239 showed a mild safety profile, similar to Hepa-B, with no difference in the proportion of solicited adverse events between groups and no severe solicited events. Pain was the most common local symptom (1215 [12·8%] HEV239 recipients and 1218 [12·2%] Hepa-B recipients) and fever the most common systemic symptom (141 [1·5%] HEV239 recipients and 145 [1·5%] Hepa-B recipients). None of the serious adverse events or deaths were vaccine related. Among pregnant participants, the HEV239 group had a higher risk of miscarriage (136 [5·7%] of 2407 pregnant participants) compared with the control group (102 [3·9%] of 2604; adjusted odds ratio 1·54 [95% CI 1·15-2·08]). The effectiveness of HEV239 in pregnant women remains uncertain. HEV239 was safe and well tolerated in non-pregnant women, but findings regarding miscarriage warrant further investigation.

        "abstract": "The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and its complication, MAFLD-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (MAFLD-ACLF), is rising. Yet, factors determining patient outcomes in MAFLD-ACLF remain understudied. Patients with MAFLD-ACLF were recruited from the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver-ACLF Research Consortium (AARC registry). The diagnosis of MAFLD-ACLF was made when the treating unit had identified the etiology of chronic liver disease as MAFLD (or previous nomenclature such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis). Patients with coexisting other etiologies of chronic liver disease (such as alcohol, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, etc.) were excluded. Data were randomly split into derivation (n = 258) and validation (n = 111) cohorts at a 70:30 ratio. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Only the baseline clinical, laboratory features and severity scores were considered. The derivation group had 258 patients; 60% were male, with a mean age of 53. Diabetes was noted in 27% and hypertension in 29%. The dominant precipitants included viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus, 32%), drug-induced injury (drug-induced liver injury, 29%), and sepsis (23%). Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) and AARC scores on admission averaged 32 ± 6 and 10.4 ± 1.9. At 90 days, 51% survived. Nonviral precipitant, diabetes, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and encephalopathy were independent factors influencing mortality. Adding diabetes and precipitant to MELD-Na and AARC scores, the novel MAFLD-MELD-Na score (+12 for diabetes, +12 for nonviral precipitant), and MAFLD-AARC score (+5 for each) were formed. These outperformed the standard scores in both cohorts. Almost half of patients with MAFLD-ACLF die within 90 days. Diabetes and nonviral precipitants such as drug-induced liver injury and sepsis lead to adverse outcomes. The new MAFLD-MELD-Na and MAFLD-AARC scores provide reliable 90-day mortality predictions for patients with MAFLD-ACLF.",

        "abstract": "Afghan refugees child labourers face many challenges as they are labelled as refugees. In an attempt to explore these challenges, the present study was conducted in Tehran with a qualitative approach. The present qualitative research was conducted using a conventional content analysis approach with 25 Afghan child labourers in 2022 in Tehran. Child labourers were selected through purposive and snowball sampling and interviewed in a semi-in-depth interview. The data were analysed based on Granheim and Lundman's criteria, as well as those of Guba and Lincoln, to further enrich the findings. A total of 3 categories, 13 sub-categories, and 183 initial codes were extracted from the data analysis, including: \"psychological challenges\" (history of harassment and abuse, negative effects, high-risk behaviours, and family detachment); \"health challenges\" (physical problems, inappropriate accommodation, medical/therapeutic problems, and health threats); and \"social challenges\" (neglected childhood, dual identity, educational limitations, inadequate social support, social isolation, and social humiliation). At the individual level, it is possible to meet the child labourers' health needs and make them aware of the hazards of working in the streets through physical examination at certain intervals and holding training workshops on harassment prevention, anger control, prevention of high-risk behaviours, prevention of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and strengthening self-confidence to improve health. Also, the Afghan child labourers' work could be intervened at the social and familial level by providing accommodation in more suitable neighbourhoods, providing health insurance for child labourers, creating the chances of studying in schools, preventing dropouts, and strengthening social relations in order to improve children's health.",

        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

Anti viral therapy should be started as soon as possible in the ACLF patients at presentation while waiting for confirmation by HBV DNA level. This randomized controlled trial was carried out at the Department of Hepatology, BSMMU, Bangladesh from September 2019 to august 2020 with Hepatitis B virus related ACLF patient. This trial was conducted among twenty seven HBV acute on chronic liver failure patient to compare Child Turcotte pugh (CTP) score, Model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score, Asia Pacific Association for study of Liver (APASL) ACLF Research consortium (AARC) score, survival of the patients and HBV DNA level at 3 months with antiviral therapy between tenofovir alafenamide (25mg) and entecavir (0.5mg) group. CTP score, MELD score and AARC score were significantly (p<0.05) decline from baseline to all subsequent follow-up at 1st (at 7 days), 2nd (at 14 days), 3rd (at 30 days) and 4th (at 90 days) in each group but non significant (p>0.05) difference occurred between two group. All twenty seven patients had detectable HBV DNA level at pre-treatment and all survived patients became undectable at 4th, 90 days follow-up. Total 10 patients (37.07%) were survived at 90 days follow-up, out of them seven patients (70.0%) were in tenofovir alafenamide group and three patients (30.0%) were in entecavir group which was statistically significant (p<0.05) in between two group. Hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome were most common causes of death in both groups. Both drugs tenofovir alafenamide and entecavir significantly improves liver functions but the former one is superior regarding survival.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the pervasive challenges of low hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) testing rates coupled with the stigma associated with these diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with a special focus on Bangladesh. This study aims to introduce an innovative crowdsourcing intervention that involves medical students, a crucial cohort with the potential to shape healthcare attitudes. Through a structured crowdsourcing approach, the study designs and implements a digital intervention to counter stigma and promote testing among medical students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants submitted brief videos or texts aiming to encourage hepatitis testing and reduce stigma. The call, advertised through meetings, emails, and social media, welcomed entries in English or Bengali over 3 weeks. A panel of six judges evaluated each entry based on clarity, impact potential, innovation, feasibility, and sustainability, awarding prizes to students behind the highest-rated submissions. Seventeen videos and four text messages received an average score of 5.5 among 440 surveyed medical students, predominantly 22 years old (16%) and in their fourth year (21%). After viewing, 360 students underwent screening, identifying two previously undiagnosed HBV cases referred for care; no HCV infections were found. Notably, 41% expressed concerns about individuals with HBV working in hospitals or having a doctor living with HBV. In conclusion, this pilot showcases the power of medical students in spearheading campaigns to counter hepatitis stigma and encourage testing. By utilizing crowdsourcing, the study introduces an innovative approach to a persistent issue in LMICs specially in Bangladesh, offering a model that could potentially be adapted by other regions grappling with similar challenges.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is afflicted with periodic dengue outbreak every few years and one of the worst upsurges was recorded in 2019 during which there was an increasing trend of dengue with unusual symptoms which were not so common before. This study aims to describe the experience of three tertiary care centres of Dhaka regarding the clinical and laboratory, hospital outcome and management profile of the Expanded Dengue Syndrome (EDS) cases admitted from the 2019 outbreak. The current work was a cross-sectional observational study which took place from August 1 to December 31 2019 at three major tertiary care centres in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Out of total 2017 screened dengue cases, 49 met the inclusion criteria and 39 were enrolled after taking informed written consent. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel and Graph pad prism 9.3.1. A probability value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of the 39 cases, majority were male (79.49%) with median (±IQR) age of 33(±9) years. Hypertension (4; 10.26%) was the most commonly associated co-morbidity. Among the systemic manifestations, most prevalent was hepatitis (38.49%) followed by encephalopathy (12.82%). Majority of the patients were suffering from primary infection (85%). Case fatality rate was 15.38%. Hepatitis and meningoencephalitis were the predominant cause of death. This study records the only known case report of Acute respiratory dress syndrome (ARDS) complicating dengue from Bangladesh. None of the patients from our cohort were managed by steroids. Only two (5.13%) out of 39 cases received antibiotics. In the year 2019, an unusual rise in EDS cases with about 15.4% fatalities were observed in this study. Hepatitis was the most common presentation and cause of death. Here, we report the first ARDS case encountered in Bangladesh. Despite the multifaceted presentation of EDS, indiscriminate use of antibiotics and steroid was minimal. Early recognition of multifarious features of EDS is important for choosing the targeted treatment option which can avert many deaths. The results of this study underline the necessity for more in-depth research into the risk factors that are contributing to mortality in EDS cases.",

Thus, the study aimed to assess how knowledge, attitudes, and sociodemographic factors are associated with HBI prevention among a sample of Bangladeshi nursing students. A cross-sectional survey was performed among 737 nursing students from the nursing institutes of Khulna and Barishal divisions in Bangladesh from January to April 2023. The data were collected by providing questionnaires (structured questionnaire) in the classroom, following a stratified random sampling process. A model of multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors linked to HBI prevention practices. The mean (SD) scores were 11.42 (± 2.88) for knowledge, 4.33 (± 1.91) for attitude and 4.27 (± 2.056) for practice respectively. Participants' low knowledge (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.562, 95% CI: 1.29-5.07) and poor attitude (aOR = 5.730, 95% CI: 3.19-10.28) regarding HBI were significantly associated with higher likelihood of poor practice towards HBI prevention. Moreover, being 2nd year of nursing students (aOR = 2.147, 95% CI: 1.19-3.86), being aged 19-20 years (aOR = 3.038, 95% CI: 1.30-7.09), being married (aOR = 0.320, 95%CI: 0.13-0.82) and having a family history of HBI (aOR = 0.134, 95%CI: 0.05-0.36) were significantly associated with poor practices of HBI prevention among study participants. The knowledge, attitude and practice scores of the nursing students on HBI prevention were suboptimal. We advocate for implementing regular HBI prevention education and policies, free or subsidized services, skill development, proper HBI prevention enforcement and strict professional ethics within nursing colleges. Such efforts should predominantly focus on second-year, aged 19-20 and unmarried nursing students.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute jaundice in South Asia. Gaps in our understanding of transmission are driven by non-specific symptoms and scarcity of diagnostics, impeding rational control strategies. In this context, serological data can provide important proxy measures of infection. We enrolled a population-representative serological cohort of 2,337 individuals in Sitakunda, Bangladesh. We estimated the annual risks of HEV infection and seroreversion both using serostatus changes between paired serum samples collected 9 months apart, and by fitting catalytic models to the age-stratified cross-sectional seroprevalence. At baseline, 15% (95 CI: 14-17%) of people were seropositive, with seroprevalence highest in the relatively urban south. During the study, 27 individuals seroreverted (annual seroreversion risk: 15%, 95 CI: 10-21%), and 38 seroconverted (annual infection risk: 3%, 95CI: 2-5%). Relying on cross-sectional seroprevalence data alone, and ignoring seroreversion, underestimated the annual infection risk five-fold (0.6%, 95 CrI: 0.5-0.6%). When we accounted for the observed seroreversion in a reversible catalytic model, infection risk was more consistent with measured seroincidence. Our results quantify HEV infection risk in Sitakunda and highlight the importance of accounting for seroreversion when estimating infection incidence from cross-sectional seroprevalence data.",

        "abstract": "This investigation delineates an exhaustive analysis of the clinical, immunological, and genomic landscapes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection across a cohort of 22 verified patients. The demographic analysis unveiled a pronounced male bias (77.27%), with patient ages spanning 20 to 85 years and durations of illness ranging from 10 days to 4 years. Predominant clinical manifestations included fever, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and arthralgia, alongside observed co-morbidities such as chronic renal disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antigenic profiling of the HBV envelope proteins elucidated significant heterogeneity among the infected subjects, particularly highlighted by discordances in the detection capabilities of small and large HBsAg assays, suggesting antigenic diversity. Quantitative assessment of viral loads unveiled a broad spectrum, accompanied by atypical HBeAg reactivity patterns, challenging the reliability of existing serological markers. Correlative studies between viral burden and antigenicity of the envelope proteins unearthed phenomena indicative of diagnostic evasion. Notably, samples demonstrating robust viral replication were paradoxically undetectable by the large HBsAg ELISA kit, advocating for more sophisticated diagnostic methodologies. Genotypic examination of three HBV isolates classified them as genotype D (D2), with phylogenetic alignment to strains from various global origins. Mutational profiling identified pivotal mutations within the basic core promoter and preS2/S1 regions, associated with an augmented risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, mutations discerned in the small HBsAg and RT/overlap regions were recognized as contributors to vaccine and/or diagnostic escape mechanisms. In summation, this scholarly discourse elucidates the intricate interplay of clinical presentations, antigenic diversity, and genomic attributes in HBV infection, accentuating the imperative for ongoing investigative endeavors to refine diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.",

An effective response in these 20 countries is crucial if global elimination targets are to be achieved. In this update of the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission on accelerating the elimination of viral hepatitis, we convene national experts from each of the top 20 highest burdened countries to provide an update on progress. Although the global burden of diseases is falling, progress towards elimination varies greatly by country. By use of a hepatitis elimination policy index conceived as part of the 2019 Commission, we measure countries' progress towards elimination. Progress in elimination policy has been made in 14 of 20 countries with the highest burden since 2018, with the most substantial gains observed in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia. Most improvements are attributable to the publication of formalised national action plans for the elimination of viral hepatitis, provision of publicly funded screening programmes, and government subsidisation of antiviral treatments. Key themes that emerged from discussion between national commissioners from the highest burdened countries build on the original recommendations to accelerate the global elimination of viral hepatitis. These themes include the need for simplified models of care, improved access to appropriate diagnostics, financing initiatives, and rapid implementation of lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to explore the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and operational research (OR) practices during public health emergencies (PHE) in the southeast Asian region (SEAR) over the last decade. We searched electronic databases and grey literature sources for studies published between 2012 and 2022. The studies written in English were included, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. Among these 25 studies documented M&E and four studies documented OR practices. The majority of the studies were from India and Bangladesh, with no evidence found from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. M&E of surveillance programs were identified among which PHE due to COVID-19 was most prevalent. M&E was conducted in response to COVID-19, cholera, Nipah, Ebola, <i>Candida auris</i>, and hepatitis A. OR practice was minimal and reported from India and Indonesia. India conducted OR on COVID-19 and malaria, whereas Indonesia focused on COVID-19 and influenza. While most SEAR countries have mechanisms for conducting M&E, there is a noticeable limitation in OR practices. There is a compelling need to develop a standard framework for M&E. Additionally, enhancing private sector engagement is crucial for strengthening preparedness against PHE. Furthermore, there is a necessity to increase awareness about the importance of conducting M&E and OR during PHE.",

        "abstract": "Dialysis in pediatric groups is complicated by a wide range of factors that can affect long-term prognosis. The purpose of this meta-analysis and systematic review is to better understand the demographic and clinical factors that affect dialysis success in children. We searched a variety of databases for relevant articles and included 14 reports that dealt with the case studies of pediatric patients undergoing dialysis for a wide range of renal diseases. Patients' demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes were the primary areas of data collection. To get a better sense of the overall prevalence of certain outcomes and to spot noteworthy trends or patterns in the disease process, we conducted a meta-analysis. Variations in dialysis efficacy and outcomes are highlighted throughout a wide range of ages in the pediatric dialysis cohort, from neonates to teenagers. Acute kidney injuries (AKI) tended to impact more boys, but chronic kidney diseases (CKD), such as lupus nephritis, disproportionately afflicted girls. Many different ethnic groups were represented, and there was evidence that some diseases having a hereditary component were more common in some areas than others. However, the potential for long-term consequences remained a concern. Hemodialysis was found to be effective in controlling end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and AKI, with some patients going on to have a kidney transplant. At the same time, peritoneal dialysis was associated with an increased risk of infection. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of demographic and clinical parameters in determining pediatric dialysis outcomes. A 14.47% mortality rate and gender disparities are revealed by this meta-analysis of pediatric renal diseases, which included a cohort of 235 patients with conditions like lupus nephritis and hepatitis C infection. The findings stress the necessity for individualized treatment techniques and suggest that demographic characteristics should be addressed in prognostic models. For better patient outcomes, the study also suggests standardized reporting in pediatric dialysis studies.",

        "abstract": "Female commercial sex workers (FCSWs) bear higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among key populations. The association of structural determinants and STIs among FCSWs was not at the forefront of research earlier in Bangladesh. This study examined how structural factors correlate with the prevalence of STIs at physical/social/economic/policy levels among FCSWs in Dhaka city. 495 FCSWs were screened for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. Structural variables (Individual risks, high-risk sexual behaviors, work environments) were extracted from the previous multi-level study on FCSWs and analyzed in 2020 to determine whether macro/micro-structural factors were associated with STIs. The prevalence of STIs was 43.6% (95% CI: 39.1%-48). Most (n = 207/495) FCSWs were infected with Syphilis or Hepatitis B, only 1.8% had co-infection, and none was positive for HIV. Multiple logistic regression revealed that 'Individual risk' factors like age (≤18 years, adjusted odds ratio = AOR = .28; 18.1-29.9 years, AOR = .57), years in the sex industry (<1 year AOR = .15; 1-5 years, AOR = .39), and condoms as contraceptives (AOR = 2.7) were significantly associated with STIs. Considering 'High-risk behaviors' like monthly coitus with regular clients (AOR = .33), performing no anal sex ever (AOR = .03), and consistent condom use (AOR = .13) were less likely to be associated with STIs (P<0.05), while the association of ever group sex with STIs reported to double (AOR = 2.1). 'Work environment' like sex on roads/parks/shrines/markets (AOR = 2.6) and ever HIV-testing (AOR = 2.5) were significantly linked with STIs. However, micro-level factors like experiencing forced sex in the past year (AOR = 1.79) and condoms collected from hotel boys (AOR = .34) were significantly associated with STIs in the 'Hierarchical- model' with increasing model-power. 'Micro-structural' determinants predominated over 'Macro/policy-level factors' and profoundly influenced STIs. FCSWs need comprehensive and integrated interventions to promote accurate condom use perception, eliminate risky sexual behaviors, and provide quality reproductive health care. Necessary steps at the policy level are urgently needed to decriminalize commercial sex work.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis B, C, HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis, kidney and liver diseases along with presence of infections among aspirant migrant workers of Bangladesh. This study was carried out from September-December 2019. We analysed data collected on screening tests of specific diseases of aspirant workers. For each test, the prevalence was computed with 95% confidence interval. Association between categorical data was determined by the Chi-square test. A total of 2385 aspirants, 1988 (83.35%) males, aged between 18 and 65 years (29.76±6.578) were studied. Positive results for screening tests of HBsAg were 38 (1.6%,), anti-HCV were 2 (0.08%), TPHA were 25 (1.05%) and VDRL were 5 (0.21%) though no individual was positive for HIV and TB. Elevated level of SGOT (n=99, 4.2%), SGPT (n=322, 13.5%), RBS (n=57, 2.4%), bilirubin (n=46, 1.92%), creatinine (n=7, 0.3%) and ESR (n=19, 0.8%) were found in the workers. Diagnosis of diseases of workers is obligatory before going abroad to safeguard the health of the workers and residents of destination country.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh's unique epidemiological landscape presents an intriguing puzzle. This South Asian nation, with its complex sociodemographic and environmental factors, is home to a diverse array of hepatitis-B virus (HBV) genotypes, identified as Genotype C, with Genotypes D and A also making a significant contribution to the viral landscape. Reviewing such insights is necessary not only to underscore the country's regional diversity in HBV strains but also to bring into focus the clinical implications these genetic variations may have on disease progression and management. A thorough database search covered various sources using relevant keywords like \"Hepatitis B virus genotypes\", \"HBV genotypes in Bangladesh\", and \"HBV clinical implications\". The review synthesized findings and analyzed HBV genotype prevalence and clinical implications in Bangladesh. Genotypes C and D collectively represent 82% of chronic hepatitis-B infection (CHB) cases in Bangladesh, underscoring their regional prevalence. The geographic context is pivotal in understanding HBV infection dynamics and disease progression in this area. Notably, genotype C and the presence of A1762T/G1764A mutations appear to have a distinct impact on disease development, potentially affecting the immune response in CHB patients. This highlights the need for tailored management approaches in this specific region. Further research is vital to confirm and elaborate on these findings, particularly in relation to how these mutations influence the host's immune response. In summary, studies on HBV genotypes in Bangladesh stress the need for genotype-specific clinical considerations and more research to improve diagnostics and therapies. Raihan R, Akbar SMF.

The major objective was to assess the level of depression among patients having chronic hepatitis B. The Department of Hepatology of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University directed this study which was a comparative cross-sectional study during time duration from September 2021 to September 2022. Incidence and grading of depression between patients with chronic hepatitis B and HBsAg negative healthy volunteers were assessed and compared through this study. The association of different variables with depression among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients was also measured. Out of 90 patients having chronic hepatitis B, 52 (57.8%) were found to have some degree of depression; whereas among 90 HBsAg-negative healthy controls, 32 (35.6%) were found to have various degrees of depression. The dissimilarity between the two groups was significantly determined (<i>p</i>-value < 0.05). The majority of the depressed population from both groups had mild degrees of depression, however, the variance was not top the notch (<i>p</i>-value > 0.05). But the prevalence of moderate depression and moderately severe depression was statistically significant among CHB patients compared to their counterpart controls. Depression among CHB patients was found to be female-predominant. The study has shown a higher prevalence of depression among patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to HBsAg-negative healthy controls. Rahman M, Noor-E-Alam SM, Rahim MA, <i>et al</i>.

        "abstract": "HeberNasvac is a recently developed therapeutic vaccine for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) administered by intranasal (IN) and subcutaneous (SC) routes in a 14 days/10 doses schedule. To compare different schedules and routes of immunizations, a group of patients received four different vaccination regimens in a placebo-controlled factorial study. Subsequently, patients were followed for a minimum time of 48 weeks. Samples collected at the end of the follow-up were compared with initial samples. Groups I and II received the product by IN/SC routes, every 14 and 7 days, respectively. Groups III and IV were treated by SC route alone following a 14 and 7 days schedule. A group of 21 CHB patients received the vaccine in four different schedules and eight patients received placebo for a total of 29 patients enrolled. The 61.9% of vaccinees reduced their VL ≥2Log compared with baseline levels and 25% in placebo group. The 47.6% of vaccines reduced HBV levels to undetectable, 25% in placebo. HBeAg loss and seroconversion to anti-HBeAg was only achieved in vaccinees, 4 out of 9 (44.4%), and 40% (8 out of 20) developed anti-HBs response, none in placebo group. Reduction of HBsAg level in ≥1Log was achieved in the 35.0% of vaccinees and in none of the placebo-treated patients. Considering the individual and factorial analysis, significant HBV DNA reduction was detected in groups I and II, immunized by IN/SC routes. A significantly higher proportion of patients reducing VL to ≥2Log was also detected grouping the patients treated by IN/SC routes (G I + II) and grouping those inoculated every 14 days (G I + III), with 72.7% and 63.6%, respectively, compared with the placebo group (25.0%). The patients immunized every 14 days (G I + G III) also reduced the HBsAg levels compared with baseline. In conclusion, after more than 48 weeks of treatment-free follow-up, HeberNasvac-treated patients demonstrated superior responses compared with the placebo group in terms of antiviral and serological responses. The factorial analysis evidenced that the schedule combining the IN route of immunization and the frequency of 14 days resulted in the stronger antiviral and serological responses. Present results support the study of IN-only immunization schedules in future and was consistent with previous results. Long-lasting follow-ups were done to explore histological variables and the progression of serological variables in order to detect late responders. Freyre FM, Aguiar JA, Cinza Z, <i>et al</i>.

Vaccines are crucial in preventing microbial infections, including viruses, and adjuvants play a vital role in modulating immune responses. However, there are still many diseases for which effective vaccines are lacking or have limited immune response, posing significant threats to human health. The use of TLR agonists as adjuvants in viral vaccine formulations holds promise in improving vaccine effectiveness.

Neddylation has been reported to enhance the stability of the regulatory hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein, modulate viral replication, and enhance hepatocarcinogenesis. Inhibition of neddylation using the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 inhibitor MLN4924 inhibits viral replication, including that of HBV. Understanding of the role of neddylation in viral infections is critical for developing new therapeutic targets and potential treatment strategies.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major source of disease burden worldwide, with an estimated 296 million individuals living with infections worldwide. Although vaccine programs exist to control infections, certain sub-populations around the world continue to have very high prevalence of HBV infection. A systematic search of studies of HBV published after 2010 was conducted for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan. Each paper was independently screened for risk of bias and inclusion. Data were extracted from included studies before being analysed to estimate pooled prevalence, and to conduct sub-group analyses. Random-effects models were used for estimating summary prevalence due to a high level of heterogeneity between studies, and funnel plots were combined with Egger's test to assess publication bias. Meta-regression was conducted to investigate sources of between-study heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence of HBV across all studies was 3% (95% CI 0.02, 0.05). For countries with multiple studies, the pooled prevalence in India was 3% (95% CI 0.02, 0.04), in Pakistan 6% (95% CI 0.03, 0.09), in Bangladesh 5% (95% CI of 0.02, 0.12), and in Nepal 1% (95% CI 0.00, 0.08). There was some evidence of publication bias, and a high level of heterogeneity across studies. Risk of bias analysis found most studies to be of fair or moderate quality. The prevalence of HBV among countries in the sub-continent was higher than the global average, but was not as high as some other regions. Countries with greater numbers of displaced persons had higher prevalence of HBV, with a wide range of prevalence between subpopulations likely reflecting differential uptake, and implementation, of vaccination programs.",

East and South Asia bear a substantial burden of HEV infection, with Bangladesh, China, and India facing the most severe threat in this region. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the burden of HEV-ALF in these three high-risk countries. A systematic literature search was performed utilizing PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Studies in English or Chinese that reported data on the burden of HEV-ALF in Bangladesh, China and India were included. Outcomes were pooled with meta-analysis utilizing R software. Estimates were calculated with random-effects models, and subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to address heterogeneity. Egger's test and Begg's test were performed to assess publication bias. A total of 20 eligible studies were included in this study. The pooled HEV-attributable proportion of viral-related acute liver failure was estimated to be 40.0% (95% CI: 0.28-0.52), 30.0% (95% CI: 0.18-0.44), and 61.0% (95% CI: 0.49-0.72) among non-pregnant individuals in India, China and Bangladesh, while in Indian pregnant females, it was 71.0% (95% CI: 0.62-0.79). The combined prevalence among non-pregnant HEV-infected participants was 28.0% (95% CI: 0.20-0.37) and 10.0% (95% CI: 0.01-0.28) in India and China, and it was 34.0% (95% CI: 0.27-0.42) in Indian pregnant females with HEV infection. The overall mortality of HEV-ALF was estimated to be 32.0% (95% CI: 0.23-0.42) and 64.0% (95% CI: 0.50-0.77) among the non-pregnant and the pregnant participants in India, and it was 23.0% (95% CI: 0.14-0.34) in Chinese non-pregnant participants.

Nearly 60 % of Qatar's population are expatriates CMWs, including many from hyperendemic countries for HEV. Thus, estimating the seroprevalence of HEV in Qatar and understanding its epidemiology is essential for public health efforts to control HEV transmission in Qatar. Blood samples from 2670 CMWs were collected between 2020 and 2021. All samples were tested for HEV-IgG antibodies. Positive HEV-IgG samples were tested for HEV-IgM antibodies, and those positives were also tested for viral antigens using an HEV-Ag ELISA kit and HEV-RNA by RT-PCR to confirm current HEV infections. The seroprevalence of HEV-IgG was 27.3 % (729/2670; 95 % CI: 25.6-29.0). Of those HEV-IgG positive, 8.23 % (60/729; 95 % CI: 6.30-10.5) were HEV-IgM positive. Of the IgM-positive samples, 2 were HEV-RNA positive (3.39 %; 95 % CI: 0.40-11.7), and 1 was HEV-Ag positive (1.69 %; 95 % CI: 0.04-9.09).

We examined the determinants of healthcare-seeking for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection which is asymptomatic, chronic, and requires costly treatment in an urban tertiary care referral hospital in Vietnam. We conducted a secondary analysis of hospital data for patients attending the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam between 2017 and 2020 specifically for HCV infection treatment. Poisson regression was used to determine the effect of personal factors (age, sex, comorbidities) and structural factors (health insurance, proximity to the facility, seasonality, year of visit) on the number of hospital visits. From 2017 to 2020 a total of 22,052 eligible patients sought treatment in the hospital. Among the patients, 50.4% were males and 58.7% were > 50 years of age. The mean number of visits per person was 2.17. In the multivariate analysis compared to 2017, the number of hospital visits increased by 4% in 2018 and then significantly decreased in 2019 and 2020. Visit numbers were significantly lower (6%) among South East region residents compared to those from Central Highlands and for those who lived further away from the hospital. The visit numbers were significantly higher among older age groups (5-11%), those with health insurance (6%), and those with comorbidities (5%) compared to others. Although the number of hospital visits by females was higher (7%) than males in 2017, it significantly decreased in subsequent years. Our study indicated that there are both structural and individual factors affecting the number of visits for HCV treatment. To meet the global strategy for elimination of HCV, Vietnam Government needs to address the structural and personal barriers to healthcare seeking, with a special focus on women.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis is often called a 'silent killer' as most patients remain asymptomatic and hence remain unaware of their illness. They are either diagnosed incidentally or get symptomatic when their illness advances years after getting the infection. In Pakistan, transmission has increased due to ignorance of sterilization techniques, sharing personal items, and unsafe healthcare practices and the burden of liver cancers and transplants has risen three-fold during the past 20 years. Chronic hepatitis often goes undetected, leading to a rise in liver cancers and transplants. Pakistan bears the second-largest burden of hepatitis C globally, with a nationwide prevalence of 4.8%. From 2015 to 2019, there was a 5% increase in hepatitis C-related deaths and an 8% increase in hepatitis B-related deaths. During the last 4 years, out of the 110 million population, only 281 578 individuals were screened for hepatitis B and C, and 1 634 614 individuals were registered at various hepatitis clinics. However, only 278 308 patients were treated. Despite a national vaccination strategy, coverage falls short, and regular screening is neglected. The burden of hepatitis-related morbidity is a considerable challenge for the Pakistani government and healthcare system, being a low-income country with limited health resources and limited access to treatment. Increased awareness, education, and emphasizing preventive measures, such as hepatitis B vaccination, is crucial. Careful supervision of healthcare workers and the promotion of safe practices are essential. Pakistan can learn and implement the Egypt model to combat hepatitis effectively. This article aims to discuss barriers and challenges and provides possible recommendations.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 on hepatitis-related services in Bangladesh and compared the situation with same study conducted in Japan and globally. We conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey among the clinicians of four societies associated with liver disease in Bangladesh from October to December 2022. The questionnaire included the same questions as a survey conducted in Japan and globally. A total of 83 clinicians from 8 divisions in Bangladesh participated; 66.3% were heads of departments/institutions. Except for HCV treatment initiation, more than 30% of clinicians reported a 76-99% decline in all services. Compared to Japan and the global survey, there was a significantly higher decline in all HBV and HCV services in Bangladesh. To resume services back to pre-COVID-19 levels, Patient anxiety and fear (Bangladesh Survey: 80.7% vs Japan Survey: 67.4% vs Global Survey: 37.9%, p < 0.0001), loss of space due to COVID-19 (Bangladesh Survey: 63.9% vs Japan Survey: 34.7% vs Global Survey: 19.4%, p < 0.0001) were the main challenges. As part of the mitigation strategy, usage of telemedicine (Bangladesh Survey: 83.1% vs. Japan Survey: 67.3% vs Global Survey: 78.6% p < 0.0001), COVID-19 benefits, such as increased laboratory testing platforms (Bangladesh Survey: 77.1% vs Japan Survey: 17.9% vs Global Survey: 41.8%, p < 0.0001) was reported significantly higher in Bangladesh than in Japan and global survey. All the services-related to HBV and HCV were highly affected during greatest impact month of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and the decline level was higher than Japan and global survey. Repeated countermeasures of COVID-19 and constrained healthcare-system were the probable reasons in Bangladesh. Positive impact resulting from COVID-19 countermeasures should be utilized in the national hepatitis program in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>. In the United States, histoplasmosis is endemic in the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio. Histoplasmosis is often asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, and severe disseminated cases are more often seen in immunosuppressed patients. Disseminated histoplasmosis often affects the reticuloendothelial system, invading specific visceral organs such as the liver, spleen, and pancreas. The current study presents a unique case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a 64-year-old immunocompetent male. The patient's presentation included a 40-lb weight loss over a year, bilateral adrenal nodules, abnormal liver enzymes, and granulomatous hepatitis, which initially raised suspicion of a malignant etiology. An adrenal mass biopsy showed fungal morphology that confirmed an <i>H. capsulatum</i> infection. Further history showed that the patient recently traveled to Bangladesh, which is thought to be a region endemic to histoplasmosis. This case is noteworthy because disseminated histoplasmosis rarely affects immunocompetent individuals, and an infectious etiology for adrenal insufficiency is exceedingly rare, especially in the United States. The treatment regimen included a 14-day induction therapy of IV amphotericin B followed by outpatient itraconazole, leading to symptom resolution. This case highlights the need to consider an infectious etiology for adrenal insufficiency, especially among immunocompetent individuals who may be at risk after traveling to endemic areas.",

Traditional antiviral drug development involves targeting specific viral proteins, which may lead to the emergence of resistant strains. To explore alternative strategies, we investigated the antiviral potential of antimicrobial peptidomimetic compounds. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral potential of 17 short anthranilamide-based peptidomimetic compounds against two viruses: Murine hepatitis virus 1 (MHV-1) which is a surrogate of human coronaviruses and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of these compounds were determined in vitro to assess their potency as antiviral agents. Compounds <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> displayed the most potent inhibitory effects with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.38 μM, and 6.3 μM against MHV-1 while compounds <b>9</b> and <b>14</b> showed IC<sub>50</sub> values of 14.8 μM and 13 μM against HSV-1. Multiple antiviral assessments and microscopic images obtained through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) collectively demonstrated that these compounds exert a direct influence on the viral envelope. Based on this outcome, it can be concluded that peptidomimetic compounds could offer a new approach for the development of potent antiviral agents.",

        "abstract": "Background This multicentric cross-sectional study aimed to examine the prevalence of thrombocytopenia (TCP) and investigate the various causes of chronic liver disease (CLD) across 15 Southeast Asian (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) tertiary care centers over a three-month period. The study focused on assessing the fibrosis index (FI) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-sodium (Na) score's capacity to grade and predict the progression and outcomes of patients with already diagnosed CLD. Methods The cross-sectional study enrolled 377 CLD patients. The study utilized admission registries from 15 tertiary care hospitals in Southeast Asia, spanning from April 2023 to June 2023. Various descriptive variables were collected, including gender, tobacco use (specifically, chewed tobacco), underlying etiology, presence of anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, infectious state, and liver cirrhosis diagnosed via traditional ultrasonography. This study examined liver failure indicators, including alanine transaminase levels, compensation status, TCP, and liver transplant (LT) listing. The MELD-Na score was the focus of frequency and percentage analysis. MELD-Na and FI medians and standard deviations were provided. Results The study of 377 patients with CLD found that TCP was present in 4% of patients and leukopenia was present in 12% of patients. The risk of TCP was significantly higher in leukopenic patients (89.5%) than in non-leukopenic patients (52.5%) (p = 0.003). The most common CLD cause was undiagnosable (31%), followed by autoimmune (26%), hepatitis C virus (21%), hepatitis B virus (14%), and schistosomiasis (8%). The majority of patients (98%) had decompensated liver disease. Of the patients, 64% had TCP, while 36% did not. The illness severity indicators MELD score and FI had mean ± SD values of 16.89 ± 6.42 and 4.1 ± 1.06, respectively. Similarly, the prevalence of LT needs among traditional ultrasonography-diagnosed cirrhotic patients was 83.1%, compared to 59.6% among non-cirrhotic patients (p = 0.001). Conclusion Leukopenia and TCP may be linked, which may affect CLD treatment and prognosis in this population. Non-invasive indicators like the FI and MELD-Na score can detect liver fibrosis and severity without invasive procedures, enhancing patient management. These findings highlight the need to improve early diagnosis methods for CLD in Southeast Asia and raise awareness among clinicians about effective diagnostic strategies for non-infectious causes of CLD.",

        "abstract": "The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. No specific funding was awarded for this meta-analysis.

The recognition of the pathogenic HCV genotype is critical for the remedy of its sufferers. The aim of this study was to identify the HCV RNA genotype to decide the correct treatment of hepatitis C positive sufferers in Bangladesh. Blood samples were collected from 390 individuals and isolated RNA (60 µg) from blood plasma. Extracted RNA was used for quantitative HCV RNA, and complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conducted by reverse transcriptase enzyme. This cDNA amplified in multiplex by RT-PCR, which was performed with specific set of primers. The HCV RNA genotype was detected 297 of 390 patients. Of the 390 test samples, 200 (51.28%) samples were from males and 190 (48.71%) were from females, with age ranging from 5 to 78 years. In all, 166 of 200 male samples and 131/190 female samples were found positive for HCV. Of these 390 participants included in the study, 213 (54.61%) were identified as genotype 3 positive, 78 (20%) as genotype 1 positive, 6 (1.53%) as genotype 6 positive, and the remaining 93 (23.85%) samples were unclassified due to low/undetected viral load. In this study, we detected the highest percentage (30.89%) of genotype 3 HCV in patients aged 51 to 60 years. The results suggested that genotype 3 HCV is frequently present in Bangladesh and it is usually responses better to interferon therapy.

Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) estimation adjunct to HBV-DNA is vital for assessing HBV chronicity and therapeutic prognosis. This study aimed to estimate the qHBsAg and compare its diagnostic performance with that of the HBV-DNA levels in CHB patients from Bangladesh. Methodology A total of 148 CHB patients were enrolled in this study. qHBsAg and hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) were estimated using chemiluminescent and enzyme immunoassays, respectively, and HBV-DNA was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The parameters and diagnostic performances were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results The overall levels (mean ± SD) of qHBsAg, HBV-DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) among the total population (n = 148) were 3.45 ± 0.80 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, 4.40 ± 2.44 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, and 86.17 ± 39.06 IU/L, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the levels of both qHBsAg (p = 0.004) and HBV-DNA (p < 0.0001) in cases with HBeAg positivity. qHBsAg levels showed a weak positive correlation with the levels of HBV-DNA and ALT in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, but no such relationship was observed in HBeAg-negative CHB patients. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for the qHBsAg level to distinguish high HBV-DNA levels (>5 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL) was 0.653 (p = 0.002), which indicated an acceptable diagnostic performance. The best cut-off of qHBsAg for predicting high HBV-DNA levels was 3.469 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL. Conclusions Our results indicated that qHBsAg might be a useful marker for monitoring HBV-DNA in CHB patients throughout treatment and follow-up.",

        "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 296 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Approximately 15-25% of these people develop complications such as advanced chronic liver diseases (ACLDs). Mortality due to HBV-related complications accounted for an estimated 882,000 deaths in 2019. Potent preventive vaccines have already restricted new HBV infections, and several drugs are available to treat chronic HBV infections. However, the positive impacts of these drugs have been recorded in only a few patients with chronic HBV infection. These drugs do not show long-term efficacy and cannot halt the progression to complications. Thus, more effective and evidence-based therapeutic strategies need to be urgently developed for patients with chronic HBV infection. CHB is a pathological entity induced by HBV that progresses due to impaired host immunity. This indicates the inherent limitations of antiviral-drug-based monotherapy for treating patients with chronic HBV infection. Additionally, commercially available antiviral drugs are not available to patients in developing and resource-constrained countries, posing a challenge to achieving the following WHO goal: \"Elimination of Hepatitis by 2030\". As such, this review aimed to provide insights regarding evidence-based and effective management strategies for chronic HBV infection.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy for children and adolescents in Bangladesh who are living with chronic HCV infection. An experimental study was performed from January 2021 to December 2022. HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive thalassemic children, who were 6-18 years of age, were enrolled by consecutive nonprobability sampling. Clinical features were recorded, and investigations were performed. All patients were initially treated with sofosbuvir (200 mg for 6- to 11-year-olds and 400 mg for 12- to 18-year-olds) and ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg/day) and were assessed clinically on a four-weekly basis, along with liver-function testing. The total duration of therapy was 24 weeks. HCV PCR was done at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the completion of treatment to see the sustained virological response. There were 26 cases in total, with a mean age of 9.26 ± 2.82 years; 14 were males (53.8%), and 12 females (46.2%). Twenty-five (96.15%) patients achieved a sustained virological response, and the end-of-treatment PCR was negative. One patient (3.85%) was a nonresponder even after 24 weeks of treatment. The medication was well received, with only four patients (15.3%) reporting headaches that were reported untreated. The combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin is effective in treating chronic HCV infection and is not accompanied by any major negative side effects.",

        "title": "Liver injury: the therapeutic dilemma of homeopathy - a case report from Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness, homeopathic treatment is increasingly being used as a form of alternative medicine, with many people taking homeopathic remedies instead of drug therapies. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like', meaning that a remedy similar to the illness can be used to treat it. However, there have been several reports suggesting the risks of homeopathic remedies, among which homeopathy-induced liver injury is widely discussed. Here, we report a case of a 35-year-old well-oriented male patient with a typical clinical presentation of liver injury as presented by yellowish discoloration of sclera and skin along with generalized body itching following the use of homeopathic medicine for musculoskeletal pain. Laboratory reports of increased liver markers along with bilirubin were also suggestive. Excluding other differentials like viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, and standard drug and toxin-induced hepatitis, the recent use of homeopathic remedies was a contributing factor in leading to the diagnosis of homeopathy-induced liver injury. He was then treated with the discontinuation of homeopathic medicine and supportive care. This case highlights the need for public awareness of the possible complications such as headache, tiredness, skin eruption, dizziness, bowel dysfunction, allergic reactions to acute pancreatitis, renal failure, neurological dysfunction, possible liver injury, and even mortality in those patients who pursue homeopathic treatments and health care professionals should take this into account when making a differential diagnosis in patients with liver injury.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine escape mutants (VEM) are increasingly described, threatening progress in control of this virus worldwide. Here we studied the relationship between host genetic variation, vaccine immunogenicity and viral sequences implicating VEM emergence. In a cohort of 1,096 Bangladeshi children, we identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants associated with response vaccine antigens. Using an HLA imputation panel with 9,448 south Asian individuals <i>DPB1*04:01</i> was associated with higher HBV antibody responses (p=4.5×10<sup>-30</sup>). The underlying mechanism is a result of higher affinity binding of HBV surface antigen epitopes to DPB1*04:01 dimers. This is likely a result of evolutionary pressure at the HBV surface antigen 'a-determinant' segment incurring VEM specific to HBV. Prioritizing pre-S isoform HBV vaccines may tackle the rise of HBV vaccine evasion.",

        "abstract": "Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism with diverse clinical manifestations. Zinc (Zn) has been used for treatment of WD. Recent studies showed low serum zinc level in patients suffering from WD than the normal. This cross-sectional analytical study has been designed to compare the serum zinc level between paediatric patients suffering from WD but yet not started treatment and children who have normal ALT level. This study was carried out at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, BSMMU, Dhaka, Bangladesh from July 2018 to June 2019. Total 51 children were included in this study. Among them 27 were diagnosed case of WD aged between three to eighteen years and 24 children of same ages who were suffering from other than liver disease having normal ALT were included as volunteers. The patients of WD were divided into four groups according to their presentation as acute hepatitis, chronic liver disease (CLD), acute liver failure & neuropsychiatric manifestation. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients and volunteers for participation in this study. Along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations 3 ml of venous blood were collected for estimation of serum zinc level. After estimation of serum zinc level results were analyzed statistically. The difference in serum zinc levels were compared between the groups. Serum zinc level was significantly lower in Wilson disease patients (43.8±19.7μg/dl; range: 13-83) compared to volunteers group (67.8±11.8μg/dl; range: 47-97) p<0.001. Among the diseased group, serum zinc level were significantly lower in 18 CLD (38.4±17.4μg/dl) and in 4 acute liver failure (33.1±3.7μg/dl) compared to 4 acute hepatitis (71.8±4.3μg/dl) (p=0.001) and (p<0.001) respectively. Mean serum zinc level was low in 4 Wilsonian acute liver failure (33.1±3.7μg/dl), which was significant compared to those (23) who presented as Wilson disease non acute liver failure (45.7±20.8μg/dl) (p=0.013). Serum zinc level was significantly lower in Wilson disease children compared to the volunteers. Zinc level was also found significantly low in Wilson disease presented as CLD and acute liver failure in comparison to Wilson disease presented as acute hepatitis.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a dangerous virus that is responsible for a large number of infections and deaths worldwide. In the treatment of HCV, it is important that the drugs are effective and do not have additional hepatotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to test the in silico activity of 1893 terpenes against the HCV NS5B polymerase (PDB-ID: 3FQK). Two drugs, sofosbuvir and dasabuvir, were used as controls. The GOLD software (CCDC) and InstaDock were used for docking. By using the results obtained from PLP.Fitness (GOLD), pKi, and binding free energy (InstaDock), nine terpenes were finally selected based on their scores. The drug-likeness properties were calculated using Lipinski's rule of five. The ADMET values were studied using SwissADME and pkCSM servers. Ultimately, it was shown that nine terpenes have better docking results than sofosbuvir and dasabuvir. These were gniditrin, mulberrofuran G, cochlearine A, ingenol dibenzoate, mulberrofuran G, isogemichalcone C, pawhuskin B, 3-cinnamyl-4-oxoretinoic acid, DTXSID501019279, and mezerein. Each docked complex was submitted to 150 ns-long molecular dynamics simulations to ascertain the binding stability. The results show that mulberrofuran G, cochlearine A, and both stereoisomers of pawhuskin B form very stable interactions with the active site region where the reaction product should form and are, therefore, good candidates for use as effective competitive inhibitors. The other compounds identified in the docking screen either afford extremely weak (or even hardly any) binding (such as ingenol dibenzoate, gniditrin, and mezerein) or must first undergo preliminary movements in the active site before attaining their stable binding conformations, in a process which may take from 60 to 80 ns (for DTXSID501019279, 3-cinnamyl-4-oxoretinoic acid or isogemichalcone C).",

        "abstract": "Chikungunya (CHIK) patients may be vulnerable to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, presently there are no anti-COVID-19/CHIK therapeutic alternatives available. The purpose of this research was to determine the pharmacological mechanism through which kaempferol functions in the treatment of COVID-19-associated CHIK co-infection. We have used a series of network pharmacology and computational analysis-based techniques to decipher and define the binding capacity, biological functions, pharmacological targets, and treatment processes in COVID-19-mediated CHIK co-infection. We identified key therapeutic targets for COVID-19/CHIK, including TP53, MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, TNF, IL6 and NFKB1. Gene ontology, molecular and upstream pathway analysis of kaempferol against COVID-19 and CHIK showed that DEGs were confined mainly to the cytokine-mediated signalling pathway, MAP kinase activity, negative regulation of the apoptotic process, lipid and atherosclerosis, TNF signalling pathway, hepatitis B, toll-like receptor signaling, IL-17 and IL-18 signaling pathways. The study of the gene regulatory network revealed several significant TFs including KLF16, GATA2, YY1 and FOXC1 and miRNAs such as let-7b-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-34a-5p, and mir-155-5p that target differential-expressed genes (DEG). According to the molecular coupling results, kaempferol exhibited a high affinity for 5 receptor proteins (TP53, MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, and TNF) compared to control inhibitors. In combination, our results identified significant targets and pharmacological mechanisms of kaempferol in the treatment of COVID-19/CHIK and recommended that core targets be used as potential biomarkers against COVID-19/CHIK viruses. Before conducting clinical studies for the intervention of COVID-19 and CHIK, kaempferol might be evaluated in wet lab tests at the molecular level.",

        "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors that play important roles in the early detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and shaping innate and adaptive immune responses, which may influence the consequences of infection. Similarly to other viral infections, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) also modulates the host TLR response; therefore, a proper understanding of the response induced by human HIV-1 or co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), due to the common mode of transmission of these viruses, is essential for understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis during mono- or co-infection with HBV or HCV, as well as for HIV-1 cure strategies. In this review, we discuss the host TLR response during HIV-1 infection and the innate immune evasion mechanisms adopted by HIV-1 for infection establishment. We also examine changes in the host TLR response during HIV-1 co-infection with HBV or HCV; however, this type of study is extremely scarce. Moreover, we discuss studies investigating TLR agonists as latency-reverting agents and immune stimulators towards new strategies for curing HIV. This understanding will help develop a new strategy for curing HIV-1 mono-infection or co-infection with HBV or HCV.",

A single F12 gene CpG site effectively differentiates HCC samples from other blood samples, normal tissues, and non-HCC tumors in TCGA and GEO data repositories. The markers were validated in a separate plasma sample dataset from HCC patients and controls. We designed a high-throughput assay using next-generation sequencing and multiplexing techniques, analyzing plasma samples from 554 clinical study participants, including HCC patients, non-HCC cancers, chronic hepatitis B, and healthy controls. HCC detection sensitivity was 84.5% at 95% specificity and 0.94 AUC. Implementing this assay for high-risk individuals could significantly decrease HCC morbidity and mortality.",

The present study provides information about the role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype in this phase III clinical trial. From a total of 160 patients enrolled in this trial, the HBV genotypes of 133 patients were characterized, and NASVAC induced a stronger antiviral effect (HBV DNA reduction below 250 copies per mL) than Peg-IFN. The antiviral effects and alanine aminotransferase levels were not significantly different among different HBV genotypes in NASVAC-treated patients. However, a significantly higher proportion of genotype-D patients receiving NASVAC showed better therapeutic effects, compared to genotype-D patients receiving Peg-IFN, with a marked difference of 44%. In conclusion, NASVAC seems to be a better alternative to Peg-IFN, especially in patients with HBV genotype-D patients. This reflects the attractiveness of NASVAC in countries where genotype D is highly prevalent. The mechanisms underlying the effect of HBV genotype are being studied in a new clinical trial.",

        "abstract": "Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a highly conserved metabolic process, regulates cellular homeostasis by degrading dysfunctional cytosolic constituents and invading pathogens <i>via</i> the lysosomal system. In addition, autophagy selectively recycles specific organelles such as damaged mitochondria (<i>via</i> mitophagy), and lipid droplets (LDs; <i>via</i> lipophagy) or eliminates specialized intracellular pathogenic microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and coronaviruses (<i>via</i> virophagy). Selective autophagy, particularly mitophagy, plays a key role in the preservation of healthy liver physiology, and its dysfunction is connected to the pathogenesis of a wide variety of liver diseases. For example, lipophagy has emerged as a defensive mechanism against chronic liver diseases. There is a prominent role for mitophagy and lipophagy in hepatic pathologies including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and drug-induced liver injury. Moreover, these selective autophagy pathways including virophagy are being investigated in the context of viral hepatitis and, more recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated hepatic pathologies. The interplay between diverse types of selective autophagy and its impact on liver diseases is briefly addressed. Thus, modulating selective autophagy (e.g., mitophagy) would seem to be effective in improving liver diseases. Considering the prominence of selective autophagy in liver physiology, this review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and functions of selective autophagy (mainly mitophagy and lipophagy) in liver physiology and pathophysiology. This may help in finding therapeutic interventions targeting hepatic diseases <i>via</i> manipulation of selective autophagy.",
