        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes significant morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting vulnerable populations such as pregnant women. HEV239 (Hecolin<sup>®</sup>), a recombinant vaccine containing the immunodominant protruding (E2) domain of the HEV capsid protein, has demonstrated effectiveness, yet detailed human cellular immune responses remain understudied. This study characterized humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with HEV239 or natural HEV infection in healthy Bangladeshi women aged 16-39 years. Using dual IFNγ and IL-4 ELISpot assays, we found robust, predominantly Th1-mediated cellular responses at 30 days after the third vaccine dose, comparable to responses during acute infection. Longitudinal antibody assessments confirmed sustained antibody production, primarily against the E2 domain of genotypes 1 and 3, persisting up to two years post-vaccination. Despite limitations related to sample size and assay sensitivity, our findings underscore the immunogenic potential of HEV239 and support a broader use in HEV-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "abstract": "In 2023, the VAS international working group on Buerger's Disease (BD) recommended two diagnostic criteria based on a prior Delphi study: \"definitive\" and \"suspected\". The \"definitive\" criteria are history of smoking, typical angiography, and typical histopathological features. All three features are mandatory to confirm a \"definitive\" diagnosis of BD. The conundrum is-what features should be considered typical of BD angiography? According to this review, segmental occlusion of infrapopliteal arteries, corkscrew collaterals that appear to continue the occluded arterial segment (Martorell's sign) or bypass the segmental occlusion, absence of atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm could differentiate BD from ASO. Hence, for \"typical\" BD angiography, these manifestations should certainly be considered. However, data for differentiating angiography patterns of BD from the small- and medium-sized vasculitis including Behcet's disease, scleroderma, hepatitis associated vasculitis, and anti-phospholipid syndrome are limited. Further studies for investigating the angiography pattern in BD patients in early and late presentation of BD, particularly in the patients with long-term follow up, are highly recommended.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this review is to identify which environmental toxicants are linked to infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by synthesizing available evidence. It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants. Findings advocate for reducing environmental pollution exposure in LMICs to mitigate infectious disease risk.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

        "abstract": "In February-March 2024, an outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice with multiple fatalities was reported in Goalpara District, Assam, India. This study aimed to identify the etiological agents responsible for the outbreak to guide public health interventions. Clinical samples from 30 individuals were collected and analyzed using serological and molecular techniques. Serological testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), and Leptospira was performed using IgM ELISA kits. Leptospira DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for further analysis. The results revealed HAV IgM antibodies in 23.33 % of cases (7/30), while 40 % (12/30) tested positive for Leptospira-specific IgM by ELISA. Additionally, PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Leptospira DNA in 53.33 % of the urine samples (8/15). Notably, 16.67 % (5/30) of cases exhibited coinfection with both HAV and Leptospira spp., challenging the clinical outcome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-positive samples identified Leptospira wolffii (L. wolffii) as the causative agent, marking the first report of L. wolffii in human clinical samples from Northeastern India. Recently, L. wolffii, a member of the P2 subclade of Leptospira, has garnered attention due to its pathogenic potential. The findings along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of L. wolffii and its likely introduction into the region, via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent. This study highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and research to monitor emerging Leptospira strains, particularly L. wolffii, in both human and animal populations, to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health implications.",

This retrospective observational study was conducted in a single tertiary care center from July 2023 to June 2024. The study was done among inpatients of the Department of Hepatology. About 30 Cases were recorded with confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma over this period. Among 30 patients, 53.33% of patients were above 60 years of age and 76.66% were HBsAg positive. 90.0% of patients were symptomatic among which abdominal pain was the most common. Features of cirrhosis with hepatomegaly were the main physical findings. Normal alpha-fetoprotein levels were in 13.33% of patients; 96.66% of patients were in advanced age where curative treatment was not feasible. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a significant concern. It is crucial to identify high-risk patients, which should lead to screening using both serum alpha-fetoprotein level and ultrasonography of the liver.

The burden is especially high in low-income regions, where early diagnosis and treatment are critical for mitigating its impact. This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) techniques in predicting patient outcomes in HBV infection. The Chi-squared test was used for feature selection to find the most important factors, which were later applied to train and evaluate various ML models. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the data. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were used to improve the models' interpretability. Among individual models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) each achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. By implementing a Voting Classifier that combined SVM and LR, the overall accuracy was improved to 95%. The results showed that higher levels of some risk factors, especially in older patients, greatly raise the risk of death.

This study investigated the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women and cord blood Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity of their newborns in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, and South Africa. Randomly selected paired maternal and cord blood samples (n = 101 each site) taken at delivery were tested for HBsAg and Hepatitis B extractable antigen (HBeAg) in the women using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Similarly, cord blood sample of newborn was assessed for HBsAg reactivity. HBV DNA was quantified using the Xpert® HBV viral load assay, followed by genotyping. The overall prevalence of maternal HBsAg positivity was 5.5 % (95 %CI: 0.4 %-7.1 %; n = 50/909). HBsAg positivity was higher in African countries (7.3 %; 95 %CI: 5.4 %-9.6 %; n = 44/606) compared to South Asian countries (2.0 %; 95 %CI: 0.8 %-4.3 %; n = 6/303; p = 0.002).

This study investigated the synergistic potential of two anthranilamide-based peptide mimics (RK610 and RK758) in combination, and one peptide mimic (RK610) in combination with the cationic peptides Mel4 and melimine, against murine hepatitis virus (a coronavirus; MHV-1), influenza virus (H1N1), and Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). Checkerboard assays demonstrated RK610+RK758 had synergy against MHV-1 and H1N1 (∑FICI values of 0.14 and 0.5, respectively), while RK610+Mel4 showed potent synergy against HSV-1 (∑FICI = 0.18). Co-treatment outperformed sequential application. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed structural damage to virions, while cytotoxicity assays indicated that all tested combinations were non-toxic in MDCK, A9, and Vero cells, except for melimine and RK610+melimine with A9 cells. Biophysical analyses using DOPC (100 %) and DOPC: POPS (70:30) lipids provided mechanistic ideas into peptide-mimic interactions with lipid envelopes. Tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs) in conjunction with electrical impedance spectroscopy revealed that both peptide mimics and their combinations reduced membrane conductance, regardless of lipid composition. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) revealed that RK610 and RK758 induced mass addition at the outer layer, significantly increasing with POPS. In DOPC, RK610 increased the surface pressure in a Langmuir-Blodgett trough while RK758 reduced it. The 610 + 758 and 610+Mel4 combinations raised maximum pressures. In DOPC + POPS, RK758 destabilized the monolayer (35 mN/m, no plateau), whereas combinations restored stability. These findings highlight peptide mimics as broad-spectrum antiviral agents that show synergy to target viral envelopes, paving the way for safer and low-resistance therapeutics.",

Limited data have shown unusually high HCV seroprevalence among Rohingya refugees residing in camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HCV seropositivity and active infection and identify risk factors to inform the HCV response. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 10 and June 14, 2023, in adult (≥18 years) residents of seven camps in Cox's Bazar. Households were selected by simple random geosampling and one participant per household was selected at random. Participants were screened for HCV antibodies with a rapid finger prick blood test and, if seropositive, venous samples were tested for HCV viral load. A structured questionnaire collected information about demographics, HCV knowledge, and exposure risks. Survey-adjusted prevalence estimates of HCV seropositivity and active infection were generated by applying sampling weights. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity were identified using univariable and multivariable current status analysis and those associated with active infection via logistic regression. The survey included 641 participants, of whom 425 (66%) were women and for whom the median age was 34 years (IQR 28-46). 191 individuals tested positive for HCV antibodies. 187 of these individuals were tested for active infection and 124 had a detectable HCV viral load. The survey-adjusted prevalence estimate of HCV seropositivity was 30·4% (95% CI 26·5-34·5), and that of active infection 19·8% (95% CI 16·5-23·4). Current status analysis identified higher odds of HCV seropositivity among individuals reporting medical injection(s) (adjusted odds ratio 1·8 [95% CI 1·2-2·8]) or surgery (5·9 [1·9-18·4]), and among women (2·1 [1·3-3·2]). 328 (51%) of 641 participants had never heard of hepatitis C. Five (4%) of 124 participants with HCV viraemia reported previous HCV treatment. There is a substantial burden of active HCV infection among adult Rohingya camp residents, highlighting the urgent need to scale up testing and treatment capacities. The survey had constraints in identifying risk factors and could not provide data on HCV incidence. Reassessing infection prevalence after mass interventions and prospective surveillance are recommended to monitor ongoing transmission. A well-concerted multi-stakeholder action plan is needed to prevent future large-scale burden of severe liver disease and halt ongoing transmission. Médecins Sans Frontières.",

A better understanding of how ROS contributes to viral pathogenesis is critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on ROS production and its effects across various viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, influenza A virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus infections, to improve future therapeutic and preventive strategies for these infections.",

While hepatic complications are well-documented, extra-hepatic manifestations such as secondary amyloidosis are less common and can lead to diverse and complex clinical outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 60-year-old male with a history of chronic hepatitis B who progressed to liver cirrhosis and presented with chronic, unexplained, intractable diarrhea unresponsive to standard treatments. He also experienced significant unintentional weight loss and generalized weakness. Further investigations revealed amyloid deposition in the duodenum, confirming secondary amyloidosis affecting the gastrointestinal tract as the cause of malabsorption. Persistent diarrhea and malabsorption necessitated nutritional support and symptomatic management. This case highlights the rare association between chronic liver disease (CLD), secondary amyloidosis, and malabsorption syndrome, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial to managing these complex cases, improving outcomes, and preventing further complications.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis is a widespread inflammatory condition of the liver, presenting a formidable global health challenge. Accurate and timely detection of hepatitis is crucial for effective patient management, yet existing methods exhibit limitations that underscore the need for innovative approaches. Early-stage detection of hepatitis is now possible with the recent adoption of machine learning and deep learning approaches. With this in mind, the study investigates the use of traditional machine learning models, specifically classifiers such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forest, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and other models, to predict hepatitis infections. After extensive data preprocessing including outlier detection, dataset balancing, and feature engineering, we evaluated the performance of these models. We explored three modeling approaches: machine learning with default hyperparameters, hyperparameter-tuned models using GridSearchCV, and ensemble modeling techniques. The SVM model demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving 99.25% accuracy and a perfect AUC score of 1.00 with consistency in other metrics with 99.27% precision, and 99.24% for both recall and F1-measure. The MLP and Random Forest proved to be in pace with the superior performance of SVM exhibiting an accuracy of 99.00%. To ensure robustness, we employed a 5-fold cross-validation technique. For deeper insight into model interpretability and validation, we employed an explainability analysis of our best-performed models to identify the most effective feature for hepatitis detection. Our proposed model, particularly SVM, exhibits better prediction performance regarding different performance metrics compared to existing literature.",

Vaccination against Hepatitis B is an effective means of prevention. However, studies have reported variable vaccination rates among medical students from different regions of South Asia. Understanding vaccination rates and barriers can guide effective interventions to protect future doctors. Therefore, we aimed to find out the vaccination rate among medical students in South Asia. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and other sources) beginning from inception to July 15, 2024. Observational studies reporting vaccination rates among Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.) students in South Asia were included. Two reviewers independently screened and performed the quality assessment. Pooled vaccination rates were calculated and visualized using a random-effects model in R Studio (Version 2023.12.0). Subgroup analysis was performed based on country and year of publication of the studies. Fifty studies from the South Asian region, including 12,231 participants, were included in the quantitative analysis. The overall pooled Hepatitis B vaccination rate using the random-effects model was 56% (CI: 49-63%), with significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 98%; P = 0). Subgroup analysis based on country revealed a significant regional variation in vaccination rate (59% in Pakistan, 57% in India, 55% in Nepal, and 41% in Bangladesh; P < 0.01). Lack of awareness, perceived low risk or necessity, concerns about side effects, logistical challenges, and lack of motivation have been reported as barriers to vaccination. The overall vaccination rate was relatively low in South Asia, with significant regional variation. Based on the reported barriers, we recommend that relevant authorities focus on vaccination awareness, motivation, cost-effectiveness, logistics management, policy formulation, and monitoring.",

Understanding the burden of AHE in this region is crucial for targeted interventions. We used Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data to assess the burden of AHE across eight South Asian countries from 1990 to 2021. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze temporal trends and Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify trends. The relationship between age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) and socio-demographic index (SDI) was assessed using smoothing spline model and Spearman rank correlation. Rates are expressed per 100,000 population. Bangladesh had highest age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) [33.27 (95 % Uncertainty Interval: 27.64 to 39.95)] and age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) [433.01 (359.61 to 519.76)], while India had highest ASDR [9.52 (4.33 to 18.42)]. Males had higher ASIR and ASPR than females in most South Asian countries, except Bhutan and India, and higher ASDR except in Nepal and Pakistan. Bhutan had the highest EAPC for both sexes in ASPR and ASIR, while India had the highest EAPC in ASDR, closely followed by Bhutan for both sexes. Age group 5-9 had the highest ASPR and ASIR whereas <1-year age group had the highest ASDR. There was an inverse relationship between ASDR and SDI (R = -0.49, p < 0.01). South Asia bears a high burden of AHE, with variations across countries. Improvements in Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services are needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 6.",

Recently, we reported that there are distinct virological and clinical profiles between chronic patients with subgenotype C2 with the rt269I polymorphism and those with the rt269L polymorphism, with the latter being more closely related to liver disease severity. This study explored the phylogenetic and geographic distributions, as well as the mutation frequencies, of precore (T1858C/G1896A) and basal core promoter (BCP) (A1762T/G1764A) mutations between these two types within the HBV subgenotype C1. Analysis of 408 HBV/C1 full-genome sequences from GenBank revealed clear phylogenetic separation between rt269L and rt269I in subgenotype C1. Geographically, rt269I strains within subgenotype C1 are predominant in Southwest Asia (e.g., Thailand and Bangladesh), whereas rt269L strains are more common in East Asia and Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam, China, and Hong Kong). Notably, compared with rt269L in subgenotype C2, rt269I presented higher frequencies of the C1858 and BCP mutations but lower frequencies of the G1896A mutation. These findings suggest significantly distinct phylogeographic and mutational characteristics of the rt269L and rt269I types of subgenotype C1, impacting clinical outcomes and evolutionary trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in many resource-poor countries. Despite an available vaccine, data on HEV-associated mortality are scarce, hindering informed decisions. This study aims to estimate the population-based rate of HEV-specific mortality in Bangladesh. During December 2014 to September 2017, we conducted surveillance in 6 tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Patients aged ≥14 years with acute jaundice were recruited, tested for IgM anti-HEV, and followed up postdischarge. A mortality survey in the hospital catchment areas identified deaths associated with acute jaundice, including maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths delivered by a mother with acute jaundice during pregnancy, as confirmed by 2 independent physicians reviewing verbal autopsy data. Out of 1925 patients with acute jaundice enrolled in the surveillance hospitals, 302 died, with 28 (9%) testing positive for IgM anti-HEV. In the hospital catchment areas, the team identified 587 jaundice-associated deaths, including 25 maternal deaths. Combining hospital-based surveillance and mortality survey data, the study estimated 986 (95% CI, 599-1338) HEV-associated deaths annually among individuals aged ≥14 years in Bangladesh, including 163 (95% CI, 57-395) maternal deaths. Additionally, 279 (95% CI, 101-664) stillbirths and 780 (95% CI, 365-1297) neonatal deaths were attributed to HEV infection annually. Prior Global Burden of Disease studies presented wildly varying modeling estimates of HEV-associated annual deaths, ranging from 50 000 in 2013 to 1932 in 2019. This study is the first to directly measure population-based estimates of mortality in Bangladesh, which can be used to determine the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis E vaccination and other interventions.",

        "abstract": "T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, <i>LAG-3</i>, <i>PDCD1</i>, <i>TIGIT</i>, <i>HAVCR2</i>, <i>CXCL13</i>, and <i>LAYN</i> was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients' survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.",

Age-standardised rates per 100,000 population for prevalence, annual incidence and YLDs were compared across regions and countries, as well as the socio-demographic index (SDI). Trends were expressed as percentage changes (PC) and estimates were reported with uncertainty intervals (UI). Globally, in 2021, the age-standardised rates per 100,000 population for the prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, MASLD and cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were 3583.6 (95%UI 3293.6-3887.7), 1717.8 (1385.5-2075.3), 15018.1 (13756.5-16361.4) and 20302.6 (18845.2-21791.9) respectively. From 2010 to 2021, the PC in age-standardised prevalence rates were-20.4% for hepatitis B, -5.1% for hepatitis C, +11.2% for MASLD and + 2.6% for cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases. Over the same period, the PC in age-standardized incidence rates were -24.7%, -6.8%, +3.2%, and +3.0%, respectively. Generally, negative associations, but with fluctuations, were found between age-standardised prevalence rates for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and the SDI at a global level. However, MASLD prevalence peaked at moderate SDI levels. The global burden of chronic liver diseases remains substantial. Hepatitis B and C have decreased in prevalence and incidence in the last decade, while MASLD, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases have increased, necessitating targeted public health strategies and resource allocation.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health issue with limited therapeutic options given the persistence of viral episomal DNA (cccDNA). Previously, we investigated the effects of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vector-mediated delivery of three guide (g)RNAs/Cas9 selected from 16 gRNAs. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 effectively suppressed HBV replication in vitro and in humanized chimeric mouse livers. In the present study, we examined the effect of AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 on the acute phase of HBV genotype F infection in an immunocompetent northern tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri; hereafter, \"tupaia\") model. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treatment significantly reduced the HBV viral load in serum at 1, 7, 10, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). HBV-F infection caused enlargement of hepatocytes and mild lymphocytic infiltration in the interlobular connective tissue. Thus, the virus damages hepatocytes and drives infection progression and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) accumulation, which were not observed in AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treated and normal liver tissues. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treatment reduced HBV DNA and cccDNA in liver tissues, as well as serum levels of HBV surface antigen and HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), including HBcAg and HBeAg at 14 dpi. Anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and anti-AAV Abs production was also detected. AAV2/WJ11-Cas9 treatment suppressed inflammatory cytokines and TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, and TLR9 mRNA levels. Thus, WJ11/Cas9 delivered by AAV2 vectors may provide a new therapeutic approach for inhibiting HBV infection in immunocompetent animal models, which could be developed for use in humans through further translational research.",

        "abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition associated with high mortality in the absence of liver transplantation. There have been various definitions proposed worldwide. The first consensus report of the working party of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) set in 2004 on ACLF was published in 2009, and the \"APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC)\" was formed in 2012. The AARC database has prospectively collected nearly 10,500 cases of ACLF from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. This database has been instrumental in developing the AARC score and grade of ACLF, the concept of the 'Golden Therapeutic Window', the 'transplant window', and plasmapheresis as a treatment modality. Also, the data has been key to identifying pediatric ACLF. The European Association for the Study of Liver-Chronic Liver Failure (EASL CLIF) and the North American Association for the Study of the End Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) from the West added the concepts of organ failure and infection as precipitants for the development of ACLF and CLIF-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and NACSELD scores for prognostication. The Chinese Group on the Study of Severe Hepatitis B (COSSH) added COSSH-ACLF criteria to manage hepatitis b virus-ACLF with and without cirrhosis. The literature supports these definitions to be equally effective in their respective cohorts in identifying patients with high mortality. To overcome the differences and to develop a global consensus, APASL took the initiative and invited the global stakeholders, including opinion leaders from Asia, EASL and AASLD, and other researchers in the field of ACLF to identify the key issues and develop an evidence-based consensus document. The consensus document was presented in a hybrid format at the APASL annual meeting in Kyoto in March 2024. The 'Kyoto APASL Consensus' presented below carries the final recommendations along with the relevant background information and areas requiring future studies.",

        "abstract": "<i>Houttuynia cordata</i> Thunb. holds a longstanding reputation as a traditional folk remedy in East Asia, where it has been employed to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, nephritis, hepatitis and cancer. Despite its extensive use, there exists a paucity of research examining its efficacy in managing thyroid disorders and diabetes. Moreover, the bioactive components responsible for modulating the molecular pathways remain elusive. This research aimed to determine the key bioactive components in the ethanolic extract of <i>H. cordata</i> Thunb. (HCEE) responsible for its thyroid-modifying properties and examine its effects on rats with experimentally induced hypothyroidism and diabetes. Molecular docking was performed to investigate the possible mechanisms of thyroid regulation of HCEE constituents. Researchers induced hypothyroidism in rats by adding 6-propyl-2-thiouracil to their drinking water for a period of four weeks. To induce diabetes, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The animals were then given daily oral doses of HCEE (500 mg/kg b.w.), levothyroxine (50 mg/kg b.w.), or glibenclamide (5 mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days. Following this treatment, standard methods were employed to measure biochemical parameters in the rats' serum. The results demonstrate that HCEE ameliorated hypothyroidism by increasing serum T3 (14.38%) and T4 (125.96%) levels and decreasing TSH (<i>p</i> < 0.01; -41.75%) levels. In diabetic rats with induced hypothyroidism, HCEE significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001) increased T3 (149.51%) and T4 (73.54%) levels with reduced TSH (-64.39%) levels. In silico analysis demonstrated that the identified bioactive compounds from HCEE may enhance thyroid hormone function through interaction with the thyroid hormone receptor protein TRβ1 (PDB:3GWS), similar to the conventional pharmaceuticals levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3). HCEE exhibits potential as a natural alternative to synthetic medications in the prevention and treatment of thyroid dysfunctions.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge in mitigating waterborne diseases risk exacerbated by climate change. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of these diseases at the district level remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern and identifying the best tree-based ML models for determining the meteorological factors associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh. This study used district-level reported cases of waterborne diseases (cholera, amoebiasis, typhoid and hepatitis A) obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) sourced from NASA for the period spanning 2017 to 2020. Exploratory spatial analysis, spatial regression and tree-based machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 and 2020, Bangladesh reported 73, 606 cholera, 38, 472 typhoid, 2, 510 hepatitis A and 1, 643 amoebiasis disease cases. Among the waterborne diseases cholera showed higher incidence rates in Chapai-Nawabganj (456.23), Brahmanbaria (417.44), Faridpur (225.07), Nilphamari (188.62) and Pirojpur (171.62) districts. The spatial regression model identified mean temperature (β = 12.16, s.e: 3.91) as the significant risk factor of waterborne diseases. The optimal XGBoost model highlighted mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation as determinants associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2020. The findings from the study, incorporating the One Health perspective, provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat waterborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries. Precautionary measures and intensified surveillance need to be implemented in certain high-risk districts for waterborne diseases across the country.",

Herein, we present Japan's experience in training medical coordinators to combat NCDs, with a focus on hepatitis, early-onset dementia, and children with medical complexity. Coordinators play an important role in bridging the gap between patients and healthcare services. We examined the training and roles of the coordinators. In the Japanese model, medical coordinators, including both medical and non-medical personnel, have successfully strengthened the delivery of healthcare services for specific diseases. However, challenges persist, including the uneven distribution of coordinators, inconsistencies in training programs, the program's relatively recent establishment, and limited awareness of coordinators' roles and activities. Training medical coordinators can strengthen comprehensive patient support in managing NCDs. Despite its limitations, this model provides valuable insights for developing interventional strategies in other Asian countries facing similar medical human resource shortages. Collaboration among governments, hospitals, and related organisations in training coordinators holds promise in addressing the growing prevalence of NCDs in these regions.",

        "abstract": "Cholestatic jaundice is a potentially serious condition that requires early diagnosis for proper management. Fat-soluble vitamin (FSV) deficiency develops as a consequence of cholestasis. Vitamin D deficiency is common and remains a challenge in patients with cholestasis. Objectives of the study were to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in infants with cholestatic jaundice. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2017 to June 2018 on purposively sampled infants. Infants who developed jaundice before three months of age, had direct bilirubin of more than 20.0% of the total bilirubin if total bilirubin is ≥5 mg/dl or more than 1.0 mg/dl if total bilirubin is <5 mg/dl, with pale stool and dark urine were included as cases while infants who visited hospital with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease and acute viral infection but no evidence of liver, gastrointestinal disease or renal disease checked by means of medical history, physical examination and a review of medical records were included as controls. Blood was collected from patients with cholestatic liver disease for liver biochemistries, prothrombin time, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium. Blood was also collected from controls for 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <15, 15 to 20 and >20 ng/ml were defined as vitamin D \"deficiency\", \"insufficiency\" and \"sufficiency\" respectively. Thirty patients and 30 controls were evaluated. Mean age in cases and controls were 113.43±74.08 and 145.50±88.62 days respectively (p=0.134). Biliary atresia was found to be the commonest cause, 18(60.0%), followed by idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) 7(23.3%), choledochal cyst 4(13.3%) and 1 case of neonatal hepatitis (NH) due to CMV infection. The mean serum bilirubin (total) was 12.07±3.92 mg/dl, mean serum bilirubin (direct) 6.51±2.03 mg/dl, serum ALT 130.7±67.81 U/L, serum AST 135.07±52.54 U/L, prothrombin time 17.36±11.88 seconds, serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 700.3±555.89 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 560.37±283.12 U/L and serum albumin was 3.6±0.4 gm/dl. Mean serum calcium was 9.18±0.84 mg/dl. Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in cholestatic patients was 14.7±5.75 ng/ml, compared to 27.68±10.44 ng/ml in controls (p=0.001). Vitamin D deficiency was found in 43.3% patients. The correlation between age at presentation and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was not significant (r = 0.051; p = 0.784). Statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.389; p=0.034) was found between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Serum calcium was found to have statistically significant positive correlation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r=0.692; p=0.001). Blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with cholestasis were lower than those of controls. So, adequate vitamin D supplementation and monitoring in this population is of great importance.",

The risk of transmission is more common among health care personnels and medical students during their professional health trainings. Vaccination is the most effective means of prevention. The main objective of this study was to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding Hepatitis B and vaccination among pre-clinical students in a medical college. A web-based, single-center, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among pre-clinical medical students in Bangladesh from April 28, 2024, to May 4, 2024. The whole sampling technique method was used taking the entire population for our study. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed using JMP Pro V17 Statistical Software. Sixty-one (34%) students were vaccinated against Hepatitis B, of whom 18% received all three doses with a booster dose. The most common reason for non-vaccination was lack of awareness of one's vaccination status (43%). The median knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores were 54 (50-60), 19 (17-21) and 20 (19-23) respectively, and they were moderately positively correlated. Forty-six (25.98%) students had a good overall KAP score (≥ 102). Only one-third of the students had been vaccinated, and the commonest reason for non-vaccination was lack of awareness of one's vaccination status. Nearly one-fourth of the participants had good knowledge, attitude, and practice related to Hepatitis B. Therefore, education regarding Hepatitis B infection, risk factors, and importance of vaccination is a must among pre-clinical medical students in Bangladesh.",

Clinically, the major unmet needs are recurrence after curative-intent surgery, liver transplantation or local ablation and disease progression in those with hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for resection or failed locoregional therapy. In the recent few years, new targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors have been registered as systemic therapy to address these issues. Notably, new forms of systemic therapy, either as first-line or second-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular or those not eligible for locoregional therapy, are now available. New data is also emerging with the use of systemic therapy to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after curative-intent resection or local ablation therapy and to retard disease progression after locoregional therapy. In the future, further implementation of immune-checkpoint inhibitors and other forms of immunotherapy are expected to bring a new paradigm to the management of hepatocellular carcinoma. New insight related to immune-related adverse events with the use of immunotherapy has allso enabled optimization of the therapeutic approach to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide an up-to-date recommendation based on clinical evidence and experience from expert Asia-Pacific key opinion leaders in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma. Three key questions will be addressed, namely: (1) Which patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered for systemic therapy? (2) Which systemic therapy should be used? (3) How should a patient planned for immune checkpoint-based systemic therapy be managed and monitored?",

This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

Improved diagnostic accuracy can drastically influence patient outcomes, emphasizing the need for innovative, non-invasive biomarkers. This study utilized a cohort of 402 participants, including healthy controls, chronic hepatitis patients, and HCC patients from Bangladesh, to evaluate DNA methylation signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We performed targeted next-generation sequencing on selected genes previously identified to assess their methylation dynamics. The development of M8 and M4 scores was based on these dynamics, using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine their effectiveness in detecting early-stage HCC alongside existing markers such as epiLiver and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Integration of M8 and M4 scores with epiLiver and AFP significantly enhances diagnostic sensitivity for early-stage HCC. The M4+epiLiver score achieves a sensitivity of 79.4% in Stage A HCC, while combining M4 with AFP increases sensitivity to 88.2-95.7% across all stages, indicating a superior diagnostic performance compared to each marker used alone. Our study confirms that combining gene methylation profiles with established diagnostic markers substantially improves the sensitivity of detecting early-stage HCC. This integrated diagnostic approach holds promise for advancing non-invasive cancer diagnostics, potentially leading to earlier treatment interventions and improved survival rates for high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

        "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection affects the hepatic, neurologic, hematopoietic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other organs, resulting in a high mortality rate and long-term sequelae. It may cause acute or chronic hepatitis, or even lead to hepatic cirrhosis. Valganciclovir (VGCV) is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for congenital CMV infection, without any serious adverse effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical, biochemical, and virological profiles of infants with CMV with intrahepatic cholestasis and to determine the outcomes with or without treatment with VGCV. Twenty infants aged <6 months diagnosed with congenital CMV infection with evidence of intrahepatic cholestasis were included in this study. Randomization was used to divide the study participants into 2 groups. The control group (n=10) was treated with only supportive management, and the intervention group (n=10) was treated with oral VGCV at 16 mg/kg/dose 12 hours a day for 6 weeks plus supportive treatments. Physical examinations and biochemical, serological, and virological tests were performed at the time of diagnosis and at the end of 6 weeks and 6 months. The control and intervention groups were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory parameters such as jaundice, dark urine, pale stool, hepatomegaly, total bilirubin, aminotransferases, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and CMV polymerase chain reaction load, which showed a significant reduction after treatment in the intervention group (<i>p</i><0.05) with oral VGCV, with very few side effects, whereas the control group showed no significant changes. Oral VGCV can be used to effectively treat CMV infection with intrahepatic cholestasis without notable side effects.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV), resistant to several antiviral drugs due to viral genomic mutations, has been reported, which aggravates chronic infection and leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, host cellular factors/signaling modulation might be an alternative way of treatment for drug-resistant HBV. Here, we investigated the viral protein expression, replication, and virion production using endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-modulating chemicals, tunicamycin (an ER-stress inducer), and salubrinal (an ER-stress inhibitor). We found that ER-stress could be induced by HBV replication in transfected HepG2 cells as well as by tunicamycin as demonstrated by dual luciferase assay. HBV intracellular core-associated DNA quantified by qPCR has been significantly increased by tunicamycin in transfected HepG2 cells. Inversely, intracellular core associated and extracellular particle DNA has been significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in salubrinal-treated HepG2 cells transfected with HBV-replicating plasmid pHBI. Similar results were found in stably HBV-expressing hepatoblastoma (HB611) cells treated with salubrinal. However, increased or decreased ER-stress by tunicamycin or salubrinal treatment, respectively, has been confirmed by expression analysis of grp78 using Western blot. In addition, Western blot results demonstrated that the expression of HBV core protein and large HBsAg is increased and decreased by tunicamycin and salubrinal, respectively. In conclusion, the sal-mediated inhibition of the HBV replication and virion production might be due to the simultaneous reduction of core and large HBsAg expression and maintaining the ER homeostasis. These results of HBV replication regulation by modulation of ER-stress dynamics would be useful for designing/identifying anti-HBV drugs targeting cellular signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "The people who inject drugs (PWID) are attributed to high-risk groups for transmission of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study assessed the prevalence and associated factors of current HCV infection (CHI) among U.S. general population and PWID of ages between 20 and 59 years old. This study utilized cross-sectional data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducting separate analyses for the U.S. general population, including PWID and non-PWID, as well as specific analyses focusing solely on PWID. The analytical methods included the estimation of CHI prevalence, Rao-Scott chi-square test to compare CHI-positive and CHI-negative groups, and univariate and multivariable logistic regressions models to evaluate the associated risk factors of CHI. The prevalence of CHI among general population and PWID were 1% and 19%, respectively. Compared to non-PWID, the odds of CHI were significantly higher among PWID (OR = 32.6, 95% CI = 17.7-60.3) in general population. Among PWID, male vs. female (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-5.9), adults aged 40-59 vs. 20-39 years old (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.2-7.3), Non-Hispanic Black vs. White (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 1.5-13.6), with high school diploma or less educational attainment vs. above college degree (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.4-9.2) showed higher odds of having CHI. The prevalence of CHI was found to be higher among PWID especially those who were male, aged 40-59 years old, Non-Hispanic Black, and had lower educational attainment. Targeted intervention such as screening and awareness program among PWID population is recommended to reduce the burden of new HCV infections in the U.S.",

Several studies have shown the association of microRNA (miRNA) in the progression of CLD in regulating cell proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis as well as in carcinogenesis. <b>Objectives:</b> The study was aimed at determining the expression of miRNA-221 among different stages of fibrosis in CLD patients due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and thus evaluate its role as an early biomarker in CLD. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 100 participants (75 CLD patients and 25 healthy control) were recruited in this cross-sectional study and divided into four groups, of which 25 as healthy control, 25 in CLD without fibrosis, 25 were CLD with fibrosis, and 25 were CLD with cirrhosis. Total RNA was extracted from plasma followed by cDNA synthesis, and finally, the expression of miRNA-221 was analyzed for its diagnostic potential as a single biomarker using the qRT-PCR method. <b>Results:</b> The plasma level of miRNA-221 was significantly upregulated in different fibrosis stages of CLD (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and this upregulation was positively correlated with the progression of fibrosis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Significantly increased expression of miRNA-221 was found in NAFLD patients compared to HBV patients in the CLD without fibrosis patient group (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while expression of miRNA-221 was significantly upregulated among HBV patients in the CLD with the fibrosis group. miRNA-221 showed high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating different stages of fibrosis from healthy control (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> miRNA-221 may be used as a potential plasma biomarker for early prediction of fibrosis progression in CLD patients.",

        "abstract": "This immunoinformatic study identified potential epitopes from the envelopment polyprotein (Gn/Gc) of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a pathogenic virus causing severe fever in humans and livestock. Effective vaccination is crucial for controlling RVFV outbreaks. The identification of suitable epitopes is crucial for the development of safe and effective vaccines. Protein sequences were obtained from the UniProt database, and evaluated through VaxiJen v2.0 to predict the B and T-cell epitopes within the RVFV glycoprotein. Gn/Gc protein sequences were analyzed with bioinformatics tools and algorithms. The predicted T-cell and B-cell epitopes were evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity by the VaxiJen v2.0 system, AllerTop v2.0, and ToxinPred server, respectively. We employed computational methods to screen the RVFV envelopment polyprotein encompassing N-terminal and C-terminal glycoprotein segments, to discover antigenic T- and B-cell epitopes. Our analysis unveiled multiple potential epitopes within the RVFV glycoprotein, specifically within the Gn/Gc protein sequences. Subsequently, we selected eleven cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and four helper T-lymphocytes (HTL) for population coverage analysis, which collectively extended to cover 97.04% of the world's population, representing diverse ethnicities and regions. Notably, the CTL epitope VQADLTLMF exhibited binding affinity to numerous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. The identification of glycoprotein (Gn/Gc) epitopes through this immunoinformatic study bears significant implications for advancing the development of an effective RVFV vaccine. These findings provide valuable insights into the immunological aspects of the disease and may contribute towards the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies targeting other RNA viruses with similar polymerase enzymes.",

        "abstract": "Vaccination constitutes an attractive control measure for hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality globally. Analysis of pregnant participants in an effectiveness trial of the HEV vaccine HEV239 showed possible HEV239-associated fetal losses. We aimed to conduct a detailed analysis of this safety signal. In a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial, 67 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomly allocated (1:1) to two vaccine groups, in which non-pregnant women aged 16-39 years received either HEV239 (HEV239 group) or Hepa-B (a hepatitis B vaccine; control group). We implemented weekly surveillance for pregnancy detection, and follow-up of pregnancies once every 2 weeks, using physician-confirmed diagnoses to evaluate fetal loss outcomes (miscarriage [spontaneous abortion], stillbirth, and elective termination). Data from a parallel system of reproductive health surveillance in Matlab were used to clarify study diagnoses when necessary. Miscarriage was assessed only among participants whose first positive pregnancy test and vaccination date (for whichever dose was closest to the date of last menstrual period [LMP]) were before 20 weeks' gestation. We defined the following analysis periods of interest: from 90 days before the LMP until the pregnancy outcome (the proximal period); from the LMP date until the pregnancy outcome (the pregnancy period); from 90 days before the LMP until the LMP date (90 days pre-LMP period); and from enrolment until 90 days before the LMP (the distal period). Both Poisson and Cox regression models were used to assess the associations between receipt of HEV239 and fetal loss outcomes. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02759991). Among the 19 460 non-pregnant participants enrolled in the trial, 5011 were identified as having pregnancies within 2 years following vaccination and met the criteria for analysis (2407 in the HEV239 group and 2604 in the control group). Among participants vaccinated in the proximal period and evaluated for miscarriage, miscarriage occurred in 54 (8·9%) of 607 in the HEV239 group and 32 (4·5%) of 719 in the control group (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 2·0 [95% CI 1·3-3·1], p=0·0009). Similarly, the risk of miscarriages was increased in the HEV239 group versus the control group among participants inadvertently vaccinated during pregnancy (22 [10·5%] miscarriages among 209 participants in the HEV239 group vs 14 [5·3%] of 266 in the control group; aRR 2·1 [95% CI 1·1-4·1], p=0·036) and among those vaccinated within 90 days pre-LMP (32 [8·0%] of 398 vs 18 [4·0%] of 453; 1·9 [1·1-3·2], p=0·013). No increased risk of miscarriage was observed in those who received HEV239 in the distal period (93 [5·6%] of 1647 vs 80 [4·5%] of 1773; 1·3 [0·8-1·9], p=0·295). Stillbirth and elective termination showed no increased risk among women administered HEV239 versus those administered Hepa-B in any of the analysis periods. HEV239 given shortly before or during pregnancy was associated with an elevated risk of miscarriage. This association poses a possible safety concern for programmatic use of HEV239 in women of childbearing age. Research Council of Norway and Innovax.",

We aimed to evaluate the safety of a HEV vaccine and its effectiveness in preventing hepatitis E during pregnancy. In this phase 4, double-blind, cluster-randomised trial, 67 villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, were randomised 1:1 to receive HEV239 (a recombinant HEV vaccine) or a control vaccine (Hepa-B, a hepatitis B vaccine), using block randomisation with random number tables and blocks of size eight, stratified by cluster population size. Eligible non-pregnant women (aged 16-39 years) were vaccinated intramuscularly on day 0, at 1 month, and at 6 months, and followed up for 2 years after the last immunisation. The primary endpoint was hepatitis E in the pregnant, per-protocol population (those who received all three doses within 2 days of the scheduled dates), while safety was a secondary endpoint, assessed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (participants who received at least one dose). Solicited adverse events were recorded for the first 7 days after each dose, and unsolicited events until 2 years after a participant's final dose. Pregnancy-related safety outcomes were assessed in the pregnant ITT population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02759991). Between Oct 2, 2017, and Feb 28, 2019, 19 460 participants were enrolled and received either HEV239 (9478 [48·7%] participants, 33 clusters) or Hepa-B (9982 [51·3%] participants, 34 clusters), of whom 17 937 (92·2%) participants received three doses and 17 613 (90·5%) were vaccinated according to protocol (8524 [48·4%] in the HEV239 group and 9089 [51·6%] in the control group). No pregnant participants were confirmed to have hepatitis E in either treatment group. HEV239 showed a mild safety profile, similar to Hepa-B, with no difference in the proportion of solicited adverse events between groups and no severe solicited events. Pain was the most common local symptom (1215 [12·8%] HEV239 recipients and 1218 [12·2%] Hepa-B recipients) and fever the most common systemic symptom (141 [1·5%] HEV239 recipients and 145 [1·5%] Hepa-B recipients). None of the serious adverse events or deaths were vaccine related. Among pregnant participants, the HEV239 group had a higher risk of miscarriage (136 [5·7%] of 2407 pregnant participants) compared with the control group (102 [3·9%] of 2604; adjusted odds ratio 1·54 [95% CI 1·15-2·08]). The effectiveness of HEV239 in pregnant women remains uncertain. HEV239 was safe and well tolerated in non-pregnant women, but findings regarding miscarriage warrant further investigation.

        "abstract": "The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and its complication, MAFLD-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (MAFLD-ACLF), is rising. Yet, factors determining patient outcomes in MAFLD-ACLF remain understudied. Patients with MAFLD-ACLF were recruited from the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver-ACLF Research Consortium (AARC registry). The diagnosis of MAFLD-ACLF was made when the treating unit had identified the etiology of chronic liver disease as MAFLD (or previous nomenclature such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-cirrhosis). Patients with coexisting other etiologies of chronic liver disease (such as alcohol, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, etc.) were excluded. Data were randomly split into derivation (n = 258) and validation (n = 111) cohorts at a 70:30 ratio. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Only the baseline clinical, laboratory features and severity scores were considered. The derivation group had 258 patients; 60% were male, with a mean age of 53. Diabetes was noted in 27% and hypertension in 29%. The dominant precipitants included viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus and hepatitis E virus, 32%), drug-induced injury (drug-induced liver injury, 29%), and sepsis (23%). Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) and AARC scores on admission averaged 32 ± 6 and 10.4 ± 1.9. At 90 days, 51% survived. Nonviral precipitant, diabetes, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and encephalopathy were independent factors influencing mortality. Adding diabetes and precipitant to MELD-Na and AARC scores, the novel MAFLD-MELD-Na score (+12 for diabetes, +12 for nonviral precipitant), and MAFLD-AARC score (+5 for each) were formed. These outperformed the standard scores in both cohorts. Almost half of patients with MAFLD-ACLF die within 90 days. Diabetes and nonviral precipitants such as drug-induced liver injury and sepsis lead to adverse outcomes. The new MAFLD-MELD-Na and MAFLD-AARC scores provide reliable 90-day mortality predictions for patients with MAFLD-ACLF.",

        "abstract": "Afghan refugees child labourers face many challenges as they are labelled as refugees. In an attempt to explore these challenges, the present study was conducted in Tehran with a qualitative approach. The present qualitative research was conducted using a conventional content analysis approach with 25 Afghan child labourers in 2022 in Tehran. Child labourers were selected through purposive and snowball sampling and interviewed in a semi-in-depth interview. The data were analysed based on Granheim and Lundman's criteria, as well as those of Guba and Lincoln, to further enrich the findings. A total of 3 categories, 13 sub-categories, and 183 initial codes were extracted from the data analysis, including: \"psychological challenges\" (history of harassment and abuse, negative effects, high-risk behaviours, and family detachment); \"health challenges\" (physical problems, inappropriate accommodation, medical/therapeutic problems, and health threats); and \"social challenges\" (neglected childhood, dual identity, educational limitations, inadequate social support, social isolation, and social humiliation). At the individual level, it is possible to meet the child labourers' health needs and make them aware of the hazards of working in the streets through physical examination at certain intervals and holding training workshops on harassment prevention, anger control, prevention of high-risk behaviours, prevention of infectious diseases such as hepatitis, and strengthening self-confidence to improve health. Also, the Afghan child labourers' work could be intervened at the social and familial level by providing accommodation in more suitable neighbourhoods, providing health insurance for child labourers, creating the chances of studying in schools, preventing dropouts, and strengthening social relations in order to improve children's health.",

        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

Anti viral therapy should be started as soon as possible in the ACLF patients at presentation while waiting for confirmation by HBV DNA level. This randomized controlled trial was carried out at the Department of Hepatology, BSMMU, Bangladesh from September 2019 to august 2020 with Hepatitis B virus related ACLF patient. This trial was conducted among twenty seven HBV acute on chronic liver failure patient to compare Child Turcotte pugh (CTP) score, Model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score, Asia Pacific Association for study of Liver (APASL) ACLF Research consortium (AARC) score, survival of the patients and HBV DNA level at 3 months with antiviral therapy between tenofovir alafenamide (25mg) and entecavir (0.5mg) group. CTP score, MELD score and AARC score were significantly (p<0.05) decline from baseline to all subsequent follow-up at 1st (at 7 days), 2nd (at 14 days), 3rd (at 30 days) and 4th (at 90 days) in each group but non significant (p>0.05) difference occurred between two group. All twenty seven patients had detectable HBV DNA level at pre-treatment and all survived patients became undectable at 4th, 90 days follow-up. Total 10 patients (37.07%) were survived at 90 days follow-up, out of them seven patients (70.0%) were in tenofovir alafenamide group and three patients (30.0%) were in entecavir group which was statistically significant (p<0.05) in between two group. Hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome were most common causes of death in both groups. Both drugs tenofovir alafenamide and entecavir significantly improves liver functions but the former one is superior regarding survival.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses the pervasive challenges of low hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) testing rates coupled with the stigma associated with these diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with a special focus on Bangladesh. This study aims to introduce an innovative crowdsourcing intervention that involves medical students, a crucial cohort with the potential to shape healthcare attitudes. Through a structured crowdsourcing approach, the study designs and implements a digital intervention to counter stigma and promote testing among medical students in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants submitted brief videos or texts aiming to encourage hepatitis testing and reduce stigma. The call, advertised through meetings, emails, and social media, welcomed entries in English or Bengali over 3 weeks. A panel of six judges evaluated each entry based on clarity, impact potential, innovation, feasibility, and sustainability, awarding prizes to students behind the highest-rated submissions. Seventeen videos and four text messages received an average score of 5.5 among 440 surveyed medical students, predominantly 22 years old (16%) and in their fourth year (21%). After viewing, 360 students underwent screening, identifying two previously undiagnosed HBV cases referred for care; no HCV infections were found. Notably, 41% expressed concerns about individuals with HBV working in hospitals or having a doctor living with HBV. In conclusion, this pilot showcases the power of medical students in spearheading campaigns to counter hepatitis stigma and encourage testing. By utilizing crowdsourcing, the study introduces an innovative approach to a persistent issue in LMICs specially in Bangladesh, offering a model that could potentially be adapted by other regions grappling with similar challenges.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is afflicted with periodic dengue outbreak every few years and one of the worst upsurges was recorded in 2019 during which there was an increasing trend of dengue with unusual symptoms which were not so common before. This study aims to describe the experience of three tertiary care centres of Dhaka regarding the clinical and laboratory, hospital outcome and management profile of the Expanded Dengue Syndrome (EDS) cases admitted from the 2019 outbreak. The current work was a cross-sectional observational study which took place from August 1 to December 31 2019 at three major tertiary care centres in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Out of total 2017 screened dengue cases, 49 met the inclusion criteria and 39 were enrolled after taking informed written consent. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel and Graph pad prism 9.3.1. A probability value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of the 39 cases, majority were male (79.49%) with median (±IQR) age of 33(±9) years. Hypertension (4; 10.26%) was the most commonly associated co-morbidity. Among the systemic manifestations, most prevalent was hepatitis (38.49%) followed by encephalopathy (12.82%). Majority of the patients were suffering from primary infection (85%). Case fatality rate was 15.38%. Hepatitis and meningoencephalitis were the predominant cause of death. This study records the only known case report of Acute respiratory dress syndrome (ARDS) complicating dengue from Bangladesh. None of the patients from our cohort were managed by steroids. Only two (5.13%) out of 39 cases received antibiotics. In the year 2019, an unusual rise in EDS cases with about 15.4% fatalities were observed in this study. Hepatitis was the most common presentation and cause of death. Here, we report the first ARDS case encountered in Bangladesh. Despite the multifaceted presentation of EDS, indiscriminate use of antibiotics and steroid was minimal. Early recognition of multifarious features of EDS is important for choosing the targeted treatment option which can avert many deaths. The results of this study underline the necessity for more in-depth research into the risk factors that are contributing to mortality in EDS cases.",

Thus, the study aimed to assess how knowledge, attitudes, and sociodemographic factors are associated with HBI prevention among a sample of Bangladeshi nursing students. A cross-sectional survey was performed among 737 nursing students from the nursing institutes of Khulna and Barishal divisions in Bangladesh from January to April 2023. The data were collected by providing questionnaires (structured questionnaire) in the classroom, following a stratified random sampling process. A model of multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors linked to HBI prevention practices. The mean (SD) scores were 11.42 (± 2.88) for knowledge, 4.33 (± 1.91) for attitude and 4.27 (± 2.056) for practice respectively. Participants' low knowledge (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.562, 95% CI: 1.29-5.07) and poor attitude (aOR = 5.730, 95% CI: 3.19-10.28) regarding HBI were significantly associated with higher likelihood of poor practice towards HBI prevention. Moreover, being 2nd year of nursing students (aOR = 2.147, 95% CI: 1.19-3.86), being aged 19-20 years (aOR = 3.038, 95% CI: 1.30-7.09), being married (aOR = 0.320, 95%CI: 0.13-0.82) and having a family history of HBI (aOR = 0.134, 95%CI: 0.05-0.36) were significantly associated with poor practices of HBI prevention among study participants. The knowledge, attitude and practice scores of the nursing students on HBI prevention were suboptimal. We advocate for implementing regular HBI prevention education and policies, free or subsidized services, skill development, proper HBI prevention enforcement and strict professional ethics within nursing colleges. Such efforts should predominantly focus on second-year, aged 19-20 and unmarried nursing students.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute jaundice in South Asia. Gaps in our understanding of transmission are driven by non-specific symptoms and scarcity of diagnostics, impeding rational control strategies. In this context, serological data can provide important proxy measures of infection. We enrolled a population-representative serological cohort of 2,337 individuals in Sitakunda, Bangladesh. We estimated the annual risks of HEV infection and seroreversion both using serostatus changes between paired serum samples collected 9 months apart, and by fitting catalytic models to the age-stratified cross-sectional seroprevalence. At baseline, 15% (95 CI: 14-17%) of people were seropositive, with seroprevalence highest in the relatively urban south. During the study, 27 individuals seroreverted (annual seroreversion risk: 15%, 95 CI: 10-21%), and 38 seroconverted (annual infection risk: 3%, 95CI: 2-5%). Relying on cross-sectional seroprevalence data alone, and ignoring seroreversion, underestimated the annual infection risk five-fold (0.6%, 95 CrI: 0.5-0.6%). When we accounted for the observed seroreversion in a reversible catalytic model, infection risk was more consistent with measured seroincidence. Our results quantify HEV infection risk in Sitakunda and highlight the importance of accounting for seroreversion when estimating infection incidence from cross-sectional seroprevalence data.",

        "abstract": "This investigation delineates an exhaustive analysis of the clinical, immunological, and genomic landscapes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection across a cohort of 22 verified patients. The demographic analysis unveiled a pronounced male bias (77.27%), with patient ages spanning 20 to 85 years and durations of illness ranging from 10 days to 4 years. Predominant clinical manifestations included fever, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and arthralgia, alongside observed co-morbidities such as chronic renal disorders and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antigenic profiling of the HBV envelope proteins elucidated significant heterogeneity among the infected subjects, particularly highlighted by discordances in the detection capabilities of small and large HBsAg assays, suggesting antigenic diversity. Quantitative assessment of viral loads unveiled a broad spectrum, accompanied by atypical HBeAg reactivity patterns, challenging the reliability of existing serological markers. Correlative studies between viral burden and antigenicity of the envelope proteins unearthed phenomena indicative of diagnostic evasion. Notably, samples demonstrating robust viral replication were paradoxically undetectable by the large HBsAg ELISA kit, advocating for more sophisticated diagnostic methodologies. Genotypic examination of three HBV isolates classified them as genotype D (D2), with phylogenetic alignment to strains from various global origins. Mutational profiling identified pivotal mutations within the basic core promoter and preS2/S1 regions, associated with an augmented risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, mutations discerned in the small HBsAg and RT/overlap regions were recognized as contributors to vaccine and/or diagnostic escape mechanisms. In summation, this scholarly discourse elucidates the intricate interplay of clinical presentations, antigenic diversity, and genomic attributes in HBV infection, accentuating the imperative for ongoing investigative endeavors to refine diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.",

An effective response in these 20 countries is crucial if global elimination targets are to be achieved. In this update of the Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology Commission on accelerating the elimination of viral hepatitis, we convene national experts from each of the top 20 highest burdened countries to provide an update on progress. Although the global burden of diseases is falling, progress towards elimination varies greatly by country. By use of a hepatitis elimination policy index conceived as part of the 2019 Commission, we measure countries' progress towards elimination. Progress in elimination policy has been made in 14 of 20 countries with the highest burden since 2018, with the most substantial gains observed in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia. Most improvements are attributable to the publication of formalised national action plans for the elimination of viral hepatitis, provision of publicly funded screening programmes, and government subsidisation of antiviral treatments. Key themes that emerged from discussion between national commissioners from the highest burdened countries build on the original recommendations to accelerate the global elimination of viral hepatitis. These themes include the need for simplified models of care, improved access to appropriate diagnostics, financing initiatives, and rapid implementation of lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to explore the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and operational research (OR) practices during public health emergencies (PHE) in the southeast Asian region (SEAR) over the last decade. We searched electronic databases and grey literature sources for studies published between 2012 and 2022. The studies written in English were included, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. A total of 29 studies were included in this review. Among these 25 studies documented M&E and four studies documented OR practices. The majority of the studies were from India and Bangladesh, with no evidence found from Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. M&E of surveillance programs were identified among which PHE due to COVID-19 was most prevalent. M&E was conducted in response to COVID-19, cholera, Nipah, Ebola, <i>Candida auris</i>, and hepatitis A. OR practice was minimal and reported from India and Indonesia. India conducted OR on COVID-19 and malaria, whereas Indonesia focused on COVID-19 and influenza. While most SEAR countries have mechanisms for conducting M&E, there is a noticeable limitation in OR practices. There is a compelling need to develop a standard framework for M&E. Additionally, enhancing private sector engagement is crucial for strengthening preparedness against PHE. Furthermore, there is a necessity to increase awareness about the importance of conducting M&E and OR during PHE.",

        "abstract": "Dialysis in pediatric groups is complicated by a wide range of factors that can affect long-term prognosis. The purpose of this meta-analysis and systematic review is to better understand the demographic and clinical factors that affect dialysis success in children. We searched a variety of databases for relevant articles and included 14 reports that dealt with the case studies of pediatric patients undergoing dialysis for a wide range of renal diseases. Patients' demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes were the primary areas of data collection. To get a better sense of the overall prevalence of certain outcomes and to spot noteworthy trends or patterns in the disease process, we conducted a meta-analysis. Variations in dialysis efficacy and outcomes are highlighted throughout a wide range of ages in the pediatric dialysis cohort, from neonates to teenagers. Acute kidney injuries (AKI) tended to impact more boys, but chronic kidney diseases (CKD), such as lupus nephritis, disproportionately afflicted girls. Many different ethnic groups were represented, and there was evidence that some diseases having a hereditary component were more common in some areas than others. However, the potential for long-term consequences remained a concern. Hemodialysis was found to be effective in controlling end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and AKI, with some patients going on to have a kidney transplant. At the same time, peritoneal dialysis was associated with an increased risk of infection. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of demographic and clinical parameters in determining pediatric dialysis outcomes. A 14.47% mortality rate and gender disparities are revealed by this meta-analysis of pediatric renal diseases, which included a cohort of 235 patients with conditions like lupus nephritis and hepatitis C infection. The findings stress the necessity for individualized treatment techniques and suggest that demographic characteristics should be addressed in prognostic models. For better patient outcomes, the study also suggests standardized reporting in pediatric dialysis studies.",

        "abstract": "Female commercial sex workers (FCSWs) bear higher rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among key populations. The association of structural determinants and STIs among FCSWs was not at the forefront of research earlier in Bangladesh. This study examined how structural factors correlate with the prevalence of STIs at physical/social/economic/policy levels among FCSWs in Dhaka city. 495 FCSWs were screened for HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis. Structural variables (Individual risks, high-risk sexual behaviors, work environments) were extracted from the previous multi-level study on FCSWs and analyzed in 2020 to determine whether macro/micro-structural factors were associated with STIs. The prevalence of STIs was 43.6% (95% CI: 39.1%-48). Most (n = 207/495) FCSWs were infected with Syphilis or Hepatitis B, only 1.8% had co-infection, and none was positive for HIV. Multiple logistic regression revealed that 'Individual risk' factors like age (≤18 years, adjusted odds ratio = AOR = .28; 18.1-29.9 years, AOR = .57), years in the sex industry (<1 year AOR = .15; 1-5 years, AOR = .39), and condoms as contraceptives (AOR = 2.7) were significantly associated with STIs. Considering 'High-risk behaviors' like monthly coitus with regular clients (AOR = .33), performing no anal sex ever (AOR = .03), and consistent condom use (AOR = .13) were less likely to be associated with STIs (P<0.05), while the association of ever group sex with STIs reported to double (AOR = 2.1). 'Work environment' like sex on roads/parks/shrines/markets (AOR = 2.6) and ever HIV-testing (AOR = 2.5) were significantly linked with STIs. However, micro-level factors like experiencing forced sex in the past year (AOR = 1.79) and condoms collected from hotel boys (AOR = .34) were significantly associated with STIs in the 'Hierarchical- model' with increasing model-power. 'Micro-structural' determinants predominated over 'Macro/policy-level factors' and profoundly influenced STIs. FCSWs need comprehensive and integrated interventions to promote accurate condom use perception, eliminate risky sexual behaviors, and provide quality reproductive health care. Necessary steps at the policy level are urgently needed to decriminalize commercial sex work.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis B, C, HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis, kidney and liver diseases along with presence of infections among aspirant migrant workers of Bangladesh. This study was carried out from September-December 2019. We analysed data collected on screening tests of specific diseases of aspirant workers. For each test, the prevalence was computed with 95% confidence interval. Association between categorical data was determined by the Chi-square test. A total of 2385 aspirants, 1988 (83.35%) males, aged between 18 and 65 years (29.76±6.578) were studied. Positive results for screening tests of HBsAg were 38 (1.6%,), anti-HCV were 2 (0.08%), TPHA were 25 (1.05%) and VDRL were 5 (0.21%) though no individual was positive for HIV and TB. Elevated level of SGOT (n=99, 4.2%), SGPT (n=322, 13.5%), RBS (n=57, 2.4%), bilirubin (n=46, 1.92%), creatinine (n=7, 0.3%) and ESR (n=19, 0.8%) were found in the workers. Diagnosis of diseases of workers is obligatory before going abroad to safeguard the health of the workers and residents of destination country.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh's unique epidemiological landscape presents an intriguing puzzle. This South Asian nation, with its complex sociodemographic and environmental factors, is home to a diverse array of hepatitis-B virus (HBV) genotypes, identified as Genotype C, with Genotypes D and A also making a significant contribution to the viral landscape. Reviewing such insights is necessary not only to underscore the country's regional diversity in HBV strains but also to bring into focus the clinical implications these genetic variations may have on disease progression and management. A thorough database search covered various sources using relevant keywords like \"Hepatitis B virus genotypes\", \"HBV genotypes in Bangladesh\", and \"HBV clinical implications\". The review synthesized findings and analyzed HBV genotype prevalence and clinical implications in Bangladesh. Genotypes C and D collectively represent 82% of chronic hepatitis-B infection (CHB) cases in Bangladesh, underscoring their regional prevalence. The geographic context is pivotal in understanding HBV infection dynamics and disease progression in this area. Notably, genotype C and the presence of A1762T/G1764A mutations appear to have a distinct impact on disease development, potentially affecting the immune response in CHB patients. This highlights the need for tailored management approaches in this specific region. Further research is vital to confirm and elaborate on these findings, particularly in relation to how these mutations influence the host's immune response. In summary, studies on HBV genotypes in Bangladesh stress the need for genotype-specific clinical considerations and more research to improve diagnostics and therapies. Raihan R, Akbar SMF.

The major objective was to assess the level of depression among patients having chronic hepatitis B. The Department of Hepatology of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University directed this study which was a comparative cross-sectional study during time duration from September 2021 to September 2022. Incidence and grading of depression between patients with chronic hepatitis B and HBsAg negative healthy volunteers were assessed and compared through this study. The association of different variables with depression among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients was also measured. Out of 90 patients having chronic hepatitis B, 52 (57.8%) were found to have some degree of depression; whereas among 90 HBsAg-negative healthy controls, 32 (35.6%) were found to have various degrees of depression. The dissimilarity between the two groups was significantly determined (<i>p</i>-value < 0.05). The majority of the depressed population from both groups had mild degrees of depression, however, the variance was not top the notch (<i>p</i>-value > 0.05). But the prevalence of moderate depression and moderately severe depression was statistically significant among CHB patients compared to their counterpart controls. Depression among CHB patients was found to be female-predominant. The study has shown a higher prevalence of depression among patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to HBsAg-negative healthy controls. Rahman M, Noor-E-Alam SM, Rahim MA, <i>et al</i>.

        "abstract": "HeberNasvac is a recently developed therapeutic vaccine for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) administered by intranasal (IN) and subcutaneous (SC) routes in a 14 days/10 doses schedule. To compare different schedules and routes of immunizations, a group of patients received four different vaccination regimens in a placebo-controlled factorial study. Subsequently, patients were followed for a minimum time of 48 weeks. Samples collected at the end of the follow-up were compared with initial samples. Groups I and II received the product by IN/SC routes, every 14 and 7 days, respectively. Groups III and IV were treated by SC route alone following a 14 and 7 days schedule. A group of 21 CHB patients received the vaccine in four different schedules and eight patients received placebo for a total of 29 patients enrolled. The 61.9% of vaccinees reduced their VL ≥2Log compared with baseline levels and 25% in placebo group. The 47.6% of vaccines reduced HBV levels to undetectable, 25% in placebo. HBeAg loss and seroconversion to anti-HBeAg was only achieved in vaccinees, 4 out of 9 (44.4%), and 40% (8 out of 20) developed anti-HBs response, none in placebo group. Reduction of HBsAg level in ≥1Log was achieved in the 35.0% of vaccinees and in none of the placebo-treated patients. Considering the individual and factorial analysis, significant HBV DNA reduction was detected in groups I and II, immunized by IN/SC routes. A significantly higher proportion of patients reducing VL to ≥2Log was also detected grouping the patients treated by IN/SC routes (G I + II) and grouping those inoculated every 14 days (G I + III), with 72.7% and 63.6%, respectively, compared with the placebo group (25.0%). The patients immunized every 14 days (G I + G III) also reduced the HBsAg levels compared with baseline. In conclusion, after more than 48 weeks of treatment-free follow-up, HeberNasvac-treated patients demonstrated superior responses compared with the placebo group in terms of antiviral and serological responses. The factorial analysis evidenced that the schedule combining the IN route of immunization and the frequency of 14 days resulted in the stronger antiviral and serological responses. Present results support the study of IN-only immunization schedules in future and was consistent with previous results. Long-lasting follow-ups were done to explore histological variables and the progression of serological variables in order to detect late responders. Freyre FM, Aguiar JA, Cinza Z, <i>et al</i>.

Vaccines are crucial in preventing microbial infections, including viruses, and adjuvants play a vital role in modulating immune responses. However, there are still many diseases for which effective vaccines are lacking or have limited immune response, posing significant threats to human health. The use of TLR agonists as adjuvants in viral vaccine formulations holds promise in improving vaccine effectiveness.

Neddylation has been reported to enhance the stability of the regulatory hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein, modulate viral replication, and enhance hepatocarcinogenesis. Inhibition of neddylation using the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 inhibitor MLN4924 inhibits viral replication, including that of HBV. Understanding of the role of neddylation in viral infections is critical for developing new therapeutic targets and potential treatment strategies.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major source of disease burden worldwide, with an estimated 296 million individuals living with infections worldwide. Although vaccine programs exist to control infections, certain sub-populations around the world continue to have very high prevalence of HBV infection. A systematic search of studies of HBV published after 2010 was conducted for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan. Each paper was independently screened for risk of bias and inclusion. Data were extracted from included studies before being analysed to estimate pooled prevalence, and to conduct sub-group analyses. Random-effects models were used for estimating summary prevalence due to a high level of heterogeneity between studies, and funnel plots were combined with Egger's test to assess publication bias. Meta-regression was conducted to investigate sources of between-study heterogeneity. The pooled prevalence of HBV across all studies was 3% (95% CI 0.02, 0.05). For countries with multiple studies, the pooled prevalence in India was 3% (95% CI 0.02, 0.04), in Pakistan 6% (95% CI 0.03, 0.09), in Bangladesh 5% (95% CI of 0.02, 0.12), and in Nepal 1% (95% CI 0.00, 0.08). There was some evidence of publication bias, and a high level of heterogeneity across studies. Risk of bias analysis found most studies to be of fair or moderate quality. The prevalence of HBV among countries in the sub-continent was higher than the global average, but was not as high as some other regions. Countries with greater numbers of displaced persons had higher prevalence of HBV, with a wide range of prevalence between subpopulations likely reflecting differential uptake, and implementation, of vaccination programs.",

East and South Asia bear a substantial burden of HEV infection, with Bangladesh, China, and India facing the most severe threat in this region. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the burden of HEV-ALF in these three high-risk countries. A systematic literature search was performed utilizing PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Studies in English or Chinese that reported data on the burden of HEV-ALF in Bangladesh, China and India were included. Outcomes were pooled with meta-analysis utilizing R software. Estimates were calculated with random-effects models, and subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to address heterogeneity. Egger's test and Begg's test were performed to assess publication bias. A total of 20 eligible studies were included in this study. The pooled HEV-attributable proportion of viral-related acute liver failure was estimated to be 40.0% (95% CI: 0.28-0.52), 30.0% (95% CI: 0.18-0.44), and 61.0% (95% CI: 0.49-0.72) among non-pregnant individuals in India, China and Bangladesh, while in Indian pregnant females, it was 71.0% (95% CI: 0.62-0.79). The combined prevalence among non-pregnant HEV-infected participants was 28.0% (95% CI: 0.20-0.37) and 10.0% (95% CI: 0.01-0.28) in India and China, and it was 34.0% (95% CI: 0.27-0.42) in Indian pregnant females with HEV infection. The overall mortality of HEV-ALF was estimated to be 32.0% (95% CI: 0.23-0.42) and 64.0% (95% CI: 0.50-0.77) among the non-pregnant and the pregnant participants in India, and it was 23.0% (95% CI: 0.14-0.34) in Chinese non-pregnant participants.

Nearly 60 % of Qatar's population are expatriates CMWs, including many from hyperendemic countries for HEV. Thus, estimating the seroprevalence of HEV in Qatar and understanding its epidemiology is essential for public health efforts to control HEV transmission in Qatar. Blood samples from 2670 CMWs were collected between 2020 and 2021. All samples were tested for HEV-IgG antibodies. Positive HEV-IgG samples were tested for HEV-IgM antibodies, and those positives were also tested for viral antigens using an HEV-Ag ELISA kit and HEV-RNA by RT-PCR to confirm current HEV infections. The seroprevalence of HEV-IgG was 27.3 % (729/2670; 95 % CI: 25.6-29.0). Of those HEV-IgG positive, 8.23 % (60/729; 95 % CI: 6.30-10.5) were HEV-IgM positive. Of the IgM-positive samples, 2 were HEV-RNA positive (3.39 %; 95 % CI: 0.40-11.7), and 1 was HEV-Ag positive (1.69 %; 95 % CI: 0.04-9.09).

We examined the determinants of healthcare-seeking for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection which is asymptomatic, chronic, and requires costly treatment in an urban tertiary care referral hospital in Vietnam. We conducted a secondary analysis of hospital data for patients attending the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam between 2017 and 2020 specifically for HCV infection treatment. Poisson regression was used to determine the effect of personal factors (age, sex, comorbidities) and structural factors (health insurance, proximity to the facility, seasonality, year of visit) on the number of hospital visits. From 2017 to 2020 a total of 22,052 eligible patients sought treatment in the hospital. Among the patients, 50.4% were males and 58.7% were > 50 years of age. The mean number of visits per person was 2.17. In the multivariate analysis compared to 2017, the number of hospital visits increased by 4% in 2018 and then significantly decreased in 2019 and 2020. Visit numbers were significantly lower (6%) among South East region residents compared to those from Central Highlands and for those who lived further away from the hospital. The visit numbers were significantly higher among older age groups (5-11%), those with health insurance (6%), and those with comorbidities (5%) compared to others. Although the number of hospital visits by females was higher (7%) than males in 2017, it significantly decreased in subsequent years. Our study indicated that there are both structural and individual factors affecting the number of visits for HCV treatment. To meet the global strategy for elimination of HCV, Vietnam Government needs to address the structural and personal barriers to healthcare seeking, with a special focus on women.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis is often called a 'silent killer' as most patients remain asymptomatic and hence remain unaware of their illness. They are either diagnosed incidentally or get symptomatic when their illness advances years after getting the infection. In Pakistan, transmission has increased due to ignorance of sterilization techniques, sharing personal items, and unsafe healthcare practices and the burden of liver cancers and transplants has risen three-fold during the past 20 years. Chronic hepatitis often goes undetected, leading to a rise in liver cancers and transplants. Pakistan bears the second-largest burden of hepatitis C globally, with a nationwide prevalence of 4.8%. From 2015 to 2019, there was a 5% increase in hepatitis C-related deaths and an 8% increase in hepatitis B-related deaths. During the last 4 years, out of the 110 million population, only 281 578 individuals were screened for hepatitis B and C, and 1 634 614 individuals were registered at various hepatitis clinics. However, only 278 308 patients were treated. Despite a national vaccination strategy, coverage falls short, and regular screening is neglected. The burden of hepatitis-related morbidity is a considerable challenge for the Pakistani government and healthcare system, being a low-income country with limited health resources and limited access to treatment. Increased awareness, education, and emphasizing preventive measures, such as hepatitis B vaccination, is crucial. Careful supervision of healthcare workers and the promotion of safe practices are essential. Pakistan can learn and implement the Egypt model to combat hepatitis effectively. This article aims to discuss barriers and challenges and provides possible recommendations.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19 on hepatitis-related services in Bangladesh and compared the situation with same study conducted in Japan and globally. We conducted an online cross-sectional questionnaire survey among the clinicians of four societies associated with liver disease in Bangladesh from October to December 2022. The questionnaire included the same questions as a survey conducted in Japan and globally. A total of 83 clinicians from 8 divisions in Bangladesh participated; 66.3% were heads of departments/institutions. Except for HCV treatment initiation, more than 30% of clinicians reported a 76-99% decline in all services. Compared to Japan and the global survey, there was a significantly higher decline in all HBV and HCV services in Bangladesh. To resume services back to pre-COVID-19 levels, Patient anxiety and fear (Bangladesh Survey: 80.7% vs Japan Survey: 67.4% vs Global Survey: 37.9%, p < 0.0001), loss of space due to COVID-19 (Bangladesh Survey: 63.9% vs Japan Survey: 34.7% vs Global Survey: 19.4%, p < 0.0001) were the main challenges. As part of the mitigation strategy, usage of telemedicine (Bangladesh Survey: 83.1% vs. Japan Survey: 67.3% vs Global Survey: 78.6% p < 0.0001), COVID-19 benefits, such as increased laboratory testing platforms (Bangladesh Survey: 77.1% vs Japan Survey: 17.9% vs Global Survey: 41.8%, p < 0.0001) was reported significantly higher in Bangladesh than in Japan and global survey. All the services-related to HBV and HCV were highly affected during greatest impact month of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and the decline level was higher than Japan and global survey. Repeated countermeasures of COVID-19 and constrained healthcare-system were the probable reasons in Bangladesh. Positive impact resulting from COVID-19 countermeasures should be utilized in the national hepatitis program in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>. In the United States, histoplasmosis is endemic in the Mississippi River Valley and Ohio. Histoplasmosis is often asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, and severe disseminated cases are more often seen in immunosuppressed patients. Disseminated histoplasmosis often affects the reticuloendothelial system, invading specific visceral organs such as the liver, spleen, and pancreas. The current study presents a unique case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a 64-year-old immunocompetent male. The patient's presentation included a 40-lb weight loss over a year, bilateral adrenal nodules, abnormal liver enzymes, and granulomatous hepatitis, which initially raised suspicion of a malignant etiology. An adrenal mass biopsy showed fungal morphology that confirmed an <i>H. capsulatum</i> infection. Further history showed that the patient recently traveled to Bangladesh, which is thought to be a region endemic to histoplasmosis. This case is noteworthy because disseminated histoplasmosis rarely affects immunocompetent individuals, and an infectious etiology for adrenal insufficiency is exceedingly rare, especially in the United States. The treatment regimen included a 14-day induction therapy of IV amphotericin B followed by outpatient itraconazole, leading to symptom resolution. This case highlights the need to consider an infectious etiology for adrenal insufficiency, especially among immunocompetent individuals who may be at risk after traveling to endemic areas.",

Traditional antiviral drug development involves targeting specific viral proteins, which may lead to the emergence of resistant strains. To explore alternative strategies, we investigated the antiviral potential of antimicrobial peptidomimetic compounds. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral potential of 17 short anthranilamide-based peptidomimetic compounds against two viruses: Murine hepatitis virus 1 (MHV-1) which is a surrogate of human coronaviruses and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of these compounds were determined in vitro to assess their potency as antiviral agents. Compounds <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> displayed the most potent inhibitory effects with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.38 μM, and 6.3 μM against MHV-1 while compounds <b>9</b> and <b>14</b> showed IC<sub>50</sub> values of 14.8 μM and 13 μM against HSV-1. Multiple antiviral assessments and microscopic images obtained through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) collectively demonstrated that these compounds exert a direct influence on the viral envelope. Based on this outcome, it can be concluded that peptidomimetic compounds could offer a new approach for the development of potent antiviral agents.",

        "abstract": "Background This multicentric cross-sectional study aimed to examine the prevalence of thrombocytopenia (TCP) and investigate the various causes of chronic liver disease (CLD) across 15 Southeast Asian (India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) tertiary care centers over a three-month period. The study focused on assessing the fibrosis index (FI) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-sodium (Na) score's capacity to grade and predict the progression and outcomes of patients with already diagnosed CLD. Methods The cross-sectional study enrolled 377 CLD patients. The study utilized admission registries from 15 tertiary care hospitals in Southeast Asia, spanning from April 2023 to June 2023. Various descriptive variables were collected, including gender, tobacco use (specifically, chewed tobacco), underlying etiology, presence of anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, infectious state, and liver cirrhosis diagnosed via traditional ultrasonography. This study examined liver failure indicators, including alanine transaminase levels, compensation status, TCP, and liver transplant (LT) listing. The MELD-Na score was the focus of frequency and percentage analysis. MELD-Na and FI medians and standard deviations were provided. Results The study of 377 patients with CLD found that TCP was present in 4% of patients and leukopenia was present in 12% of patients. The risk of TCP was significantly higher in leukopenic patients (89.5%) than in non-leukopenic patients (52.5%) (p = 0.003). The most common CLD cause was undiagnosable (31%), followed by autoimmune (26%), hepatitis C virus (21%), hepatitis B virus (14%), and schistosomiasis (8%). The majority of patients (98%) had decompensated liver disease. Of the patients, 64% had TCP, while 36% did not. The illness severity indicators MELD score and FI had mean ± SD values of 16.89 ± 6.42 and 4.1 ± 1.06, respectively. Similarly, the prevalence of LT needs among traditional ultrasonography-diagnosed cirrhotic patients was 83.1%, compared to 59.6% among non-cirrhotic patients (p = 0.001). Conclusion Leukopenia and TCP may be linked, which may affect CLD treatment and prognosis in this population. Non-invasive indicators like the FI and MELD-Na score can detect liver fibrosis and severity without invasive procedures, enhancing patient management. These findings highlight the need to improve early diagnosis methods for CLD in Southeast Asia and raise awareness among clinicians about effective diagnostic strategies for non-infectious causes of CLD.",

        "abstract": "The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. No specific funding was awarded for this meta-analysis.

The recognition of the pathogenic HCV genotype is critical for the remedy of its sufferers. The aim of this study was to identify the HCV RNA genotype to decide the correct treatment of hepatitis C positive sufferers in Bangladesh. Blood samples were collected from 390 individuals and isolated RNA (60 µg) from blood plasma. Extracted RNA was used for quantitative HCV RNA, and complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conducted by reverse transcriptase enzyme. This cDNA amplified in multiplex by RT-PCR, which was performed with specific set of primers. The HCV RNA genotype was detected 297 of 390 patients. Of the 390 test samples, 200 (51.28%) samples were from males and 190 (48.71%) were from females, with age ranging from 5 to 78 years. In all, 166 of 200 male samples and 131/190 female samples were found positive for HCV. Of these 390 participants included in the study, 213 (54.61%) were identified as genotype 3 positive, 78 (20%) as genotype 1 positive, 6 (1.53%) as genotype 6 positive, and the remaining 93 (23.85%) samples were unclassified due to low/undetected viral load. In this study, we detected the highest percentage (30.89%) of genotype 3 HCV in patients aged 51 to 60 years. The results suggested that genotype 3 HCV is frequently present in Bangladesh and it is usually responses better to interferon therapy.

Quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) estimation adjunct to HBV-DNA is vital for assessing HBV chronicity and therapeutic prognosis. This study aimed to estimate the qHBsAg and compare its diagnostic performance with that of the HBV-DNA levels in CHB patients from Bangladesh. Methodology A total of 148 CHB patients were enrolled in this study. qHBsAg and hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) were estimated using chemiluminescent and enzyme immunoassays, respectively, and HBV-DNA was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The parameters and diagnostic performances were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results The overall levels (mean ± SD) of qHBsAg, HBV-DNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) among the total population (n = 148) were 3.45 ± 0.80 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, 4.40 ± 2.44 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, and 86.17 ± 39.06 IU/L, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the levels of both qHBsAg (p = 0.004) and HBV-DNA (p < 0.0001) in cases with HBeAg positivity. qHBsAg levels showed a weak positive correlation with the levels of HBV-DNA and ALT in HBeAg-positive CHB patients, but no such relationship was observed in HBeAg-negative CHB patients. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for the qHBsAg level to distinguish high HBV-DNA levels (>5 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL) was 0.653 (p = 0.002), which indicated an acceptable diagnostic performance. The best cut-off of qHBsAg for predicting high HBV-DNA levels was 3.469 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL. Conclusions Our results indicated that qHBsAg might be a useful marker for monitoring HBV-DNA in CHB patients throughout treatment and follow-up.",

        "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 296 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Approximately 15-25% of these people develop complications such as advanced chronic liver diseases (ACLDs). Mortality due to HBV-related complications accounted for an estimated 882,000 deaths in 2019. Potent preventive vaccines have already restricted new HBV infections, and several drugs are available to treat chronic HBV infections. However, the positive impacts of these drugs have been recorded in only a few patients with chronic HBV infection. These drugs do not show long-term efficacy and cannot halt the progression to complications. Thus, more effective and evidence-based therapeutic strategies need to be urgently developed for patients with chronic HBV infection. CHB is a pathological entity induced by HBV that progresses due to impaired host immunity. This indicates the inherent limitations of antiviral-drug-based monotherapy for treating patients with chronic HBV infection. Additionally, commercially available antiviral drugs are not available to patients in developing and resource-constrained countries, posing a challenge to achieving the following WHO goal: \"Elimination of Hepatitis by 2030\". As such, this review aimed to provide insights regarding evidence-based and effective management strategies for chronic HBV infection.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy for children and adolescents in Bangladesh who are living with chronic HCV infection. An experimental study was performed from January 2021 to December 2022. HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive thalassemic children, who were 6-18 years of age, were enrolled by consecutive nonprobability sampling. Clinical features were recorded, and investigations were performed. All patients were initially treated with sofosbuvir (200 mg for 6- to 11-year-olds and 400 mg for 12- to 18-year-olds) and ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg/day) and were assessed clinically on a four-weekly basis, along with liver-function testing. The total duration of therapy was 24 weeks. HCV PCR was done at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the completion of treatment to see the sustained virological response. There were 26 cases in total, with a mean age of 9.26 ± 2.82 years; 14 were males (53.8%), and 12 females (46.2%). Twenty-five (96.15%) patients achieved a sustained virological response, and the end-of-treatment PCR was negative. One patient (3.85%) was a nonresponder even after 24 weeks of treatment. The medication was well received, with only four patients (15.3%) reporting headaches that were reported untreated. The combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin is effective in treating chronic HCV infection and is not accompanied by any major negative side effects.",

        "title": "Liver injury: the therapeutic dilemma of homeopathy - a case report from Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness, homeopathic treatment is increasingly being used as a form of alternative medicine, with many people taking homeopathic remedies instead of drug therapies. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like', meaning that a remedy similar to the illness can be used to treat it. However, there have been several reports suggesting the risks of homeopathic remedies, among which homeopathy-induced liver injury is widely discussed. Here, we report a case of a 35-year-old well-oriented male patient with a typical clinical presentation of liver injury as presented by yellowish discoloration of sclera and skin along with generalized body itching following the use of homeopathic medicine for musculoskeletal pain. Laboratory reports of increased liver markers along with bilirubin were also suggestive. Excluding other differentials like viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, and standard drug and toxin-induced hepatitis, the recent use of homeopathic remedies was a contributing factor in leading to the diagnosis of homeopathy-induced liver injury. He was then treated with the discontinuation of homeopathic medicine and supportive care. This case highlights the need for public awareness of the possible complications such as headache, tiredness, skin eruption, dizziness, bowel dysfunction, allergic reactions to acute pancreatitis, renal failure, neurological dysfunction, possible liver injury, and even mortality in those patients who pursue homeopathic treatments and health care professionals should take this into account when making a differential diagnosis in patients with liver injury.",

Here we studied the relationship between host genetic variation, vaccine immunogenicity and viral sequences implicating VEM emergence. In a cohort of 1,096 Bangladeshi children, we identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants associated with response vaccine antigens. Using an HLA imputation panel with 9,448 south Asian individuals <i>DPB1*04:01</i> was associated with higher HBV antibody responses (p=4.5×10<sup>-30</sup>). The underlying mechanism is a result of higher affinity binding of HBV surface antigen epitopes to DPB1*04:01 dimers. This is likely a result of evolutionary pressure at the HBV surface antigen 'a-determinant' segment incurring VEM specific to HBV. Prioritizing pre-S isoform HBV vaccines may tackle the rise of HBV vaccine evasion.",

Recent studies showed low serum zinc level in patients suffering from WD than the normal. This cross-sectional analytical study has been designed to compare the serum zinc level between paediatric patients suffering from WD but yet not started treatment and children who have normal ALT level. This study was carried out at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, BSMMU, Dhaka, Bangladesh from July 2018 to June 2019. Total 51 children were included in this study. Among them 27 were diagnosed case of WD aged between three to eighteen years and 24 children of same ages who were suffering from other than liver disease having normal ALT were included as volunteers. The patients of WD were divided into four groups according to their presentation as acute hepatitis, chronic liver disease (CLD), acute liver failure & neuropsychiatric manifestation. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients and volunteers for participation in this study. Along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations 3 ml of venous blood were collected for estimation of serum zinc level. After estimation of serum zinc level results were analyzed statistically. The difference in serum zinc levels were compared between the groups. Serum zinc level was significantly lower in Wilson disease patients (43.8±19.7μg/dl; range: 13-83) compared to volunteers group (67.8±11.8μg/dl; range: 47-97) p<0.001. Among the diseased group, serum zinc level were significantly lower in 18 CLD (38.4±17.4μg/dl) and in 4 acute liver failure (33.1±3.7μg/dl) compared to 4 acute hepatitis (71.8±4.3μg/dl) (p=0.001) and (p<0.001) respectively. Mean serum zinc level was low in 4 Wilsonian acute liver failure (33.1±3.7μg/dl), which was significant compared to those (23) who presented as Wilson disease non acute liver failure (45.7±20.8μg/dl) (p=0.013). Serum zinc level was significantly lower in Wilson disease children compared to the volunteers. Zinc level was also found significantly low in Wilson disease presented as CLD and acute liver failure in comparison to Wilson disease presented as acute hepatitis.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a dangerous virus that is responsible for a large number of infections and deaths worldwide. In the treatment of HCV, it is important that the drugs are effective and do not have additional hepatotoxic effects. The aim of this study was to test the in silico activity of 1893 terpenes against the HCV NS5B polymerase (PDB-ID: 3FQK). Two drugs, sofosbuvir and dasabuvir, were used as controls. The GOLD software (CCDC) and InstaDock were used for docking. By using the results obtained from PLP.Fitness (GOLD), pKi, and binding free energy (InstaDock), nine terpenes were finally selected based on their scores. The drug-likeness properties were calculated using Lipinski's rule of five. The ADMET values were studied using SwissADME and pkCSM servers. Ultimately, it was shown that nine terpenes have better docking results than sofosbuvir and dasabuvir. These were gniditrin, mulberrofuran G, cochlearine A, ingenol dibenzoate, mulberrofuran G, isogemichalcone C, pawhuskin B, 3-cinnamyl-4-oxoretinoic acid, DTXSID501019279, and mezerein. Each docked complex was submitted to 150 ns-long molecular dynamics simulations to ascertain the binding stability. The results show that mulberrofuran G, cochlearine A, and both stereoisomers of pawhuskin B form very stable interactions with the active site region where the reaction product should form and are, therefore, good candidates for use as effective competitive inhibitors. The other compounds identified in the docking screen either afford extremely weak (or even hardly any) binding (such as ingenol dibenzoate, gniditrin, and mezerein) or must first undergo preliminary movements in the active site before attaining their stable binding conformations, in a process which may take from 60 to 80 ns (for DTXSID501019279, 3-cinnamyl-4-oxoretinoic acid or isogemichalcone C).",

        "abstract": "Chikungunya (CHIK) patients may be vulnerable to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, presently there are no anti-COVID-19/CHIK therapeutic alternatives available. The purpose of this research was to determine the pharmacological mechanism through which kaempferol functions in the treatment of COVID-19-associated CHIK co-infection. We have used a series of network pharmacology and computational analysis-based techniques to decipher and define the binding capacity, biological functions, pharmacological targets, and treatment processes in COVID-19-mediated CHIK co-infection. We identified key therapeutic targets for COVID-19/CHIK, including TP53, MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, TNF, IL6 and NFKB1. Gene ontology, molecular and upstream pathway analysis of kaempferol against COVID-19 and CHIK showed that DEGs were confined mainly to the cytokine-mediated signalling pathway, MAP kinase activity, negative regulation of the apoptotic process, lipid and atherosclerosis, TNF signalling pathway, hepatitis B, toll-like receptor signaling, IL-17 and IL-18 signaling pathways. The study of the gene regulatory network revealed several significant TFs including KLF16, GATA2, YY1 and FOXC1 and miRNAs such as let-7b-5p, mir-16-5p, mir-34a-5p, and mir-155-5p that target differential-expressed genes (DEG). According to the molecular coupling results, kaempferol exhibited a high affinity for 5 receptor proteins (TP53, MAPK1, MAPK3, MAPK8, and TNF) compared to control inhibitors. In combination, our results identified significant targets and pharmacological mechanisms of kaempferol in the treatment of COVID-19/CHIK and recommended that core targets be used as potential biomarkers against COVID-19/CHIK viruses. Before conducting clinical studies for the intervention of COVID-19 and CHIK, kaempferol might be evaluated in wet lab tests at the molecular level.",

Similarly to other viral infections, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) also modulates the host TLR response; therefore, a proper understanding of the response induced by human HIV-1 or co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), due to the common mode of transmission of these viruses, is essential for understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis during mono- or co-infection with HBV or HCV, as well as for HIV-1 cure strategies. In this review, we discuss the host TLR response during HIV-1 infection and the innate immune evasion mechanisms adopted by HIV-1 for infection establishment. We also examine changes in the host TLR response during HIV-1 co-infection with HBV or HCV; however, this type of study is extremely scarce. Moreover, we discuss studies investigating TLR agonists as latency-reverting agents and immune stimulators towards new strategies for curing HIV. This understanding will help develop a new strategy for curing HIV-1 mono-infection or co-infection with HBV or HCV.",

The present study provides information about the role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype in this phase III clinical trial. From a total of 160 patients enrolled in this trial, the HBV genotypes of 133 patients were characterized, and NASVAC induced a stronger antiviral effect (HBV DNA reduction below 250 copies per mL) than Peg-IFN. The antiviral effects and alanine aminotransferase levels were not significantly different among different HBV genotypes in NASVAC-treated patients. However, a significantly higher proportion of genotype-D patients receiving NASVAC showed better therapeutic effects, compared to genotype-D patients receiving Peg-IFN, with a marked difference of 44%. In conclusion, NASVAC seems to be a better alternative to Peg-IFN, especially in patients with HBV genotype-D patients. This reflects the attractiveness of NASVAC in countries where genotype D is highly prevalent. The mechanisms underlying the effect of HBV genotype are being studied in a new clinical trial.",

        "abstract": "Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a highly conserved metabolic process, regulates cellular homeostasis by degrading dysfunctional cytosolic constituents and invading pathogens <i>via</i> the lysosomal system. In addition, autophagy selectively recycles specific organelles such as damaged mitochondria (<i>via</i> mitophagy), and lipid droplets (LDs; <i>via</i> lipophagy) or eliminates specialized intracellular pathogenic microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and coronaviruses (<i>via</i> virophagy). Selective autophagy, particularly mitophagy, plays a key role in the preservation of healthy liver physiology, and its dysfunction is connected to the pathogenesis of a wide variety of liver diseases. For example, lipophagy has emerged as a defensive mechanism against chronic liver diseases. There is a prominent role for mitophagy and lipophagy in hepatic pathologies including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and drug-induced liver injury. Moreover, these selective autophagy pathways including virophagy are being investigated in the context of viral hepatitis and, more recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated hepatic pathologies. The interplay between diverse types of selective autophagy and its impact on liver diseases is briefly addressed. Thus, modulating selective autophagy (e.g., mitophagy) would seem to be effective in improving liver diseases. Considering the prominence of selective autophagy in liver physiology, this review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and functions of selective autophagy (mainly mitophagy and lipophagy) in liver physiology and pathophysiology. This may help in finding therapeutic interventions targeting hepatic diseases <i>via</i> manipulation of selective autophagy.",

This prospective cohort study was conducted in the Department of Nephrology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from September 2016 to August 2017. Adult patients who had undergone renal transplantation were selected as study population. CMV serology (CMV IgM and CMV IgG) of both donor and recipient were detected before renal transplantation. Cytomegalovirus viral DNA was extracted from both serum by using a commercially available DNA extraction kit and PCR was done by the StepOne™ PCR machine using real time PCR kit in all patient during the early post-transplant period. During this period, sign symptoms of patients with cytomegalovirus infection as well as clinical outcomes were also noted. Total number of 32 patients was included in this study with the mean age of 31.15±11.56 years. Cytomegalovirus was found positive in 11(34.4%) patients and negative in 21(65.6%) patients.

Depending upon the degree of ischemic injury, it can be either partial or complete. We report an interesting case of a 35-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with complaints of abdominal distension, which was later presumed to be due to disseminated tuberculosis (TB) after excluding the possible differentials. During the treatment course, she was going through repeated attacks of hypovolemic shock and hypoglycemia due to adrenocortical insufficiency. This, along with the history of prolonged amenorrhea 4 years back due to severe postpartum hemorrhage in her last pregnancy, has led us to our diagnosis of partial Sheehan's syndrome. After 1 month of starting steroid and anti-TB therapy, it was quite surprising when she presented with features of pancytopenia and antitubercular drug-induced hepatitis. Sheehan's syndrome may have a varying degree of presentation depending upon the degree of damage to the pituitary gland, which includes amenorrhea, lactation failure, adrenocortical insufficiency, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, as well as pancytopenia in some rare instances The hormone panel especially the thyroid profile should be monitored carefully. Such cases are often challenging to deal with because of their varying degrees of presentation and the delay in diagnosis due to a lack of clinical suspicion. Therefore, we believe that this rare presentation of pancytopenia in Sheehan's syndrome with fluctuating thyroid profile and abdominal TB in the background will let clinicians approach such a rare disease differently.",

        "abstract": "Early identification of non-response to steroids is critical in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) causing acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). We assessed if this non-response can be accurately identified within first few days of treatment. Patients with AIH-ACLF without baseline infection/hepatic encephalopathy were identified from APASL ACLF research consortium (AARC) database. Diagnosis of AIH-ACLF was based mainly on histology. Those treated with steroids were assessed for non-response (defined as death or liver transplant at 90 days for present study). Laboratory parameters, AARC, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores were assessed at baseline and day 3 to identify early non-response. Utility of dynamic SURFASA score [- 6.80 + 1.92*(D0-INR) + 1.94*(∆%3-INR) + 1.64*(∆%3-bilirubin)] was also evaluated. The performance of early predictors was compared with changes in MELD score at 2 weeks. Fifty-five out of one hundred and sixty-five patients (age-38.2 ± 15.0 years, 67.2% females) with AIH-ACLF [median MELD 24 (IQR: 22-27); median AARC score 7 (6-9)] given oral prednisolone 40 (20-40) mg per day were analyzed. The 90 day transplant-free survival in this cohort was 45.7% with worse outcomes in those with incident infections (56% vs 28.0%, p = 0.03). The AUROC of pre-therapy AARC score [0.842 (95% CI 0.754-0.93)], MELD [0.837 (95% CI 0.733-0.94)] score and SURFASA score [0.795 (95% CI 0.678-0.911)] were as accurate as ∆MELD at 2 weeks [0.770 (95% CI 0.687-0.845), p = 0.526] and better than ∆MELD at 3 days [0.541 (95% CI 0.395, 0.687), p < 0.001] to predict non-response. Combination of AARC score > 6, MELD score > 24 with SURFASA score ≥ - 1.2, could identify non-responders at day 3 (concomitant- 75% vs either - 42%, p < 0.001). Baseline AARC score, MELD score, and the dynamic SURFASA score on day 3 can accurately identify early non-response to steroids in AIH-ACLF.",

        "abstract": "Many of the medicinally active molecules in the flavonoid class of phytochemicals are being researched for their potential antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses. Quercetin is a flavonoid that can be found in a variety of foods, including fruits and vegetables. It has been reported to be effective against a variety of viruses. This review, therefore, deciphered the mechanistic of how Quercetin works against some of the deadliest viruses, such as influenza A, Hepatitis C, Dengue type 2 and Ebola virus, which cause frequent outbreaks worldwide and result in significant morbidity and mortality in humans through epidemics or pandemics. All those have an alarming impact on both human health and the global and national economies. The review extended computing the Quercetin-contained natural recourse and its modes of action in different experimental approaches leading to antiviral actions. The gap in effective treatment emphasizes the necessity of a search for new effective antiviral compounds. Quercetin shows potential antiviral activity and inhibits it by targeting viral infections at multiple stages. The suppression of viral neuraminidase, proteases and DNA/RNA polymerases and the alteration of many viral proteins as well as their immunomodulation are the main molecular mechanisms of Quercetin's antiviral activities. Nonetheless, the huge potential of Quercetin and its extensive use is inadequately approached as a therapeutic for emerging and re-emerging viral infections. Therefore, this review enumerated the food-functioned Quercetin source, the modes of action of Quercetin for antiviral effects and made insights on the mechanism-based antiviral action of Quercetin.",

This review summarizes the latest knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, testing, and treatment of HEV infection. We also focused on Bangladesh to highlight the distinct challenges and the possible remedies. In low-income settings, the virus is mainly transmitted between people by fecal contamination of drinking water causing large outbreaks, and sporadic cases. The disease is usually mild and self-limiting acute hepatitis. Still, pregnant women and their offspring in low-income countries are at particular risk for severe disease, with up to 20% maternal mortality. Despite the high burden of the disease, HEV remains a relatively neglected virus, with detection hampered by costly tests and a lack of suitable treatments. Molecular PCR diagnostics, together with ELISA antibody tests, remain the preferred methods for diagnosis of HEV; however, rapid bedside diagnostics are available and could offer a practical alternative, especially in low-income countries. One vaccine (HEV 239) is only available in China and Pakistan, as efficacy against the other genotypes remains uncertain. The effectiveness trial conducted in Bangladesh might lead the way in gathering more efficacy data and could, together with improved surveillance and raised awareness, dramatically reduce the global burden of HEV.",

This study investigated the hepatitis B vaccination coverage among Bangladeshi HCWs in selected tertiary care hospitals. Between September 2020 to January 2021, a multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in 11 hospitals across Bangladesh. Participants included physicians, nurses, cleaners, and administrative staff. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were used to analyze the data. The overall hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 66.6% (1363/2046) among HCWs, with cleaning staff having the lowest at 38.8%. Among the unvaccinated, 89.2% of HCWs desired to receive the free vaccine in the near future. In the last year, over one-fourth of staff (27.9%) had at least one history of needlestick injury. Only 9.8% HCWs were found to have attended training on hepatitis B virus prevention and management in the previous two years. Multivariate analysis revealed that physicians (AOR: 7.13, 95% CI: 4.94-10.30) and nurses (AOR: 6.00, 95% CI: 4.09-8.81) were more likely to be vaccinated against hepatitis B than cleaners and administrative staff.

        "abstract": "The livestock sector contributes 1.90% to the GDP in Bangladesh during 2021-22. Poultry is one of the important subsectors struggling with diseases. Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) cause numerous diseases resulting in economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Several FAdV serotypes cause inclusion body hepatitis in chicken. Although FAdV infection was suspected, there was no confirmatory report from Bangladesh. The study was conducted to investigate the FAdV infection and antibodies in chicken. A total of 50 samples, each composed of liver and spleen, were collected from different chickens of Gazipur, Dinajpur, and Panchagarh district. Each location belongs to A, B, and C poultry zones of Bangladesh, respectively. Viruses were detected by real-time PCR and conventional PCR. Blood samples (<i>n</i> = 303) were collected at the beginning and after the recovery from infection and tested by indirect ELISA. Sequencing of PCR products was done for serotyping and phylogenetic analysis. Clinical signs were observed including anorexia, drowsiness, ruffled feathers, reduced body weight, lack of uniformity, and high mortality (15-25%). Enlarged friable liver with yellow to tan color mottled with the focal soft area, fluid in pericardial sac, swollen and hemorrhagic kidneys, enlarged congested spleen and pancreas, etc. were found on postmortem examination. FAdVs were detected in 90% of the flocks except commercial layer flock from Dinajpur. Three serotypes, namely, 8b (70%), 11 (10%), and 5 (10%) were detected. Anti-FAdV antibody was detected in 80% flocks at the beginning of infection and in 90% of the flocks after recovery from infection. The antibody titer increases significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) after recovery from infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Bangladeshi FAdVs have close identity with viruses from Asia, Europe, and South and North America. These findings suggested that several introductions of FAdVs were taken place in Bangladesh. To combat the disease, vaccination along with maintenance of biosecurity is essential.",

The sudden rise in cases has mainly been among the pediatric population of around 35 countries around the world, including developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and European countries. The outbreaks have had a devastating impact, with around 10% of the affected patients developing liver failure. The clinical presentation of patients resembles any other case of acute hepatitis, with the major symptoms being: jaundice (68.8%), vomiting (57.6%), and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain (36.1%) and nausea (25.7%). Interestingly, the cases have tested negative for hepatotropic viruses Hep A, B, C, and E, thus giving rise to the terms Hepatitis of Unknown Origin or non-HepA-E hepatitis. Many causes have been attributed to the disease, with major evidence seen for adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2. International agencies have stressed on establishing diagnostic and management protocols to limit these outbreaks. As the understanding has evolved over time, diagnostic and management faculties have found more shape. The current review was designed to comprehensively compile all existing data and whittle it down to evidence-based conclusions to help clinicians.",

A three-dose regimen of a vaccine against HEV (HEV 239) has shown promising results in China. The effects and safety of this vaccine in other populations and with different dosing regimens remains uncertain. Investigate the immune response and safety of a two-dose regimen with the HEV 239 vaccine among healthy adults. Examine the feasibility of conducting a larger HEV 239 vaccine trial in rural Bangladesh. One-hundred healthy men and non-pregnant women 16-39 years old were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of either the study (HEV) or control (Hepatitis B virus, HBV) vaccine (at 0, 1 month). Blood samples were collected at day 0, day 60 and 2 years after vaccination. The primary endpoints were the proportion and severity of adverse events up to 2 months after dose one and the longitudinal shift in anti-HEV IgG levels from day 0 to day 60 and 2 years after vaccination. Adverse events to HEV 239 were comparable to the control vaccine, mild in severity and resolved within one to nine days. All participants in the study group seroconverted and achieved high levels of HEV IgG antibodies that remained positive for two years in all but one. A T-cell response was detected one month after HEV 239 vaccination. Our results show that two doses of the HEV 239 vaccine produces broad and likely functional immune responses against HEV that remain for at least two years. The safety profile was acceptable and a phase four study of HEV 239 in rural Bangladesh is feasible. gov Identifier: NCT02759991.",

We need to have a simple and cheap biochemical test in resource poor countries like Bangladesh, to pick up BA early. Serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) has been shown to be a useful marker to differentiate BA from INH. Objective of the study was to find out the diagnostic value of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in differentiating Biliary atresia (BA) from idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH). This observational cross section study was carried out at the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Study period was from January 2014 to June 2015. Consecutive infants with neonatal cholestasis (defined as conjugated bilirubin >1.0mg/dL when total bilirubin was ≤5.0 or >20.0% to total bilirubin) were included in this study. Clinical details and the results of laboratory tests were recorded in a proforma. BA was diagnosed on the basis of liver biopsy. Different biochemical parameters especially the results of serum GGT level (normal up to 60U/L), were compared between two groups (BA and INH). Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve for GGT was constructed to find out the best cut off value to discriminate BA from INH by using SPSS (version 20.0). After confirming cholestasis, a total of 165 cases were enrolled for study. Among them 86 cases were diagnosed as INH or BA. Among these 86 cases, 38(44.2%) cases were BA and 48(55.8%) cases were INH. On comparing 38(44.2%) cases of BA with 48(55.8%) cases of INH it was found that low birth weight (13.0% vs. 31.0%, p<0.05), persistently acholic stools (76.0% vs. 44.0%, p=0.002) and mean GGT values (921 vs. 264, p<0.001) were significantly different between them. At a cut off value of 524U/L (8.7 times upper limit of normal) the area under curve (AUC) for GGT was 0.81 with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy were 81.7%, 72.9%, 70.5%, 83.3% and 76.1% respectively for the diagnosis of Biliary atresia. Serum GGT value of >524 U/L or 8.7 times upper limit of normal value was fairly good in differentiating BA from INH and can be used as a screening investigation in developing countries.",

Here, we conducted this systematic review to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and determinants in children worldwide. In this systematic review and meta-analysis study, we searched international and preprinted scientific databases from December 1, 2019 to July 10, 2022. Pooled seroprevalences were estimated according to World Health Organization (WHO) regions (at 95% confidence intervals, CIs) using random-effects meta-analyses. Associations with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and sources of heterogeneity were investigated using sub-group and meta-regression analyses. The protocol used in this study has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022350833). We included 247 studies involving 757,075 children from 70 countries. Seroprevalence estimates varied from 7.3% (5.8-9.1%) in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to 37.6% (18.1-59.4%) in the fifth wave and 56.6% (52.8-60.5%) in the sixth wave. The highest seroprevalences in different pandemic waves were estimated for South-East Asia (17.9-81.8%) and African (17.2-66.1%) regions; while the lowest seroprevalence was estimated for the Western Pacific region (0.01-1.01%). Seroprevalence estimates were higher in children at older ages, in those living in underprivileged countries or regions, and in those of minority ethnic backgrounds. Our findings indicate that, by the end of 2021 and before the Omicron wave, around 50-70% of children globally were still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, clearly emphasising the need for more effective vaccines and better vaccination coverage among children and adolescents, particularly in developing countries and minority ethnic groups.

Therefore, in this context, there is no exception to public participation in disease burden reduction. Consequently, for the first time in Bangladesh, the current study aims to assess the level of vaccination status, knowledge, attitude, and practice of hepatitis B infection among general people. A cross-sectional study was carried out between December 15, 2021, and January 17, 2022, including sociodemographic information as well as questions about vaccination status and knowledge, attitude, and practice related to hepatitis B. Data were analyzed using descriptive (frequency) and inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>, Kruskal-Wallis <i>H</i>, <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>, binary logistic regression, and spearman's rho correlation coefficient). Results indicated that about one-third (37.9%) of the 807 participants had received hepatitis B vaccine, with an overall mean score of 11.506 ± 5.403 for knowledge, 5.435 ± 1.038 and 4.252 ± 1.776 for attitude and practice, respectively. Risk factors related to vaccination were age, religion, educational qualification, occupation, residence area, marital status, comorbidity, and family member suffering from hepatitis B. Higher level of knowledge was significantly found among the young people aged between 10 and 29; had higher secondary or tertiary education (median = 13); were employed (median = 13.5, interquartile range [IQR] = 8); living in divisional city (median = 13, IQR = 7); were single (media = 13, IQR = 7); and whose family members were suffering from hepatitis B.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. In many low-income countries it causes large outbreaks and disproportionally affects pregnant women and their offspring. Surveillance studies to find effective preventive interventions are needed but are hampered by the lack of funding and infrastructure. Dried blood spots (DBS) offer an easier and more robust way to collect, transport, and store blood samples compared to plasma/serum samples, and could ease some of the barriers for such studies. In this study we optimize an HEV IgG ELISA for DBS samples and validate it on 300 paired DBS and plasma samples collected in rural areas of Bangladesh from participants in a HEV vaccine study. We demonstrate that HEV IgG in blood stored as DBS is stable for two months at up to 40 °C, and for five freeze-thaw cycles. The specificity was 97% and the overall sensitivity of the DBS assay was 81%. The sensitivity was higher in samples from vaccinated participants (100%) compared to previously infected participants (59%), reflecting a positive correlation between IgG titer and sensitivity. We found a strong correlation between DBS and plasma samples with an r2 of 0.90, but with a higher degree of difference between individual paired samples. Our study shows that DBS offers a stable alternative to plasma/serum for HEV IgG measurements and can facilitate serological studies, particularly in resource limited areas.",

It is responsible for approximately 3% of adult malignancies, and 90-95% of neoplasms originate from the kidney. Advances in tumor diagnosis, innovative immune therapeutics, and checkpoint inhibitors-based treatment options improved the survival rate of patients with RCC accompanied by different risk factors. RCC patients with diabetes, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or obesity (OB) may have a comorbidity, and finding the risk factor for better clinical treatment is an urgent issue. Therefore, the study focused on network-based gene expression analysis approaches to learning the impact of RCC on other comorbidities associated with the disease. The study found critical genetic factors and signal transduction pathways that share pathophysiology and commonly use dysregulated genes of the illness. Initially, the study identified 385 up-regulated genes and 338 down-regulated genes involved with RCC. OB, chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and HCV significantly shared 28, 14, 5, and 3 genes, respectively. RCC shared one down-regulated gene versican (VCAN) with OB and HCV and one down-regulated gene oxidase homolog 2 (LOXL2) with OB and CKD. Interestingly, most of the shared pathways were linked with metabolism. The study also identified six prospective biomarkers, signaling pathways, and numerous critical regulatory and associated drug candidates for the disease. We believe that the discovery will help explain these diseases' complicated interplay and aid in developing novel therapeutic targets and drug candidates.",

However, there is no approved regimen of vaccine therapy for the treatment of CHB. This is mainly attributable to faulty conception, an improper understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CHB, and the impaired design of vaccine therapy for CHB. With the advent of new techniques and a better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the genesis of CHB, the limitations and failures of previous regimens of therapeutic vaccines have been primarily understood. Additionally, the importance of immune therapy for treating millions of CHB patients and achieving the target of \"Elimination of Hepatitis by 2030\" has been focused on in the international arena. This has been amplified by the apparent limitation of commercially available antiviral drugs that are infinite in duration, endowed with safety concerns, and unable to cure liver damage due to their minimal immune modulation capacities. The proposed review article comprehensively discusses each of these points and proposes evidence-based approaches for viable types of vaccine therapy for the treatment of CHB.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a waterborne zoonotic disease that can result in a high fatality rate in pregnant women and infants. In 2018, a large HEV outbreak emerged in Chattogram, Bangladesh, resulting in 2800 cases and a significant public health response to mitigate the transmission. While the source of the outbreak remained poorly understood, authorities suggested that possible risk factors for HEV infection included contamination of water supply, exacerbated by concurrent severe flooding events in the community. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the distribution and risk factors for HEV seroprevalence between January and December 2018 in the Chattogram city area. A total of 505 blood samples were collected from symptomatic patients of 10 hospitals who met the case definition for an HEV infection. Standard ELISA tests were performed in all patients to identify anti-HEV antibodies. The size and location of HEV seroprevalence clusters within Chattogram were investigated using SaTScan. We investigated the association between risk of HEV infection and individual and environmentally lagged risk factors using Bernoulli generalised linear regression models. Our results indicate an overall HEV seroprevalence of 35% with significant variation according to sex, source of drinking water, and boiling of drinking water. A positive cross-correlation was found between HEV exposure and precipitation, modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI), and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our model indicated that risk of infection was associated with sex, age, source of drinking water, boiling of water, increased precipitation, and increased MNDWI. The results from this study indicate that source and boiling of drinking water and increased precipitation were critical drivers of the 2018 HEV outbreak. The communities at highest risk identified in our analyses should be targeted for investments in safe water infrastructure to reduce the likelihood of future HEV outbreaks in Chattogram.",

        "abstract": "Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a hypothesis-free approach for pathogen detection, but its applicability in clinical diagnosis, in addition to other factors, remains limited due to complicated library construction. The present study describes a PCR-free isothermal workflow for mNGS targeting RNA, based on a multiple displacement amplification, termed circular whole-transcriptome amplification (cWTA), as the template is circularized before amplification. The cWTA approach was validated with clinical samples and nanopore sequencing. Reads homologous to dengue virus 2 and chikungunya virus were detected in clinical samples from Bangladesh and Brazil, respectively. In addition, the practicality of a high-throughput detection system that combines mNGS and a group testing algorithm termed mNGS screening enhanced by a group testing algorithm (mEGA) was established. This approach enabled significant library size reduction while permitting trackability between samples and diagnostic results. Serum samples of patients with undifferentiated febrile illnesses from Vietnam (<i>n</i> = 43) were also amplified with cWTA, divided into 11 pools, processed for library construction, and sequenced. Dengue virus 2, hepatitis B virus, and parvovirus B19 were successfully detected without prior knowledge of their existence. Collectively, cWTA with the nanopore platform opens the possibility of hypothesis-free on-site comprehensive pathogen diagnosis, while mEGA contributes to the scaling up of sample throughput. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Given the breadth of pathogens that cause infections, a single approach that can detect a wide range of pathogens is ideal but is impractical due to the available tests being highly specific to a certain pathogen. Recent developments in sequencing technology have introduced mNGS as an alternative that provides detection of a wide-range of pathogens by detecting the presence of their nucleic acids in the sample. However, sequencing library preparation is still a bottleneck, as it is complicated, costly, and time-consuming. In our studies, alternative approaches to optimize library construction for mNGS were developed. This included isothermal nucleic acid amplification and expansion of sample throughput with a group testing algorithm. These methods can improve the utilization of mNGS as a diagnostic tool and can serve as a high-throughput screening system aiding infectious disease surveillance.",

The clinical variation of GBS across geographical regions has been suggested to be related to differences in the distribution of preceding infections, but this has not been studied on a large scale. We analyzed the first 1,000 patients included in the International GBS Outcome Study with available biosamples (n = 768) for the presence of a recent infection with <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>, hepatitis E virus, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. Serologic evidence of a recent infection with <i>C. jejuni</i> was found in 228 (30%), <i>M. pneumoniae</i> in 77 (10%), hepatitis E virus in 23 (3%), cytomegalovirus in 30 (4%), and Epstein-Barr virus in 7 (1%) patients. Evidence of more than 1 recent infection was found in 49 (6%) of these patients. Symptoms of antecedent infections were reported in 556 patients (72%), and this proportion did not significantly differ between those testing positive or negative for a recent infection. The proportions of infections were similar across continents. The sensorimotor variant and the demyelinating electrophysiologic subtype were most frequent across all infection groups, although proportions were significantly higher in patients with a cytomegalovirus and significantly lower in those with a <i>C. jejuni</i> infection. <i>C. jejuni</i>-positive patients were more severely affected, indicated by a lower Medical Research Council sum score at nadir (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and a longer time to regain the ability to walk independently (<i>p</i> = 0.005). The pure motor variant and axonal electrophysiologic subtype were more frequent in Asian compared with American or European <i>C. jejuni</i>-positive patients (<i>p</i> < 0.001, resp. <i>p</i> = 0.001). Time to nadir was longer in the cytomegalovirus-positive patients (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Across geographical regions, the distribution of infections was similar, but the association between infection and clinical phenotype differed.

Multiple amino acid changes in genotype 1 HEV (HEV-1) are reportedly linked to FHF clinical cases, but experimental confirmation of the roles of these changes in FHF is lacking. By utilizing the HEV-1 indicator replicon and infectious clone, we generated 11 HEV-1 single mutants, each with an individual mutation, and investigated the effect of these mutations on HEV replication and infection in human liver cells. We demonstrated that most of the mutations actually impaired HEV-1 replication efficiency compared with the wild type (WT), likely due to altered physicochemical properties and structural conformations. However, two mutations, A317T and V1120I, significantly increased HEV-1 replication. Notably, these two mutations simultaneously occurred in 100% of 21 HEV-1 variants from patients with FHF in Bangladesh. We further created an HEV-1 A317T/V1120I double mutant and found that it greatly enhanced HEV replication, which may explain the rapid viral replication and severe disease. Furthermore, we tested the effect of these FHF-associated mutations on genotype 3 HEV (HEV-3) replication and found that all the mutants had a reduced level of replication ability and infectivity, which is not unexpected due to distinct infection patterns between HEV-1 and HEV-3. Additionally, we demonstrated that these FHF-associated mutations do not appear to alter their sensitivity to ribavirin (RBV), suggesting that ribavirin remains a viable option for antiviral therapy for patients with FHF.

The spread of HEV to the environment might pollute surface waters, which could act as the source of infection for both humans and animals. Identification of the virus in animal products suggests the circulation of HEV within water and food chains. High seroprevalence and circulation of HEV in livestock, in particular pigs, as well as in environmental samples warrants further investigation into pig markets. HEV virulence in different environments and meat supply chains could shed light on the possible sources of infection in humans and the degree of occupational risk.

This data included demographic profile, severity of liver disease, and rebleeding and mortality in 6 weeks. These outcomes were compared with a propensity score matched (PSM) cohort of ACLF matched for severity of liver disease (MELD, AARC score) without AVB (ACLF without AVB). Of the 4434 ACLF patients, the outcomes in ACLF-AVB (n = 72) [mean age-46 ± 10.4 years, 93% males, 66% with alcoholic liver disease, 65% with alcoholic hepatitis, AARC score: 10.1 ± 2.2, MELD score: 34 (IQR: 27-40)] were compared with a PSM cohort selected in a ratio of 1:2 (n = 143) [mean age-44.9 ± 12.5 years, 82.5% males, 48% alcoholic liver disease, 55.7% alcoholic hepatitis, AARC score: 9.4 ± 1.5, MELD score: 32 (IQR: 24-40)] of ACLF-without AVB. Despite PSM, ACLF patients with AVB had a higher baseline HVPG than without AVB (25.00 [IQR: 23.00-28.00] vs. 17.00 [15.00-21.75] mmHg; p = 0.045). The 6-week mortality in ACLF patients with or without AVB was 70.8% and 53.8%, respectively (p = 0.025). The 6-week rebleeding rate was 23% in ACLF-AVB. Presence of ascites [hazard ratio (HR) 2.2 (95% CI 1.03-9.8), p = 0.026], AVB [HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-2.5, p = 0.03)], and MELD score [HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.1), p = 0.001] independently predicted mortality in the overall ACLF cohort. Development of AVB confers poor outcomes in patients with ACLF with a high 6-week mortality. Elevated HVPG at baseline represents a potential risk factor for future AVB in ACLF.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health problem despite the availability of an effective prophylactic HBV vaccine. Current antiviral therapies are unable to fully cure chronic hepatitis B (CHB) because of the persistent nature of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a replicative template for HBV, which necessitates the development of alternative therapeutic approaches. The CRISPR/Cas system, a newly emerging genome editing tool, holds great promise for genome editing and gene therapy. Several <i>in vitro</i> and/or <i>in vivo</i> studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of HBV-specific clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) systems in cleaving HBV DNA and cccDNA. Although recent advances in CRISPR/Cas technology enhance its prospects for clinical application against HBV infection, <i>in vivo</i> delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 system at targets sites remains a major challenge that needs to be resolved before its clinical application in gene therapy for CHB. In the present review, we discuss CRISPR/Cas9 delivery tools for targeting HBV infection, with a focus on the development of adeno-associated virus vectors and lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based CRISPR/Cas ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery to treat CHB. In addition, we discuss the importance of delivery tools in the enhancement of the antiviral efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 against HBV infection.",

        "title": "Natural flavonoids effectively block the CD81 receptor of hepatocytes and inhibit HCV infection: a computational drug development approach.",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health concern, and almost two million people are infected per year globally. This is occurred by the diverse spectrum of viral genotypes, which are directly associated with chronic liver disease (fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Indeed, the viral genome encodes three principal proteins as sequentially core, E1, and E2. Both E1 and E2 proteins play a crucial role in the attachment of the host system, but E2 plays a more fundamental role in attachment. The researchers have found the \"E2-CD81 complex\" at the entry site, and therefore, CD81 is the key receptor for HCV entrance in both humans, and chimpanzees. So, the researchers are trying to block the host CD81 receptor and halt the virus entry within the cellular system via plant-derived compounds. Perhaps that is why the current research protocol is designed to perform an in silico analysis of the flavonoid compounds for targeting the tetraspanin CD81 receptor of hepatocytes. To find out the best flavonoid compounds from our library, web-based tools (Swiss ADME, pKCSM), as well as computerized tools like the PyRx, PyMOL, BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer, Ligplot+ V2.2, and YASARA were employed. For molecular docking studies, the flavonoid compounds docked with the targeted CD81 protein, and herein, the best-outperformed compounds are Taxifolin, Myricetin, Puerarin, Quercetin, and (-)-Epicatechin, and outstanding binding affinities are sequentially - 7.5, - 7.9, - 8.2, - 8.4, and - 8.5 kcal/mol, respectively. These compounds have possessed more interactions with the targeted protein. To validate the post docking data, we analyzed both 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation, and MM-PBSA via the YASARA simulator, and finally finds the more significant outcomes. It is concluded that in the future, these compounds may become one of the most important alternative antiviral agents in the fight against HCV infection. It is suggested that further in vivo, and in vitro research studies should be done to support the conclusions of this in silico research workflow.",

We report a novel variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Bangladesh isolated from a patient co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who exhibited liver cirrhosis. From 150 collected plasma samples, we sequenced HBV complete genome from one HBV-HCV co-infected patient. The complete genome was analysed using bioinformatics tools, NCBI BLAST, Geno2Pheno, and SnapGene software. The strain belongs to genotype A and subgenotype A1. Upon analysing the complete genome of this strain, we found a frameshift deletion of 54 nucleotides at the pre-S2 region, a functional regulator of HBV surface protein. Furthermore, we observed a Y126H mutation in the polymerase protein of this strain. This is the first report with such an unusual pre-S deletion event of the HBV genome in an HCV-co-infected patient associated with liver cirrhosis.

        "abstract": "Gynura nepalensis D.C. (family: Asteraceae) has abundant uses in the alternative medicinal practice, and this species is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes, rheumatism, cuts or wounds, asthma, kidney stones, cough, urinary tract bleeding, gall bladder stones, hepatitis, diarrhea, hemorrhoids, constipation, vomiting, fertility problems, blood poisoning, septicemia, skin allergy, indigestion, high cholesterol levels, and so on. This study aims to investigate the hepatoprotective and antioxidant potential of the methanol extract of the Gynura nepalensis D.C. (GNME) along with chemical profiling with phytochemical screening. Moreover, prospective phytocompounds have been screened virtually to present the binding affinity of the bioactive components to the hepatic and oxidative receptors. In the hepatoprotective study, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), and lipid peroxidation (LP) and total bilirubin (TB) have been assessed, and in the antioxidant study, the DPPH free radical scavenging, total antioxidant flavonoid, and phenolic contents were determined. Moreover, the molecular binding affinity of the bioactive component of the plant has been analyzed using PyRx AutoDock Vina, Chimera, and Discovery Studio software. The plant extract showed dose-dependent hepatoprotective potential (p < 0.05, 0.01, 0.001) as well as strong antioxidant properties. Moreover, hepatoprotective and antioxidant molecular docking studies revealed a result varying from −2.90 kcal/mol to −10.1 kcal/mol. 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid revealed the highest binding affinity among the selected molecules. However, the plant showed portent antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties in the in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models, and it is presumed that the hepatoprotective properties of the plant extract have occurred due to the presence of the vast bioactive chemical compounds as well as their antioxidant properties. Therefore, advanced studies are recommended to elucidate the pharmacological properties of the plant extracts.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a highly complicated pathological process in which the disease is initiated by the hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, host immune responses are primarily responsible for variable extents of liver damage. If the patients with CHB remain untreated, many CHB patients will eventually develop complications like cirrhosis of the liver (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In 2019, an estimated 882,000 patients died due to HBV-related complications worldwide. Accordingly, several drugs with antiviral properties have been used to treat CHB patients during the last four decades. However, the treatment outcome is not satisfactory because viral suppression is not usually related to the containment of progressive liver damage. Although proper reconstruction of host immunity is essential in CHB patients, as of today, there is no acceptable immune therapeutic protocol for them. These realities have exposed new, novel, and innovative therapeutic regimens for the management of CHB patients. This review will update the scope and limitation of the different innovative antiviral and immune therapeutic approaches for restoring effective host immunity and containing the virus in CHB patients to block progression to LC and HCC.",

A proper understanding of the TLR response in HCV infection is essential for devising new therapeutic approaches against HCV infection.

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the biggest communicable causes of mortality worldwide. While incidence in the UK has continued to fall since 2011, Bradford retains one of the highest TB rates in the UK. This study aims to examine the local disease burden of musculoskeletal (MSK) TB, by analyzing common presenting factors within the famously diverse population of Bradford. An observational study was conducted, using data from the Bradford Teaching Hospitals TB database of patients with a formal diagnosis of MSK TB between January 2005 and July 2017. Patient data included demographic data (including nationality/date of entry to the UK), disease focus, microbiology, and management strategies. Disease incidence was calculated using population data from the Office for National Statistics. Poisson confidence intervals were calculated to demonstrate the extent of statistical error. Disease incidence and nationality were also analyzed, and correlation sought, using the chi-squared test. Between January 2005 and July 2017, 109 cases of MSK TB were diagnosed in Bradford. Mean incidence was 1.65 per 100,000 population, per calendar year (SD 0.75). A total of 38 cases required surgical intervention. Low rates of antimicrobial resistance were encountered. A low rate of loss to follow-up was observed (four patients; 3.7%). Overall, 94.5% of patients (n = 103) were successfully treated. 67% of patients (n = 73) reported their country of origin as either India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. These ethnicities account for around 25% of the local population. Bradford maintains a high prevalence of MSK TB infection relative to national data; the prevalence within the local immigrant population remains grossly disproportionate. Typical associated factors (HIV/hepatitis coinfection, drug resistance), have only modest prevalence in our dataset. However, local socioeconomic factors such as deprivation and poverty appear germane as suggested by global literature. We advocate a high degree of suspicion in treatment of atypical infection in any area with similar population factors to ensure timely diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Modest improvements in household water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and typhoid vaccination can reduce typhoid risk in endemic settings. However, empiric evaluation of their combined impact is lacking. A total of 62,756 persons residing in 80 clusters in a Kolkata slum were allocated randomly 1:1 to either the typhoid Vi polysaccharide (ViPS) vaccine or hepatitis A (Hep A) vaccine. Surveillance was conducted for 2 years before and 2 years after vaccination. We classified households as having \"better\" or \"not better\" WASH, and calculated the prevalence of better WASH households in clusters using previously validated criteria. We evaluated the protection by better household WASH, better household WASH prevalence, and ViPS vaccination against typhoid in all cluster members present at baseline using Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, ViPS vaccination was associated with a 55% (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 35-69) reduction of typhoid risk and was similar regardless of better WASH in the residence. Living in a better WASH household was associated with a typhoid risk reduction of 31% (P = 0.16; 95% CI, -16 to 59) overall. The reduction was 48% (P = 0.05; 95% CI, -1 to 73) in Hep A clusters, 6% (P = 0.85; 95% CI, -82 to 51) in ViPS clusters, and 57% (P < 0.05; 95% CI, 15-78) in the population during the 2 years preceding the trial. These findings demonstrate a preventive association of better household WASH in the non-ViPS population, but, unexpectedly, an absence of additional protection from ViPS by better WASH in the ViPS population. This analysis highlights the importance of assessing the combination of WASH in conjunction with typhoid vaccines, and has implications for the evaluation of new-generation typhoid conjugate vaccines.",

Most follow-up studies in different countries showed a similar pattern of antibody decline with increasing age. Many authors observed a declined level of HBs-antibody over a period of 3-6 years. This study was aimed at to observe immune status in children 7 years or more after primary hepatitis B vaccination. This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted at the department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, BSMMU, Dhaka, Bangladesh from April 2015 to March 2016. For this study children of both sexes aged between 7 to 18 years, who had history of 2 or more doses of hepatitis B vaccine 7 or more years back were included in the study. All the serum samples were tested for anti HBs by chemiluminescence's technique. Total 120 children were studied among them male was 59.2% and male female ratio was 1.4:1 with a mean age of 8.6±1.7 years. Good immune response (66.7%) was observed against hepatitis B. Significantly higher geometric mean titer of anti HBs was found in the age group of 7-8 years (p=0.02). Waning of immunity including non seroprotectivity was significantly associated with increasing age (p=0.015). Majority (96.7%) of children received EPI vaccination than commercially available vaccine. Children with weight for age percentile (WAP), height for age percentile (HAP) and BMI for age lies below 5th percentile had comparatively lower non seroprotection rate than normal children, but this was not statistically significant. History of dental or surgical procedure, blood transfusion and family history of contact with known case of hepatitis B infection did not have any significant inference on anti- HBs response. The study detected a good immune response against hepatitis B. About 66.7% of children were seroprotective 7 years or more after primary hepatitis B vaccination. Waning of immunity including non seroprotectivity was significantly associated with increasing age. Further studies with larger sample size are needed about booster dose to come to a final conclusion.",

        "abstract": "Gastritis can lead to ulcers and the development of gastric cancer. The rhizome of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (Asteraceae), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, is prescribed for the treatment of gastric disorders, hepatitis and rheumatism. Its bio-active compounds are considered to be particularly effective in this regard. However, the molecular processes of the herb's anti-inflammatory activity remain obscure. This study elucidates a mechanism upon which an ethanolic extract of this herb (Am-EE) exerts anti-inflammation effects in RAW264.7 macrophage cells (RAW cells) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and HCl Ethanol-stimulated gastritis rats. To investigate the anti-gastritis activities of Am-EE and explore the mode of action. Ethanol (95%) was used to prepare Am-EE. The quality of the extract was monitored by HPLC analysis. The in vivo effects of this extract were examined in an HCl Ethanol-stimulated gastritis rat model, while LPS-stimulated RAW cells were used for in vitro assays. Cell viability and nitric oxide (NO) production were observed by MTT and Griess assays. Real-time PCR was used to examine mRNA expression. The PGE<sub>2</sub> ELISA kit was employed to detect prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>). Enzyme activities and protein contents were examined by immunoblotting. Luciferase reporter gene assays (LRA) were employed to observe nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB activity. The SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, United States) application was used for statistical examination. HPLC analysis indicates that Am-EE contains atractylenolide-1 (AT-1, 1.33%, w/w) and atractylenolide-2 (AT-2, 1.25%, w/w) (Additional Figure. A1). Gastric tissue damage (induced by HCl Ethanol) was significantly decreased in SD rats following intra-gastric application of 35 mg/kg Am-EE. Indistinguishable to the anti-inflammation effects of 35 mg/kg ranitidine (gastric medication). Am-EE treatment also reduced LPS-mediated nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production. The mRNA and protein synthesis of inducible cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and NO synthase (iNOS) was down-regulated following treatment in RAW cells. Am-EE decreased NF-κB (p50) nuclear protein levels and inhibited NF-κB-stimulated LRA activity in RAW cells. Lastly, Am-EE decreased the up-regulated levels of phosphorylated IκBα and Akt proteins in rat stomach lysates and in LPS challenged RAW cell samples. Our study illustrates that Am-EE suppresses the Akt/IκBα/NF-κB pathway and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. These novel conclusions provide a pharmacological basis for the clinical use of the A. macrocephala rhizome in the treatment and prevention of gastritis and gastric cancer.",

        "abstract": "Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) comprise a group of haematologic malignancies with different histologic subtypes. The clinical picture varies from indolent to aggressive presentation and nodal (lymphadenopathy) to extranodal (central nervous system, gastrointestinal, cutaneous plaque, or ulcer) involvement. Digital gangrene is seldom reported. Here, we describe a patient with pain and blackening of all fingers and toes as presenting symptoms of NHL. <i>Case Presentation</i>. A 32-year-old male weaver had been smoking three to five cannabis-containing cigarettes daily for about ten years and methamphetamine four to five tablets daily for five years. He had no history of Raynaud's phenomenon, fever, cough, weight loss, skin rash, joint pain, and atherogenic or thrombogenic risk factors. We found normal blood pressure and absent peripheral pulses in arms and legs, dry gangrene of all fingers and toes, generalized lymphadenopathy, and hepatomegaly with ascites. The chest X-ray was normal, as were blood sugar, lipid profile, and hepatic and renal function. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies, C-ANCA and P-ANCA, hepatitis B and C, and HIV were negative. CT abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly with multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies. The peripheral angiogram showed 90-99% stenosis of radial and dorsalis pedis arteries with normal proximal vessels. Diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was confirmed by histopathology of cervical lymph node (diffuse type), immunohistochemically subtyped as peripheral T cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified). The digital ischemia worsened despite cessation of cannabis and methamphetamine and starting CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) treatment, making amputation necessary. We present, to our knowledge, the first report of peripheral T cell lymphoma, NOS presenting with gangrene in all digits complicated by methamphetamine and cannabis abuse. This uncommon vascular manifestation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may cause a diagnostic dilemma and delayed initiation of treatment.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review was aimed to estimate hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence and burden in disease in WHO South East Asia Region (SEAR). Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar) and websites of non-indexed national medical journals, government and international health agencies were searched to identify English language literature published between 1991 and June 2020. We selected the studies reporting HCV seroprevalence in asymptomatic general (low-risk) and high-risk adult populations, that is, persons living with HIV (PLHIV), persons who inject drugs (PWID), sex workers, persons on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), people in prison, and men sex with men (MSM). Seroprevalence data were combined to estimate weighted pooled prevalence (95% confidence interval) in each group and in each country, using the random-effects model. Estimated pooled seroprevalences were multiplied with estimated populations at risk to estimate the overall HCV burden. The analysis included 538 studies (35 Bangladesh, 6 Bhutan, 2 DPR Korea, 323 India, 43 Indonesia, 2 Maldives, 18 Myanmar, 29 Nepal, 11 Sri Lanka, 67 Thailand, and 2 Timor-Leste). In SEAR, the weighted pooled anti-HCV seroprevalence was estimated as 0.84% (0.56-1.12) in low-risk population and 13.67% (10.95-16.40) in PLHIV, 51.44% (43.67-59.20) in PWID, 25.80% (20.34-32.09) in MHD, 8.39% (5.84-11.51) in prison inmates, 2.69% (1.43-4.13) in people with high-risk sex behavior, and 11.43% (8.61-14.74) in MSM. The total HCV burden in low-risk and high-risk populations in SEAR countries was estimated as 12.45 million and 1.65 million, respectively. Our estimates of HCV seroprevalence and burden should help the respective countries in planning their HCV elimination strategies.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus are three blood-borne viruses that can cause major global health issues by increasing severe morbidity. There is a high risk of coinfection with these viruses in individuals because of their same transmission routes through blood using shared needles, syringes, other injection equipment, sexual transmission, or even vertical transmission. Coinfection can cause various liver-related illnesses, non-hepatic organ dysfunction, followed by death compared to any of these single infections. The treatment of coinfected patients is complicated due to the side effects of antiviral medication, resulting in drug resistance, hepatotoxicity, and a lack of required responses. On the other hand, coinfected individuals must be treated with multiple drugs simultaneously, such as for HIV either along with HBV or HCV and HBV and HCV. Therefore, diagnosing, treating, and controlling dual infections with HIV, HBV, or HCV is complicated and needs further investigation. This review focuses on the current prevalence, risk factors, and pathogenesis of dual infections with HIV, HBV, and HCV. We also briefly overviewed the diagnosis and treatment of coinfections of these three blood-borne viruses.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is one of the most common causes of hepatitis, and may lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 296 million people worldwide are carriers of the hepatitis B virus. Various nucleos(t)ide analogs, which specifically suppress viral replication, are the main treatment agents for HBV infection. However, the development of drug-resistant HBV strains due to viral genomic mutations in genes encoding the polymerase protein is a major obstacle to HBV treatment. In addition, adverse effects can occur in patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs. Thus, alternative anti-HBV drugs of plant origin are being investigated as they exhibit excellent safety profiles and have few or no side effects. In this study, phytomedicines/phytochemicals exerting significant inhibitory effects on HBV by interfering with its replication were reviewed based on different compound groups. In addition, the chemical structures of these compounds were developed. This will facilitate their commercial synthesis and further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying their effects. The limitations of compounds previously screened for their anti-HBV effect, as well as future approaches to anti-HBV research, have also been discussed.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to estimate the pooled prevalence of HBV infection in Bangladesh. We systematically searched various electronic databases to retrieve relevant studies published until April 2021. A total of 15 studies were met the inclusion criteria and included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimated prevalence of HBV infection in the general population of Bangladesh from 1995 to 2017 was 4.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-5.1]. The results of subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence of hepatitis B was higher in females than males [odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% CI 0.48-2.97, P = 0.70], people of age <25 years had a higher prevalence than people of age >25 years (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.72-2.17, P = 0.42) and married people had a higher prevalence than unmarried/single people (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.51-3.10, P < 0.0001). The Egger's test statistics (P = 0.584), Begg and Mazumdar's rank correlation test (P = 0.054) indicated the absence of publication bias.

To further recognize binding interactions and their activity trends, molecular docking studies were carried out with the use of HCV, which can be used to accurately predict the interactions of ligands with the receptor. The QSAR models are developed through the use of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) together with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods. The statistical results indicate the multiple correlation coefficient R<sup>2</sup> = 0.840, which shows favorable estimation stability, as well as showing a significant correlation between the HCV NS3 protease of the studied compounds and their electron-accepting ability.

Out of the 59 CHB patients, 54 patients exhibited a reduction in HBV DNA, compared with their basal levels. Although all the patients had alanine transaminase (ALT) above the upper limit of normal (>42 IU/L) before the commencement of therapy, the levels of ALT were within the ULN level in 42 patients. No patient developed cirrhosis of the liver. The present study, showing the safety and efficacy of NASVAC 3 years after the EOT, is the first to report follow-up data of an immune therapeutic agent against CHB.

        "abstract": "Smoking a cigarette generates over 4000 chemicals that have a deleterious impact on each part of the human body. It produces three main severe effects on the liver organ: oncogenic, immunological, and indirect or direct toxic effects. It results in the production of cytotoxic substances, which raises fibrosis and necro-inflammation. Additionally, it also directs the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor alfa (TNF-<i>α</i>) and interleukins (IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-6) that will be responsible for the chronic liver injury. Furthermore, it gives rise to secondary polycythemia and successively raises the turnover and mass of red cells, which might be a common factor responsible for the development of oxidative stress in the liver due to iron overload. It also produces chemicals that are having oncogenic properties and raises the risk of liver cancer especially in sufferers of chronic hepatitis C. Smoking modulates both humoral and cell-mediated responses by restricting the proliferation of lymphocytes and inducing their apoptosis and ultimately decreasing the surveillance of cancer cells. Moreover, it has been determined that heavy smoking impacts the response of hepatitis C patients to interferon (IFN) therapy through different mechanisms, which can be improved by phlebotomy. Efforts are being made in different nations in decreasing the prevalence of smoking to improve premature death and ill effects of their nation's individuals.",

Traditionally, Heritiera littoralis, Ceriops decandra, Ligustrum sinense, and Polyscias scutellaria are used to treat pain, hepatitis, breast inflammation. The present research was designed to explore phytochemicals from the ethanol extracts of H. littoralis, C. decandra, L. sinense, and P. scutellaria to discern the possible pharmacophore (s) in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. The chemical compounds of experimental plants were identified through GC-MS analysis. Furthermore, in-vitro anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in human erythrocytes and an in-silico study was appraised against COX-2. The experimental extracts totally revealed 77 compounds in GC-MS analysis and all the extracts showed anti-inflammatory activity in in-vitro assays. The most favorable phytochemicals as anti-inflammatory agents were selected via ADMET profiling and molecular docking with specific protein of the COX-2 enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) confirmed the stability of the selected natural compound at the binding site of the protein. Three phytochemicals exhibited the better competitive result than the conventional anti-inflammatory drug naproxen in molecular docking and MDS studies. Both experimental and computational studies have scientifically revealed the folklore uses of the experimental medicinal plants in inflammatory disorders. Overall, N-(2-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (PubChem CID: 575170); Benzeneethanamine, 2-fluoro-. beta., 3, 4-trihydroxy-N-isopropyl (PubChem CID: 547892); and 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol (PubChem CID: 70825) could be the potential leads for COX-2 inhibitor for further evaluation of drug-likeliness.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in HBsAg, the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), might affect the serum HBV DNA level of HBV-infected patients, since the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase overlaps with the HBsAg-coding region. We previously identified a diagnostic escape mutant (W3S) HBV that produces massively glycosylated HBsAg. In this study, we constructed an HBV-producing vector that expresses W3S HBs (pHB-W3S) along with a wild-type HBV-producing plasmid (pHB-WT) in order to analyze the physicochemical properties, replication, and antiviral drug response of the mutant. Transfection of either pHB-WT or W3S into HepG2 cells yielded similar CsCl density profiles and eAg expression, as did transfection of a glycosylation defective mutant, pHB-W3S (N146G), in which a glycosylation site at the 146aa asparagine (N) site of HBs was mutated to glycine (G). Virion secretion, however, seemed to be severely impaired in cases of pHB-W3S and pHB-W3S (N146G), compared with pHB-WT, as determined by qPCR and Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, inhibition of glycosylation using tunicamycin<sup>TM</sup> on wild-type HBV production also reduced the virion secretion. These results suggested that the HBV core and Dane particle could be formed either by massively glycosylated or glycosylation-defective HBsAg, but reduced and/or almost completely blocked the virion secretion efficiency, indicating that balanced glycosylation of HBsAg is required for efficient release of HBV, and mutations inducing an imbalanced glycosylation of HBs would cause the virion to become stuck in the cells, which might be associated with various pathogeneses due to HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "Currently, viral infection is the most serious health issue which causing unexpected higher rate of death globally. Many viruses are not yet curable, such as corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis virus, human papilloma virus and so others. Furthermore, the toxicities and ineffective responses to resistant strains of synthetic antiviral drugs have reinforced the search of effective and alternative treatment options, such as plant-derived antiviral drug molecules. Therefore, in the present review, an attempt has been taken to summarize the medicinal plants reported for exhibiting antiviral activities available in Bangladesh along with discussing the mechanistic insights into their bioactive components against three most hazardous viruses, namely SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and HBV. The review covers 46 medicinal plants with antiviral activity from 25 families. Among the reported 79 bioactive compounds having antiviral activities isolated from these plants, about 37 of them have been reported for significant activities against varieties of viruses. Hesperidin, apigenin, luteolin, seselin, 6-gingerol, humulene epoxide, quercetin, kaempferol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) have been reported to inhibit multiple molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in a number of <i>in silico</i> investigations. Besides, numerous <i>in silico</i>, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> bioassays have been demonstrated that EGCG, anolignan-A, and B, ajoene, curcumin, and oleanolic acid exhibit anti-HIV activity while piperine, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, (+)-cycloolivil-4'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin, EGCG, kaempferol, aloin, apigenin, rosmarinic acid, andrographolide, and hesperidin possess anti-HBV activity. Thus, the antiviral medicinal plants and the isolated bioactive compounds may be considered for further advanced investigations with the aim of the development of effective and affordable antiviral drugs.",

As HEV occurs in epidemics, it limits medical capabilities in this resource-poor country. Cerebral oedema, resulting in raised intracranial pressure (ICP), is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Practical treatments are currently few. To study the baseline characteristics and clinical outcome of HEV-induced ALF in a recent HEV epidemicTo detect raised ICP clinically and observe response to mannitol infusion.This was a prospective cohort study from June until August 2018 of 20 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a major Bangladeshi Referral Hospital with HEV-induced ALF. We diagnosed HEV infection by detecting serum anti-HEV IgM antibody. All were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis A IgM antibody. Data were collected on 5-day outcome after admission to ICU, monitoring all patients for signs of raised ICP. An intravenous bolus of 20% mannitol was administered at a single time point to patients with raised ICP. Twenty patients were included in the study. Ten (50%) patients, seven (70%) females, received mannitol infusion. HE worsened in eight (40%): seven female and three pregnant. Glasgow Coma scores deteriorated in six (30%): all (100%) females and three pregnant. Consciousness status was not significantly different between pregnant and non-pregnant subjects, nor between those who received mannitol and those who did not. Six patients met King's College Criteria for liver transplantation. Female patients had a worse outcome, but pregnancy status was not an additional risk factor in our cohort. Mannitol infusion was also not associated with a significant difference in outcome.",

Scientists are struggling hard to develop a complete cure for infectious diseases, for example, drugs or vaccines against these deadly infectious diseases. We have searched papers on thymoquinone (TQ) and its effects on different infectious diseases in databases like Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and reviewed them in this study. To date research suggests that natural products may become a potential therapeutic option for their prodigious anti-viral or anti-microbial effects on infectious diseases. TQ, a natural phytochemical from black seeds, is known for its health-beneficial activities against several diseases, including infections. It is evident from different <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies that TQ is effective against tuberculosis, influenza, dengue, Ebola, Zika, hepatitis, malaria, HIV, and even recent pandemics caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2). In these cases, the molecular mechanism of TQ is partly clear but mostly obscure. In this review article, we have discussed the role of TQ against different infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and also critically reviewed the future use of TQ use to fight against infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "More than 180 million people have been infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and more than 4 million coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients have died in 1.5 years of the pandemic. A novel therapeutic vaccine (NASVAC) has shown to be safe and to have immunomodulating and antiviral properties against chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A phase I/II, open-label controlled and randomized clinical trial of NASVAC as a postexposure prophylaxis treatment was designed with the primary aim of assessing the local and systemic immunomodulatory effect of NASVAC in a cohort of suspected and SARS-CoV-2 risk-contact patients. A total of 46 patients, of both sexes, 60 years or older, presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Patients received NASVAC (100 μg per Ag per dose) via intranasal at days 1, 7, and 14 and sublingual, daily for 14 days. The present study detected an increased expression of toll-like receptors (TLR)-related genes in nasopharyngeal tonsils, a relevant property considering these are surrogate markers of SARS protection in the mice model of lethal infection. The HLA-class II increased their expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell's (PBMC's) monocytes and lymphocytes, which is an attractive property taking into account the functional impairment of innate immune cells from the periphery of COVID-19-infected subjects. NASVAC was safe and well tolerated by the patients with acute respiratory infections and evidenced a preliminary reduction in the number of days with symptoms that needs to be confirmed in larger studies. Our data justify the use of NASVAC as preemptive therapy or pre-/postexposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 and acute respiratory infections in general. The use of NASVAC or their active principles has potential as immunomodulatory prophylactic therapies in other antiviral settings like dengue as well as in malignancies like hepatocellular carcinoma where these markers have shown relation to disease progression.

        "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global public health concern owing to its substantial contribution to chronic liver diseases. The disease is closely linked to metabolic syndrome (MS), suggesting a common biological pathway and shared disease mechanism for both ailments. Previous studies revealed a close relationship of NAFLD with the components of MS including abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. Hence, a group of experts recently renamed NAFLD as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) in order to encompass a more appropriate pathogenesis of the disease. NAFLD was first named to describe a condition similar to alcoholic hepatitis in absence of significant alcohol consumption. However, knowledge pertaining to the etiopathogenesis of the disease has evolved over the past four decades. Recent evidence endorses NAFLD as a terminology of exclusion and suggests that it may often leads to misdiagnosis or inappropriate management of patients, particularly in clinical practice. On the other hand, the new definition is useful in addressing hepatic steatosis with metabolic dysfunction, which ultimately covers most of the patients with such illness. Therefore, it seems to be helpful in improving clinical diagnosis and managing high-risk patients with fatty liver disease. However, it is imperative to validate the new terminology at the population level to ensure a holistic approach to reduce the global burden of this heterogeneous disease condition.",

From January 2018 to September 2019, consecutive children (<18 years of age) with features suggestive of AVH with positive IgM anti-HAV both from inpatient and outpatient services were included in this study. Detailed history, physical findings, and investigations were recorded in the study questionnaire. Patients were followed up weekly until complete recovery. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was used for statistical analysis. The mean age of 200 children who were finally included in the study was 8.3±3.5 years with male to female ratio of 134:66. Atypical features were present in 30 (15%) children; prolonged cholestasis (17, 8.5%), ascites (12, 6%), pleural effusion (4, 2%), thrombocytopenia (2, 1%), and hemolysis (1, 0.5%) were observed. Pruritus (p=0.005), higher serum total and direct bilirubin (p=0.00 and 0.001 respectively), and lower serum albumin (p=0.01) levels were statistically significant in children with atypical manifestations. Moreover, this group had prolonged mean duration of jaundice and hospital course (p=0.00 and 0.083 respectively). Atypical manifestations such as prolonged cholestasis and ascites are not uncommon in children with AVH-A in developing countries and seen in almost one-sixth of patients.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The mechanisms that regulate HBV viral replication remain poorly defined. Here, we show that blocking of the neddylation elicits antiviral effect against HBV replication, indicating that NEDD8 supports viral production. To explore role of neddylation, HBV-replicating HepG2.2.15.7 cells and HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP-30 cells were treated with siNEDD8 and MLN4924, a potent and selective NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor. Cell viability, intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcrAg were measured to assess the consequences of the various treatments on viral replication. Our data showed that HBV infection increased NEDD8 expression in human liver cell lines. Symmetrically, NEDD8 knockdown by siRNA or MLN4924 treatments decreased HBV replication in HepG2.2.15.7 and HepG2-hNTCP-30 cells. Notably, HBsAg, and HBeAg secretions were strongly suppressed in the culture supernatants, but not the HBcrAg. These results indicate that the suppression of NEDD8 decreases HBV replication. However, cccDNA steady level confirms once again its persistence and longevity in chronic infection. The manipulation of the neddylation pathway can thus provide new tools interfering with HBV persistence as well as novel therapeutic strategies against chronic hepatitis B.",

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health problem. The immunopathology of the disease, especially the interplay between HBV and host innate immunity, is poorly understood. Moreover, inconsistent literature on HBV and host innate immunity has led to controversies. However, recently, there has been an increase in the number of studies that have highlighted the link between innate immune responses, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and chronic HBV infection. TLRs are the key sensing molecules that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns and regulate the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby shaping the adaptive immunity. The suppression of TLR response has been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), as well as in other models, including tree shrews, suggesting an association of TLR response in HBV chronicity. Additionally, TLR agonists have been reported to improve the host innate immune response against HBV infection, highlighting the potential of these agonists as immunomodulators for enhancing CHB treatment. In this study, we discuss the current understanding of host innate immune responses during HBV infection, particularly focusing on the TLR response and TLR agonists as immunomodulators.",

All the children of both sexes having age between six months to twelve years admitted in the pediatric ward with acute or chronic liver disease were included in this study by purposive sampling. A written consent was obtained from legal guardian of children before inclusion. Ethical clearance was obtained from competent authority. A detailed history was taken from parents in each case according to pre-designed questionnaire about demography of the patients and the risk factors of the liver disease. A thorough clinical examination and available relevant investigations like serological testing for HBV infection was done in all patients.

Anti HBc IgM was positive in 4 patients among acute liver disease. Among these Anti HBc IgM positive (4) patients only one had both HBsAg and Anti HBc IgM positive. So, four patients were confirming suffered from acute viral hepatitis because they had anti HBc IgM positive. On the contrary 5 patients suffered from chronic hepatitis by hepatitis B because they were only HBsAg positive. So, in this study 9 patients (9%) were confirming suffered from HBV infection.

Thirty-two patients aged 14-65 years were enrolled in the study. Diagnosis of ACLF was confirmed by clinical condition, biochemical analysis, and virological data. The causes of both chronic liver damages and acute insult in all patients were HBV. They were expressing HBV DNA in the sera, positive for IgM anti-HBc, had increased levels of serum bilirubin, compromised prothrombin time; and more than 50% patients had encephalopathy. The standard dose of tenofovir and entecavir was given. The antiviral effects of tenofovir and entecavir were evident as most patients became negative for HBV DNA in the sera after 90 days of therapy. Also, the levels of serum bilirubin, CTP (Child-Turcotte-Pugh) and MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score exhibited significant improvement due to antiviral therapy. Although the improvement of liver functions, and liver damages were detected in patients receiving both tenofovir and entecavir, the survival of the patients was significantly higher in those receiving tenofovir compared to entecavir-treated patients.

However, the people who were born before 2009, was dependent on imported hepatitis B vaccine as there was no locally manufactured hepatitis B vaccine in Bangladesh. Hence, we conducted a randomized observer blinded non-inferiority clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the locally manufactured Hepa-B vaccine in comparison with World Health Organization prequalified Engerix-B vaccine. Total 158 eligible adult participants were enrolled in this study with mean age of 30 and 29 years old in Hepa-B and Engerix-B groups, respectively. Both the vaccines were administered intramuscularly at 0, 1 and 6 months schedule. Baseline and post vaccination anti-HBs titers were measure at different time points. Seroconversion rate post three doses of Hepa-B vaccine was 98.67% similar to the comparator Engerix-B vaccine which was 100%. The geometric mean test ratios of both vaccines at all analysis time points were found > 0.5 predefined non-inferiority margin. Soreness at the injection site was the most common symptom for both the vaccines which resolved without any complication. No serious adverse event was reported throughout the study period.

We tested serum from a nationally representative serosurvey in Bangladesh for anti-HEV immunoglobulin G and estimated seroprevalence. We used Bayesian geostatistical models to generate high-resolution maps of seropositivity and examined variability in seropositivity by individual-level, household-level, and community-level risk factors using spatial logistic regression. We tested serum samples from 2924 individuals from 70 communities representing all divisions of Bangladesh and estimated a national seroprevalence of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-24%).

Community-level seroprevalence ranged widely (0-78%) with higher seroprevalence in urban areas, including Dhaka, with a 3.0-fold (95% credible interval, 2.3-3.7) higher seroprevalence than the rest of the country. Hepatitis E infections are common throughout Bangladesh. Strengthening surveillance for hepatitis E, especially in urban areas, can provide additional evidence to appropriately target interventions.",

Owing to the poor stability and limited permeability through gastrointestinal (GI) tract and epithelia, the therapeutic PPs are usually administered by parenteral route. Given the big demand for oral administration in clinical use, a variety of researches focused on developing new technologies to overcome GI barriers of PPs, such as enteric coating, enzyme inhibitors, permeation enhancers, nanoparticles, as well as intestinal microdevices.

This cross-sectional study was conducted among 614 students from five universities in central Bangladesh. Data were collected on demographic information, immunization history, medical and blood transfusion history through the face-to-face interview. Blood samples were collected and screened for anti-HBsAg using ELISA, HBsAg Rapid Test-cassette, and immune chromatographic test. The overall seroprevalence of HBV infection was 5.0%, and vaccination coverage was 19.2% among the participants. Students having a history of surgery (OR 11.004, 95% CI 3.211-37.707), blood transfusion (OR 5.651, 95% CI 0.965-33.068), being married (OR 4.776, 95% CI 1.508-15.127), and not being vaccinated (OR 9.825, 95% CI 1.130-85.367) were at higher risk of being infected by HBV. This study showed the endemicity of HBV infection among the Bangladeshi population. Marriage, surgical or blood transfusion history, not being vaccinated were the determinants of HBV infection within the study population. Public health initiatives for preventing HBV infection at the university levels should be envisaged.",

        "abstract": "Liver disease is a major cause of illness and death worldwide which accounts for approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide, 1 million due to complications of cirrhosis and 1 million due to viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. That's why it is seeking the researchers' attention to find out the effective treatment strategies. Phytochemicals from natural resources are the main leads for the development of noble hepatoprotective drugs. The majority of the natural sources whose active compounds are currently employed actually have an ethnomedical use. Ethnopharmacological research is essential for the development of these bioactive compounds. These studies not only provide scientific evidence on medicinal plants utilized for particular therapeutic purposes, but they also ensure cultural heritage preservation. Plenty of experimental studies have been well-documented that the ethnomedicinal plants are of therapeutics' interest for the advanced pharmacological intervention in terms of hepatic disorders. This study summarizes the processes of hepatotoxicity induced by various toxins and explores identified hepatoprotective plants and their phytoconstituents, which can guide the extraction of novel phytochemical constituents from plants to treat liver injury. This review aimed to summarize the hepatoprotective activity of Bangladeshi medicinal plants where the bioactive compounds may be leads for the drug discovery in future. Literature searches in electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Science Direct, SpringerLink, PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, Scopus, BanglaJOL, and so on, were performed using the keywords 'Bangladesh', 'ethnomedicinal plants', 'Hepatoprotective agents' as for primary searches, and secondary search terms were used as follows, either alone or in combination: traditional medicine, medicinal plants, folk medicine, liver, hepatitis, therapeutic uses, and anti-inflammatory. Besides, several books, including the book entitled \"Medicinal plants of Bangladesh: chemical constituents and uses\" authored by Abdul Ghani, were carefully considered, which contained pharmacological properties and phytoconstituents of many medicinal plants growing and traditionally available in Bangladesh. Among them, the most promising plant species with their latest therapeutic effects against hepatic disorders were deeply considered in this review. The results of this study revealed that in most cases, therapy using plant extracts stabilized altered hepatic biochemical markers induced by hepatotoxins. Initially, we investigated 32 plant species for hepatoprotective activity, however after extensive literature searching; we observed that 20 plants offer good pharmacological evidence of hepatoprotective function. Consequently, most bioactive compounds derived from the herbs including berberine, thymoquinone, andrographolide, ursolic acid, luteolin, naringenin, genistein, quercetin, troxerutin, morin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, chlorogenic acid, emodin, curcumin, resveratrol, capsaicin, ellagic acid, etc. are appeared to be effective against hepatic disorders. Flavonoids, phenolic acids, monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, alkaloids, chromenes, capsaicinoids, curcuminoids, and anthraquinones are among the phytoconstituents were appraised to have hepatoprotective activities. All the actions displayed by these ethnomedicinal plants could make them serve as leads in the formulation of drugs with higher efficacy to treat hepatic disorders.",

Patient mortality due to viral hepatitis has raised concern to COVID-19 patients due to compromise with undiagnosed hepatitis in Africa. The pandemic has worsened the control of the viral hepatitis epidemic as healthcare control facilities have moved their focus towards curbing COVID-19 infections. However, different challenges have arisen to viral hepatitis patients because of low health attention that declines the progress of already diagnosed hepatitis patients. Follow-up plans, routine testing and treatment plans for viral hepatitis are no longer as strict with the human resources transferred towards combating the pandemic. Thus, a global effort is required to abide by renewed recommendations to eradicate viral hepatitis in Africa that also fit the current picture of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A suitable small animal model is essential for viral pathogenesis and host response studies that could be used in antiviral and vaccine development. The tree shrew (<i>Tupaia belangeri</i> or <i>Tupaia belangeri chinenesis</i>), a squirrel-like non-primate small mammal in the Tupaiidae family, has been reported to be susceptible to important human viral pathogens, including hepatitis viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV), respiratory viruses (influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, human adenovirus B), arboviruses (Zika virus and dengue virus), and other viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, etc.). The pathogenesis of these viruses is not fully understood due to the lack of an economically feasible suitable small animal model mimicking natural infection of human diseases. The tree shrew model significantly contributes towards a better understanding of the infection and pathogenesis of these important human pathogens, highlighting its potential to be used as a viable viral infection model of human viruses. Therefore, in this review, we summarize updates regarding human viral infection in the tree shrew model, which highlights the potential of the tree shrew to be utilized for human viral infection and pathogenesis studies.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) extend the global health burden. Consumption of alcohol as well as maternal exposure to ethanol can damage several neuronal functions and cause cognition and behavioral abnormalities. Ethanol induces oxidative stress that is linked to the development of NDs. Treatment options for NDs are yet scarce, and natural product-based treatments could facilitate ND management since plants possess plenty of bioactive metabolites, including flavonoids, which typically demonstrate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. <i>Hypericum oblongifolium</i> is an important traditional medicinal plant used for hepatitis, gastric ulcer, external wounds, and other gastrointestinal disorders. However, it also possesses multiple bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties, but the evaluation of isolated pure compounds for neuroprotective efficacy has not been done yet. Therefore, in the current study, we aim to isolate and characterize the bioactive flavonoid folecitin and evaluate its neuroprotective activity against ethanol-induced oxidative-stress-mediated neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of postnatal day 7 (PND-7) rat pups. A single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally administered after the birth of rat pups on PND-7. This caused oxidative stress accompanied by the activation of phosphorylated-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and cysteine-aspartic acid protease-1 (caspase-1) proteins to form a complex called the NLRP3-inflammasome, which converts pro-interleukin 1 beta (IL-1B) to activate IL-1B and induce widespread neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In contrast, co-administration of folecitin (30 mg/kg body weight) reduced ethanol-induced oxidative stress, inhibited p-JNK, and deactivated the NLRP3-inflammasome complex. Furthermore, folecitin administration reduced neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative protein markers, including decreased caspase-3, BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX), B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) expression in the immature rat brain. These findings conclude that folecitin is a flavone compound, and it might be a novel, natural and safe agent to curb oxidative stress and its downstream harmful effects, including inflammasome activation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Further evaluation in a dose-dependent manner would be worth it in order to find a suitable dose regimen for NDs.",

        "abstract": "<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a protozoan parasite that causes toxoplasmosis and infects almost one-third of the global human population. A lack of effective drugs and vaccines and the emergence of drug resistant parasites highlight the need for the development of new drugs. The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is an essential pathway for energy metabolism and the survival of <i>T. gondii</i>. In apicomplexan parasites, malate:quinone oxidoreductase (MQO) is a monotopic membrane protein belonging to the ETC and a key member of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and has recently been suggested to play a role in the fumarate cycle, which is required for the cytosolic purine salvage pathway. In <i>T. gondii</i>, a putative MQO (TgMQO) is expressed in tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages and is considered to be a potential drug target since its orthologue is not conserved in mammalian hosts. As a first step towards the evaluation of TgMQO as a drug target candidate, in this study, we developed a new expression system for TgMQO in FN102(DE3)TAO, a strain deficient in respiratory cytochromes and dependent on an alternative oxidase. This system allowed, for the first time, the expression and purification of a mitochondrial MQO family enzyme, which was used for steady-state kinetics and substrate specificity analyses. Ferulenol, the only known MQO inhibitor, also inhibited TgMQO at IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.822 μM, and displayed different inhibition kinetics compared to <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> MQO. Furthermore, our analysis indicated the presence of a third binding site for ferulenol that is distinct from the ubiquinone and malate sites.",

Recombinant and occult HBV infections (OBI) have been reported previously in the region. We investigated an adult fever cohort (<i>n</i>=201) recruited in Dhaka, to determine the prevalence of HBV and OBI. A target-enrichment deep sequencing pipeline was applied to samples with HBV DNA >3.0 log<sub>10</sub> IU ml<sup>-1</sup>. HBV infection was present in 16/201 (8 %), among whom 3/16 (19 %) were defined as OBI (HBsAg-negative but detectable HBV DNA). Whole genome deep sequences (WGS) were obtained for four cases, identifying genotypes A, C and D. One OBI case had sufficient DNA for sequencing, revealing multiple polymorphisms in the surface gene that may contribute to the occult phenotype. We identified mutations associated with nucleos(t)ide analogue resistance in 3/4 samples sequenced, although the clinical significance in this cohort is unknown. The high prevalence of HBV in this setting illustrates the importance of opportunistic clinical screening and DNA testing of transfusion products to minimise OBI transmission.

HBV is one of the most important causes of both acute insult and underlying chronic liver disease in ACLF. Reactivation of HBV is one of the common causes of ACLF in our region. ACLF requires multiple organ support and is associated with high short and medium term mortality. This is the reason why early, rapid reduction of HBV DNA is essential in treating ACLF-B. Consecutive patients of ACLF-B due to spontaneous reactivation of HBV (ALT> 5xULN or >2 x baseline and HBV DNA >20,000 IU/ml) were randomized into tenofovir group (300mg/day) and telbivudine group (600mg/day) along with standard medical treatment. Clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated at baseline, day-7, day-14, day-30 and day-90. HBV DNA was evaluated at baseline and after three months of therapy. Primary end point was survival or death at three months. Secondary end point was improvement of liver function assessed by Child-Turcotte Pugh score and MELD score at three months. 30 patients were enrolled in the study and 15 of them received tenofovir and 15 patients received telbivudine. Most of the baseline parameters showed no difference except serum AST and serum creatinine level that showed statistically significant difference between two groups. After antiviral therapy both groups showed significant clinical improvement along with CTP and MELD scores. However statistically significant improvement between tenofovir and telbivudine groups was only seen with MELD score. Survival rate was 80% in tenofovir group and 60% in telbivudine group, but this was not statistically significant. Low serum albumin at baseline was predictor of mortality. In patients of ACLF-B, antiviral therapy with both tenofovir and telbivudine improve liver function, but there is no statistically significant difference in survival between tenofovir and telbivudine.",

ACLF due to exacerbation of CHB is associate with 30%-70% mortality. Reduction of HBV-DNA is therefore a target of therapy in ACLF-B. Patients with spontaneous reactivation of HBV [(ALT >5×ULN or >2× baseline) and HBV-DNA >20,000 IU/ml] were randomized to Tenofovir mono therapy (300 mg/day) or Tenofovir plus Telbivudine (600 mg/day) dual therapy with standard care.

Ascites resolved in 3 patients in both groups. Patients receiving dual therapy showed significant improvement in AKI on follow up compared to those on Tenofovir mono therapy. Among 5 deaths, 3 received mono therapy with Tenofovir and 2 dual therapy. Predictors of mortality had high S. bilirubin, HBV-DNA, MELD score and CTP score.

The molecular characteristics and pathogenesis of endemic and outbreak HEV strains are poorly understood. We compared the genetic relatedness and virulence associated mutations of endemic HEV strains with outbreak strains. We analyzed systematically collected serum samples from HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) positive patients attended at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka from August 2013 to June 2015. HEV RNA positive samples were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Genotype and subtype of the strains were determined by phylogenetic analysis. Virulence associated mutations e.g. acute viral hepatitis (AVH), fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), chronic hepatitis, ribavirin treatment failure (RTF), B and T cell neutralization epitopes were determined. 92 HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody positive plasma samples (43 in 2013-2014 and 49 in 2014-2015) were studied. 77.1% (70/92) of the samples were HEV RNA positive. A 279 bp open reading frame (ORF) 2 and ORF 3 sequence was obtained from 54.2% (38/70) of the strains. Of these 38 strains, whole genome sequence (WGS) was obtained from 21 strains. In phylogenetic analysis of 38 (279 bp) sequence all HEV sequences belonged to genotype 1 and subtype 1a. Further phylogenetic analysis of 21 HEV WGS, Bangladeshi HEV sequences clustered with genotype 1a sequences from neighboring countries. Within genotype 1a cluster, Bangladesh HEV strains formed a separate cluster with the 2010 HEV outbreak strains from northern Bangladesh. 80.9 to 100% of the strains had A317T, T735I, L1120I, L1110F, P259S, V1479I, G1634K mutations associates AVH, FHF and RTF. Mutations in T cell recognition epitope T3, T5, T7 was observed in 76.1%, 100% and 100% of the strains respectively.

        "abstract": "Viral hepatitis is a global phenomenon, with the disease burden varying on a daily basis. Amongst chronic infections, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are egregiously linked to severe health-related complications, with a worldwide prevalence of 248 million and 71 million respectively. Amongst the developing world, a hand full of countries are exhibiting a gross decline in chronic viral infection prevalence, like Bangladesh. While countries such as India have a consistent prevalence, Pakistan bears one of the largest proportions of chronic viral hepatitis globally with increasing trends shown year-by-year. Various old literature texts have stated an approximate national prevalence rate around 2.6% and 5.3% of hepatitis B and C respectively. The objective of this study was to determine the current seroprevalence rates of chronic viral hepatitis amongst the general population of rural Sindh using a screening program to determine the current disease burden. An observational, cross-sectional survey based on a screening program was conducted in 5 districts with a combined population of over 6.5 million. The screening was carried out via the administration of various camps with the assistance of local social workers and welfare organizations. A total of 24,322 individuals met the inclusion criteria and were screened through (HBsAg/HCV) rapid test cassette (WC) Imu-Med one-step diagnostic test. Hepatitis B was found positive in 964 (3.96%) individuals including 421 (43.67%) males and 543 (56.32%) females, while hepatitis C was positive in 2872 (11.80%) individuals including 1474 (51.32%) males and 1398 (48.67%) females. The prevalence amongst the districts varied between 0.97% and 9.06% for hepatitis B, and 1.61% and 29.50% for hepatitis C, respectively. Umerkot was found to be the most prevalent district amongst rural Sindh, while Badin had the least number of seropositive people. The second most prevalent district of the study population was found to be Tando Allahyar followed by Mirpur Khas. The combined seroprevalence of 15.76% was calculated for hepatitis B and C together amongst the five studied districts of rural and peri-urban Sindh. The alarmingly high prevalence rates revealed in our study warrant the urgent need to generate multiple effective strategies in the region to enhance awareness amongst the general population regarding screening, prevention, and prompt treatment of the disease.",

        "abstract": "The inheritable thalassemia and other structural hemoglobinopathies are prevalent globally. In Bangladesh, there is a scarcity of studies concerning thalassemia and other structural hemoglobinopathies. Hence, the present study investigated the prevalence and distribution of β-thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies among the university students and ready-made garment (RMG) workers. A cross-sectional study was conducted, whereas a total of 989 subjects were selected randomly from 10 garments industries (n=495) and five universities (n=494) for diagnosis and counseling from April 2018 to August 2018. Basic information related to the study and venous blood was collected and subjected to capillary Hb-electrophoresis for each participant. The present study identified thalassemia carriers and other hemoglobinopathies among 13.6% of the participants (14.1% university students and 13.2% RMG workers). The most common form of hemoglobin formation disorder was the Hb-E trait (10.5%), considering both participants' groups. Other forms of hemoglobin formation disorders observed were a β-thalassemia trait, Hb-D trait, Hb-E disease, and β-thalassemia major. The hemoglobinopathies were significantly associated with the individuals who had a family history of thalassemia and were not vaccinated against hepatitis B in the total sample. Although not statistically suggestive, the most considerable portion (87.3%) of the carriers was unmarried in the present findings. The present study findings are anticipated to help the public health authorities by providing novel data (of a neglected cohort, ie, RGM workers), facilitating the upcoming comprehensive national thalassemia prevention programs.",

The present study reviews tocilizumab adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance database. All suspected ADEs associated with tocilizumab between April to August 2020 were analyzed based on COVID-19 patients' demographic and clinical variables, and severity of involvement of organ system. A total of 1005 ADEs were reported among 513 recipients. The majority of the ADEs (46.26%) were reported from 18-64 years, were males and reported spontaneously. Around 80%, 20%, and 64% were serious, fatal, and administered intravenously, respectively. 'Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications' remain as highest (35%) among categorized ADEs. Neutropenia, hypofibrinogenemia were common hematological ADEs. The above 64 years was found to have significantly lower odds than of below 45 years. In comparison, those in the European Region have substantially higher odds compared to the Region of Americas. Neutropenia, superinfections, reactivation of latent infections, hepatitis, and cardiac abnormalities were common ADEs observed that necessitate proper monitoring and reporting.",

Noninvasive serum biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis are the current research focus. To assess the correlation between serum Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) levels and histological severity in patients with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-related compensated chronic liver disease (CLD). This cross-sectional study evaluated 50 treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B with compensated CLD. Liver biopsy was done, and hepatic fibrosis was categorized using the METAVIR scoring system; we divided the study subjects into three groups; group 1 included subjects with F0 and F1, group 2 having F2 group 3 having F3 and F4. Serum CHI3L1 was measured in all by immunoassay. Among 50 patients, only one had METAVIR score F0, seven had F1, 33 had F2, nine had F3, and none had METAVIR score F4. The median value of CHI3L1 was 460.8 (IQR 340.1-570.3) in all study subjects; 359.5 (IQR 272.8-526.9) in group 1, 450.0 (IQR 307.75-5332.0) in group 2, and 1355.5 (IQR 530.75-1580.5) in the group 3. The difference in median CHI3L1 across the groups was statistically significant. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) score had significant positive correlations with CHI3L1 levels. CHI3L1 also had significant positive correlations with METAVIR scores.

        "abstract": "Rodents are one of the most diversified terrestrial mammals, and they perform several beneficial activities in nature. These animals are also important as carriers of many pathogens with public health importance. The current systematic review was conducted to formulate a true depiction of rodent-related zoonoses in Qatar. Following systematic searches on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science and a screening process, a total of 94 published articles were selected and studied. The studied articles reported 23 rodent-related zoonotic pathogens that include nine bacterial, eleven parasitic, and three viral pathogens, from which the frequently reported pathogens were <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (32 reports), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (23), and <i>Salmonella</i> spp. (16). The possible pathway of entry of the rodent-borne pathogens can be the land port, seaports, and airport of Qatar through carrier humans and animals, contaminated food, and agricultural products. The pathogens can be conserved internally by rodents, pets, and livestock; by agricultural production systems; and by food marketing chains. The overall estimated pooled prevalence of the pathogens among the human population was 4.27% (95%CI: 4.03-4.51%; <i>p</i> < 0.001) with significant heterogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 99.50%). The top three highest prevalent pathogens were <i>M.</i><i>tuberculosis</i> (30.90%; 22.75-39.04%; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 99.70%) followed by <i>Toxoplasma</i><i>gondii</i> (21.93%; 6.23-37.61%; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 99.30%) and hepatitis E virus (18.29%; 11.72-24.86%; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 96.70%). However, there is a knowledge gap about the listed pathogens regarding the occurrence, transmission pathways, and rodent role in transmission dynamics at the human-animal-environment interface in Qatar. Further studies are required to explore the role of rodents in spreading zoonotic pathogens through the One Health framework, consisting of zoologists, ecologists, microbiologists, entomologists, veterinarians, and public health experts in this country.",

        "abstract": "The dried rhizome of Atractylodes lancea (Thumb.) DC. (Compositae) has been prescribed in folk medicine for the management of various inflammatory conditions such as rheumatic diseases, gastritis and hepatitis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial properties of this herb remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the anti-gastritis activities of Al-EE (an ethanolic extract of the herb) and explored the mechanism of action. An ethanolic extract of the Atractylodes lancea (Thumb.) DC. (Compositae) rhizome, Al-EE, was prepared with ethanol (95%) and quality controlled using HPLC analysis. To determine the in vivo effects of this extract, we utilised a HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis rat model. In vitro assays were carried out using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cell model. MTT assays were used to examine cell viability, while Griess assays were carried out to measure nitric oxide (NO) production. Messenger RNA expression was examined by real-time PCR. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production was examined using ELISA assays. To examine protein expression and enzymatic activities, we employed western blot analysis. Nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB activity was determined by Luciferase reporter assays. The content of atractylenolide (AT)-1 and AT-2 in Al-EE was 0.45% and 5.07% (w/w), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1). Al-EE treatment suppressed the production of NO and PGE<sub>2</sub>, reduced the mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while also reducing the protein levels of iNOS and COX-2 in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Furthermore, Al-EE inhibited the nuclear protein levels of NF-κB (p65) and NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene activity in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Critically, intra-gastric injection of Al-EE (25 mg/kg) attenuated HCl/EtOH-induced gastric damage in SD rats, while the phosphorylation of Akt and IκBα was suppressed by Al-EE in vitro and in vivo. In summary, Al-EE has significant anti-gastritis effects in vivo and in vitro, which can be associated with the inhibition of the Akt/IκBα/NF-κB signalling pathway. This mechanistic finding provides a pharmacological basis for the use of the A. lancea rhizome in the clinical treatment of various inflammatory conditions.",

        "abstract": "To date, the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide include viral infections, such as Ebola, influenza virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and recently COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, we can count on a narrow range of antiviral drugs, especially older generation ones like ribavirin and interferon which are effective against viruses in vitro but can often be ineffective in patients. In addition to these, we have antiviral agents for the treatment of herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV and hepatitis virus. Recently, drugs used in the past especially against ebolavirus, such as remdesivir and favipiravir, have been considered for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. However, even if these drugs represent important tools against viral diseases, they are certainly not sufficient to defend us from the multitude of viruses present in the environment. This represents a huge problem, especially considering the unprecedented global threat due to the advancement of COVID-19, which represents a potential risk to the health and life of millions of people. The demand, therefore, for new and effective antiviral drugs is very high. This review focuses on three fundamental points: (1) presents the main threats to human health, reviewing the most widespread viral diseases in the world, thus describing the scenario caused by the disease in question each time and evaluating the specific therapeutic remedies currently available. (2) It comprehensively describes main phytochemical classes, in particular from plant foods, with proven antiviral activities, the viruses potentially treated with the described phytochemicals. (3) Consideration of the various applications of drug delivery systems in order to improve the bioavailability of these compounds or extracts. A PRISMA flow diagram was used for the inclusion of the works. Taking into consideration the recent dramatic events caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the cry of alarm that denounces critical need for new antiviral drugs is extremely strong. For these reasons, a continuous systematic exploration of plant foods and their phytochemicals is necessary for the development of new antiviral agents capable of saving lives and improving their well-being.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) covers 11 countries with a combined population of about 2 billion people, making it the most populous of the six WHO regions. In 1992, the WHO advocated including the hepatitis B vaccine in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) and vaccinating all infants and children three times within 1 year of birth (HepB3). Recently, the WHO advocate birth-dose hepatitis B vaccination (HepB-BD) as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours. In 2016, the SEARO endorsed a regional hepatitis B control goal with a target of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroprevalence of ≤1% among children aged ≥5 years by 2020. Of the 11 SEARO countries, four achieved this target on schedule. Out of these four countries, two countries (Bangladesh and Nepal) have not adopted HepB-BD in EPI program. On the other hand, the coverage of HepB3 is not satisfactory in some SEARO countries, including India which adopted HepB-BD but could not achieve the overall target of SEARO. Thus, it is a point of debate whether emphasis should be placed on proper implementation of HepB3 or whether a new agenda of HepB-BD should be incorporated in developing countries of SEARO. The article discusses strengthening and expanding the Hepatitis B vaccination program in SEARO countries with an emphasis on HepB and HepB-BD programs.",

        "abstract": "In the summer of 2017, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in what has been described as one of the largest and fastest growing refugee crises in the world. Among numerous health concerns, an outbreak of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) was detected by the disease surveillance system in early 2018 among the refugee population. This paper describes the investigation into the increase in AJS cases, the process and results of the investigation, which were strongly suggestive of a large outbreak due to hepatitis A virus (HAV). An enhanced serological investigation was conducted between 28 February to 26 March 2018 to determine the etiologies and risk factors associated with the outbreak. A total of 275 samples were collected from 18 health facilities reporting AJS cases. Blood samples were collected from all patients fulfilling the study specific case definition and inclusion criteria, and tested for antibody responses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Out of the 275 samples, 206 were positive for one of the agents tested. The laboratory results confirmed multiple etiologies including 154 (56%) samples tested positive for hepatitis A, 1 (0.4%) positive for hepatitis E, 36 (13%) positive for hepatitis B, 25 (9%) positive for hepatitis C, and 14 (5%) positive for leptospirosis. Among all specimens tested 24 (9%) showed evidence of co-infections with multiple etiologies. Hepatitis A and E are commonly found in refugee camps and have similar clinical presentations. In the absence of robust testing capacity when the epidemic was identified through syndromic reporting, a particular concern was that of a hepatitis E outbreak, for which immunity tends to be limited, and which may be particularly severe among pregnant women. This report highlights the challenges of identifying causative agents in such settings and the resources required to do so. Results from the month-long enhanced investigation did not point out widespread hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmission, but instead strongly suggested a large-scale hepatitis A outbreak of milder consequences, and highlighted a number of other concomitant causes of AJS (acute hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Leptospirosis), albeit most likely at sporadic level. Results strengthen the need for further water and sanitation interventions and are a stark reminder of the risk of other epidemics transmitted through similar routes in such settings, particularly dysentery and cholera. It also highlights the need to ensure clinical management capacity for potentially chronic conditions in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "hepatitis E is a disease spread all over the world, with endemic levels varying according to ecological and socioeconomic factors. In developing countries, large epidemics spread mainly through contaminated water; in developed countries, hepatitis E has always been considered a sporadic disease, closely associated to the travels to endemic areas, especially in Southeastern Asia. In the last years, this perception is significantly changing, because of an increasing number of autochthonous cases reported in many European countries. to describe the epidemiological picture of hepatitis E in Italy from 2007 to 2019. descriptive study based on the cases reported to the special surveillance of acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA); case-control analytical study for the analysis of risk factors associated with hepatitis E. hepatitis E cases reported to SEIEVA in the period 2007-2019. number of cases notified by year, percentages of cases exposed to known risk factors, odds ratios. from January 2007 to June 2019, 385 hepatitis E cases were notified to SEIEVA. The annual number increased from 12 in 2007 to 49 in 2018, the increasing trend continued in 2019, when 39 cases were observed in the first 6 months of the year. Northern and Central Regions reported most of the cases; only a few were diagnosed in Southern Regions. Based on SEIEVA data, the trend of hepatitis E notifications has increased according to the increasing propensity to the differentiated diagnosis, at least until 2018. However, only 46% of suspected cases are tested to detect the presence of anti-HEV IgM antibodies, during the observation period; the percentage of tested cases is significantly lower in the South than in Northern and Central Italy (p<0.001). The reported cases have a median age of 48 years (range: 5-87) and are mostly males (80%); 32% was observed in foreign citizens mainly from endemic areas of South Asia (Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan). In 72.5% of cases, the infection was contracted in Italy. The most frequent risk factor is the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat, especially sausages (70% of cases), significantly associated with hepatitis E risk (OR 3.0; IC95% 1.4-6.1). Other important risk factors are wild boar sausages consumption (40% of cases, OR 4.6, not statistically significant), and travels to endemic areas during the six weeks before the disease (31% of cases, OR 3.2; IC95% 1.6-6.4). hepatitis E can now be considered as endemic even in industrialized countries. In Italy, from 2007 an increasing number of cases has been reported. However, the real impact of HEV infection is still underestimated due to the limited number of clinical centres which perform tests for the search of anti-HEV IgM antibodies in cases of acute hepatitis. An ad hoc surveillance has been activated in January 2019 in some Local Health Units/Regions and extended to a national level starting from January 2020. This initiative is necessary in order to better dimension the burden of the disease associated with HEV infection, to study its epidemiology, and to increase awareness of this infection among health professionals.",

        "title": "Current status of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of barbers regarding transmission and prevention of hepatitis B and C virus in the north-west part of Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study in 2020.",
        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and preventative practices among barbers regarding Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) viral infection in Rajshahi city of Bangladesh. This was a prospective observational study. This study was conducted from January to June 2020. A questionnaire was adapted from existing knowledge attitude and practice surveys regarding HBV and HCV infection. Data were collected from barbers by face to face interview by trained interviewers. A knowledge score was calculated by giving one point for each correct response to the knowledge-related items, with a maximum score of 17. Associations between knowledge and patient characteristics were assessed by Welch's <i>t</i>-test. A total of 403 barbers were enrolled with a mean age of 29.2 ​± ​7.4 years. Of participants, the majority of barbers were either illiterate or had education up to primary school (232, 57.5%). 41.2%, 33.7%, and 25.1% barbers knew that HBV and HCV could be transmitted through sexual route, blood transfusion, and shaving instruments respectively. A lower knowledge level was associated with a lower level of education (P ​< ​0.001). Most of the participants agreed that it was essential to have periodic screening tests for HBV and HCV infection (318, 78.9%). Only 12.2% of the barbers were vaccinated against HBV. 57.1% of the barbers cleaned their instruments with disinfectant between clients. Most of them used a new blade on new clients (401, 99.5%) and disposed of the used blades into the regular garbage system (371,92.1%). Poor knowledge regarding transmission and prevention of HBV and HCV was found among barbers which could be one of the major causes of transmission of those infections in the community. The concerned authority should pay attention to the problems and can take specific measures to increase awareness of the barbers to prevent transmission of HBV and HCV from the barber's shop.",
