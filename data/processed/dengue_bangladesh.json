        "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic potential of five natural compounds from Carica papaya - olean-12-ene, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and kaempferol - against dengue virus (DENV) using a multi-faceted in silico approach. Quantum chemical analysis using density functional theory (DFT) revealed insights into the electronic properties and stability, with olean-12-ene exhibiting the highest stability (HOMO-LUMO gap: 6.91Â eV), while luteolin and apigenin showed balanced reactivity profiles suitable for biochemical interactions. ADMET profiling underlined the drug-likeness of these compounds: Quercetin showed good solubility (logS: -2.93) and hydrogen bonding potential, apigenin showed high oral bioavailability (HIA: 93.25%) and olean-12-ene exhibited remarkable permeability (Caco-2: 1.26). Molecular docking simulations against the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease, the NS1 protein and the envelope protein provided further insight into their binding affinities and interaction modes. Toxicity assessments indicated manageable risks, although flavonoids exhibited moderate hepatotoxicity and olean-12-ene showed cardiotoxic/nephrotoxic tendencies, suggesting a need for further optimization. Overall, these results highlight the potential of specific papaya-derived compounds, particularly the flavonoids, as candidates for further experimental validation in the development of anti-DENV therapeutics. This work lays a foundation for future in vitro and in vivo studies to combat DENV infection and associated complications such as thrombocytopenia.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever has been increasing in recent decades and has become a key concern for the health sector in the USA. This study aims to investigate the impact of meteorological conditions on the incidence of dengue fever in the USA. This research based on the evidence of weekly dengue cases from January 2015 to December 2021 in 56 regions in the USA. Besides descriptive statistics, association was examined between dengue fever incidence and specific environmental factors. A number of multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) for count data was applied to discover the elements that substantially influence the spread of dengue sickness. The hurdle negative binomial regression (NBR) model was considered the final model based on the AIC and BIC criteria. This study showed that temperature, humidity, rainfall, and surface pressure are positively correlated with dengue cases. However, the sky clearance index has negative relationships with dengue cases. The hurdle-NBR model revealed that humidity, temperature, and air-pressure are more prone to dengue cases. In contrast, precipitation, wind speed, and sky clearance index are negatively associated with dengue incidence. The findings of this research impart crucial information about meteorological parameters that could increase the risk of dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "The Mayaro virus (MAYV), an emerging arbovirus of the Alphavirus genus (family Togaviridae), shares clinical and epidemiological features with other arboviruses such as Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika. It causes Mayaro fever in humans, characterized by febrile illness and prolonged arthralgia, often leading to misdiagnosis. Given the absence of licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies and the presence of competent vectors in endemic regions, MAYV poses a significant threat of epidemic, particularly in rural South America. In this research, computational immunological methods were employed to construct a polypeptide vaccine, with a focus on the structural polyprotein of the Mayaro virus. A series of rigorous computational assessments were used to predict the most potent T and B lymphocyte epitopes for the vaccine candidate. The vaccine exhibited favorable physicochemical properties, stable secondary and tertiary structures, and high solubility. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated its structural stability, while docking studies indicated robust interactions with TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, essential for initiating immune responses. Codon optimization, along with in silico cloning, demonstrated efficient expression of the vaccine candidate in an <i>E. coli</i> system. Finally, an immune simulation indicated that the vaccine candidate could induce a robust and long-lasting immune response.

        "abstract": "We investigated a new outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Dhaka and nearby areas of Bangladesh in 2024, examining its epidemiology, clinical features, and genomic characteristics. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research enrolled suspected Chikungunya cases from October 19 to December 31, 2024. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed, and positive cases were followed up via telephone between days 21 and 28. The E1 gene of 12 samples was sequenced. Of 394 enrolled patients, 138 (35%) were CHIKV-positive, mostly male (64.5%) and over 30 years old (83.3%), with 98.6% residing in Dhaka. Common symptoms included fever (100%), arthralgia (97.8%), myalgia (83.2%), and headache (65.0%). While no fatalities were recorded, 14.5% required hospitalization with an average stay of 5.9 days, and patients lost an average of 10.5 workdays. At 28 days, 81% of 58 follow-up patients had persistent symptoms. Both hospitalization and persistent symptoms were associated with having >4 symptoms initially (incidence risk ratio: 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.27 and 1.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.39, respectively). Sequence analysis identified an E1-K211E substitution, with phylogenetics revealing a distinct East-Central-South-African (ECSA) sub-lineage compared to 2017 strains. CHIKV is likely to re-emerge in Bangladesh amid the ongoing dengue outbreak, posing a risk of a major outbreak soon. Strengthening efforts to control <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes is essential.",

        "abstract": "After a major outbreak in Bangladesh in 2017, chikungunya nearly vanished from its territory until its resurgence in late 2024. However, its symptomatic overlap with dengue virus (DENV), another major arbovirus, has hindered accurate diagnosis and reporting, resulting in limited molecular diagnostic efforts for chikungunya in this region. This diagnostic evaluation study aimed to detect and characterize arboviral infections at the molecular level, focusing on the re-emergence of chikungunya and implications for future outbreaks. Febrile individuals aged 5-65 years old presenting with fever onset within 2-5 days along with other corresponding febrile symptoms were prospectively recruited from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh diagnostic facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 569 of 1,280 screened individuals were enrolled, providing informed written consent/assent. Serum samples from 474 participants underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, revealing 213 positive cases for at least one arbovirus. Chikungunya cases totaled 55, including seven coinfections (six with DENV and the first documented chikungunya virus-Zika virus coinfection in Bangladesh). No infections were reported from January to August, with a peak in October and November. Most chikungunya virus infections (72.7%) had moderate to high viral loads, with symptoms of joint pain, myalgia, and headaches. This resurgence of chikungunya in late 2024 highlights the potential for a major outbreak in 2025, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate public health impact and ensure a robust response to this re-emerging threat.",

This study aims to identify the risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia based on the recent STEPS survey in Bangladesh. Secondary cross-sectional study. This study analyze the publicly available \"National STEPS Survey for Non-communicable Diseases Risk Factors in Bangladesh 2018\" dataset. The sample size was 6875, after cleaning the three phases of dataset. Frequency distribution, Spatial distribution, Chi-square test, and Logistic regression models were employed in data analysis. The nationwide prevalence of NCDs revealed 27.3Â % for hypertension, 9.8Â % for diabetes, and 30.2Â % for hypercholesterolemia. The NCDs prevalence significantly varied across divisions in Bangladesh, with Barisal having the highest hypertension (25Â %) and Sylhet the lowest (18.1Â %). Chittagong led in diabetes prevalence (12.0Â %), while Rangpur had the lowest (4.8Â %). For hypercholesterolemia, Barisal topped (34.9Â %), and Mymensingh had the lowest (20.9Â %).

Older age and obesity notably increased significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) the odds of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, while urban residence increased the odds of diabetes. Several factors, mostly age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category are responsible for higher prevalence of NCD diseases.

        "abstract": "Dengue represents a significant public health threat in Bangladesh, characterized by its complex ecological transmission dynamics. To improve dengue prevention and control efforts, firstly, we employ state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods to identify the roles of eco-climatic factors in predicting dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. We utilize high-performance machine learning (ML) models, XGBoost and LightGBM, combined with explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to evaluate the predictive performance and impact of various dengue determinants in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2023. The LightGBM and XGBoost models were also utilized to predict dengue cases and early warning trends from 2024 to 2030. Climatic, socio-demographic, and landscape features were used to train these models; SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) were used to interpret the results. Between 2000 and 2023, Bangladesh experienced the highest number of dengue cases in August, while November saw the most fatalities. The XGBoost model excelled in predicting dengue outbreaks, achieving an AUC score of 0.89, a Log Loss of 0.64. Key predictors identified by the model include population density, precipitation, temperature, and land-use patterns. Additionally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) provided insights into the model's predictions, highlighting the significance of population density, relative humidity, and minimum temperature in dengue outbreaks. This study showcases the potential of XAI in uncovering the complexities of dengue outbreaks, providing a robust tool for public health interventions. Our AI-driven framework can be utilized to generate prompt and timely alerts to prevent imminent dengue and other infectious disease outbreaks.",

Despite whole blood being the gold standard for DENV detection, emerging evidence suggests that non-blood specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), may offer a less invasive alternative for diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of NPSs for detecting DENV RNA in pediatric patients in Bangladesh. We collected 130 paired NPS and blood specimens from children with suspected dengue (aged 1 month to 15 years) at Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute. Viral RNA was extracted from both sample types and subsequently detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 130 paired specimens, DENV RNA was detected in 115 blood samples and 104 NPSs. Compared with blood, NPS exhibited a sensitivity of 90.43%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 91.54%. An analysis of demographic and clinical factors revealed no significant differences between NPS-positive and -negative cases. This study underscores the potential of NPSs as a viable alternative diagnostic specimen for DENV detection, particularly, in settings where blood collection is difficult. Integrating NPS into existing diagnostic and surveillance systems could enhance early detection and outbreak management, ultimately improving patient care and public health response.",

Dengue infections can present with a wide range of symptoms, from fever to severe organ involvement like myocarditis. In this retrospective analysis, risk factors, clinic-laboratory profile, and outcomes of dengue myocarditis in hospitalised patients were investigated. Methods The study wasÂ a retrospective one, conducted in a tertiary private hospital in Dhaka between 2019 and 2023.Â Dengue infection was diagnosed by positive dengue nonstructural antigen (NS1) tests and/or dengue IgM or dengue RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) positivity. Dengue myocarditis was diagnosed with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013 consensus statement.Â For each myocarditis patient, we recruitedÂ age-, gender-, and year-of-admission-matched control dengue patients. Results Thirty-four dengue-myocarditis patients and 81 matchedÂ dengue patients were recruited as controls, with the mean age of myocarditis patients being 48.5 Â± 20.1 years; 20.7% were from the 60-69 age group, and 21 (61.7%) were male. Mean (Â±standard deviation)Â leucocyte count 9.1 (Â±4.7) Ã10<sup>9</sup>/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 604 (Â±937) IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2076 (Â±4202) IU/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 5.5 (Â±5.3) mg/dL were significantly higher in the myocarditis group. Among 34 myocarditis patients, four patients (11.7%) died, with procalcitonin 18.8 (Â±27.5) ng/mL, prothrombin time (PT) 28.7 (Â±12.4) seconds, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 102.6 (Â±46.9) seconds being significantly higher. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the presence of comorbidities (odds ratio [OR]: 10.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78-39.5])Â and a raised neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR 11.9; 95% CI: 2.82-50.7) were significantly associated with myocarditis.

        "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive statistical and graphical analysis of hematological parameters in a cohort of 1523 dengue patients in a thorough search for the determination of the clinical features of dengue fever. The most important parameters were hemoglobin level, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and total platelet counts, whose statistical analysis has been conducted with the vision to clarify their role in dengue pathology. Statistical significance finds the key hematological parameters such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red blood cells, and RDW-CV to be strongly associated with dengue, and the same is borne out by their p-values. The gender, hemoglobin, MCH, and PDW are less strongly related, however. The consistency of results using T-tests as well as Z-tests strengthens the findings, highlighting significant markers while also pointing out how more intricate interactions would be uncovered using multivariate analysis. Subsequently, several data visualizations were constructed using box plots, violin plots, and pair plots. Hematological parameters in dengue positive and negative patients are somewhat disparate, as shown by box plots; positive patients presented with lower WBC and RBC counts and higher hemoglobin levels and monocyte percentages. Although females tend to have greater monocyte percentages and platelet counts and males tend to have overall greater hematocrit levels, violin plots do not indicate any gender differences in the majority of the blood parameters. The pair plot indicates that younger patients with lower hemoglobin are more likely to have positive dengue results, with some overlap between total WBC count and lymphocyte percentage. In conclusion, this database will be very useful and will provide a tremendous benefit to dengue research studies, public health initiatives, and better patient diagnosis and treatment methods.",

This study aims to characterize dengue fatalities and analyze their determinants and spatial influence. Using data from the Management Information System of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, we characterized dengue mortality and conducted a linear regression analysis to determine the impact of age groups and gender on case fatality rate (CFR). We used a geographically weighted Poisson regression model to assess the spatial influence and impact of population factors. Women had a higher CFR than men (0.75% vs 0.38%, <i>P</i> <0.05). Among the recorded deaths, 74% (n = 1262) developed dengue shock syndrome, 17% (n = 290) expanded dengue syndrome, and 7% (n = 119) dengue hemorrhagic fever. The 10-year age groups significantly impacted CFR (estimate: 0.03, <i>P</i> <0.01), suggesting that each additional decade increased CFR by 30%, whereas gender was insignificant. Higher deaths were observed in the southern regions, whereas spatial clusters were primarily concentrated around Dhaka City, the epicenter of the outbreak. Substantial effects from neighboring districts were also identified. Bangladesh's 2023 dengue outbreak resulted in significant mortality, particularly, among older age groups.

In contrast, the random forest model outperformed others on the downscaled daily data, reaching an accuracy of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>95.8</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> , thereby supporting the efficacy of data downscaling for ML applications in epidemiology. Comparative analysis reveals that downscaling provided a <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>28.5</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> improvement in accuracy and an <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>89.3</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) over non-downscaled data which has been proven to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, illustrating the substantial advantages of employing downscaling for effective DENV forecasting. Based on the best-performing model, the study further projects a worst-case scenario for 2024, forecasting daily cases to peak at 1,382 ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>95</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> CI: 1,341-1,423) between August and October, with a gradual decline expected by December. The findings not only underscore the critical influence of meteorological variables on DENV transmission but also advocate for the adoption of sophisticated data preprocessing techniques, such as downscaling, to enhance prediction accuracy. This research marks a significant advancement in predictive epidemiology, offering a scalable framework for DENV and other vector-borne diseases, with implications for improving public health responses in vulnerable regions globally.",

        "abstract": "A life-threatening vector-borne disease, dengue fever (DF), poses significant global public health and economic threats, including Bangladesh. Determining dengue risk factors is crucial for early warning systems to forecast disease epidemics and develop efficient control strategies. To address this, we propose an interpretable tree-based machine learning (ML) model for dengue early warning systems and outbreak prediction in Bangladesh based on climatic, sociodemographic, and landscape factors. A framework for forecasting DF risk was developed by using high-performance ML algorithms, namely Random Forests, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), based on sociodemographic, climate, landscape, and dengue surveillance epidemiological data (January 2000 to December 2021). The optimal tree-based ML model with strong interpretability was created by comparing various ML models using the hyperparameter optimization technique. The feature importance ranking and the most significant dengue driver were found using the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) value. Our study findings detected a nonlinear effect of climatic parameters on dengue at different thresholds such as mean (27Â°C), minimum (22Â°C), maximum temperatures (32Â°C), and relative humidity (82%). The optimal minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed for dengue risk are 25-28Â°C, 32-34Â°C, 75%-85%, 10âmm, and 12âm/s, respectively. The LightGBM model accurately forecasts DF and agricultural land, population density, and minimum temperature significantly affecting the dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. Our proposed ML model functions as an early warning system, improving comprehension of the factors that precipitate dengue outbreaks and providing a framework for sophisticated analytical techniques in public health.",

        "abstract": "In 2023, the dengue virus (DENV) outbreak infected over 0.3âmillion cases and 1500 deaths in Bangladesh. Our study conducted serotyping and genomic surveillance in four districts of Southwest Bangladesh between September and October 2023. The surveillance data from 2019 to 2023 extracted from the Directorate General of Health Services in Bangladesh indicated a significant increase of Dengue infections in 2023, particularly during September-November. The two-layered hypothesis examination confirmed that, despite endemic months, 2023 dengue outbreak had a higher morbidity rate compared to previous years (2019-2022) in the southwest of Bangladesh. Serotyping using RT-PCR and E gene sequence analysis of 25 randomly selected positive samples reveals that DENV-2 was the dominant serotype circulating in this region during the study period. Genomic analysis (phylogenetic analysis and classical multidimensional scaling [cMDS]) exposed a new strain of DENV-2, classified under Cosmopolitan genotype within C clade, distinct from previous Bangladeshi strains until 2022. This strain, possibly migrating from India, might have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic years and exhibited higher morbidity rates, thus challenging our existing mitigation strategies. This investigation provides valuable insights for public health interventions and underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance in managing dengue outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease predominantly found in tropical and subtropical countries like Bangladesh. The Aedes species particularly Aedes aegypti carry and transmit the dengue virus thus causing dengue fever irrespective of age, gender, race or religion. Limited studies on dengue in low endemic zone of Bangladesh are available. This study attempted to investigate factors influencing dengue among suspected patients with dengue in a tertiary level hospital at Mymensingh region of Bangladesh. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 381 suspected patients with dengue admitted to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from June 2023 to December 2023. A face to face interview was performed and there were no ignored cases in this study. Dengue infection was confirmed by a positive result of NS1 dengue antigen test if the blood sample taken within 7 days of the onset of fever, and IgM antibody test if the blood sample taken after 7th day of symptoms. The chi-square test and binary logistic regression model were used to determine the influencing factors of dengue using SPSS software (IBM version 25). Most of the suspected patients came from urban environment (64.3%). The prevalence of dengue among suspected patients with dengue admitted at hospital was 74.3%, among them 45.9% and 28.3% were confirmed as dengue fever by NS1 antigen and IgM test respectively. Logistic regression model demonstrated that female had more likely to get dengue than male [aORâ=â2.08, CI:1.09-3.93; pâ<â0.05]. Similarly, patients came from urban environment [aORâ=â5.99, CI:3.09-11.64; pâ<â0.01], travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks preceding the survey [aORâ=â11.21, CI:5.30-23.72; pâ<â0.01], participants did not use mosquito net during sleeping at day time [aORâ=â2.74, CI:1.41-5.55; pâ<â0.01] and presence of water containers around the house [aORâ=â12.00, CI: 5.69-25.29; pâ<â0.01] had higher chance to get dengue compared to their counterparts. More than 25% suspected patients were not identified as dengue patients. Some factors were identified as risk for dengue. A safe working and living environment, self and community awareness and planned urbanization can help to prevent breeding of mosquito larvae that transmit dengue virus thus causing dengue.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Dengue virus (DENV) is the fatal pathogenic arthropod-borne virus (arboviruses) that belongs to the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family, which transmits to humans through mosquito bites from infected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes or maternal-fetal transmission. Despite antigenic differences, the four serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4) share 65-78% of their genome. Non-structural (NS) proteins amongst serotypes show analogous functions. Among NS proteins, NS3 and NS5 are frequently used as targets for antiviral drugs due to their multifunctional roles. <b>Methods</b>: To identify potential inhibitors of DENV, we created a phytochemical library of 898 compounds derived from 17 medicinal plants recognized for their medicinal and antiviral properties. The phytochemicals library has been docked against the target proteins. Phytochemicals with a docking score greater than -8.0 kcal/mol were selected for further evaluation using a machine learning approach. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to evaluate the root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, solvent-accessible surface area, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond count of the compounds. <b>Results</b>: From the docking results, Silibinin, Rubiadin, and Ellagic acid showed binding affinities of -8.5, -8.3, and -8.2 kcal/mol, respectively, for NS3, and NSC 640467, Bisandrographolide A, and Andrographidin A showed binding affinities of -9.3, -10.1, and -9.3 kcal/mol, respectively, for NS5 target proteins. These compounds exhibited strong interactions with target proteins. MD simulation results confirmed the stable formation of protein-ligand complexes. Further, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) and bioactivity predictions confirmed their pharmacological safety. <b>Conclusions</b>: Despite global public health concerns, DENV still lacks specific drug treatments. Our identified new drug candidates might help for developing effective antiviral inhibitors against the DENV. However, further confirmation is needed through in vivo and in vitro research.",

        "abstract": "Dengue cases in Bangladesh have surged in recent years. The existing insecticide-based control program is challenged by issues of insufficient household coverage and high levels of insecticide resistance in the primary dengue virus (DENV) vector, Aedes aegypti. A more sustainable, effective alternative could be the implementation of a Wolbachia-mediated disease management strategy. Hence, we created and characterised a Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti strain with a Dhaka wild-type genetic background, and compared its reproductive compatibility, maternal inheritance, fitness, and virus-blocking ability to the parental strains (Dhaka wild-type and wAlbB2-F4). The new Ae. aegypti strain wAlbB2-Dhaka demonstrated complete cytoplasmic incompatibility with the wild-type and complete maternal transmission, retaining levels of pyrethroid resistance of the Dhaka wild-type. No significant fitness costs were detected during laboratory comparison. Compared to the wild-type, wAlbB2-Dhaka mosquitoes demonstrated a significantly reduced genome copies of DENV in the bodies (44.4%, pâ=â0.0034); a two-fold reduction in dissemination to legs and wings (47.6%, pâ<â0.0001); and >â13-fold reduction of DENV in saliva expectorates (proxy of transmission potential) (92.7%, pâ<â0.0001) 14 days after ingesting dengue-infected blood.

Despite apparent symptoms, many patients tested negative on the NS1 rapid antigen test, the primary diagnostic tool. This study assesses the reliability of the NS1 rapid test results by analyzing its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values using RT-PCR as the gold standard. It also explores how viral serotypes and secondary infections may impact test performance, especially in NS1-negative cases. This cross-sectional study recruited febrile patients at two tertiary hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, within 24Â hours to 7 days of fever onset. Patients were selected based on physician-advised NS1 antigen testing, without restrictions on age, sex, or occupation. NS1 antigen test reports were collected from hospitals, and RNA testing via RT-PCR was conducted on all samples. Additional IgG and IgM tests were carried out for NS1-negative, RT-PCR-positive cases, and serotyping was performed on all RT-PCR-positive samples. Of the 194 samples tested, 65 (33.5%) were RT-PCR positive for dengue. Among these, 25 (38.5%) were NS1-negative. Most RT-PCR-positive cases were male (67.7%), with the 16-45 age group most affected. Symptoms like body aches (83.1%) and headaches (70.8%) were common. The predominant serotype was DEN-2 (97.5% in NS1-positive and 84% in NS1-negative cases), known for lower NS1 sensitivity. NS1 test sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 61%, 97%, 91%, and 83%, respectively. Early IgG positivity in NS1-negative cases suggested secondary infections. Despite the high specificity of NS1 rapid tests, moderate sensitivity demands alternative diagnostics like RT-PCR, which are crucial for better dengue management, especially in the presence of DEN-2 infections and associated secondary infections in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, dengue fever and influenza pose serious public health risks due to their high rates of morbidity and fatality. Frequent outbreaks have been caused by dengue, a virus spread by mosquitoes that causes flu-like symptoms, particularly during the monsoon season. Another infectious respiratory illness that varies every year is influenza. Both illnesses frequently co-circulate in tropical areas like Bangladesh, raising the possibility of co-infection and putting vulnerable groups at higher risk. The purpose of the article is to explore the effects of dengue and influenza co-infection in Bangladesh, looking at present issues and possible solutions to this dual health burden. This perspective piece gathers data from authoritative sources, including PubMed, the World Health Organization, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Relevant literature on dengue and influenza incidence, control measures, and co-infection dynamics was reviewed. In Bangladesh, dengue incidence are still on the rise, while influenza infections have climbed, especially during the winter. The country's healthcare system may be overburdened by the simultaneous spread of both diseases, particularly if dengue rates keep rising and influenza cases rise. To lessen the effects of these illnesses, effective community awareness campaigns, vector control initiatives, and early diagnosis techniques are crucial. Bangladesh must emphasize increased preventative and preparation measures, such as better monitoring, public health communication, and vaccine development research, given the twin danger posed by dengue and influenza. To lower the likelihood of co-infection and avert future public health emergencies, coordinated actions are essential.",

This situation warrants the importance of quickly identifying severe dengue patients to expedite necessary medical interventions which could potentially reduce the adverse consequences. The aim of this study was to identify clinical features and laboratory parameters of the severe dengue patients in the 2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. This hospital based cross-sectional study included the demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 1313 Dengue patients from several secondary and tertiary hospitals across Bangladesh from August 2023 to December 2023. According to the 2009 WHO classification, dengue cases were classified into severe dengue and non-severe dengue (with and without warning signs). Chi-square test, Fischer's exact test and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify potential risk factors associated with severe dengue cases. Of the 1313 patients included in this study, nearly 20% had severe dengue, 36.71% of them were from the 16-25Â year age bracket and nearly two-thirds were male. Fever (99.54%) was the most common clinical symptom followed by anorexia (69.54%) and severe headache (66.03%); whereas most common warning signs were severe lethargy (43.64%), persistent vomiting (27.57%), and severe abdominal pain and tenderness (20.03%) across all patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are significantly more common in severe dengue cases compared to non-severe ones. Among the laboratory parameters, decrease of platelet level and increased ALT level was more prominent in severe patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that severe abdominal pain, severe lethargy, respiratory distress, altered mental status, decreased urine output, pleural effusion and ascites were positively associated with the development of severe dengue. This study presents warning signs, clinical symptoms and trends of laboratory parameters associated with severe cases of dengue in Bangladesh that can be used in improving patient management in the future.",

The sensitivity of widely used rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) varies due to factors like viral load, serotypes, secondary infections, and disease severity. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of RDTs compared to RT-PCR, identifying key factors affecting sensitivity. The study at Dhaka Medical College (DMC) involved 683 suspected dengue cases. Blood samples and metadata were collected, and RDTs (NS1, IgG, IgM) were performed on-site. Samples were analyzed at icddr,b using RT-PCR for viral RNA detection and serotyping. Diagnostic performance was assessed using MedCalc, while metadata and sensitivity differences were analyzed with SPSS. We found that vomiting was the most common symptom, followed by, diarrhea, restlessness, and abdominal tenderness. RDT sensitivity was highest in cases with high viral loads, reaching 94 % within 1-3 days of symptom onset and 82 % beyond three days. Moderate viral loads showed sensitivities of 70 % for NS1+IgM and 84 % for NS1+IgM+IgG within three days, decreasing thereafter. Sensitivity was low in low viral load cases but improved after three days with IgG incorporation. DENV-3 and secondary infections showed higher false-negative rates.

        "abstract": "Dengue fever remains a significant public health challenge in Bangladesh. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and epidemiological profiles of confirmed dengue cases during the 2024 outbreak in Bangladesh. This observational study was conducted from June to September 2024 in four tertiary care hospitals across Bangladesh located in four administrative divisions. A total of 401 laboratory-confirmed (NS1- or IgM-positive) dengue patients agedââ¥â12Â years were included. Demographic data, clinical presentations, and laboratory findings were collected through faceâto-face interviews. The revised WHO 2009 dengue case classification was used for severity assessment of dengue patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize the results. The mean age of patients with dengue fever was 29.81âÂ±â11.64 (SD) years, with 7.2% of the patients being adolescents (aged 12-17Â years). A clear male predominance (88.3%) was observed. Overall, 65.6% of patients had dengue with warning signs, and 9% had severe dengue. Fever (94.3%), headache (70.3%), myalgia (66.1%), and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea (49.9%) and abdominal pain (43.9%) were common symptoms. The median in-hospital stay of both non-severe and severe cases were 4 & 5Â days, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.75%, which was significantly higher among severe dengue patients (5.6%). The 2024 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh predominantly affected young adult males, with a notable prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms alongside classic dengue manifestations.",

Managing outbreaks of dengue fever poses a challenge in tropical regions like Bangladesh, where consistently warm temperatures allow mosquitoes to breed and the virus to proliferate. This study introduces a deterministic model with four compartments to represent the transmission of the dengue virus, with parameters estimated using the 2023 outbreak data in Bangladesh. Utilizing the next generation method, we calculate the basic reproduction number (R<sub>b</sub>) and conduct sensitivity analysis to explore how various model parameters impact the transmission and spread of dengue in the population. Furthermore, personal protective measures and treatment are incorporated into our proposed model. Numerical simulations are conducted, using the average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to assess the cost-effectiveness of different control strategies, focusing on different control measures with varying cost weights. The findings demonstrate that the combined application of controls avert more infections at a minimal expenses. Additionally, there is a reciprocal relationship between the extent of control efforts and cost weights.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

This study intends to explore the circulating serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV) and their clinical associations across Bangladesh. The study enrolled 1317 febrile patients presenting with at least two symptoms (nausea or vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, and leukopenia) at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) between July and August 2023. They provided demographic data, clinical features, and blood samples. DENV was tested using a rapid detection test and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Of 1317 patients, 300 (23%) tested positive by rapid detection test and 775 (59%) by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The median age of participants was 20 years, with 61% of confirmed cases being male. The DENV-2 serotype was found in 88%, DENV-3 in 12%, and only one was found positive for DENV-4. Overall, 80 percent of dengue-positive cases showed warning signs (abdominal tenderness, persistent vomiting, rash, and bleeding). The severity of cases was significantly higher with DENV-2. This study generates insights into the distribution of dengue serotypes and their association with disease severity. The DENV-2 was found as the dominant serotype in the 2023 outbreak.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), presents a significant global health concern, with millions of cases reported annually. Despite significant progress in understanding Dengue fever, effective prognosis and treatment remain elusive due to the complex clinical presentations and limitations in current diagnostic methods. The virus, transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, exists in four closely related forms, each capable of causing flu-like symptoms ranging from mild febrile illness to severe manifestations such as plasma leakage and hemorrhagic fever. Although advancements in diagnostic techniques have been made, early detection of severe dengue remains difficult due to the complexity of its clinical presentations. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression in dengue fever patients using multiple microarray datasets from the NCBI GEO database. Through bioinformatics approaches, 163 potential biomarker genes were identified, with some overlapping previously reported biomarkers and others representing novel candidates. Notably, AURKA, BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3, CCNA2, CCNB2, CDC6, CDK1, CENPE, EXO1, NEK2, ZWINT, and STAT1 were among the most significant biomarkers. These genes are involved in critical cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation and mitotic checkpoint control, which are essential for immune cell function and response. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the dysregulated genes were predominantly associated with immune response to the virus, cell division, and RNA processing. Key regulatory genes such as AURKA, BUB1, BUB3, and CDK1 are found to be involved in cell cycle regulation and have roles in immune-related pathways, underscoring their importance in the host immune response to Dengue virus infection. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Dengue fever pathogenesis, highlighting key regulatory genes such as AURKA and CDK1 that could serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targets for therapeutic intervention, paving the way for improved management of the disease.",

        "abstract": "A more accurate assessment of the disease's incidence and fatality rate over the previous years could help with future outbreak detection and containment. Therefore, this scoping review was conducted to compile the results of research on dengue investigation in Bangladesh in terms of knowledge, attitudes, and practices; risk factors; clinical presentations; and stereotypes of dengue. The final analysis included 27 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA 2020 guidelines served as the basis for data extraction. All included articles were retrieved from PubMed, BanglaJOL, Google Scholar, Embase, Web Sciences, Cochrane Library, and other databases up to October, 2024. The quality of included studies in terms of relevance, reliability, validity, and applicability was also evaluated. The present study recorded a moderate understanding of dengue infection among slum dwellers and people in rural areas due to a lack of knowledge about it. Insufficient practices regarding dengue fever were also found among them. However, the differences in perception regarding dengue infection were observed in different parts of Dhaka city. Additionally, between 2017 and 2022, different dengue serotypes were the most common at various times. The potential risk factors included monsoon sessions (July to September), static water, scrapyards, and indoor plants; urbanization; population density; being outside in the morning and evening; sleeping during the day; and so forth. Along with the common symptoms of dengue, hematological abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, as well as elevated levels of ALT and AST, were observed in Bangladeshi dengue patients. Knowledge gap, moderate understanding, insufficient practices regarding dengue infection among slum dwellers and rural people, and varieties in dengue serotypes are the main obstacles to control the dengue outbreak. Therefore, it is essential to undertake several preventive measures to reduce the dengue infection and also understand the dengue serotypes.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a viral disease caused by the dengue flavivirus and transmitted through mosquito bites in humans. According to the World Health Organization, severe dengue causes approximately 40,000 deaths annually, and nearly 4 billion people are at risk of dengue infection. The urgent need for effective treatments against the dengue virus has led to extensive research on potential bioactive compounds. In this study, we utilized a network pharmacology approach to identify the DENV-2 capsid protein as an appropriate target for intervention. Subsequently, we selected a library of 537 phytochemicals derived from <i>Azadirachta indica</i> (Family: Meliaceae), known for their anti-dengue properties, to explore potential inhibitors of this protein. The compound library was subjected to molecular docking to the capsid protein to identify potent inhibitors with high binding affinity. We selected 81 hits based on a thorough analysis of their binding affinities, particularly those exhibiting higher binding energy than the established inhibitor ST-148. After evaluating their binding characteristics, we identified two top-scored compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamics simulations to assess their stability and binding properties. Additionally, we predicted ADMET properties using <i>in silico</i> methods. One of the inhibitors, [(5S,7R,8R,9R,10R,13R,17R)-17-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-5-oxo-2H-furan-4-yl]-4,4,8,10,13-pentamethyl-3-oxo-5,6,7,9,11,12,16,17-octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-7-yl] acetate (AI-59), showed the highest binding affinity at -10.4Â kcal/mol. Another compound, epoxy-nimonol (AI-181), demonstrated the highest number of H-bonds with a binding affinity score of -9.5Â kcal/mol. During molecular dynamics simulation studies, both compounds have exhibited noteworthy outcomes. Through molecular mechanics employing Generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations, AI-59 and AI-181 displayed negative ÎG_bind scores of -74.99 and -83.91Â kcal/mol, respectively. The hit compounds identified in the present investigation hold the potential for developing drugs targeting dengue virus infections. Furthermore, the knowledge gathered from this study serves as a foundation for the structure- or ligand-based exploration of anti-dengue compounds.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93Â·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89Â·6-96Â·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80Â·6 million (78Â·2-83Â·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emiratesâand Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15Â·6% (12Â·7-17Â·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14Â·2% (11Â·4-15Â·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16Â·5% [13Â·3-18Â·3]) than overweight (12Â·9% [12Â·2-13Â·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is a well-known epidemic zone for dengue fever. Several epidemiological and geographical factors influence the transmission and severity of dengue infection. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological and geographical factors that contributed to the severity of the dengue outbreak in Bangladesh in 2023. This hospital-based cross-sectional study investigated 1,313 dengue patients admitted to public hospitals in Dhaka, Chattogram and Kishoreganj, Bangladesh, between July and December 2023. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the independent risk factors for severe dengue infection. The average age of respondents was 29.5 years, with individuals aged 20-40 accounting for 59.5%. Of the 1,313 dengue patients, 19.3% (254) were diagnosed with severe dengue infection. Patients with low monthly income and those lacking awareness of dengue's spread from clogged rooftop water were respectively 2.35 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.35; P <0.05; 95% CI: 1.08-5.07) and 2.23 (aOR 2.23; P <0.05; 95% CI: 1.20-4.14) times more likely to develop severe dengue. The dengue outbreak has become a serious public health issue in Bangladesh, with factors such as low family income and lack of awareness contributing to the development of severe cases. These findings provide valuable evidence for policymakers to guide and implement preventive measures and raise awareness.",

        "abstract": "During the 2023-dengue outbreak in Bangladesh, a diagnostic evaluation study was conducted to investigate concurrent Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) transmission in Dhaka in 2023. The study explored to simultaneously detect the presence of ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV while considering relevant clinical and epidemiological risk factors, using a real-time multiplex RT-PCR system. Following this, it was planned to sequence the selected samples to identify genetic variations of the ZIKV infections within the population. This study was designed as a diagnostic evaluation, where participants meeting the inclusion criteria were prospectively recruited with written informed consent. A total of 399 febrile individuals were screened, with 185 meeting the inclusion criteria of having a fever onset within 2-5 days, along with one of the following clinical features, e.g. headache, myalgia, arthralgia or bone pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and 152 undergoing real-time RT-PCR testing. Five ZIKV-positive cases were identified, including one DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the ZIKV strains were part of the Asian lineage, closely related to Cambodian and Chinese strains from 2019. All ZIKV-positive cases were male, residing within a one-kilometer radius, with no prior travel history, suggesting community-level transmission. This study marks the first identification of ZIKV in Dhaka city and the first report of ZIKV-DENV co-infection in Bangladesh that highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by the symptomatic similarities between ZIKV and other arboviruses and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and public health interventions to mitigate the spread and impact of ZIKV in dengue-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that frequently causes seasonal outbreaks in Bangladesh, particularly during the monsoon months from June to September. Recent outbreaks have shown significant shifts in clinical manifestations, including changes in the timeframe and serotype mixing. This study focused on the clinical and hematological profiles of patients during the 2022 outbreak, which was notably severe. This quantitative cross-sectional study at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital classified 67 dengue-positive patients as having dengue fever (DF), dengue fever with warning signs (DFWS), and severe dengue (SD). Fisher's exact test, Pearson's chi-squared test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were conducted for statistical analysis using the R software (version 4.2), with significance established at <i>p</i>â<â0.05. Predominantly male patients (76%) aged 21-40 (63%) and middle-class patients from Dhaka (57%) formed the majority. Most patients (45%) lacked a regular drainage system. Laboratory tests showed 63% NS1 antigen (nonspecific antigen 1) positivity, and 16% tested positive for both NS1 and IgM (Immunoglobulin M). Symptoms included headache (84%), retroorbital pain (51%), joint pain (75%), myalgia (72%), vomiting (75%), abdominal pain (69%), diarrhea (39%), and shock (48%). Thrombocytopenia was present in 61% of patients, with 79% showing elevated hematocrit (HCT) levels. Pedal edema, pleural effusion, and ascites were observed in DF and DFWS cases, while SD cases exhibited distinct HCT level variations. Accurate clinical and laboratory assessments are vital for the treatment and prediction of dengue outcomes in Bangladesh, given the severe manifestations of dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is characterized by headache, muscle pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, and potential neurological complications or mortality. Severe cases involve critical plasma leakage, leading to DSS with fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and potential multiorgan involvement. Enhancing physician awareness regarding dengue case detection and management, along with routine dengue testing, are recommended for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",

Historically, most of the cases were recorded in the capital city, Dhaka. We aimed to characterize the geographical transmission of DENV in Bangladesh. From 1 January-31 December 2023, we extracted and analyzed daily data on dengue cases and deaths from the Management Information System of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. We performed a generalized linear mixed model to identify the associations between division-wise daily dengue counts and various geographical and meteorological covariates. The number of dengue cases reported in 2023 was 1.3 times higher than the total number recorded in the past 23Â years (321,179 vs. 244,246), with twice as many deaths than the total fatalities recorded over the past 23Â years (1705 vs. 849). Of the 1,705 deaths in 2023, 67.4% (<i>n</i>Â =Â 1,015) died within one day after hospital admission. The divisions southern to Dhaka had a higher dengue incidence/1000 population (2.30 vs. 0.50, <i>p</i>Â <0.01) than the northern divisions.

The aim of the study was to gauge liver dysfunction in patients with dengue infections. To judge the impact of dengue virus infection on liver function by measuring various liver function tests in blood samples of serologically diagnosed dengue patients. This study was undertaken as an observational cross-sectional study in the period of June 2019 to October 2020. Records of 120 serologically confirmed cases of dengue infection with available biochemical liver function tests, admitted to Bangladesh Medical College Hospital, were analyzed. Patients were classified as classical dengue fever (DF) - 64.1%, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) - 24.1% and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) - 11.6%. The mean age was 36.61Â±14.55 years. Normal values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had 27.0% of patients and 73.0% had values above normal.

The mean value of AST was significantly more than ALT. The degree of rise of ALT and AST was significantly more in DHF and DSS, as compared to DF. Mean serum ALT, AST and bilirubin values were significantly higher in patients with haemorrhage as compared to those without haemorrhage and in non-survivors. Serum albumin concentration was significantly lower in DSS than DHF or DF patients. Hepatic dysfunction was quite common altogether types of dengue infection, with AST rising significantly more than ALT.

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, continues to pose severe risks to public health and economic stability in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in developing nations like Bangladesh. The necessity for advanced forecasting mechanisms has never been more critical to enhance the effectiveness of vector control strategies and resource allocations. This study formulates a dynamic data pipeline to forecast dengue incidence based on 13 meteorological variables using a suite of state-of-the-art machine learning models and custom features engineering, achieving an accuracy of 84.02%, marking a substantial improvement over existing studies. A novel wrapper feature selection algorithm employing a custom objective function is proposed in this study, which significantly improves model accuracy by 12.63% and reduces the mean absolute percentage error by 70.82%. The custom objective function's output can be transformed to quantify the contribution of each variable to the target variable's variability, providing deeper insights into the workings of black box models. The study concludes that relative humidity is redundant in predicting dengue infection, while meteorological factors exhibit more significant short-term impacts compared to long-term and immediate impacts. Sunshine (hours) emerges as the meteorological factor with the most immediate impact, whereas precipitation is the most impactful predictor over both short-term (8-month lag) and long-term (26-30-month lag) periods. Forecasts for 2024 using the best-performing model predict a rise in dengue cases starting in May, peaking at 24,000 cases per month by August and persisting at high levels through October before declining to half by year-end. These findings offer critical insights into temporal climate effects on dengue transmission, aiding the development of effective forecasting systems.",

        "abstract": "Rapid human movement plays a crucial role in the spatial dissemination of the dengue virus. Nevertheless, robust quantification of this relationship using both spatial and temporal models remains necessary. This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue transmission under various human movement contexts. We obtained district-wise aggregated dengue incidence data from the Management Information System,Â Directorate General of Health Services of Bangladesh. The stringency index (SI), along with eight individual policy measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker database) and six mobility indices (as measured by Google's Community Mobility Reports) were obtained as human movement indicators. A multi-step correlative modelling approach, including various spatial and temporal models, was utilized to explore the associations of dengue incidence with the SI, fourteen human movement indices and the Eid festival. The global Moran's I indicated significant spatial autocorrelation in dengue incidence during the pre-pandemic (Moran's I: 0.14, Pâ<â0.05) and post-pandemic periods (Moran's I: 0.42, Pâ<â0.01), while the pandemic period (2020-2022) showed weaker, non-significant spatial clustering (Moran's I: 0.07, Pâ>â0.05). Following the pandemic, we identified the emergence of new dengue hotspots. We found a strong negative relationship between monthly dengue incidence and the SI (r<sub>spearman</sub>: -Â 0.62, Pâ<â0.01). Through the selection of an optimal Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we observed that the closure of public transport (Î²â=â-Â 1.66, Pâ<â0.10) and restrictions on internal movement (Î²â=â-Â 2.13, Pâ<â0.10) were associated with the reduction of dengue incidence. Additionally, observed cases were substantially lower than predicted cases during the period from 2020 to 2022. By utilising additional time-series models, we were able to identify in 2023 a rise in dengue incidence associated with the Eid festival intervention, even after adjusting for important climate variables. Overall, rapid human movement was found to be associated with increased dengue transmission in Bangladesh. Consequently, the implemention of effective mosquito control interventions prior to large festival periods is necessary for preventing the spread of the disease nationwide. We emphasize the necessity for developing advanced surveillance and monitoring networks to track real-time human movement patterns and dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "There is a shortage of rapid, accurate, and low-cost assays for diagnosing enteric fever. The dual-path platform for typhoid (DPPT) assay had high accuracy in retrospective studies with banked plasma samples. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DPPT assay in a prospective study using fingerstick capillary blood. For this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled children younger than 18Â years, who presented at the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with at least 3Â days of fever. We collected blood and nasal swabs, and did the following assays to assess the accuracy of DPPT: blood culture, serological assays for typhoid fever (DPPT assay, Widal, and Test-it), and molecular assays to identify alternative aetiologies (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza, dengue virus, and Rickettsia spp). The primary outcomes of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay for diagnosis of enteric fever. We evaluated the accuracy of combined anti-haemolysin EÂ and anti-lipopolysaccharide IgA readings using the DPPT assay in distinguishing culture-confirmed enteric fever from alternative aetiologies using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). Given the imperfect reference standard diagnostics for enteric fever, we used Bayesian latent class models, incorporating results from the typhoid and alternative aetiology diagnostics, to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay. We also did subgroup analyses for the assay across multiple biological variables. Between Aug 17, 2021, and July 16, 2022, we enrolled 501Â participants who presented with at least 3Â days of fever. 223 (45%) of 501Â participants were female and 278 (55%) were male. 77Â participants had culture-confirmed enteric fever (62 Salmonella entericaÂ serotype Typhi and 15 Salmonella entericaÂ serotype Paratyphi A) and 70Â were culture-negative with PCR-confirmed alternative aetiology (34 influenza AÂ or B, 22Â dengue virus, seven Rickettsia spp, six RSV, and one participant co-infected with RSV and dengue virus). The AUC for DPPT on fingerstick capillary blood in distinguishing typhoid from alternative aetiologies was 0Â·969 (95% CI 0Â·943-0Â·994). In latent class analysis, the sensitivity of DPPT was 93%Â (95% credible interval [CrI] 87-97) and specificity was 89% (85-93). The balanced accuracy was higher for DPPT (91%, 95% CrI 87-94) than blood culture (81%, 78-85), Test-it (77%,Â 74-79), or Widal (70%, 67-73). Assay performance did not vary by sex, age, duration of fever at presentation, antibiotic use before presentation, Salmonella serotype, or sample type. The point-of-care DPPT assay achieved high diagnostic accuracy for enteric fever in a highly endemic community. This assay has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for enteric fever, allowing rapid diagnosis and treatment, and could facilitate more appropriate antimicrobial use.

The disease is now endemic in some parts of the world, including Bangladesh. The disorder exhibits a wide range of clinical and laboratory features in children. Judicial fluid resuscitation during the critical phase and prompt referral to the appropriate health facility can be lifesaving. Objectives This research appraised clinical and laboratory features and treatment outcomes of DF in pediatric cases. Methods This prospective investigative work was conducted at Islami Bank Hospital, Dhaka, India, from July to October 2023. The study included 135 admitted pediatric cases of DF, either dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) or anti-dengue antibody IgM or IgG positive. Results Among the selected cases, boys were more predominant than girls, and most patients were in the age group of 5 to 10 years (n=46, 34%), most of them belonging to lower-middle-class families (n=56, 41.5%). All of the study participants had raised body temperatures, and most had abdominal pain (n=82, 60.7%), vomiting (n=77, 57%), cough (n=43, 31.9%), headache (n=38, 28.2%), body aches (n=32, 23.7%), and diarrhea (n=23, 17%). Dengue NS1 was positive in 91.1% (n=123) of cases. Raised hematocrit was found in 36.3% (n=49) of cases, leukopenia in 47% (n=63), and thrombocytopenia in 69.6% (n=94) of cases. Most of our patients were categorized as having DF (68.1%, n=92), followed by dengue with warning signs (16.3%, n=22), and severe dengue was present in 15.6% (n=21) of patients. Most were treated with crystalloid, and some with crystalloid and colloid solution. Fortunately, most of them recovered with no death. Conclusion DF may manifest with varied clinical and laboratory features in children. Appropriate treatment of critical phases, depending on clinical and laboratory features, is crucial to reducing dengue-induced miseries and fatal clinical outcomes among the pediatric population.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by <i>Leptospira</i> bacteria, which is reemerging in various regions and often poses a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms. While most infections are mild, severe cases occur in 5-10% of patients and are associated with high mortality, especially in areas with poor sanitation and urbanization. This study aims to investigate the association of specific parameters with leptospirosis diagnosis using a machine learning model and geographic mapping tools to identify spatial patterns and high-risk areas for the disease. Methods An observational retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care center analyzed patients clinically suspected of leptospirosis over the course of one year. The study utilized laboratory investigations, geographic mapping, and machine learning models to explore the association between various laboratory parameters and the predictive diagnosis of leptospirosis. Results The study, conducted over one year at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalyani, India, included 325 patients, of whom 43 (13.2%) tested positive for leptospirosis by IgM ELISA. Geographic mapping revealed case clusters around nearby districts of West Bengal, with a few cases from Tripura and Bangladesh. The study found no significant association between individual laboratory parameters and leptospirosis diagnosis. However, machine learning models, particularly k-nearest neighbors (KNN), demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy (accuracy: 74%, area under the curve: 0.6). Conclusion Geographic mapping identified clusters of leptospirosis cases; however, no significant association was found between individual laboratory parameters and the disease diagnosis. Machine learning models, particularly KNN, demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy. The study also highlighted the overlapping clinical features of leptospirosis, dengue, and scrub typhus in West Bengal, although it noted the absence of detailed clinical data as a limitation.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a serious public health issue in Bangladesh, where its incidence rises with the monsoon. Meteorological variables are believed to be responsible factors among others. Therefore, this study examines the effects of meteorological variables (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) on dengue incidence in Bangladesh. While previous studies have examined the relationship between dengue and meteorological variables using single model approaches, this study employs advanced econometric techniques to capture dynamic interactions. Furthermore, in the case of Bangladesh, this type of analysis is necessary due to the fact that dengue outbreak become one of the major issues. However, the analysis related to this issue is not available. For estimation purposes, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, Granger causality tests, Impulse Response Function (IRF), Variance Decomposition (VDC), and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) are employed. Rainfall has a significant impact on dengue incidence compared to temperature and humidity. The Granger causality test demonstrates that rainfall and dengue incidence are causally related unidirectionally. Rainfall can potentially have a short-term and long-term effect on the incidence of dengue, as per the estimates of the VECM model. These findings will assist policymakers in Bangladesh in developing a dengue fever early warning system depending on climate change. In order to efficiently avoid the spread of dengue in Bangladesh's dengue-endemic urban areas, this study suggests societal monitoring.",

Various forecasting models, including Seasonal ARIMA, Poisson regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and other statistical techniques, were applied to forecast dengue trends and generate future datasets. The results showed that Bangladesh has higher mean temperatures. The Poisson regression indicated that rainfall positively correlated with dengue cases in Bangladesh, while humidity and sunshine showed negative associations. In Singapore, temperature was positively associated with dengue cases, while rainfall and humidity had inverse relationships. ARIMA models predicted Singapore would experience the highest dengue cases by 2023. Based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the TBATS model was most accurate for predicting dengue cases in Bangladesh, while both ARIMA and TBATS models performed well in Singapore. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers in Singapore and Bangladesh to develop climate-based warning systems.",

        "abstract": "Dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, pose significant public health challenges. Effective treatments for these viruses remain elusive, highlighting the urgent need for new efficient antiviral therapies. This study explores prodigiosin, a microbial tripyrrole pigment, as an antiviral agent against both DENV and ZIKV employing advanced analytical approaches which integrate molecular docking, CASTp 3.0 validation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations providing insights into molecular interactions at an atomic level. Prodigiosin exhibited favourable drug-likeness properties, meeting Lipinski's rule of five and demonstrating optimal physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics according to Ghose's, Veber's, Egan's and Muegge's filters, essential for oral bioavailability. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity profiling indicated high intestinal absorption, minimal risk for drug-drug interactions and a low toxicity profile, with no AMES toxicity, hepatotoxicity, or skin sensitization. Molecular docking revealed prodigiosin's strong binding affinities to NS5 methyltransferases of both DENV (-7.6Â kcal/mol) and ZIKV (-7.7Â kcal/mol) viruses, suggesting potential disruption of viral replication. Notably, prodigiosin's binding affinities were comparable to ribavirin-5'-triphosphate and chloroquine, known inhibitors of DENV and ZIKV, respectively. MD simulations confirmed stable and specific interactions with prodigiosin with low root-mean-square deviation values. Additional analyses, including root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, indicated compact and stable complexes. These multi-parametric in-silico analytical strategies provide a novel perspective of prodigiosin as an antiviral agent, demonstrating its drug interactions at the molecular level. These promising results suggest that prodigiosin could serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against both DENV and ZIKV, warranting further experimental validation for therapeutic development against flaviviral infections.",

        "abstract": "Historically, pandemics constitute a major nuisance to public health. They have a debilitating impact on global health with previous occurrences causing major mortalities worldwide. The adverse outcomes are not limited to health outcomes but ravage the social, economic, and political landscapes. The World Health Organization (WHO) stands at the front of the pandemic response, strategizing to contain and mitigate the impacts on humans and the environment. It also intervenes in regional disease outbreaks that pose a threat to global health through strategic technical guidance, resource allocations, and expert support. With emerging pathogens, and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions are currently underway on global preparedness for a potential future pandemic. The effects of previous pandemics underscore the need to improve global health preparedness for upcoming pandemics. The WHO's July 2024 updated list of emerging pathogens serves as a potential tool to foster global health readiness for a future pandemic. It represents a change in the world's approach to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, shifting focus from specific pathogens to adopting a broader family-focused approach. This new list recognizes the shortcomings of previous lists and adopts a more forward-thinking, proactive, and flexible approach to dealing with familiar and unfamiliar pandemic risks, now incorporating 'Prototype Pathogens' and 'Pathogen X' into its risk classification. The WHO has set the pace, developing tools and guidelines for practice. This updated list of high-priority pathogens seeks to gear research and development toward combating and neutralizing the virulence of these pathogens. Recent outbreaks of Cholera, Mpox, and Dengue fever in Africa, Avian influenza (H5N2) in Mexico, Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh, and Oropouche virus in the Americas necessitate intensifying regional disease surveillance Research organizations and institutions must prioritize incorporating these tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies in the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative as outlined by WHO.",

In total, 16 publications from 2007 to 2024 were manually screened for inclusion in this systematic review. The articles were divided into three categories: climate and water, climate and health, and climate, water, and health. Due to the climate change, 20 million individuals in Bangladesh have been suffering from water- and health-related illness. The results showed that among Bangladeshi vulnerable groups, cholera, infant diarrhea, pneumonia, dengue, malaria, mental illness, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and an increase in communicable diseases like water-, vector-, and food-borne infections, along with malnutrition, are common. Further findings of the study include health risks, water-related risks, and difficulties in determining the consequences of climate change. This review study focuses on Bangladesh, a developing country, and the correlation between climate change and the dangers of water and health-related diseases.

        "abstract": "Acute arboviral infections like dengue have a significant negative socioeconomic and health impact on many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. About 3.9 billion Individuals are at risk of contracting the dengue virus and Asia bears the brunt of that load. Bangladesh, like other south-east Asian countries faced a massive outbreak of dengue in 2019. This cross sectional study was done in three tertiary care centers in Dhaka, Bangladesh during this worst outbreak of dengue. The study was conducted from 1st July to 31st December, 2019 with an aim to describe the clinical and laboratory variations among severe dengue cases and to conduct a serotype survey. This might help to understand the future changes in the clinical or serological profile of the circulating dengue virus. The study enrolled 1978 participants who were grouped into group B (Patients with warning signs or risk factors who should be admitted for close observation as they approach critical phase) and C (Patients having severe plasma leakage leading to dengue shock and/or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, severe organ impairment and severe metabolic abnormalities) according to national guidelines. Furthermore, 81 samples were serotyped using Qiagen One step RT-PCR kit (Cat. No: 210212). In addition sequencing (ABI sequencing platform) of partial C-prM gene of five DENV-3 isolates were done and analyzed (BLAST tool of NCBI) for phylogenetics (MEGA6 software package). Among the 1978 enrolled participants group B and C patients were 1580 (80%) and 398 (20%) respectively. The median (IQR) age of the patients were 26(11 to 41). Maximum proportion of the enrolled were male (72.3%) (p = 0.0002). Most common co- morbidities were hypertension (90; 4.5%) and DM (70; 3.5%). Group C patients more commonly presented with vomiting (p 0.133), diarrhea (p<0.0001) and abdominal pain (p 0.0203). The common mode of bleeding was melaena (12%). Thirteen (0.7%) patients succumbed to death, 12 of them belonged to group B who mostly presented with GI manifestations (99.9%) and melaena (12%). Only 5.6% of the cases were secondarily infected. In group C cases low hemoglobin and hematocrit was observed with high AST (p 0.004, 0.006 and 0.0016 respectively). Fluid requirement was also more in the same group (p<0.0001). Group B patients had a higher platelet requirement (p = 0.0070). Twelve patients (0.7%) required ICU. The management profile of these cases are showcased here which highlights minimal use of antibiotics and no application of steroids, which abides by the current national protocol. Furthermore, 81 samples from enrolled participants were serotyped and majority (79%) yielded DENV-3, followed by DENV 2 & 3 co-infection (13.6%) and DENV-2 alone (7.4%). Following phylogenetic analysis DENV-3 and DENV2 were deemed to be of genotype I and cosmopolitan variety respectively. This study presents the first instance of heterogeneous co-infection with several serotypes since 2000 in Bangladesh. It also gives an overview of serotype prevalence, management evaluation and clinical results that promises to navigate future control planning.",

        "abstract": "Dengue emerged as a significant health threat in endemic regions in recent years. However, inconsistent diagnostic accuracy in sequential dengue infections necessitate improved testing methods to ensure effective management of dengue cases. Here, we evaluated a portable, rapid, and sensitive molecular assay-reverse transcriptase recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RAA)-utilizing a mobile suitcase laboratory to detect infections in suspected dengue cases in Bangladesh. A total of 364 suspected patients with dengue were enrolled in the study. Dengue cases were confirmed by a positive result from any of the four tests: non-structural protein 1 (NS1) rapid diagnostic test (RDT), immunoglobulin (Ig) M RDT, quantitative reverse transcriptive-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and RT-RAA assay. IgG RDT was performed to differentiate between primary and secondary dengue infections. Of 364 suspected cases, 320 were confirmed dengue cases, with 55.94% classified as primary and 44.06% as secondary infections. Laboratory results showed comparable positivity rates between RT-RAA (78.8%) and NS1 RDT (77.1%) in primary dengue, followed by quantitative RT-PCR (57.5%) and IgM RDT (12.8%). RT-RAA demonstrated superior positivity rates in secondary dengue (76.6%), surpassing RT-PCR (60.3%), NS1 RDT (27%), and IgM RDT (24.8%). Combining RT-RAA with NS1 RDT detected infections in 89.95% primary and 81.56% secondary dengue. The findings suggest that complementing RT-RAA with NS1 RDT could significantly improve dengue detection rate, particularly, for secondary infections.",

This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

Integrated studies on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, seasonality, and genotype of dengue are limited. This study was conducted to determine recent trends in the molecular epidemiology, clinical features, and seasonality of dengue outbreaks. We analyzed data from 41 original studies, extracting epidemiological information from all 41 articles, clinical symptoms from 30 articles, and genotypic diversity from 11 articles. The study adhered to the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. A total of 565,438 dengue cases and 2,587 fatalities were documented from January 2000 to March 2024. Notably, 60% of cases during the 2019 and 2023 outbreaks were reported in regions previously considered non-endemic. Fatalities were more frequent among women (70%). The majority of the studies (95-100%) used the NS1Ag test, followed by IgG or IgM and RT-PCR tests. New hotspots of dengue transmission were identified in the southern (Khulna, 10.8% and Barishal, 11.8%) and southeastern (Chattogram, 13.8%) regions of Bangladesh. Serotyping was conducted on 92.4% (1,456 of 1,575) of isolates between 2012 and 2023. Of the four serotypes, DENV3 was the most prevalent (57%), followed by DENV2 (30%), DENV1 (11%), and DENV4 (<1%). Genotype DENV3-I (43 of 59 isolates) was the most prevalent, followed by DENV3-II (8 of 59). The highest frequency of dengue cases was observed in August (26.3%), followed by September (22.5%), October (20.2%), and November (13.08%). Fever (90.51, 95% CI 85-100%) was the most prevalent symptom, followed by headache (57.98, 95% CI 12-100%), vomiting (51.16, 95% CI 23-91%), abdominal pain (34.12, 95% CI 12-85%), and myalgia (25.53, 95% CI 13-85%), respectively.

This data set presents hematological parameters for the systematic record of patients suffering from dengue infection: age, sex, hemoglobin, WBC count, differential count, RBC panel, platelet count, and PDW. The dataset has in-depth records of patients admitted to Upazila Health Complex, Kalai, Jaipurhat, Bangladesh and thus offers an opportunity for further analysis of hematological changes produced by dengue infection. This dataset is valuable because of the potential contribution that these data will make to developing predictive models for disease severity and patient outcomes, enhancing clinical decision-making. It serves as a benchmark for the comparison of hematological responses across different demographics and geographical locations, adding value to the knowledge of dengue in the world. Moreover, the study has gone further to indicate how the characteristics related to blood may be affected by various treatment regimens, hence offering better treatment protocols. The data preprocessing in this study involved cleaning, normalization, and encoding of the variables before proceeding to perform the statistical analysis. This showed a Chi-Square test for no significant association of sex with the diagnostic outcome, as given by the <i>p</i>-value of 0.277. On the other hand, the Z-test and T-test results indicated a significant difference in the hemoglobin levels concerning gender; the obtained p-values are 2.534 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup> and 4.325 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively.

        "abstract": "Despite the initial hope inspired by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world is now dangerously close to breaching its target of limiting global multiyear mean heating to 1Â·5Â°C. Annual mean surface temperature reached a record high of 1Â·45Â°C above the pre-industrial baseline in 2023, and new temperature highs were recorded throughout 2024. The resulting climatic extremes are increasingly claiming lives and livelihoods worldwide. The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established the same year the Paris Agreement entered into force, to monitor the health impacts and opportunities of the worldâs response to this landmark agreement. Supported through strategic core funding from Wellcome, the collaboration brings together over 300 multidisciplinary researchers and health professionals from around the world to take stock annually of the evolving links between health and climate change at global, regional, and national levels. The 2024 report of the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown, building on the expertise of 122 leading researchers from UN agencies and academic institutions worldwide, reveals the most concerning findings yet in the collaborationâs 8 years of monitoring. Data in this yearâs report show that people all around the world are facing record-breaking threats to their wellbeing, health, and survival from the rapidly changing climate. Of the 15 indicators monitoring climate change-related health hazards, exposures, and impacts, ten reached concerning new records in their most recent year of data. Heat-related mortality of people older than 65 years increased by a record-breaking 167%, compared with the 1990s, 102 percentage points higher than the 65% that would have been expected without temperature rise (indicator 1.1.5). Heat exposure is also increasingly affecting physical activity and sleep quality, in turn affecting physical and mental health. In 2023, heat exposure put people engaging in outdoor physical activity at risk of heat stress (moderate or higher) for a record high of 27Â·7% more hours than on average in the 1990s (indicator 1.1.2) and led to a record 6% more hours of sleep lost in 2023 than the average during 1986â2005 (indicator 1.1.4). People worldwide are also increasingly at risk from life-threatening extreme weather events. Between 1961â90 and 2014â23, 61% of the global land area saw an increase in the number of days of extreme precipitation (indicator 1.2.3), which in turn increases the risk of flooding, infectious disease spread, and water contamination. In parallel, 48% of the global land area was affected by at least 1 month of extreme drought in 2023, the second largest affected area since 1951 (indicator 1.2.2). The increase in drought and heatwave events since 1981â2010 was, in turn, associated with 151 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity across 124 countries assessed in 2022, the highest recorded value (indicator 1.4.2). The hotter and drier weather conditions are increasingly favouring the occurrence of sand and dust storms. This weather-environmental phenomenon contributed to a 31% increase in the number of people exposed to dangerously high particulate matter concentrations between 2003â07 and 2018â22 (indicator 1.2.4). Meanwhile, changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are favouring the transmission of deadly infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, West Nile virus-related illness, and vibriosis, putting people at risk of transmission in previously unaffected locations (indicators 1.3.1â1.3.4). Compounding these impacts, climate change is affecting the social and economic conditions on which health and wellbeing depend. The average annual economic losses from weather-related extreme events increased by 23% from 2010â14 to 2019â23, to US$227 billion (a value exceeding the gross domestic product [GDP] of about 60% of the worldâs economies; indicator 4.1.1). Although 60Â·5% of losses in very high Human Development Index (HDI) countries were covered by insurance, the vast majority of those in countries with lower HDI levels were uninsured, with local communities bearing the brunt of the physical and economic losses (indicator 4.1.1). Extreme weather and climate change-related health impacts are also affecting labour productivity, with heat exposure leading to a record high loss of 512 billion potential labour hours in 2023, worth $835 billion in potential income losses (indicators 1.1.3 and 4.1.3). Low and medium HDI countries were most affected by these losses, which amounted to 7Â·6% and 4Â·4% of their GDP, respectively (indicator 4.1.3). With the most underserved communities most affected, these economic impacts further reduce their capacity to cope with and recover from the growing impacts of climate change, thereby amplifying global inequities. Concerningly, multiple hazards revealed by individual indicators are likely to have simultaneous compounding and cascading impacts on the complex and inter-connected human systems that sustain good health, disproportionately threatening peopleâs health and survival with every fraction of a degree of increase in global mean temperature. Despite years of monitoring exposing the imminent health threats of climate inaction, the health risks people face have been exacerbated by years of delays in adaptation, which have left people ill-protected from the growing threats of climate change. Only 68% of countries reported high-to-very-high implementation of legally mandated health emergency management capacities in 2023, of which just 11% were low HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Moreover, only 35% of countries reported having health early warning systems for heat-related illness, whereas 10% did so for mental and psychosocial conditions (indicator 2.2.1). Scarcity of financial resources was identified as a key barrier to adaptation, including by 50% of the cities that reported they were not planning to undertake climate change and health risk assessments (indicator 2.1.3). Indeed, adaptation projects with potential health benefits represented just 27% of all the Green Climate Fundâs adaptation funding in 2023, despite a 137% increase since 2021 (indicator 2.2.4). With universal health coverage still unattained in most countries, financial support is needed to strengthen health systems and ensure that they can protect people from growing climate change-related health hazards. The unequal distribution of financial resources and technical capacity is leaving the most vulnerable populations further unprotected from the growing health risks. As well as exposing the inadequacy of adaptation efforts to date, this yearâs report reveals a world veering away from the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1Â·5Â°C, with concerning new records broken across indicators monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that enable them. Far from declining, global energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reached an all-time high in 2023 (indicator 3.1.1). Oil and gas companies are reinforcing the global dependence on fossil fuels andâpartly fuelled by the high energy prices and windfall profits of the global energy crisisâmost are further expanding their fossil fuel production plans. As of March, 2024, the 114 largest oil and gas companies were on track to exceed emissions consistent with 1Â·5Â°C of heating by 189% in 2040, up from 173% 1 year before (indicator 4.2.2). As a result, their strategies are pushing the world further off track from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, further threatening peopleâs health and survival. Although renewable energy could provide power to remote locations, its adoption is lagging, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The consequences of this delay reflect the human impacts of an unjust transition. Globally, 745 million people still lack access to electricity and are facing the harms of energy poverty on health and wellbeing. The burning of polluting biomass (eg, wood or dung) still accounts for 92% of the energy used in the home by people in low HDI countries (indicator 3.1.2), and only 2Â·3% of electricity in these countries comes from clean renewables, compared with 11Â·6% in very high HDI countries (indicators 3.1.1). This persistent burning of fossil fuel and biomass led to at least 3Â·33 million deaths from outdoor fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2Â·5</sub>) air pollution globally in 2021 alone (indicator 3.2.1), and the domestic use of dirty solid fuels caused 2Â·3 million deaths from indoor air pollution in 2020 across 65 countries analysed (indicator 3.2.2). Compounding the growth in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, almost 182 million hectares of forests were lost between 2016 and 2022 (indicator 3.4), reducing the worldâs natural capacity to capture atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. In parallel, the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which contributed to 11Â·2 million deaths attributable to unhealthy diets in 2021 (indicator 3.3.2), has led to a 2Â·9% increase in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions since 2016 (indicator 3.3.1). Health systems themselves, although essential to protect peopleâs health, are also increasingly contributing to the problem. Greenhouse gas emissions from health care have increased by 36% since 2016, making health systems increasingly unprepared to operate in a net zero emissions future and pushing health care further from its guiding principle of doing no harm (indicator 3.5). The growing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is pushing the world to a future of increasingly dangerous health hazards and reducing the chances of survival of vulnerable people all around the globe. With the availability of financial resources a key barrier to tackling climate change, a rapid growth in predictable and equitable investment is urgently needed to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. A growing body of literature shows that the economic benefits of a transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions will far exceed the costs of inaction. Healthier, more resilient populations will further support more prosperous and sustainable economies (indicators 4.1.2â4.1.4). However, although funding to enable potentially life-saving climate change adaptation and mitigation activities remains scarce, substantial financial resources are being allocated to activities that harm health and perpetuate a fossil fuel-based economy. The resulting reliance on fossil fuel energy has meant many countries faced sharp increases in energy prices following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruption of fossil fuel supplies. To keep energy affordable to local populations, many governments resorted to increasing their explicit fossil fuel subsidies. Consequently, 84% of countries studied still operated net negative carbon prices (explicit net fossil fuel subsidies) in 2022, for a record high net total of $1Â·4 trillion (indicator 4.3.3), with the sums involved often comparable to countriesâ total health budgets. In addition, although clean energy investment grew by 10% globally in 2023âexceeding fossil fuel investment by 73%âconsiderable regional disparities exist. Clean energy investment is 38% lower than fossil fuel spending in emerging market and developing economies outside China. Clean energy spending in these countries only accounted for 17Â·4% of the global total. Moreover, investment in energy efficiency and end use, essential for a just transition, decreased by 1Â·3% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1). The resulting expansion of fossil fuel assets is increasingly jeopardising the economies on which peopleâs livelihoods depend. On the current trajectory, the world already faces potential global income losses ranging from 11% to 29% by 2050. The number of fossil fuel industry employees reached 11Â·8 million in 2022, increasing the size of a workforce whose employment cannot be sustained in a world that avoids the most catastrophic human impacts of climate change (indicator 4.2.1). Meanwhile, ongoing investments in coal power have pushed the value of coal-fired power generation assets that risk becoming stranded within 10 years (between 2025 and 2034) in a 1Â·5Â°C trajectory to a cumulative total of $164Â·5 billionâa value that will increase if coal investments persist (indicator 4.2.3). The prioritisation of fossil fuel-based systems means most countries remain ill-prepared for the vital transition to zero greenhouse gas emission economies. As a result of an unjust transition, the risk is unequally distributed: preparedness scores for the transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy were below the global average in all countries with a low HDI, 96% of those with a medium HDI, and 84% of those with a high HDI, compared with just 7% of very high HDI countries (indicator 4.2.4). Following decades of delays in climate change action, avoiding the most severe health impacts of climate change now requires aligned, structural, and sustained changes across most human systems, including energy, transportation, agriculture, food, and health care. Importantly, a global transformation of financial systems is required, shifting resources away from the fossil fuel-based economy towards a zero emissions future. Putting peopleâs health at the centre of climate change policy making is key to ensuring this transition protects wellbeing, reduces health inequities, and maximises health gains. Some indicators reveal incipient progress and important opportunities for delivering this health-centred transformation. As of December, 2023, 50 countries reported having formally assessed their health vulnerabilities and adaptation needs, up from 11 the previous year, and the number of countries that reported having a Health National Adaptation Plan increased from four in 2022 to 43 in 2023 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Additionally, 70% of 279 public health education institutions worldwide reported providing education in climate and health in 2023, essential to build capacities for health professionals to help shape this transition (indicator 2.2.6). Regarding the energy sector, the global share of electricity from clean modern renewables reached a record high of 10Â·5% in 2021 (indicator 3.1.1); clean energy investment exceeded fossil fuel investment by 73% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1); and renewable energy-related employment has grown 35Â·6% since 2016, providing healthier and more sustainable employment opportunities than those in the fossil fuel industry (indicator 4.2.1). Importantly, mostly as a result of coal phase-down in high and very high HDI countries, deaths attributable to outdoor PM<sub>2Â·5</sub> from fossil fuel combustion decreased by 6Â·9% between 2016 and 2021 (indicator 3.2.1), showing the life-saving potential of coal phase-out. Important progress was made within international negotiations, which opened new opportunities to protect health in the face of climate change. After years of leadership from WHO on climate change and health, its Fourteenth General Programme of Work, adopted in May, 2024, made responding to climate change its first strategic priority. Within climate negotiations themselves, the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) featured the first health thematic day in 2023: 151 countries endorsed the COP28 United Arab Emirates Declaration on Climate and Health, and the Global Goal on Adaptation set a specific health target. The outcome of the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement also recognised the right to health and a healthy environment, urging parties to take further health adaptation efforts, and opened a new opportunity for human survival, health, and wellbeing to be prioritised in the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) due in 2025. The pending decision of how the Loss and Damage fund will be governed and the definition of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance during COP29 provide further opportunities to secure the financial support crucial for a healthy net zero transition. Although still insufficient to protect peopleâs health from climate change, these emerging signs of progress help open new opportunities to deliver a healthy, prosperous future. However, much remains to be done. With climate change breaking dangerous new records and emissions persistently rising, preventing the most catastrophic consequences on human development, health, and survival now requires the support and will of all actors in society. However, data suggest that engagement with health and climate change could be declining across key sectors: the number of governments mentioning health and climate change in their annual UN General Debate statements fell from 50% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, and only 47% of the 58 NDCs updated as of February, 2024, referred to health (indicator 5.4.1). Media engagement also dropped, with the proportion of newspaper climate change articles mentioning health falling 10% between 2022 and 2023 (indicator 5.1). The powerful and trusted leadership of the health community could hold the key to reversing these concerning trends and making peopleâs wellbeing, health, and survival a central priority of political and financial agendas. The engagement of health professionals at all levels of climate change decision making will be pivotal in informing the redirection of efforts and financial resources away from activities that jeopardise peopleâs health towards supporting healthy populations, prosperous economies, and a safer future. As concerning records continue to be broken and people face unprecedented risks from climate change, the wellbeing, health, and survival of individuals in every country now hang in the balance.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection, spread by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes, is a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the four distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4), DENV-2 is associated with the highest number of fatalities worldwide. However, there is no specific treatment available for dengue patients caused by DENV-2. This study aimed to identify inhibitory phytocompounds <i>in silico</i> in <i>Vernonia cinerea</i> (<i>V. cinerea</i>), a widely used traditional medicinal plant, for treating DENV-2 associated illnesses. The chemical structures of 17 compounds from <i>V. cinerea</i> were sourced from the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry, and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database. These compounds underwent geometry optimization, were screened against nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of DENV-2, and further validated through molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). Baicalein, an established drug against DENV-2, was used for validation in molecular screening, MDS, and MM-GBSA analyses. Among these compounds, Beta-amyrin, Beta-amyrin acetate, Chrysoeriol, Isoorientin, and Luteolin showed promising potential as inhibitors of the NSP1 of DENV-2, supported by the results of thermodynamic properties, molecular orbitals, electrostatic potentials, spectral data and molecular screening. Besides, these compounds adhered to the Lipinski's \"rule of 5\", showing no hepatotoxicity/cytotoxicity, with mixed mutagenicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, final validation through MDS confirmed their potential, demonstrating stable tendencies with significant inhibitory activities against NSP1 of DENV-2 over the control drug Baicalein. Among the screened compounds, Chrysoeriol emerged as the most promising inhibitor of NSP1 of DENV-2, followed by Luteolin and Isoorientin. Taken together, our results suggest that Chrysoeriol is the best inhibitor of NSP1 of DENV-2, which could be evaluated as a therapeutic agent or a lead compound to treat and manage DENV-2 infections.",

This prospective observational study analysed 805 confirmed dengue cases during August-December 2023. Data on demographic, clinical and laboratory profiles, as well as outcomes, were gathered using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 25. The mean age of dengue patients was 31.5 (Â±12.2) y, with the majority being males (81.2%). All 805 patients experienced fever, 792 (98.4%) had headaches, 698 (86.7%) had myalgia, 601 (74.7%) had persistent vomiting and 598 (74.3%) had abdominal pain. Bleeding was observed in 191 (23.7%) patients and neurological symptoms were seen in 209 (25.9%) patients. Most patients (n=781, 97%) exhibited non-severe symptoms, while 3% (n=24) had severe symptoms. Among the 24 severe cases, four (16.7%) patients were reported to have encephalitis and one (4.2%) patient had meningoencephalitis. Moreover, 365 patients (45.3%) had travelled to an endemic region who were predominantly males (n=327, 89.6%). Most dengue patients recovered well with rapid fluid replacement therapy (n=754, 93.7%). The 2023 dengue outbreak in a non-endemic area of Bangladesh primarily impacted males, young adults, with the majority presenting non-severe symptoms. Further studies are essential to validate and build upon these results.",

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia, also known as diabetes, is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream. It can lead to the prolonged dysfunction, injury, and deterioration of several organs. In addition, dengue is a viral illness transmitted by mosquitoes that has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. In this article, we focused on the severity of comorbidities, difficulties in managing them, and preventive measures meant to lessen the risks associated with comorbidities in diabetic patients with dengue infection. We explored a number of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library, for this review article using various related keywords. The findings of this review article indicate that elderly dengue patients with diabetes should be admitted to the hospital for close observation and early management using fluid therapy. An observed association exists between dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and diabetes, indicating a possible consequence in this specific group. Additionally, patients with diabetes who contract dengue show elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Diabetes mellitus deteriorates the immune system, which exacerbates the progression of dengue fever. Cutting-edge technology and scientific research may assist in addressing the challenges that diabetes and dengue viruses pose in low- and middle-income countries. Implementing innovative diabetic care management is essential to ensuring consistency of care, improving a healthy lifestyle, and lowering patient risk factors and comorbidities. Dengue fever has spread to epidemic levels throughout the world. Inflammatory markers increase and the prevalence of DHF is greater in diabetes individuals with dengue infection. Given the continued growth of dengue in Asian nations, it is imperative that we concentrate our efforts and resources on providing more precise and effective treatment for this emerging issue.",

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes, has become a substantial public health issue in Bangladesh. The high population density and subtropical-tropical climate of the nation create conducive environments for the transmission of the virus. The recent increase in dengue cases in Bangladesh prompts an inquiry into the potential for the virus to progress into an epidemic manifestation. Bangladesh is prone to dengue outbreaks due to a multitude of contributing factors. To commence, the virus is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, and climate change is contributing to the expansion of its range. Additionally, the high population density in Bangladesh amplifies the vulnerability to dengue transmission. Intimate human proximity elevates the probability of contracting mosquito stings and transmitting viruses. The escalating incidence of dengue in Bangladesh is substantiated by the growing count of documented cases. The emergence of severe dengue is a contributing aspect that raises concerns about the potential worldwide consequences of the disease. It could potentially head from Bangladesh to neighboring nations via an infected individual. There exist apprehensions due to the substantial employment of Bangladeshi laborers overseas, compounded by the presence of foreign laborers within Bangladesh. The endeavor to control dengue in Bangladesh continues to face ongoing challenges. This review addresses the complexities of dengue transmission, assesses Bangladesh's readiness for managing epidemics, analyzes risk factors associated with dengue, and suggests preventive measures to mitigate the possibility of worldwide consequences of dengue originating within the nation.",

We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2Â·5th and 97Â·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7Â·3 million [95% UI 6Â·6-7Â·8] deaths; 10Â·7% [9Â·8-11Â·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160Â·5 million [147Â·8-171Â·6] DALYs; 5Â·6% [5Â·0-6Â·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93Â·8 million (89Â·0-99Â·3) prevalent and 11Â·9 million (10Â·7-13Â·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65Â·3% (62Â·4-67Â·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28Â·8% (28Â·3-28Â·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5Â·8% (5Â·7-6Â·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88Â·2% [53Â·4-117Â·7]), high ambient temperature (72Â·4% [51Â·1 to 179Â·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32Â·1% [26Â·7-38Â·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23Â·4% [12Â·7-35Â·7]), low physical activity (11Â·3% [1Â·8-34Â·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6Â·7% [2Â·5-11Â·6]), lead exposure (6Â·5% [4Â·5-11Â·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5Â·3% [0Â·5-10Â·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

        "title": "Spatio-temporal patterns of dengue in Bangladesh during 2019 to 2023: Implications for targeted control strategies.",
        "abstract": "Dengue, a viral infection transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, presents a substantial global public health concern, particularly in tropical regions. In Bangladesh, where dengue prevalence is noteworthy, accurately mapping the distribution of high-risk and low-risk areas and comprehending the clustering of dengue cases throughout the year is essential for the development of effective risk-based prevention and control strategies. Our objective was to identify dengue hotspots and temporal patterns over the years across Bangladesh in the years 2019-2023 excluding year 2020. A sequential spatial analysis was employed for each year to identify high-risk areas for dengue cases. Choropleth graphs were used to visualize the geographic distribution of dengue incidence rates per million population across the areas. Monthly distribution analysis was performed to identify temporal trends over the year 2022 and 2023. Additionally, the global Moran's I test was used to assess the overall geographical pattern. Subsequently, Anselin local Moran's I test was employed to identified clustering and hotspots of dengue incidences. Dengue cases in Bangladesh exhibited a significant increase from 2019 to 2023 (excluding 2020 data), with a cumulative total of 513,344 reported cases. Dhaka city initially bore substantial burden, accounting for over half (51%) of the 101,354 cases in 2019. The case fatality rate also demonstrated a steadily rise, reaching 0.5% in 2023 with 321,179 cases (a five-fold increase compare to 2022). Interestingly, the proportion of cases in Dhaka city decreased from 51% in 2019 to 34% in 2023. Notably, the southeast and central regions of Bangladesh showed the highest dengue rates, persisting throughout the study period. Cases were concentrated in urban regions, with Dhaka exhibiting the highest caseload in most years, followed by Manikganj in 2023. A distinct temporal shift in dengue transmission was observed in 2023, when the peak incidence occurred three months earlier in July with complete geographic coverage (all the 64 districts) compared to the peak in October 2022 (covering 95%, 61 districts). Positive global autocorrelation analysis revealed spatial dependence, with more stable trends in 2023 compared to previous years. Several districts like, Bagerhat, Barisal, and Faridpur remained persistent hotspots or emerged as new hotspots in 2023. Conversely, districts like Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Nilphamari, Rangpur and Sylhet consistently exhibited low caseloads, categorized as dengue coldspots throughout most of the years. Jhalokati in 2019 and Gopalganj in 2022, both initially classified as low-incidence district surrounded by high-incidence districts, emerged as hotspots in 2023. This study sheds light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue transmission in Bangladesh, particularly by identifying hotspots and clustering patterns. These insights offer valuable information for designing and implementing targeted public health interventions and control strategies. Furthermore, the observed trends highlight the need for adaptable strategies to address the region's evolving nature of dengue transmission effectively.",

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019 has accumulated a series of point mutations and evolved into several variants of concern (VOCs), some of which are more transmissible and potentially more severe than the original strain. The most notable VOCs are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, which have spread to various parts of the world. This study conducted surveillance in Jashore, Bangladesh to identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 coinfected with dengue virus and their genomic effect on the emergence of VOCs. A hospital-based COVID-19 surveillance from June to August, 2021 identified 9 453 positive patients in the surveillance area. The study enrolled 572 randomly selected COVID-19-positive patients, of which 11 (2%) had dengue viral coinfection. Whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed and compared between coinfection positive and negative group. In addition, we extracted 185 genome sequences from GISAID to investigate the cross-correlation function between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and VOC; multiple ARIMAX(p,d,q) models were developed to estimate the average number of amino acid (aa) substitution among different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. The results of the study showed that the coinfection group had an average of 30.6 (Â±1.7) aa substitutions in SARS-CoV-2, whereas the dengue-negative COVID-19 group had that average of 25.6 (Â±1.8; <i>P</i>â<â.01). The coinfection group showed a significant difference of aa substitutions in open reading frame (ORF) and N-protein when compared to dengue-negative group (<i>P</i>â=â.03). Our ARIMAX models estimated that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta required additional 9 to 12 aa substitutions than Alpha, Beta, or Gamma variant. The emergence of Omicron accumulated additional 19 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.74, 21.95) aa substitution than Delta. Increased number of point mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome identified from coinfected cases could be due to the compromised immune function of host and induced adaptability of pathogens during coinfections. As a result, new variants might be emerged when series of coinfection events occur during concurrent two epidemics.",

        "title": "Demographic-environmental effect on dengue outbreaks in 11 countries.",
        "abstract": "Dengue outbreaks are common in tropical or temperate countries, and climate change can exacerbate the problem by creating conditions conducive to the spread of mosquitoes and prolonging the transmission season. Warmer temperatures can allow mosquitoes to mature faster and increase their ability to spread disease. Additionally, changes in rainfall patterns can create more standing water, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between environmental and demographic factors and the dissemination of dengue fever. The study will use yearly data from 2000 to 2021 from 11 countries highly affected by dengue, considering multiple factors such as dengue cases, temperatures, precipitation, and population to better understand the impact of these variables on dengue transmission. In this research, Poisson regression (PR) and negative binomial regression (NBR) models are used to model count data and estimate the effect of different predictor variables on the outcome. Also, histogram plots and pairwise correlation plots are used to provide an initial overview of the distribution and relationship between the variables. Moreover, Goodness-of-fit tests, t-test analysis, diagnostic plots, influence plots, and residual vs. leverage plots are used to check the assumptions and validity of the models and identify any outliers or influential observations that may be affecting the results. The findings indicate that mean temperature and log(Urban) had a positive impact on dengue infection rates, while maximum temperature, log(Precipitation), and population density had a negative impact. However, minimum temperature, log(Rural), and log(Total population) did not demonstrate any significant effects on the incidence of dengue. The impact of demographic-environmental factors on dengue outbreaks in 11 Asian countries is illuminated by this study. The results highlight the significance of mean temperature (Tmean), maximum temperature (Tmax), log(Urban), log(Precipitation), and population density in influencing dengue incidence rates. However, further research is needed to gain a better understanding of the role of additional variables, such as immunity levels, awareness, and vector control measures, in the spread of dengue.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most significant mosquito-borne diseases in Nepal. In 2023, DENV outbreaks began in Eastern Nepal, near the border with India, and rapidly spread nationwide. The study aims to describe the outbreak's epidemiological pattern, laboratory characteristics, DENV serotypes, and genotypes. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in four hospitals in Jhapa, Eastern Nepal, in 2023. Acute serum samples were obtained from dengue suspected patients within 7 days of illness and subjected to virus isolation, conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and phylogenetic analysis. Out of 60 samples, 42 (70 %), 11 (18.3 %) and 7 (11.7 %) were primary, secondary and non-dengue infection, respectively. Among 53 dengue confirmed patients, 46 (86.7 %) were positive for NS1 and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for both NS1 and IgM. Out of 42 dengue isolates, a new clade of the cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2 was the most prevalent (28, 66.7 %), followed by genotype III of DENV-3 (11, 26.2 %) and genotype V of DENV-1 (3, 7.1 %). Genotype III of DENV-3 was first introduced in 2022-2023 in Nepal. Phylogenetic analysis of the E gene revealed the DENV-2 isolates from Nepal had 98 % homologous nucleotide similarity with the strains from India and Bangladesh. To our knowledge, this is the first report of circulating serotypes and genotypes of DENV in Jhapa. Integrating molecular findings into the dengue control plan can enhance surveillance efforts, monitor disease trends, and implement proactive measures to reduce the burden of dengue and prevent fatalities in future outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is an important vector-borne disease occurring globally. Dengue virus (DENV) infection can result in a potentially life-threatening disease. To date, no DENV-specific antiviral treatment is available. Moreover, an equally effective pan-serotype dengue virus vaccine is not available. Recently, two DENV vaccines, Dengvaxia and Qdenga, were licensed for limited use. However, none of them have been approved in Bangladesh. DENV is transmitted by <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes, and global warming caused by climate change favoring <i>Aedes</i> breeding plays an important role in increasing DENV infections in Bangladesh. Dengue is a serious public health concern in Bangladesh. In the year 2023, Bangladesh witnessed its largest dengue outbreak, with the highest number of dengue cases (<i>n</i>â=â321,179) and dengue-related deaths (<i>n</i>â=â1,705) in a single epidemic year. There is an increased risk of severe dengue in individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunoglobulin G if the individuals become infected with different DENV serotypes. To date, vector control has remained the mainstay for controlling dengue; therefore, an immediate, strengthened, and effective vector control program is critical and should be regularly performed for controlling dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. In addition, the use of DENV vaccine in curbing dengue epidemics in Bangladesh requires more consideration and judgment by the respective authority of Bangladesh. This review provides perspectives on the control and prevention of dengue outbreaks. We also discuss the challenges of DENV vaccine use to reduce dengue epidemics infection in Bangladesh.",

We retrospectively analyzed dengue fever cases reported by national health surveillance systems, focusing on incidence, geographical spread, and fatalities. Statistical methods were used to explore correlations between population density, healthcare capacity, and disease prevalence. Our study revealed that in 2023, dengue cases and deaths surged five-fold (from 62,382 to 320,835) and nearly six-fold (from 281 to 1699) compared with 2022. Major cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong emerged as epicenters with significantly higher caseloads and mortality rates. The analysis identified a strong positive correlation between population density and disease prevalence, suggesting urbanization as a contributing factor. In addition, a shift in the peak dengue season from August to September was observed. Furthermore, disparities in health care infrastructure were identified, with densely populated areas experiencing critical shortages of hospital beds, potentially impacting fatality rates. This unprecedented dengue outbreak in Bangladesh highlights the need for a multifaceted approach. Prioritizing vector control, targeted public awareness in identified hotspots, addressing healthcare resource inequities, and further research on environmental and demographic determinants of transmission are crucial for mitigating future outbreaks in Bangladesh.",

Bangladesh has a noticeable rise in VBDs attributed to climate change. Despite the severity of this issue, the interconnections between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this research gap, our review meticulously examined existing literature on the relationship between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, we identified 3849 records from SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Ultimately, 22 research articles meeting specific criteria were included. We identified that the literature on the subject matter of this study is non-contemporaneous, with 68% of studies investing datasets before 2014, despite studies on climate change and dengue nexus having increased recently. We pinpointed Dhaka and Chittagong Hill Tracts as the dengue and malaria research hotspots, respectively. We highlighted that the 2023 dengue outbreak illustrates a possible shift in dengue-endemic areas in Bangladesh. Moreover, dengue cases surged by 317% in 2023 compared to 2019 records, with a corresponding 607% increase in mortality compared to 2022. A weak connection was observed between dengue incidents and climate drivers, including the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). However, no compelling evidence supported an association between malaria cases, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Bay of Bengal, along with the NINO3 phenomenon. We observed minimal microclimatic and non-climatic data inclusion in selected studies. Our review holds implications for policymakers, urging the prioritization of mitigation measures such as year-round surveillance and early warning systems.

Dengue fever remains a significant public health challenge in Southeast Asia, with complex epidemiological patterns. Previous research has mainly focused on den serotypes in Dhaka. Therefore, this study aims to identify serotypes in the Rajshahi district under endemic conditions. Blood samples from suspected dengue patients were collected at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. Initial rapid detection of dengue-positive cases was performed using (Nonstructural Protein 1Â L) NS1, (Immunoglobulin G) IgG, and (Immunoglobulin M) IgM tests. Upon confirmation of dengue positivity, viral RNA was extracted for molecular testing. The dengue serotype was identified using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The study revealed that 93.3Â % of the patient were infected with (Dengue virus type 2) DENV2 and rest 6.7Â % of the patient were (Dengue virus type 3) DENV3 among 30 dengue positive patients. Demographic observations show the distribution of dengue over nine upazilas. In Paba upazila, we found two DENV3 alongside DENV2. The study concludes that the 2023 dengue outbreak in Rajshahi district, Bangladesh, predominantly involved the DENV2 serotype.

Coinfection with these pathogens presents significant diagnostic challenges for clinicians due to overlapping clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. This case report aims to elucidate two clinical scenarios where the coinfection of dengue and leptospirosis complicates the disease course, creating a diagnostic conundrum. We present the clinical scenarios of two Bangladeshi males, aged 25 and 35Â years, who were admitted to our hospital with acute febrile illness. The first patient exhibited hepatic and renal involvement, while the second presented with symptoms initially suggestive of meningoencephalitis. Both cases were initially managed under the presumption of dengue infection based on positive serology. However, further evaluation revealed coinfection with Leptospira, complicating the disease course. Both patients received appropriate treatment for dengue and antibacterial therapy for leptospirosis, ultimately resulting in their recovery. These case scenarios underscore the critical importance for clinicians in regions where dengue and Leptospira are endemic to consider both diseases when evaluating patients presenting with acute febrile illness.",

In this study, we have critically analyzed the factors contributing to the escalation of the dengue burden in recent years in Bangladesh and discussed the strategies for effective control. This retrospective observational study analyzed the dengue data collected from the five most dengue-affected countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines) from 2019 to 2023. An increased number of dengue-related deaths has been recorded in Bangladesh since 2021. The year 2023 has witnessed a record high dengue-related deaths in Bangladesh, with cumulative deaths for the year surpassing all totals of the previous 23 years (2000-2022: 853 deaths vs 2023: 1705 deaths). Comparing the epidemiologic data of major dengue-endemic countries over the last 5 years, Bangladesh recorded higher dengue fatality rates consecutively for 3 years. Besides the environmental and viral host factors, which are also applicable to many other dengue-endemic countries, there is concern about the failures and mismanagement of authorities to manage dengue patients properly. This study provided evidence that Bangladesh recorded higher dengue fatality rates in recent years. By implementing multi-pronged proactive approaches that can ensure proper prevention programs and appropriate patient management, Bangladesh or similar other countries can significantly reduce the current dengue burden and the associated deaths.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue. Although most infected individuals are asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms, severe manifestations could potentially devastate human populations in tropical and subtropical regions. In hyperendemic regions such as South Asia and Southeast Asia (SEA), all four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) have been prevalent for several decades. Each DENV serotype is further divided into multiple genotypes, reflecting the extensive diversity of DENV. Historically, specific DENV genotypes were associated with particular geographical distributions within endemic regions. However, this epidemiological pattern has changed due to urbanization, globalization, and climate change. This review comprehensively traces the historical and recent genetic epidemiology of DENV in Asia from the first time DENV was identified in the 1950s to the present. We analyzed envelope sequences from a database covering 16 endemic countries across three distinct geographic regions in Asia. These countries included Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka from South Asia; Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam from Mainland SEA; and Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore from Maritime SEA. Additionally, we describe the phylogenetic relationships among DENV genotypes within each serotype, along with their geographic distribution, to enhance the understanding of DENV dynamics.",

A total of 1,705 people died in Bangladesh, representing the highest case fatality rate (0.5%) due to dengue in the world for that year. The severity of dengue infection is to some extent related to the emergence of new circulating serotypes. To identify the possible predominant serotype in 2023, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based identification technique was used on stored serum samples of suspected dengue patients during the period between July and December 2023. The overall result of molecular serotyping showed that dengue virus (DENV-2) reappeared as the predominant serotype (74.1%), followed by a moderate number of samples with DENV-1 (19.8%) and DENV-3 (6.1%), in 2023. However, DENV-1 was found to be dominant in a few rural areas of Cox's Bazar districts. During the 2019 outbreak, DENV-3 was the dominant serotype, which seemed to be replaced by the DENV-2 serotype; this may have impacted the increased case fatality in 2023.",

        "abstract": "Traditional medicine (TM) interventions are plausible therapeutic alternatives to conventional medical interventions against emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases, particularly in low-and middle-income countries that may lack resources and infrastructure. Despite the growing popularity in the usage of TM interventions, their clinical safety and effectiveness are still contested within conventional healthcare in many countries. We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature that synthesises and maps the evidence on TM interventions for the treatment and prevention of zoonoses on the Indian subcontinent. The region, a global hotspot of biodiversity and emerging infections, is characterised by high prevalence of TM use. Based on the scientific literature (mostly case study research, n=l06 studies), our review (1) maps the scope of the literature, (2) synthesises the evidence on the application of TM interventions for zoonoses, and (3) critically reflects on the state of TM and identifies areas for future research focus. The evidence synthesis confirmed widespread usage of TM interventions for zoonoses on the subcontinent, with the majority of research reported from India (n=99 studies, 93.4%), followed by Pakistan (n=3 studies, 2.8%), Bangladesh (n=2 studies, 1.9%), and Sri Lanka (n=1, 0.9%). Most of the reviewed studies reported on ethno-medicinal uses of plant species, primarily for treating dengue (n=20 studies), tuberculosis (n=18 studies), Escherichia coli infection (n=16 studies), lymphatic filariasis and cholera (n=9 apiece). However, the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these reported TM interventions is limited, indicating that these data are rarely collected and/or shared within the peer-reviewed literature. This review thus highlights that, whilst TMs are already being used and could offer more widely accessible interventions against emerging and endemic zoonoses and ectoparasites, there is an urgent need for rigorous clinical testing and validation of the safety and effectiveness of these interventions.",

We conducted a nationally representative seroprevalence survey in 70 randomly selected communities immediately before the epidemic. We found that 69 of 2938 sampled individuals (2.4%) were seropositive to CHIKV. Seropositivity to dengue virus (adjusted odds ratio, 3.13 [95% confidence interval, 1.86-5.27]), male sex (0.59 [.36-.99]), and community presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1.80 [1.05-3.0]7) were significantly associated with CHIKV seropositivity. Using a spatial prediction model, we estimated that across the country, 4.99 (95% confidence interval, 4.89-5.08) million people had been previously infected.

        "abstract": "Climate change affects the transmission of vector-borne diseases like dengue, posing a substantial public health threat. Bangladesh, with its favorable conditions for Dengue transmission, has experienced periodic outbreaks. This study explores the relationship between climate change knowledge, perceptions of the Dengue-climate link, and the associated factors among Bangladeshi youth. In the Dhaka district of Bangladesh, a cross-sectional study was conducted between September and October 2023, involving face-to-face interviews with 1,358 participants. Convenient (non-probability) sampling was utilized for participant selection. Data collection involved the administration of a semi-structured questionnaire encompassing informed consent, socio-demographic information, and inquiries pertaining to climate change-related knowledge (13 items) and perception (11 items). Data analysis utilized STATA (Version 15.0) and SPSS (Version 26.0). The mean scores for knowledge and perceptions were determined to be 7.10âÂ±â3.20 (out of 13) and 26.60âÂ±â4.12 (out of 33) respectively. Participants had a mean age of 22.02âÂ±â1.58âyears. The study revealed that unmarried status, living in a nuclear family, being a non-smoker, good self-perception of physical health, regular sleep patterns, moderate social media usage, older age, unemployment, and daily media consumption are factors associated with higher knowledge and perception regarding the Dengue-climate change link. Moreover, a positive association was observed between knowledge of climate change and favorable attitudes toward the Dengue-climate connection. This study underscores the importance of tailored climate change education for youth in Bangladesh and highlights key variables influencing their knowledge and perceptions. Notably, there exists a positive association between climate change knowledge and favorable attitudes toward the Dengue-climate connection. These insights underscore the importance of targeted educational campaigns and policy interventions aimed at enhancing climate consciousness among the youth population, thereby fostering proactive measures to mitigate the impact of Dengue fever in the context of climate change.",

A study was conducted to identify the contribution of bamboo stumps to these disease vectors that were used in the flower garden as pillars to hold the bamboo flex fence. Two sizes of whole bamboo were used to hold fences around gardens at Dhaka University, Bangladesh, and were painted red and green. Mosquito larvae and pupae were collected from bamboo stumps between July and August, and vectors were identified up to the species level. The data were analyzed using the STATA/MP 14.2 version. 83.5% and 0.2% were Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, and the remaining were Culex and Ar-migeres species. Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and both species-positive bamboo stumps were 46.9, 0.7, and 47.1%, respectively. 54.5% of the bamboo stumps had at least one mosquito species. The average stump depth for Aedes positive stumps (mean=11.7 cm, SE = 0.5) was significantly (p <0.001) higher than the Aedes negative stumps (mean = 9.5 cm, SE = 0.4). 53.8% and 38.0% stumps were found Aedes positive on the ground and upper sides of fences, respectively, and found significant (p<0.01) differences between both sides. A zero-inflated negative binomial count model is significant at a 5% level of significance, Ï2(4) = 11.8, p = 0.019 (<0.05) for Ae. albopictus.

For different amplitudes (A) within a sequence of values (AÂ =Â 0.1 to 0.5), the highest number of infected mosquitoes occurs in July. However, simulations project that when Î²<sub>M</sub>Â =Â 0.5 and AÂ =Â 0.1, the peak of human infections occurs in late September. Not only the next-generation matrix approach along with the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are observed, but also a cutting-edge Machine learning (ML) approach such as the Prophet model is explored for forecasting future Dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. Remarkably, we have fitted our solution curve of infection with the reported data by the government of Bangladesh. We can predict the outcome of 2024 based on the ML Prophet model situation of Dengue will be detrimental and proliferate 25Â % compared to 2023.

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant public health challenge in Pakistan, with a significant outbreak in 2023, prompting our investigation into the serotype and genomic diversity of the dengue virus (DENV). NS-1 positive blood samples from 153 patients were referred to the National Institute of Health, Pakistan, between JulyÂ and October 2023. Among these, 98 (64.1%) tested positive using multiplex real-time PCR, with higher prevalence among males (65.8%) and individuals aged 31-40. Serotyping revealed DENV-1 as the predominant serotype (84.7%), followed by DENV-2 (15.3%). Whole-genome sequencing of 18 samples (DENV-1â=â17, DENV-2â=â01) showed that DENV-1 (genotype III) samples were closely related (>99%) to Pakistan outbreak samples (2022), and approx.â>â98% with USA (2022), Singapore and China (2016), Bangladesh (2017), and Pakistan (2019).

No coinfection with dengue serotypes or other viruses were observed. Comparisons with previous DENV-1 sequences highlighted genetic variations affecting viral replication efficiency (NS2B:K55R) and infectivity (E:M272T).

        "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is an endemic disease that has become a public health concern around the globe. The NS3 protease-helicase enzyme is an important target for the development of antiviral drugs against DENV (dengue virus) due to its impact on viral replication. Inhibition of the activity of the NS3 protease-helicase enzyme complex significantly inhibits the infection associated with DENV. Unfortunately, there are no scientifically approved antiviral drugs for its prevention. However, this study has been developed to find natural bioactive molecules that can block the activity of the NS3 protease-helicase enzyme complex associated with DENV infection through molecular docking, MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Three hundred forty-two (342) compounds selected from twenty traditional medicinal plants were retrieved and screened against the NS3 protease-helicase protein by molecular docking and MM-GBSA studies, where the top six phytochemicals have been identified based on binding affinities. The six compounds were then subjected to pharmacokinetics and toxicity analysis, and we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on three protein-ligand complexes to validate their stability. Through computational analysis, this study revealed the potential of the two selected natural bioactive inhibitors (CID-440015 and CID-7424) as novel anti-dengue agents.",

Coinfection is also significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. Comorbidity risk during a coinfection is of a greater concern. Although the pathophysiologies of the two infections vary, their identical clinical symptoms during coinfection result in diagnostic and therapeutic complexities. A literature search for the current relevant reports was carried out. The searched databases were Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and the Web of Science, with health agencies like the WHO. Based on the selection criteria, the most recent and pertinent reports published in English language were included for the ease of understanding, deciphering and analysing the secondary data. A delay in proper diagnosis of coinfection could result in serious complications with poor patient outcome. Whether it is a standalone dengue or COVID-19 infection or a coinfection, specific biomarkers may be utilized for its foolproof diagnosis. This article highlights the various diagnostic techniques and immune responses from the perspective of prompt and appropriate public health management for patients suffering from COVID-19 and dengue viral coinfections, both being independently or collectively capable of damaging a human body. As coinfection poses significantly large burden on an already-fragile healthcare facility, constant monitoring of a coinfected patient is needed for prompt and suitable therapeutics. Also, to maintain high vigilance and invoke appropriate preventive measures particularly in dengue endemic regions, the government, healthcare authority and the general public need to collaborate and cooperate.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has been going through outbreaks of dengue fever cases every year since 2000. Yet this year's (2023) episode of dengue fever has crossed every line concerning fatality. Symptoms of the fever range from high fever, headaches, and muscle aches to deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The present review aims to assess the current pathogenicity and associated risk factors of recent dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. To perform this review work, we extracted relevant information from published articles available in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We used dengue virus, dengue fever, and dengue outbreaks as keywords while searching for information. This Aedes mosquito-transmitted viral fever is more common in Bangladesh because of the tropical nature and immense burden of populations, resulting in convenient conditions for the reproduction of the vector. The rapid genetic transformation of this RNA virus and the resistance of its vector against insecticides have intensified the situation. The number of hospitalized patients has increased, and the case fatality rate has risen to 0.47%. Inadequate mosquito control measures, plenty of vector breeding sites, and a lack of public awareness have worsened the situation. Routine spraying of effective insecticides in high-risk zones, regular inspection of potential mosquito breeding sites, and public awareness campaigns are the keys to limiting the spread of this virus. Also, the availability of detection kits, improved hospital settings, and trained health professionals are mandatory to keep disease fatalities under control. Dengue fever is a preventable disease. The successful development of a competent vaccine is now a prime need for preventing any future upsurge of the disease. Also, we recommend public awareness, vector control activities, and global collaboration to prevent spread.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a significant mosquito-borne disease. Several studies have utilized estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to assess the global, regional or national burden of dengue over time. However, our recent investigation suggests that GBD's estimates for dengue cases in Taiwan are unrealistically high. The current study extends the scope to compare reported dengue cases with GBD estimates across 30 high-burden countries and territories, aiming to assess the accuracy and interpretability of the GBD's dengue estimates. Data for this study were sourced from the GBD 2019 study and various national and international databases documenting reported dengue cases. The analysis targeted the top 30 countries and territories with the highest 10-year average of reported cases from 2010 to 2019. Discrepancies were quantified by computing absolute differences and ratios between the 10-year average of reported cases and GBD estimates. Coefficients of variation (CV) and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess variations and trends in the two data sources. Significant discrepancies were noted between reported data and GBD estimates in the number of dengue cases, incidence rates, and EAPCs. GBD estimates were substantially higher than reported cases for many entities, with the most notable differences found in China (570.0-fold), India (303.0-fold), Bangladesh (115.4-fold), Taiwan (85.5-fold) and Indonesia (23.2-fold). Furthermore, the GBD's estimates did not accurately reflect the extensive yearly fluctuations in dengue outbreaks, particularly in non-endemic regions such as Taiwan, China and Argentina, as evidenced by high CVs. This study reveals substantial discrepancies between GBD estimates and reported dengue cases, underscoring the imperative for comprehensive analysis in areas with pronounced disparities. The failure of GBD estimates to represent the considerable annual fluctuations in dengue outbreaks highlights the critical need for improvement in disease burden estimation methodologies for dengue.",

Cognitive Behavioral Anti-insomnia therapies including benzodiazepines often face limitations due to patient adherence or potential adverse effects. This study focused on identifying novel bioactive compounds from medicinal plants, aiming to discover and develop new therapeutic agents with low risk-to-benefit ratios using computational drug discovery methods. Through a systematic framework involving compound library preparation, evaluation of drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics, toxicity prediction, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulations, two natural compounds such as 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-8-methoxy-6-prop-2-enyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol from Ocimum tenuiflorum and 7-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-1,4a-dimethyl-9-oxo-3,4,10,10a-tetrahydro-2H-phenanthrene-1-carboxylic acid from Poria cocos exhibited high binding affinity with orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) and type 2 (OX2R), surpassing commercial drugs used in insomnia treatment. Additionally, they showed interactions with critical amino acid residues within the receptors that play crucial roles in competitive inhibitor activity, like commercial drugs such as Suvorexant, Lemborexant, and Daridorexant. Further, molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-ligand complexes under conditions that mimic the in vivo environment revealed both compounds' sustained and robust interactions with the OX1R and OX2R, reinforcing their potential as effective therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, upon evaluating both compounds' drug-likeness, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiles, it was discerned that they displayed considerable drug-like properties and favorable pharmacokinetics, along with diminished toxicity. The research provides a solid foundation for further exploring and validating these compounds as potential anti-insomnia therapeutics.",

Dengue has harmed human health since its first known cases among Spanish soldiers in the Philippines to its 21st-century outbreaks in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas. In light of the current circumstances, it is imperative to investigate its origin and prevalence, enabling the implementation of effective interventions to curb the upsurge. Our study examines the history of dengue outbreaks, and evolving impact on public health, aiming to offer valuable insights for a more resilient public health response worldwide. In this comprehensive review, we incorporated data from renowned databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus to provide a thorough analysis of dengue outbreaks. Recent dengue outbreaks are associated with rapid urbanization, international travel, climatic change, and socioeconomic factors. Rapid urbanization and poor urban design and sanitation have created mosquito breeding places for dengue vectors. Also, international travel and trade have spread the pathogen. Climate change in the past two decades has favored mosquito habitats and outbreaks. Socioeconomic differences have also amplified the impact of dengue outbreaks on vulnerable communities. Dengue mitigation requires vector control, community engagement, healthcare strengthening, and international cooperation. Climate change adaptation and urban planning are crucial. Although problems remain, a comprehensive vector control and community involvement plan may reduce dengue epidemics and improve public health in our interconnected world.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is afflicted with periodic dengue outbreak every few years and one of the worst upsurges was recorded in 2019 during which there was an increasing trend of dengue with unusual symptoms which were not so common before. This study aims to describe the experience of three tertiary care centres of Dhaka regarding the clinical and laboratory, hospital outcome and management profile of the Expanded Dengue Syndrome (EDS) cases admitted from the 2019 outbreak. The current work was a cross-sectional observational study which took place from August 1 to December 31 2019 at three major tertiary care centres in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Out of total 2017 screened dengue cases, 49 met the inclusion criteria and 39 were enrolled after taking informed written consent. Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel and Graph pad prism 9.3.1. A probability value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of the 39 cases, majority were male (79.49%) with median (Â±IQR) age of 33(Â±9) years. Hypertension (4; 10.26%) was the most commonly associated co-morbidity. Among the systemic manifestations, most prevalent was hepatitis (38.49%) followed by encephalopathy (12.82%). Majority of the patients were suffering from primary infection (85%). Case fatality rate was 15.38%. Hepatitis and meningoencephalitis were the predominant cause of death. This study records the only known case report of Acute respiratory dress syndrome (ARDS) complicating dengue from Bangladesh. None of the patients from our cohort were managed by steroids. Only two (5.13%) out of 39 cases received antibiotics. In the year 2019, an unusual rise in EDS cases with about 15.4% fatalities were observed in this study. Hepatitis was the most common presentation and cause of death. Here, we report the first ARDS case encountered in Bangladesh. Despite the multifaceted presentation of EDS, indiscriminate use of antibiotics and steroid was minimal. Early recognition of multifarious features of EDS is important for choosing the targeted treatment option which can avert many deaths. The results of this study underline the necessity for more in-depth research into the risk factors that are contributing to mortality in EDS cases.",

As a priority activity towards the strengthening of vector control systems, it has been advocated that countries conduct a vector-control needs assessment. A review was carried out of the perceived needs for disease vector control programs among eleven countries and subnational states in South Asia and the Middle East. In each country or state, independent teams conducted vector control needs assessment with engagement of stakeholders. Important weaknesses were described for malaria, dengue and leishmaniases regarding vector surveillance, insecticide susceptibility testing, monitoring and evaluation of operations, entomological capacity and laboratory infrastructure. In addition, community mobilization and intersectoral collaboration showed important gaps. Countries and states expressed concern about insecticide resistance that could reduce the continued effectiveness of interventions, which demands improved monitoring. Moreover, attainment of disease elimination necessitates enhanced vector surveillance. Vector control needs assessment provided a useful planning tool for systematic strengthening of vector control systems. A limitation in conducting the vector control needs assessment was that it is time- and resource-intensive. To increase the feasibility and utility of national assessments, an abridged version of the guidance should focus on operationally relevant topics of the assessment.

We investigated the socioeconomic, clinical, and laboratory aspects of patients diagnosed with dengue during this outbreak. This observational study was conducted from July to September 2023 at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Chittagong Medical College Hospital, and included 450 confirmed cases of dengue. Sociodemographic information was collected via face-to-face interviews, clinical examinations, and laboratory testing, which was done within 24 hours of admission. Dengue severity was classified according to the 2009 WHO dengue guidelines. Notably, 17% of patients experienced severe dengue, and 89% of those with nonsevere cases exhibited at least one warning sign. Most patients were young adults (mean age, 33 years), with a nearly equal male-to-female ratio. Common clinical presentations included fever (95%), myalgia (62%), and headache (58%), whereas warning signs such as vomiting (54%) and abdominal pain (39%) were prevalent. Plasma leakage indicators, including ascites, pleural effusion, and edema, were found predominantly in severe cases. Laboratory findings revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in nearly half the patients. An elevated hematocrit level was associated with severe dengue. We report that a substantial number of patients developed severe dengue during the epidemic in 2023, and provide detailed clinical-epidemiological profiles of the patients, offering valuable insight into management of dengue cases.",

        "abstract": "Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56â604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2Â·5th and 97Â·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94Â·0 deaths (95% UI 89Â·2-100Â·0) per 100â000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271Â·0 deaths [250Â·1-290Â·7] per 100â000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195Â·4 deaths [182Â·1-211Â·4] per 100â000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48Â·1 deaths [47Â·4-48Â·8] per 100â000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23Â·2 deaths [16Â·3-37Â·2] per 100â000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1Â·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8Â·3 years (6Â·7-9Â·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0Â·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3Â·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

        "abstract": "Dengue is a major public health concern in Bangladesh. This study aimed to assess the perceptions and practices of community members in Dhaka regarding community engagement and social participation for dengue prevention. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Dhaka City from May 2022 to December 2022. The respondents were randomly selected. The association between community participation and prevention practices was tested using the <i>Ï</i> <sup>2</sup> test. The findings of this study indicate that the majority of participants (92%) believed that community effort would be relied upon in the event of a dengue outbreak. Environmental cleaning campaigns were the preferred approach, and religious leaders viewed them positively. This study also revealed significant variations in knowledge levels, with those involved in community efforts and mass gatherings demonstrating greater knowledge. This study sheds light on the demographic factors that influence dengue knowledge and provides valuable insights into the development of targeted public health interventions. The study revealed negative perceptions and limited participation in dengue prevention among participants, with the majority demonstrating a poor understanding of preventive measures. While some showed positive attitudes towards community engagement, significant disparities existed in participation, highlighting the need for targeted educational campaigns and enhanced community mobilization efforts. Moreover, the importance of multisectoral collaboration is emphasized, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts among health departments, NGOs, religious institutions, and community leaders to effectively combat dengue transmission. Recommendations include ongoing educational initiatives, targeted interventions to promote community involvement, and fostering collaboration across sectors to strengthen dengue prevention efforts and to safeguard public health.",

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness in Cambodia and Bangladesh of a putative, as-yet-undeveloped LF-RDT capable of diagnosing enteric fever and dengue, as well as measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) to guide antibiotic prescription, in primary care patients with acute NMFI. A country-specific decision tree model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a health system plus limited societal perspective considering the cost of antimicrobial resistance. Parameters were based on data from a large observational study on the regional epidemiology of acute febrile illness, published studies, and procurement price lists. Costs were expressed in US$ (value in 2022), and cost-effectiveness evaluated by comparing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with conservative opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay thresholds and the more widely used threshold of per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Compared to standard of care, LF-RDT-augmented clinical assessment was dominant in Cambodia, being more effective and cost-saving. The cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in Bangladesh was US$482, slightly above the conservative opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay threshold of US$388 and considerably lower than the GDP-based threshold of US$2687. The intervention remained dominant in Cambodia and well below the GDP-based threshold in Bangladesh when antimicrobial resistance costs were disregarded. These findings provide guidance for academic, industry, and policymaker stakeholders involved in acute NMFI diagnostics. While definitive conclusions cannot be made in the absence of established thresholds, our results suggest that similar results are highly likely in some target settings and possible in others.

This virus has two distinct life cycles, one in the human and another in the mosquito, and both cycles are crucial to be controlled. To control the vector of DENV, the mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, scientists employed many techniques, which were later proved ineffective and harmful in many ways. Consequently, the attention shifted to the development of a vaccine; researchers have targeted the E protein, a surface protein of the virus and the NS1 protein, an extracellular protein. There are several types of vaccines developed so far, such as live attenuated vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, viral vectored vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines. Along with these, scientists are exploring new strategies of developing improved version of the vaccine by employing recombinant DNA plasmid against NS1 and also aiming to prevent the infection by blocking the DENV life cycle inside the mosquitoes. Here, we discussed the aspects of research in the field of vaccines until now and identified some prospects for future vaccine developments.",

        "abstract": "To assess the spectrum of hepatic involvement in children with dengue fever (DF) and prediction of severity of dengue infection by early detection of elevated liver enzymes. This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from June 2019 to September 2019. Children admitted with DF were included. Severity of DF was graded as dengue without warning sign (DNWS), with warning sign (DWS), and severe dengue fever (SDF) according to WHO criteria. Liver injury (LI) was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than upper limit of normal irrespective of sex. Of 190 children (male, 109) with DF, 60 had DNWS, 49 had DWS, and 81 had SDF. A total of 100 children (52.6%) had LI. The distribution of hepatic involvement spectrum involves hepatomegaly (26.3%), hepatic tenderness (25.2%), features of acute liver failure (1.5%), raised level of ALT (52.6%), raised level of aspartateaminotransferase (AST) (65.8%), prolonged prothrombin time (7.3%), and reduced level of serum albumin (44.7%) in children.

        "abstract": "Estimates of demographic metrics are crucial to assess levels and trends of population health outcomes. The profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations worldwide has underscored the need for timely estimates to understand this unprecedented event within the context of long-term population health trends. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides new demographic estimates for 204 countries and territories and 811 additional subnational locations from 1950 to 2021, with a particular emphasis on changes in mortality and life expectancy that occurred during the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic period. 22â223 data sources from vital registration, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources were used to estimate mortality, with a subset of these sources used exclusively to estimate excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2026 data sources were used for population estimation. Additional sources were used to estimate migration; the effects of the HIV epidemic; and demographic discontinuities due to conflicts, famines, natural disasters, and pandemics, which are used as inputs for estimating mortality and population. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate under-5 mortality rates, which synthesised 30â763 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 1365 surveys and censuses, and 80 other sources. ST-GPR was also used to estimate adult mortality (between ages 15 and 59 years) based on information from 31â642 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 355 surveys and censuses, and 24 other sources. Estimates of child and adult mortality rates were then used to generate life tables with a relational model life table system. For countries with large HIV epidemics, life tables were adjusted using independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated via an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, and other data sources. Excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 was determined by subtracting observed all-cause mortality (adjusted for late registration and mortality anomalies) from the mortality expected in the absence of the pandemic. Expected mortality was calculated based on historical trends using an ensemble of models. In location-years where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, we estimated excess mortality rates using a regression model with covariates pertaining to the pandemic. Population size was computed using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model. Life expectancy was calculated using age-specific mortality rates and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. Global all-cause mortality followed two distinct patterns over the study period: age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1950 and 2019 (a 62Â·8% [95% UI 60Â·5-65Â·1] decline), and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-21; 5Â·1% [0Â·9-9Â·6] increase). In contrast with the overall reverse in mortality trends during the pandemic period, child mortality continued to decline, with 4Â·66 million (3Â·98-5Â·50) global deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2021 compared with 5Â·21 million (4Â·50-6Â·01) in 2019. An estimated 131 million (126-137) people died globally from all causes in 2020 and 2021 combined, of which 15Â·9 million (14Â·7-17Â·2) were due to the COVID-19 pandemic (measured by excess mortality, which includes deaths directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those indirectly due to other social, economic, or behavioural changes associated with the pandemic). Excess mortality rates exceeded 150 deaths per 100â000 population during at least one year of the pandemic in 80 countries and territories, whereas 20 nations had a negative excess mortality rate in 2020 or 2021, indicating that all-cause mortality in these countries was lower during the pandemic than expected based on historical trends. Between 1950 and 2021, global life expectancy at birth increased by 22Â·7 years (20Â·8-24Â·8), from 49Â·0 years (46Â·7-51Â·3) to 71Â·7 years (70Â·9-72Â·5). Global life expectancy at birth declined by 1Â·6 years (1Â·0-2Â·2) between 2019 and 2021, reversing historical trends. An increase in life expectancy was only observed in 32 (15Â·7%) of 204 countries and territories between 2019 and 2021. The global population reached 7Â·89 billion (7Â·67-8Â·13) people in 2021, by which time 56 of 204 countries and territories had peaked and subsequently populations have declined. The largest proportion of population growth between 2020 and 2021 was in sub-Saharan Africa (39Â·5% [28Â·4-52Â·7]) and south Asia (26Â·3% [9Â·0-44Â·7]). From 2000 to 2021, the ratio of the population aged 65 years and older to the population aged younger than 15 years increased in 188 (92Â·2%) of 204 nations. Global adult mortality rates markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, reversing past decreasing trends, while child mortality rates continued to decline, albeit more slowly than in earlier years. Although COVID-19 had a substantial impact on many demographic indicators during the first 2 years of the pandemic, overall global health progress over the 72 years evaluated has been profound, with considerable improvements in mortality and life expectancy. Additionally, we observed a deceleration of global population growth since 2017, despite steady or increasing growth in lower-income countries, combined with a continued global shift of population age structures towards older ages. These demographic changes will likely present future challenges to health systems, economies, and societies. The comprehensive demographic estimates reported here will enable researchers, policy makers, health practitioners, and other key stakeholders to better understand and address the profound changes that have occurred in the global health landscape following the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and longer-term trends beyond the pandemic.

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed unprecedented suffering on social and individual levels worldwide. Vaccines against COVID-19 have been prioritized as a crucial strategy for ending the pandemic as well as minimizing its consequences. This study aimed to determine the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among high-risk urban populations in Southern Thailand using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study in the Hat Yai district, Songkhla province in Southern Thailand, in September and October 2021. The questionnaire was composed of sections on sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, and COM-B constructs. We employed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. We set statistical significance at p < 0.05. In this study, females constituted 54.7% of the total participants (n = 358), and nearly half of the participants (45.8%) were in the younger age group (18-29). Of all the participants, 59.5% (95%CI: 54.2%-64.6%) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine and their adjusted OR (95% CI) were being married: 3.59 (2.06-6.24), having a graduate degree: 2.34 (1.38-3.96), gainfully employed: 3.30 (1.91-5.67), having a high level of opportunity: 2.90 (1.48-5.66), and having a high level of motivation: 2.87 (1.17-17.08). The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines was moderate in this population. Moreover, the results showed that the COM-B model is useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The findings of this study could be used to aid future public health interventions in any event of outbreaks similar to COVID-19 disease in Thailand and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Currently, there is no antiviral medication for dengue, a potentially fatal tropical infectious illness spread by two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The RdRp protease of dengue virus is a potential therapeutic target. This study focused on the in silico drug discovery of RdRp protease inhibitors. To assess the potential inhibitory activity of 29 phenolic acids from Theobroma cacao L. against DENV3-NS5 RdRp, a range of computational methods were employed. These included docking, drug-likeness analysis, ADMET prediction, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The aim of these studies was to confirm the stability of the ligand-protein complex and the binding pose identified during the docking experiment. Twenty-one compounds were found to have possible inhibitory activities against DENV according to the docking data, and they had a binding affinity of â¥-37.417 kcal/mol for DENV3- enzyme as compared to the reference compound panduratin A. Additionally, the drug-likeness investigation produced four hit compounds that were subjected to ADMET screening to obtain the lead compound, catechin. Based on ELUMO, EHOMO, and band energy gap, the DFT calculations showed strong electronegetivity, favouravle global softness and chemical reactivity with considerable intra-molecular charge transfer between electron-donor to electron-acceptor groups for catechin. The MD simulation result also demonstrated favourable RMSD, RMSF, SASA and H-bonds in at the binding pocket of DENV3-NS5 RdRp for catechin as compared to panduratin A. According to the present findings, catechin showed high binding affinity and sufficient drug-like properties with the appropriate ADMET profiles. Moreover, DFT and MD studies further supported the drug-like action of catechin as a potential therapeutic candidate. Therefore, further in vitro and in vivo research on cocoa and its phytochemical catechin should be taken into consideration to develop as a potential DENV inhibitor.",

This study elucidated the interactions between proline-enriched motifs and Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. The SH3 domain is pivotal in mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly by recognizing and binding to proline-rich regions in partner proteins. Through a computational pipeline, we analyzed the interactions and binding modes of proline-enriched motifs with SH3 domains, identified new potential DENV-2 interactions with the SH3 domain, and revealed potential hot spot residues, underscoring their significance in the viral life cycle. This comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights into the molecular basis of DENV-2 infection, highlighting conserved and serotype-specific interactions. The identified hot spot residues offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention, laying the foundation for developing antiviral strategies against Dengue virus infection.

A 2-tailed <i>t</i> test was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted. We found about 277 801 cases and 1393 deaths from the 2023 dengue outbreak. About 52% of the cases were from outside of Dhaka. The male:female ratio was about 3:2. The highest frequency of cases was found among people aged 19-29 years (28.7%, 79 673 of 277 801; <i>P</i> = .001). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.5%. The highest CFR was found among children aged 0-10 years (12%). Fever (99%) was the most prevalent, followed by joint pain (86%).

This study examines youth perceived dengue risk, and preventive practices, providing valuable insights into their behavior regarding this mosquito-borne disease. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in various regions of the Dhaka district in Bangladesh. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1,358 participants using convenience sampling, spanning the period from September 2 to October 10, 2023. A semi-structured questionnaire covered informed consent, socio-demographic data, and questions about perceived dengue risk scale (12 items), and prevention practice (13 items). Participants' mean age was 22.02âÂ±â1.58Â years. The average scores for perceived dengue risk, and prevention practices were found to be 51.39âÂ±â12.01 (out of 96), and 55.57âÂ±â14.55 (out of 104) respectively. Previous dengue history, history of other vector-borne diseases, gender, educational level, father's educational qualification, employment status, adequate sleep duration, father's occupation, etc. are factors associated with higher risk and prevention practices regarding dengue. The research underscores the importance of tailoring prevention strategies for different demographics, raising awareness, and promoting active engagement in preventive measures.

Febrile participants underwent blood tests for chikungunya, dengue, and ABO groups and rhesus (Rh) factors. Blood grouping information was gathered from healthy donors. Males and those aged between 18 and 49 years had a higher risk of contracting dengue and chikungunya. Blood group O exhibited the highest infection rates at â¼50%, whereas group AB had the lowest at â¼9% among the participants in the study. Yet, when considering the general population's blood group distribution, the combined odds of infection were 2.0, 3.5, and 1.4 times higher in groups B, O, and AB, respectively, than in group A. Infection rates were greater in Rh-negative people. Blood groups B, O, and AB showed higher susceptibility than blood group A according to adjusted odds ratios. Blood groups ABO and Rh factor hold significance in disease susceptibility and vaccine effectiveness. Keeping these implications in mind, further investigations are necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying these connections and their effects on the efficacy of dengue and chikungunya vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Severe morbidity and mortality due to seasonal infectious diseases are common global public health issues. Vector-borne viral illnesses like dengue and chikungunya overload the healthcare systems leading to critical financial burden to manage them. There is no effective drug or vaccine currently available to control these two diseases. The review was formulated by incorporating relevant reports on chikungunya and dengue in the Americas regions through a comprehensive search of literature that were available on dedicated scientific publication portals such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. The strategies of public health administrations to control largely the mosquito vectors during tropical monsoon seem to be effective. Yet, it seems practically impossible to completely eliminate them. The mosquito vector disseminates the virus via transovarian route thereby internalising the virus through generations, a reason behind reappearing and recurring outbreaks. The numerous factors associated with industrialisation, urbanisation, population density, and easy transboundary movements appear to have contributed to the spread of vectors from an endemic region to elsewhere. The article made a state-of-affair comprehensive analysis of the rising dengue and chikungunya cases in the tropics, particularly the tropical Americas, as a human health concern, the countermeasures undertaken and the overall preparedness. The viral transmission is a hard situation to tackle as the vector survives in diverse temperature and ecology, is resistant to insecticides, and the unavailability of drugs. Better vector-control measures and improved understanding of the reemerging arboviral infections could offer an extended reaction time to counter outbreaks, and minimise associated morbidity/mortality.",

For the period 2000-2022, dengue cases and death data from Bangladesh's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's website, and meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department were analyzed. A Poisson regression model was performed to identify the impact of meteorological parameters on the monthly dengue cases. A forecast of dengue cases was performed using an autoregressive integrated moving average model. Over the past 23 yr, a total of 244,246 dengue cases were reported including 849 deaths (CFRâ=â0.35%). The mean annual number of dengue cases increased 8 times during the second decade, with 2,216 cases during 2000-2010 vs. 18,321 cases during 2011-2022. The mean annual number of deaths doubled (21 vs. 46), but the overall CFR has decreased by one-third (0.69% vs. 0.23%). Concurrently, the annual mean temperature increased by 0.49 Â°C, and rainfall decreased by 314 mm with altered precipitation seasonality. Monthly mean temperature (Incidence risk ratio [IRR]: 1.26), first-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.08), and second-lagged rainfall (IRR: 1.17) were significantly associated with monthly dengue cases.

Two sizes of whole bamboo were used to hold fences around gardens at Dhaka University, Bangladesh, and they were painted red and green. Mosquito larvae and pupae were collected from bamboo stumps between July and August, and vectors were identified up to the species level. The data were analyzed using the STATA/MP 14.2 version. We found 83.5% and 0.2% were Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, and the rest were Culex and Armigeres species. Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and both species-positive bamboo stumps were 46.9, 0.7, and 47.1 percent, respectively. 54.5% of bamboo stumps had at least one mosquito species. The average stump depth for Aedes positive stumps (mean =11.7 cm, SE = 0.5) was significantly (p <0.001) higher than the Aedes negative stumps (mean = 9.5 cm, SE = 0.4). 53.8% and 38.0% stumps were found Aedes positive on the ground and upper sides of fences, respectively, and found significant (p<0.01) differences between both sides. A zero-inflated negative binomial count model is significant at a 5% level of significance, Ï2(4) = 11.8, p = 0.019 (<0.05) for Ae. albopictus.

Although the disease has been prevalent around the globe over the centuries, recent outbreaks of dengue have devasted the healthcare delivery system of many countries. Being a global infection, dengue virus (DENV) is endemically present mainly in Latin America and Caribbean countries as well as countries in South Asia. The recent outbreak of DENV infection has indicated an exceptional outbreak of DENV in some countries in South Asia. There has been a serious endemic of DENV during 2019. After a heterogeneous pause, another severe outbreak of DENV was reported in some Asian countries in 2023. Among the Asian countries, Bangladesh has reported an acute upsurge of DENV infection in 2023 with record numbers of fatalities. However, this pattern of DENV has not been detected in neighbors of Bangladesh, such as India or other countries in Southeast Asia. This provides an emergent task of dissecting the present DENV infection in Bangladesh from different angles to get insights for future containment of the DENV infection, not only in Bangladesh but also in other DENV endemic areas or DENV-native areas.

Often to avoid these problems, these data are processed as monthly/yearly aggregate where the prevalent forecasting tools like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and TBATS often fail to provide satisfactory results. Artificial data synthesis methods have been proven to be a powerful tool for tackling these challenges. The paper aims to propose a novel algorithm named Stochastic Bayesian Downscaling (SBD) algorithm based on the Bayesian approach that can regenerate downscaled time series of varying time lengths from aggregated data, preserving most of the statistical characteristics and the aggregated sum of the original data. The paper presents two epidemiological time series case studies of Bangladesh (Dengue, Covid-19) to showcase the workflow of the algorithm. The case studies illustrate that the synthesized data agrees with the original data regarding its statistical properties, trend, seasonality, and residuals.

        "abstract": "Viruses are microscopic biological entities that can quickly invade and multiply in a living organism. Each year, over 36,000 people die and nearly 400 million are infected with the dengue virus (DENV). Despite dengue being an endemic disease, no targeted and effective antiviral peptide resource is available against the dengue species. Antiviral peptides (AVPs) have shown tremendous ability to fight against different viruses. Accelerating antiviral drug discovery is crucial, particularly for RNA viruses. DDX3X, a vital cell component, supports viral translation and interacts with TRPV4, regulating viral RNA metabolism and infectivity. Its diverse signaling pathway makes it a potential therapeutic target. Our study focuses on inhibiting viral RNA translation by blocking the activity of the target gene and the TRPV4-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> cation channel. Six major proteins from camel milk were first extracted and split with the enzyme pepsin. The antiviral properties were then analyzed using online bioinformatics programs, including AVPpred, Meta-iAVP, AMPfun, and ENNAVIA. The stability of the complex was assessed using MD simulation, MM/GBSA, and principal component analysis. Cytotoxicity evaluations were conducted using COPid and ToxinPred. The top ten AVPs, determined by optimal scores, were selected and saved for docking studies with the GalaxyPepDock tools. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the peptides had very short hydrogen bond distances (1.8 to 3.6Â Ã) near the active site of the target protein. Approximately 76% of the peptide residues were 5-11 amino acids long. Additionally, the identified peptide candidates exhibited desirable properties for potential therapeutic agents, including a net positive charge, moderate toxicity, hydrophilicity, and selectivity. In conclusion, this computational study provides promising insights for discovering peptide-based therapeutic agents against DENV.",

Despite the government's efforts, dengue outbreaks are on the upswing, and people's knowledge, belief, and preventive practices regarding the disease at the rural community level are unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the level of knowledge, belief and preventive practices regarding dengue and associated factors among community people from rural Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 401 people using a convenient sampling technique from three unions of Savar from August to September 2021. Participants' responses were collected through face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested structured questionnaire that included information related to socio-demographics, dengue-related knowledge, preventive practices, and the health belief model (HBM) constructs. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with the knowledge and preventive practices of dengue. Overall, participants (mean age = 33.47 Â± 12.96 years; age range = 18-75 years) correctly answered 66.15% of the knowledge questions regarding dengue. Higher education, travel to dengue-risk regions, and self-efficacy under the HBM construct were all shown to be strongly associated with dengue knowledge. Regarding HBM constructs, about 80% of the participants perceived dengue as dangerous, but less than half (41.4%) believed themselves susceptible to dengue. Considering perceived barriers, 73.07% of the participants believed their residential area was not suitable for Aedes mosquito breeding. Nearly all (93.52%) believed they always kept their surrounding area clean as part of self-efficacy. Moreover, on average participants engaged in 53.69% of all dengue preventive practices. Being older, female, having a higher education, being a service holder, having a good quality of house structure, and perceived susceptibility as well as self-efficacy under the HBM construct were all factors in participants' dengue prevention activities. Participants' dengue preventative practices were shown to be significantly influenced by their knowledge. The findings of this study found a moderate level of knowledge regarding dengue among the participants. Regarding dengue prevention, although participants scored highly in several indicators, the overall preventive practices were not satisfactory. This suggests that there is a pressing need for expanded education outreach aimed at increasing public awareness of dengue and encourage preventive practices within rural communities in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, a vector-borne disease, is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries including Bangladesh. The objective of this study is to estimate the societal cost of illness of dengue infections among the urban population in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A cost-of-illness study was conducted using a prevalence-based approach from a societal perspective. Costs attributable to dengue were estimated from a bottom-up strategy using the guideline proposed by the World Health Organization for estimating the economic burden of infectious diseases. A total of 302 hospitalized confirmed dengue patients were enrolled in this study. The average cost to society for a person with a dengue episode was US$ 479.02. This amount was ranged between US$ 341.67 and US$ 567.12 for those patients who were treated at public and private hospitals, respectively. The households out-of-pocket cost contributed to a larger portion of the total costs of illness (66%) while the cost burden was significantly higher for the poorest households than the richest quintile. Dengue disease imposes a substantial financial burden on households and society. Therefore, decision-makers should consider the treatment cost of dengue infections, particularly among the poor in the population while balancing the benefits of introducing potentially effective dengue preventive programs in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is widely recognized as one of the dengue prone nations, and empirical evidence has consistently demonstrated an upward trend in the severity of the disease over time. With the persistent occurrence of dengue in Bangladesh and the ongoing presence of COVID-19, which has not been fully eradicated and may persist for an uncertain period of time, there is a high probability of co-infection between these 2 illnesses. Given the circumstances, the concurrent occurrence of the COVID-19 and dengue epidemics, along with the potential co-infection, may pose an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems that are already grappling with challenges in meeting the existing demand. Due to a lack of awareness, an inadequate health infrastructure, and ineffective disease prevention initiatives, the country is now more susceptible to the threat posed by a co-infection that has been found to be associated with more severe outcomes, marked by significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this opinion piece is to explore the gravity of co-infection in Bangladesh, as well as the potential challenges to overcome and the preventative measures that need to be implemented to address the severity. This opinion piece proposes a set of modern preventative strategies that, when integrated with conventional methods, have the potential to mitigate disease severity, avert the occurrence of co-infection between COVID-19 and dengue, and halt the co-epidemics of COVID-19 and dengue.",

        "title": "The 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: the imperative for a health-centred response in a world facing irreversible harms.",
        "abstract": "The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown is an international research collaboration that independently monitors the evolving impacts of climate change on health, and the emerging health opportunities of climate action. In its eighth iteration, this 2023 report draws on the expertise of 114 scientists and health practitioners from 52 research institutions and UN agencies worldwide to provide its most comprehensive assessment yet. In 2022, the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown warned that peopleâs health is at the mercy of fossil fuels and stressed the transformative opportunity of jointly tackling the concurrent climate change, energy, cost-of-living, and health crises for human health and wellbeing. This yearâs report finds few signs of such progress. At the current 10-year mean heating of 1Â·14Â°C above pre-industrial levels, climate change is increasingly impacting the health and survival of people worldwide, and projections show these risks could worsen steeply with further inaction. However, with health matters gaining prominence in climate change negotiations, this report highlights new opportunities to deliver health-promoting climate change action and a safe and thriving future for all. In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986â2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990â2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5). Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951â60 to 47% in 2013â22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981â2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3). Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010â14 and 2018â22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6Â·1% and 3Â·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3). The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impactsâboth a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change. The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the worldâs populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted each second, each moment of delay worsens the risks to peopleâs health and survival. In this yearâs report, new projections reveal the dangers of further delays in action, with every tracked health dimension worsening as the climate changes. If global mean temperature continues to rise to just under 2Â°C, annual heat-related deaths are projected to increase by 370% by midcentury, assuming no substantial progress on adaptation (indicator 1.1.5). Under such a scenario, heat-related labour loss is projected to increase by 50% (indicator 1.1.4), and heatwaves alone could lead to 524Â·9 million additional people experiencing moderate-to-severe food insecurity by 2041â60, aggravating the global risk of malnutrition. Life-threatening infectious diseases are also projected to spread further, with the length of coastline suitable for <i>Vibrio</i> pathogens expanding by 17â25%, and the transmission potential for dengue increasing by 36â37% by midcentury. As risks rise, so will the costs and challenges of adaptation. These estimates provide some indication of what the future could hold. However, poor accounting for non-linear responses, tipping points, and cascading and synergistic interactions could render these projections conservative, disproportionately increasing the threat to the health of populations worldwide. The health risks of a 2Â°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to peopleâs lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3Â°C of heating. The 2022 <i>Lancet</i> Countdown report highlighted the opportunity to accelerate the transition away from health-harming fossil fuels in response to the global energy crisis. However, data this year show a world that is often moving in the wrong direction. Energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions increased by 0Â·9% to a record 36Â·8 Gt in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1), and still only 9Â·5% of global electricity comes from modern renewables (mainly solar and wind energy), despite their costs falling below that of fossil fuels. Concerningly, driven partly by record profits, oil and gas companies are further reducing their compliance with the Paris Agreement: the strategies of the worldâs 20 largest oil and gas companies as of early 2023 will result in emissions surpassing levels consistent with the Paris Agreement goals by 173% in 2040âan increase of 61% from 2022 (indicator 4.2.6). Rather than pursuing accelerated development of renewable energy, fossil fuel companies allocated only 4% of their capital investment to renewables in 2022. Meanwhile, global fossil fuel investment increased by 10% in 2022, reaching over $1 trillion (indicator 4.2.1). The expansion of oil and gas extractive activities has been supported through both private and public financial flows. Across 2017â21, the 40 banks that lend most to the fossil fuel sector collectively invested $489 billion annually in fossil fuels (annual average), with 52% increasing their lending from 2010â16. Simultaneously, in 2020, 78% of the countries assessed, responsible for 93% of all global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, still provided net direct fossil fuels subsidies totalling $305 billion, further hindering fossil fuel phase-out (indicator 4.2.4). Without a rapid response to course correct, the persistent use and expansion of fossil fuels will ensure an increasingly inequitable future that threatens the lives of billions of people alive today. Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2Â·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7Â·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1Â·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM<sub>2Â·5</sub>; indicator 3.2.1), and a large proportion of the 78 deaths per 100 000 people associated with exposure to indoor air pollution (indicator 3.2.2). Additionally, the just development of renewable energy markets can generate net employment opportunities with safer, more locally available jobs. Ensuring countries, particularly those facing high levels of energy poverty, are supported in the safe development, deployment, and adoption of renewable energy is key to maximising health gains and preventing unjust extractive industrial practices that can harm the health and livelihoods of local populations and widen health inequities. With fossil fuels accounting for 95% of road transport energy (indicator 3.1.3), interventions to enable and promote safe active travel and zero-emission public transport can further deliver emissions reduction, promote health through physical activity, and avert many of the 460 000 deaths caused annually by transport-derived PM<sub>2Â·5</sub> pollution (indicator 3.2.1), and some of the 3Â·2 million annual deaths related to physical inactivity. People-centred, climate-resilient urban redesign to improve building energy efficiency, increase green and blue spaces, and promote sustainable cooling, can additionally prevent heat-related health harms, avoid air-conditioning-derived emissions (indicator 2.2.2), and provide direct physical and mental health benefits. Additionally, food systems are responsible for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 57% of agricultural emissions in 2020 being derived from the production of red meat and milk (indicator 3.3.1). Promoting and enabling equitable access to affordable, healthy, low-carbon diets that meet local nutritional and cultural requirements can contribute to mitigation, while preventing many of the 12Â·2 million deaths attributable to suboptimal diets (indicator 3.3.2). The health community could play a central role in securing these benefits, by delivering public health interventions to reduce air pollution, enabling and supporting active travel and healthier diets, and promoting improvements in the environmental conditions and commercial activities that define health outcomes. Importantly, the health sector can lead by example and transition to sustainable, resource-efficient, net-zero emission health systems, thereby preventing its 4Â·6% contribution to global GHG emissions, with cascading impacts ultimately affecting the broader economy (indicator 3.4). Some encouraging signs of progress offer a glimpse of the enormous human benefits that health-centred action could render. Deaths attributable to fossil-fuel-derived air pollution have decreased by 15Â·7% since 2005, with 80% of this reduction being the result of reduced coal-derived pollution. Meanwhile the renewable energy sector expanded to a historical high of 12Â·7 million employees in 2021 (indicator 4.2.2); and renewable energy accounted for 90% of the growth in electricity capacity in 2022 (indicator 3.1.1). Supporting this, global clean energy investment increased by 15% in 2022, to $1Â·6 trillion, exceeding fossil fuel investment by 61% (indicator 4.2.1); and lending to the green energy sector rose to $498 billion in 2021, approaching fossil fuel lending (indicator 4.2.7). Scientific understanding of the links between health and climate change is rapidly growing, and although coverage lags in some of the most affected regions, over 3000 scientific articles covered this topic in 2022 (indicators 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). Meanwhile, the health dimensions of climate change are increasingly acknowledged in the public discourse, with 24% of all climate change newspaper articles in 2022 referring to health, just short of the 26% in 2020 (indicator 5.1). Importantly, international organisations are increasingly engaging with the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation (indicator 5.4.2), and governments increasingly acknowledge this link, with 95% of updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement now referring to healthâup from 73% in 2020 (indicator 5.4.1). These trends signal what could be the start of a life-saving transition. With the world currently heading towards 3Â°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermineârather than protectâthe future of people alive today and generations to come. Safeguarding peopleâs health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all.",

        "abstract": "Introduction The overlap in clinical presentation between COVID-19 and dengue poses challenges for diagnosis in co-endemic regions. Furthermore, there have been reports of antibody cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue. Our research aims to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antigens for serological testing while reducing the possibility of cross-reactivity with anti-dengue antibodies. Method Two hundred and ten serum samples were collected from 179 patients and divided into four panels. Panels 1 and 2 consisted of COVID-19-negative healthy donors (n=81) and pre-pandemic dengue patients (n=50), respectively. Alternatively, Panel 3 (n=19) was composed of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-positive samples collected within two weeks of COVID-19 symptom onset, while Panel 4 (n=60) was composed of positive samples collected after two weeks of symptom onset. Previously developed and characterized in-house SARS-CoV-2 spike-1 (S1), receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (N) immunoglobin G (IgG)-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were used for the study. Results Six dengue-positive sera cross-reacted with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. However, only one dengue-positive sera cross-reacted with the S1 and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Co-immobilization of S1 and RBD in different ratios revealed an 80:20 (S1:RBD) ratio as optimal for achieving an overall 96.2% sensitivity with the least cross-reaction to anti-dengue antibodies. Conclusion Our findings indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-based immunoassays present more cross-reactivity with anti-dengue antibodies than S1 and N proteins. Furthermore, co-immobilization of S1 and RBD reduces the cross-reactivity with anti-dengue antibodies compared to RBD, thereby increasing the immunoassay specificity without affecting overall sensitivity for the dengue-endemic areas.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh faces distinct challenges as a resource-poor country due to the combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneous dengue outbreaks. Older adults are particularly vulnerable to infection and death from COVID-19. While overall health and life expectancy in the general population have improved substantially in Bangladesh, health services for older adults are still lacking. No specialized geriatric units have been established in hospitals, and no home care programs have been established for older adults. COVID-19 mortality rates were highest among older adults ages 61 to 70 years (35%), and 71 to 80 years (20%) in 2022. Although the country's average COVID-19 mortality rate was low at 1.76%, in older adults, it was much higher (55%), accounting for 14,797 deaths, despite that most cases (55%) were recorded in young adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bangladesh also experienced a dengue epidemic. Around 21,193 dengue patients were admitted to hospitals between January 1 and October 8, 2022. Without a well-established and all-encompassing social care program, the indirect socioeconomic burden of COVID-19 continues to fall on older adults. There is an immediate need for robust healthcare and support services, especially for older adults in Bangladesh, which are particularly susceptible to the dual threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the dengue epidemic. Recommendations are made to protect older adults from the devastating effects of the 2 simultaneous epidemics.",

        "abstract": "Dengue ruins a major public health challenge causing death among many people in Bangladesh. The magnitude of dengue-related illness and death has significantly increased over recent years. The study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practices related to dengue fever. This cross-sectional type of descriptive study was conducted among a total of 250 respondents who consented to participate in this study. Respondents were included purposively from selected bushy Cumilla Cantonment area also classified as a stable dengue-prone region of Bangladesh from January 2023 to March 2023. The survey was carried out by face-to-face interviews using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. The results reveal that 81.2% of respondents were below 40 years of age group, 74.8% of respondents were married and 72.8% of respondents were in the below monthly 35000tk income group. Only 77.0% of respondents had good knowledge scores and 61.0% had positive attitudes and 75.0% had good compliance with practices. Knowledge was not significantly associated with type of residence, marital status, income group and age group (p>0.05 in every aspect). Transmission of dengue about more than two-thirds (84%) reported that the Aedes aegypti was a vector mosquito for dengue transmission and 27(10.8%) were aware of the biting time of the mosquito. Most participants (81.6%) strongly agreed that dengue is a serious illness and less than half (40.8%) reported that it could be prevented with vector control strategies. The majority (98.4%) used mosquito nets as a preventive measure, while over two-thirds (87.6%) reported that they discarded waste, containers and non-used bottles across their yards that hold water. Although the respondents had quite a positive attitude toward preventive measures regarding dengue (61.0%) and a sizeable number (39.0%) did not put proper attitude into practice. Poorly planned urbanization combined with an explosive urban population in the Cumilla Cantonment area has brought the mosquito and the human host into close proximity. The government should launch health education programs on dengue prevention to educate the community members, addressing misconceptions about their preventive measures and how they could eliminate the risk factors related to practices.",

        "abstract": "Morbidity and mortality from dengue virus (DENV) is rapidly growing in the large populations of south Asia. Few formal evaluations of candidate dengue vaccine candidates have been undertaken in India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. Tetravalent vaccines must be tested for safety and immunogenicity in all age groups and in those previously exposed and naive to DENV infections. TV005 is a live, attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of TV005 across age groups in dengue-endemic Bangladesh. We performed a randomised, placebo-controlled age de-escalating clinical trial of TV005 at a single clinical site in dengue-endemic Dhaka, Bangladesh, following a technology transfer from the USA. Healthy (as determined by history, clinical examination, and safety laboratory test results) volunteers aged 1-50 years were randomly assigned 3:1 (stratified by four age groups) to receive a single dose of TV005 vaccine or placebo. Participants were followed up for 3 years. The study was double blind and was unmasked at day 180; outcome assessors, clinic staff, and volunteers remained blind throughout. Primary outcomes were safety, evaluated per-protocol as proportion of volunteers with solicited related adverse events of any severity through 28 days post dosing, and post-vaccination seropositivity by day 180 using serotype-specific neutralising antibodies (PRNT<sub>50</sub> â¥10). Secondary outcomes included viremia, impact of past dengue exposure, and durability of antibody responses. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02678455, and is complete. Between March 13, 2016, and Feb 14, 2017, 192 volunteers were enrolled into four age groups (adults [18-50 years; 20 male and 28 female], adolescents [11-17 years; 27 male and 21 female], children [5-10 years; 15 male and 33 female], and young children [1-4 years; 29 male and 19 female]) with 48 participant per group. All participants were Bangladeshi. Vaccination was well tolerated and most adverse events were mild. Rash was the most common vaccine-associated solicited adverse event, in 37 (26%) of 144 vaccine recipients versus six (12%) of 48 placebo recipients; followed by fever in seven (5% of 144) and arthralgias in seven (6% of 108), which were only observed in vaccine recipients. Post-vaccine, volunteers of all ages (n=142) were seropositive to most serotypes with 118 (83%) seropositive to DENV 1, 141 (99%) to DENV 2, 137 (96%) to DENV 3, and 124 (87%) to DENV 4, overall by day 180. Post-vaccination, viraemia was not consistently found and antibody titres were higher (10-15-fold for DENV 1-3 and 1Â·6-fold for DENV 4) in individuals with past dengue exposure compared with the dengue-naive participants (DENV 1 mean 480 [SD 4Â·0] vs 32 [2Â·4], DENV 2 1042 [3Â·2] vs 105 [3Â·1], DENV 3 1406 [2Â·8] vs 129 [4Â·7], and DENV 4 105 [3Â·3] vs 65 [3Â·1], respectively). Antibody titres to all serotypes remained stable in most adults (63-86%) after 3 years of follow-up. However, as expected for individuals without past exposure to dengue, titres for DENV 1, 3, and 4 waned by 3 years in the youngest (1-4 year old) cohort (69% seropositive for DENV 2 and 22-28% seropositive for DENV 1, 3, and 4). With 3 years of follow-up, the single-dose tetravalent dengue vaccine, TV005, was well tolerated and immunogenic for all four serotypes in young children to adults, including individuals with no previous dengue exposure.

However, there has been no FDA approved medication to treat dengue fever. Researchers are looking into DENV NS5 RdRp protease as a potential therapeutic target for discovering effective anti-dengue agents. The aim of this study to discover dengue virus inhibitor from a set of five compounds from <i>Momordica charantia</i> L. using a series of <i>in-silico</i> approaches. The compounds were docked into the active area of the DENV-2 NS5 RdRp protease to obtain the hit compounds. The successful compounds underwent additional testing for a study on drug-likeness similarity. Our study obtained Momordicoside-I as a lead compound which was further exposed to the Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) toxicity analysis to determine the toxicity based on docking scores and drug-likeness studies. Moreover, DFT studies were carried out to calculate the thermodynamic, molecular orbital and electrostatic potential properties for the lead compound. Moreover, the lead compound was next subjected to molecular dynamic simulation for 200âns in order to confirm the stability of the docked complex and the binding posture discovered during docking experiment. Overall, the lead compound has demonstrated good medication like qualities, non-toxicity, and significant binding affinity towards the DENV-2 RdRp enzyme.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

The chemical structures of the synthesized analogs were characterized by spectroscopic methods and physicochemical and elemental data analyses. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds against five human pathogenic bacteria and two phyto-fungi were evaluated in vitro and it was found that the acyl moiety-induced synthesized analogs exhibited varying levels of antibacterial activity against different bacteria, with compounds <b>3</b> and <b>6</b> exhibiting broad-spectrum activity and compounds <b>2</b> and <b>5</b> exhibiting activity against specific bacteria.

This comprehensive review aims to summarize the overall scenario of dengue, including disease burden, clinical spectrum, seroprevalence, circulating serotypes/genotypes, and spatial distribution since the first recorded outbreak in Bangladesh. Since the first recorded outbreak in 2000, dengue epidemiology has shown the typical epidemic pattern with more frequent and bigger outbreaks and gradual geographic expansion to non-endemic regions in Bangladesh. For instance, highly confined Rohingya refugee camps that provide shelters to nearly 1.2 million forcibly displaced vulnerable Myanmar nationals in Cox's Bazar district confronted a massive outbreak in 2022. Recent major outbreaks are found to be associated with the emergence of serotype DENV-3, which was undetected for a long time. Consequently, changes in serotypes might be attributed to increased severity in clinical manifestation in recent years. The existing weak surveillance and risk management systems are inadequate to deal with impending dengue risks. The healthcare system, particularly at the district level, is not prepared to manage impending large-scale dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh.

DESeq2 plot counts function of the top 24 genes with the smallest q-values of differential gene expression of RNA-seq data showed that 11 genes were upregulated, whereas 13 genes were downregulated. GO analysis showed a significant upregulation (pâ=â<â0.001) in a process of multicellular organismal, nervous system, sensory perception of chemical stimulus, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways in the dengue patients. However, there were a significant downregulation (pâ=â<â0.001) of intracellular component, cellular anatomical entity, and protein-containing complex in dengue patients. Most importantly, there was a significant increase of a class of immunoregulatory proteins in dengue patients in compared to the controls, with increased GO of immune system process. In addition, upregulation of toll receptor (TLR) signaling pathways were found in dengue patients. These TLR pathways were particularly involved for the activation of innate system coupled with adaptive immune system that probably involved the rapid elimination of dengue virus infected cells. These differentially expressed genes could be further investigated for target based prophylactic interventions for dengue. This is a first report describing DENV complete genomic features and differentially expressed genes in patients in Bangladesh. These genes may have diagnostic and therapeutic values for dengue infection. Continual genomic surveillance is required to further investigate the shift in dominant genotypes in relation to viral pathogenesis.

By using the next generation method, we derive the fundamental reproduction number $ R_0 $ and show the findings based on it. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium (EE) and the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is calculated using the Lyapunov function. For the proposed fractional model, numerical simulations and dynamical attitude are seen. Moreover, A sensitivity analysis of the model is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the transmission.",

Face-to-face interviews were performed to obtain data. Python with RStudio was used for data management and analysis. The multiple regression models were applied when applicable. <b>Results:</b> 50% of respondents were aware of the deadly effects of DF, its common symptoms, and its infectious nature. However, many were unaware that DF could be asymptomatic, a previously infected person could have DF again, and the virus could be passed to a fetus. Individuals agreed that their families, communities, and authorities should monitor and maintain their environment to prevent <i>Aedes</i> mosquito breeding. However, overall 60% of the study group had inadequate preventative measures. Many participants lacked necessary practices such as taking additional measures (cleaning and covering the water storage) and monitoring potential breeding places. Education and types of media for DF information were shown to promote DF prevention practices. <b>Conclusion:</b> Slum dwellers lack awareness and preventative activities that put them at risk for DF. Authorities must improve dengue surveillance. The findings suggest efficient knowledge distribution, community stimulation, and ongoing monitoring of preventative efforts to reduce DF. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to alter dwellers' behavior since DF control can be done by raising the population's level of life. People and communities must perform competently to eliminate vector breeding sites.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infections have unpredictable clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic or minor febrile illness to severe and fatal disease. The severity of dengue infection is at least partly related to the replacement of circulating DENV serotypes and/or genotypes. To describe clinical profiles of patients and the viral sequence diversity corresponding to non-severe and severe cases, we collected patient samples from 2018 to 2022 at Evercare Hospital Dhaka, Bangladesh. Serotyping of 495 cases and sequencing of 179 cases showed that the dominant serotype of DENV shifted from DENV2 in 2017 and 2018 to DENV3 in 2019. DENV3 persisted as the only representative serotype until 2022. Co-circulation of clades B and C of the DENV2 cosmopolitan genotype in 2017 was replaced by circulation of clade C alone in 2018 with all clones disappearing thereafter. DENV3 genotype I was first detected in 2017 and was the only genotype in circulation until 2022. We observed a high incidence of severe cases in 2019 when the DENV3 genotype I became the only virus in circulation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clusters of severe cases in several different subclades of DENV3 genotype I. Thus, these serotype and genotype changes in DENV may explain the large dengue outbreaks and increased severity of the disease in 2019.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, particularly in Dhaka city, dengue fever is a major factor in serious sickness and hospitalization. The weather influences the temporal and geographical spread of the vector-borne disease dengue in Dhaka. As a result, rainfall and ambient temperature are considered macro factors influencing dengue since they have a direct impact on Aedes aegypti population density, which changes seasonally dependent on these critical variables. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between climatic variables and the incidence of dengue disease. A total of 2253 dengue and climate data were used for this study. Maximum and minimum temperature (Â°C), humidity (grams of water vapor per kilogram of air g.kg<sup>-1</sup>), rainfall (mm), sunshine hour (in (average) hours per day), and wind speed (knots (kt)) in Dhaka were considered as the independent variables for this study which trigger the dengue incidence in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Descriptive and correlation analyses were performed for each variable and stationary tests were observed using Dicky Fuller test. However, initially, the Poisson model, zero-inflated regression model, and negative binomial model were fitted for this problem. Finally, the negative binomial model is considered the final model for this study based on minimum AIC values. The mean of maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, sunshine hour, and rainfall showed some fluctuations over the years. However, a mean number of dengue cases reported a higher incidence in recent years. Maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, and wind speed were positively correlated with dengue cases. However, rainfall and sunshine hours were negatively associated with dengue cases. The findings showed that factors such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, and windspeed are crucial in the transmission cycles of dengue disease. On the other hand, dengue cases decreased with higher levels of rainfall. The findings of this study will be helpful for policymakers to develop a climate-based warning system in Bangladesh.",

This study explored the possibility of natural extract (alcoholic) from peppermint leaves, stems, and garlic cloves to use as a mosquito-repellent finish material on knit fabric. Accordingly, different concentration (5%, 15%, 25%, and 35%) of PGE (Peppermint Garlic Extract) solution was prepared and applied to the developed fabric using an exhaust dyeing process to assess the mosquito (Aedes Aegypti L.) repellency performance. Following WHO (World Health Organization) standard (cone bioassay) and a self-modified cage technique from literature survey, mosquito protection and repellency tests have been performed for characterization. The findings revealed that the PGE-treated fabric samples C (25% PGE) and D (35% PGE) had the highest mosquito mortality (50.00% and 76.67%, respectively) and repellency (78.6% and 85.6%, respectively) rates. Moreover, this study evaluated the prepared PGE formulations' shelf-life performance and colorfastness properties of PGE-treated fabrics, including the impact of washing cycles on the treated fabrics.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh reported the highest number of annual deaths (n = 281) related to dengue virus infection in 2022 since the virus reappeared in the country in 2000. Earlier studies showed that >92% of the annual cases occurred between the months of August and September. The 2022 outbreak is characterized by late onset of dengue cases with unusually higher deaths in colder months, that is, October-December. Here we present possible hypotheses and explanations for this late resurgence of dengue cases. First, in 2022, the rainfall started late in the season. Compared to the monthly average rainfall for September and October between 2003 and 2021, there was 137 mm of additional monthly rainfall recorded in September and October 2022. Furthermore, the year 2022 was relatively warmer with a 0.71Â°C increased temperature than the mean annual temperature of the past 20 yr. Second, a new dengue virus serotype, DENV-4, had recently reintroduced/reappeared in 2022 and become the dominant serotype in the country for a large naÃ¯ve population. Third, the post-pandemic return of normalcy after 2 yr of nonpharmaceutical social measures facilitates extra mosquito breeding habitats, especially in construction sites. Community engagement and regular monitoring and destruction of Aedes mosquitoes' habitats should be prioritized to control dengue virus outbreaks in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "An unprecedent increase in the number of cases and deaths reported from dengue virus (DENV) infection has occurred in the southwestern Indian ocean in recent years. From 2017 to mid-2021 more than 70,000 confirmed dengue cases were reported in Reunion Island, and 1967 cases were recorded in the Seychelles from 2015 to 2016. Both these outbreaks displayed similar trends, with the initial circulation of DENV-2 which was replaced by DENV-1. Here, we aim to determine the origin of the DENV-1 epidemic strains and to explore their genetic characteristics along the uninterrupted circulation, particularly in Reunion. Nucleic acids were extracted from blood samples collected from dengue positive patients; DENV-1 was identified by RT-qPCR. Positive samples were used to infect VERO cells. Genome sequences were obtained from either blood samples or infected-cell supernatants through a combination of both Illumina or MinION technologies. Phylogenetic analyses of partial or whole genome sequences revealed that all DENV-1 sequences from Reunion formed a monophyletic cluster that belonged to genotype I and were closely related to one isolate from Sri Lanka (OL752439.1, 2020). Sequences from the Seychelles belonged to the same major phylogenetic branch of genotype V, but fell into two paraphyletic clusters, with greatest similarity for one cluster to 2016-2017 isolate from Bangladesh, Singapore and China, and for the other cluster to ancestral isolates from Singapore, dating back to 2012. Compared to publicly available DENV-1 genotype I sequences, fifteen non-synonymous mutations were identified in the Reunion strains, including one in the capsid and the others in nonstructural proteins (NS) (three in NS1, two in NS2B, one in NS3, one in NS4B, and seven in NS5). In contrast to what was seen in previous outbreaks, recent DENV-1 outbreaks in Reunion and the Seychelles were caused by distinct genotypes, all likely originating from Asia where dengue is (hyper)endemic in many countries. Epidemic DENV-1 strains from Reunion harbored specific non-synonymous mutations whose biological significance needs to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "The dengue virus is widespread throughout Bangladesh and significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality. One effective method for preventing further dengue epidemics is to reduce mosquito breeding at the most opportune period each year. This study aims to determine dengue prevalence in 2022 by comparing previous years' data and estimating the period of this disease's most significant incidence. From the beginning of 2008-December 15, 2022, we looked at the monthly reports of cases made to the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research. According to our findings, there were 61089 confirmed dengue cases in 2022, with 269 fatalities - the highest annual death toll for this disease since 2000. Almost one-third (32.14%) of all dengue deaths in Bangladesh occurred in 2022 (1 January-15 December), highlighting the severity of the threat posed by this disease in the coming year. Furthermore, we observe that the months in the second half of any year in Bangladesh are the most at risk for dengue transmission. In 2022, Dhaka city and Chittagong are hit the hardest (incidence: 63.07% vs. 14.42%; morality: 63.34% vs. 24.16%), showing the relevance of population density in spreading this fatal disease. Statistics show an increase in dengue cases every day, and the year 2022 will be marked as the peak of the disease's death prevalence.

The present study aimed to investigate the clinical and hematological manifestations of pediatric dengue cases during the epidemic. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Dr. Sirajul Islam Medical College Hospital and Tangail Sadar Hospital, Tangail, Bangladesh between the period of June 2019 and September 2019. The study included 208 pediatric patients (age <18 years) with confirmed dengue fever. Patient's demographics, clinical and laboratory features of dengue were collected through patients' interview, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Descriptive statistics were used to represent the patients' socio-demographic information, clinical presentations and hematological parameters. The majority of the patients were aged between 6 and 17 years with male predominance. The most commonly presented clinical manifestations were fever (100.0%), headache (59.0%), myalgia (42.0%), rash (36.0%), retro-orbital pain (28.0%) and diarrhea (24.0%). Warning signs abdominal pain (40.0%) and persistent vomiting (29.0%), bleeding manifestations such as melena (17.0%), gum bleeding (7.0%) and epistaxis (6.0%) and evidence of plasma leakage such as oliguria (3.4%), ascites (2.4%), pleural effusion (1.4%), and shock (1.0%) were also present in the patients. Raised HCT levels, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were present in almost 23.0%, 43.0% and 28.0% of children, respectively.

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus, a member of the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family (which causes Dengue fever), and an arthropod-transmitted human viral infection. Bangladesh is well known for having some of Asia's most vulnerable Dengue outbreaks, with climate change, its location, and it's dense population serving as the main contributors. For speculation about DENV outbreak characteristics, it is crucial to determine how meteorological factors correlate with the number of cases. This study used five time series models to observe the trend and forecast Dengue cases. Current data-based research has also applied four statistical models to test the relationship between Dengue-positive cases and meteorological parameters. Datasets were used from NASA for meteorological parameters, and daily DENV cases were obtained from the Directorate General of Health Service (DGHS) open-access websites. During the study period, the mean of DENV cases was 882.26 Â± 3993.18, ranging between a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 52,636 daily confirmed cases. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between climatic variables and Dengue incidence indicated that no substantial relationship exists between daily Dengue cases and wind speed, temperature, and surface pressure (Spearman's rho; r = -0.007, <i>p</i> > 0.05; r = 0.085, <i>p</i> > 0.05; and r = -0.086, <i>p</i> > 0.05, respectively). Still, a significant relationship exists between daily Dengue cases and dew point, relative humidity, and rainfall (r = 0.158, <i>p</i> < 0.05; r = 0.175, <i>p</i> < 0.05; and r = 0.138, <i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively). Using the ARIMAX and GA models, the relationship for Dengue cases with wind speed is -666.50 [95% CI: -1711.86 to 378.86] and -953.05 [-2403.46 to 497.36], respectively. A similar negative relation between Dengue cases and wind speed was also determined in the GLM model (IRR = 0.98). Dew point and surface pressure also represented a negative correlation in both ARIMAX and GA models, respectively, but the GLM model showed a positive association. Additionally, temperature and relative humidity showed a positive correlation with Dengue cases (105.71 and 57.39, respectively, in the ARIMAX, 633.86, and 200.03 in the GA model). In contrast, both temperature and relative humidity showed negative relation with Dengue cases in the GLM model. In the Poisson regression model, windspeed has a substantial significant negative connection with Dengue cases in all seasons. Temperature and rainfall are significantly and positively associated with Dengue cases in all seasons. The association between meteorological factors and recent outbreak data is the first study where we are aware of the use of maximum time series models in Bangladesh. Taking comprehensive measures against DENV outbreaks in the future can be possible through these findings, which can help fellow researchers and policymakers.",

        "abstract": "<i>Aedes albopictus</i> is native to Southeast Asia and has emerged as a major vector for vector-borne diseases that are spreading rapidly worldwide. Recent studies have shown that <i>Ae. albopictus</i> populations have different genetic groups dependent on their thermal adaptations; however, studies on Korean populations are limited. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and structure of two mitochondrial genes (<i>COI</i> and <i>ND5</i>) and sixteen microsatellites in mosquitoes inhabiting Korea, Japan, and Laos. The results indicate that the Korean population has low genetic diversity, with an independent cluster distinct from the Laos population. Mixed clusters have also been observed in the Korean population. On the basis of these findings, two hypotheses are proposed. First, certain Korean populations are native. Second, some subpopulations that descended from the metapopulation (East Asian countries) were introduced to Japan before migrating to Korea. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that <i>Ae. albopictus</i> appears to have been imported to Korea. In conclusion, the dengue-virus-carrying mosquitoes could migrate to Korea from Southeast Asian epidemic regions, where they can survive during the severe winter months. The key findings can be used to establish an integrated pest management strategy based on population genetics for the Korean <i>Ae. albopictus</i> population.",

A better understanding of the effects of climate variability before dengue season on the increasing incidence of dengue in Bangladesh can enable early warning of future outbreaks. We developed a generalized linear model to predict the number of annual dengue cases based on monthly minimum temperature, rainfall and sunshine prior to dengue season. Variable selection and leave-one-out cross-validation were performed to identify the best prediction model and to evaluate the model's performance. Our model successfully predicted the largest outbreak in 2018, with 10,077 cases (95% CI: [9,912-10,276]), in addition to smaller outbreaks in five different years (2003, 2006, 2010, 2012 and 2014) and successfully identified the increasing trend in cases between 2010 and 2018. We found that temperature was positively associated with the annual incidence during the late winter months (between January and March) but negatively associated during the early summer (between April and June). Our results might be suggest an optimal minimum temperature for mosquito growth of 21-23Â°C. This study has implications for understanding how climate variability has affected recent dengue expansion in neighbours of Bangladesh (such as northern India and Southeast Asia).",

        "title": "Insecticide resistance compromises the control of Aedes aegypti in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "With no effective drugs or widely available vaccines, dengue control in Bangladesh is dependent on targeting the primary vector Aedes aegypti with insecticides and larval source management. Despite these interventions, the dengue burden is increasing in Bangladesh, and the country experienced its worst outbreak in 2019 with 101â354 hospitalized cases. This may be partially facilitated by the presence of intense insecticide resistance in vector populations. Here, we describe the intensity and mechanisms of resistance to insecticides commonly deployed against Ae. aegypti in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Dhaka Ae. aegypti colonies exhibited high-intensity resistance to pyrethroids. Using CDC bottle assays, we recorded 2-24% mortality (recorded at 24âh) to permethrin and 48-94% mortality to deltamethrin, at 10Ã the diagnostic dose. Bioassays conducted using insecticide-synergist combinations suggested that metabolic mechanisms were contributing to pyrethroid resistance, specifically multi-function oxidases, esterases, and glutathione S-transferases. In addition, kdr alleles were detected, with a high frequency (78-98%) of homozygotes for the V1016G mutation. A large proportion (â¤â74%) of free-flying and resting mosquitoes from Dhaka colonies survived exposure to standard applications of pyrethroid aerosols in an experimental free-flight room. Although that exposure affected the immediate host-seeking behavior of Ae. aegypti, the effect was transient in surviving mosquitoes. The intense resistance characterized in this study is likely compromising the operational effectiveness of pyrethroids against Ae. aegypti in Dhaka. Switching to alternative chemical classes may offer a medium-term solution, but ultimately a more sustainable and effective approach to controlling dengue vectors is required. Â© 2023 The Authors.

        "abstract": "Establishing reliable early warning models for severe dengue cases is a high priority to facilitate triage in dengue-endemic areas and optimal use of limited resources. However, few studies have identified the complex interactive relationship between potential risk factors and severe dengue. This research aimed to assess the potential risk factors and detect their high-order combinative effects on severe dengue. A structured questionnaire was used to collect detailed dengue outbreak data from eight representative hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019. Logistic regression and machine learning models were used to examine the complex effects of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers on severe dengue. A total of 1,090 dengue cases (158 severe and 932 non-severe) were included in this study. Dyspnoea (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.72 to 4.77), plasma leakage (OR = 3.61, 95% CI: 2.12 to 6.15), and hemorrhage (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.46 to 3.73) were positively and significantly associated with the occurrence of severe dengue. Classification and regression tree models showed that the probability of occurrence of severe dengue cases ranged from 7% (age >12.5 years without plasma leakage) to 92.9% (age â¤12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage). The random forest model indicated that age was the most important factor in predicting severe dengue, followed by education, plasma leakage, platelet, and dyspnoea. The research provides new evidence to identify key risk factors contributing to severe dengue cases, which could be beneficial to clinical doctors to identify and predict the severity of dengue early.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a tropical viral disease mostly spread by the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito across the globe. Each year, millions of people have dengue fever, and many die as a result. Since 2002, the severity of dengue in Bangladesh has increased, and in 2019, it reached its worst level ever. This research used satellite imagery to determine the spatial relationship between urban environmental components (UEC) and dengue incidence in Dhaka in 2019. Land surface temperature (LST), urban heat-island (UHI), land-use-land-cover (LULC), population census, and dengue patient data were evaluated. On the other hand, the temporal association between dengue and 2019 UEC data for Dhaka city, such as precipitation, relative humidity, and temperature, were explored. The calculation indicates that the LST in the research region varies between 21.59 and 33.33 degrees Celsius. Multiple UHIs are present within the city, with LST values ranging from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. In 2019, these UHIs had a higher incidence of dengue. NDVI values between 0.18 and 1 indicate the presence of vegetation and plants, and the NDWI identifies waterbodies with values between 0 and 1. About 2.51%, 2.66%, 12.81%, and 82% of the city is comprised of water, bare ground, vegetation, and settlement, respectively. The kernel density estimate of dengue data reveals that the majority of dengue cases were concentrated in the city's north edge, south, north-west, and center. The dengue risk map was created by combining all of these spatial outputs (LST, UHI, LULC, population density, and dengue data) and revealed that UHIs of Dhaka are places with high ground temperature and lesser vegetation, waterbodies, and dense urban characteristics, with the highest incidence of dengue. The average yearly temperature in 2019 was 25.26 degrees Celsius. May was the warmest month, with an average monthly temperature of 28.83 degrees Celsius. The monsoon and post-monsoon seasons (middle of March to middle of September) of 2019 sustained higher ambient temperatures (>26 Â°C), greater relative humidity (>80%), and at least 150 mm of precipitation. The study reveals that dengue transmits faster under climatological circumstances characterized by higher temperatures, relative humidity, and precipitation.",

        "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases, particularly dengue and chikungunya have become global threats, infecting millions of people worldwide, including developing countries of Southeast Asia and Latin America. Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, is experiencing frequent dengue outbreaks. This article, therefore, critically discussed the current status of dengue disease, vector control approaches, and the need for <i>Wolbachia</i>-mediated intervention in Bangladesh and other dengue-endemic developing countries. In this narrative review study, relevant literature was searched from major databases and search engines such as PubMed, BanglaJol, World Health Organization (WHO)/European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Google Scholar. Considering the selection criteria, our search strategies finally involved 55 related literature for further investigation. Findings showed that current vector control strategies could not render protection for an extended period, and the disease burden of arboviruses is increasing. The impoverished outbreak preparedness, urbanization, climate change, and less efficacy of existing control methods have made people susceptible to vector-borne diseases. Hence, <i>Wolbachia</i>, a naturally occurring endosymbiont of many mosquito species that can potentially limit virus transmission through several host genetic alterations, would be a potential alternative for dengue prevention. We also critically discussed the challenges and prospects of <i>Wolbachia</i>-based dengue control in developing countries. The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of this intervention and its mechanism have also been elucidated. Empirical evidence suggests that this introgression method could be an eco-friendly and long-lasting dengue control method. This review would help the policymakers and health experts devise a scheme of <i>Wolbachia</i>-based dengue control that can control mosquito-borne diseases, particularly dengue in Bangladesh and other developing countries.",

        "abstract": "Dengue outbreak is one of the concerning issues in Bangladesh due to the annual outbreak with the alarming number of death and infection. However, there is no effective antiviral drug available to treat dengue-infected patients. This study evaluated and screened antiviral drug candidates against dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) through viroinformatics-based analyses. Since 2017, DENV-3 has been the predominant serotype in Bangladesh. We selected 3 non-structural proteins of DENV-3, named NS3, NS4A, and NS5, as antiviral targets. Protein modeling and validation were performed with VERIFY-3D, Ramachandran plotting, MolProbity, and PROCHECK. We found 4 drug-like compounds from DRUGBANK that can interact with these non-structural proteins of DENV-3. Then, the ADMET profile of these compounds was determined by admetSAR2, and molecular docking was performed with AutoDock, SWISSDOCK, PatchDock, and FireDock. Furthermore, they were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study using the DESMOND module of MAESTRO academic version 2021-4 (force field OPLS_2005) to determine their solution's stability in a predefined body environment. Two drug-like compounds named Guanosine-5'-Triphosphate (DB04137) and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (DB01752) were found to have an effective binding with these 3 proteins (binding energyâ>â33.47 KJ/mole). We found NS5 protein was stable and equilibrated in a 100 ns simulation run along with a negligible (<3Ã) root-mean-square fluctuation value. The root-mean-square deviation value of the <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-NS5 complex was less than 3Ã, indicating stable binding between them. The global binding energy of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-homocysteine with NS5 was -40.52 KJ/mole as âG. Moreover, these 2 compounds mentioned above are non-carcinogenic according to their ADMET (chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profile (in silico). These outcomes suggest the suitability of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-homocysteine as a potential drug candidate for dengue drug discovery research.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in the early diagnosis of dengue are urgently needed, especially in resource-limited settings where the distinction between dengue and other febrile illnesses is crucial for patient management. In this prospective, observational study (IDAMS), we included patients aged 5 years and older with undifferentiated fever at presentation from 26 outpatient facilities in eight countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, El Salvador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Venezuela, and Viet Nam). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between clinical symptoms and laboratory tests with dengue versus other febrile illnesses between day 2 and day 5 after onset of fever (ie, illness days). We built a set of candidate regression models including clinical and laboratory variables to reflect the need of a comprehensive versus parsimonious approach. We assessed performance of these models via standard measures of diagnostic values. Between Oct 18, 2011, and Aug 4, 2016, we recruited 7428 patients, of whom 2694 (36%) were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed dengue and 2495 (34%) with (non-dengue) other febrile illnesses and met inclusion criteria, and were included in the analysis. 2703 (52%) of 5189 included patients were younger than 15 years, 2486 (48%) were aged 15 years or older, 2179 (42%) were female and 3010 (58%) were male. Platelet count, white blood cell count, and the change in these variables from the previous day of illness had a strong association with dengue. Cough and rhinitis had strong associations with other febrile illnesses, whereas bleeding, anorexia, and skin flush were generally associated with dengue. Model performance increased between day 2 and 5 of illness. The comprehensive model (18 clinical and laboratory predictors) had sensitivities of 0Â·80 to 0Â·87 and specificities of 0Â·80 to 0Â·91, whereas the parsimonious model (eight clinical and laboratory predictors) had sensitivities of 0Â·80 to 0Â·88 and specificities of 0Â·81 to 0Â·89. A model that includes laboratory markers that are easy to measure (eg, platelet count or white blood cell count) outperformed the models based on clinical variables only. Our results confirm the important role of platelet and white blood cell counts in diagnosing dengue, and the importance of serial measurements over subsequent days. We successfully quantified the performance of clinical and laboratory markers covering the early period of dengue. Resulting algorithms performed better than published schemes for distinction of dengue from other febrile illnesses, and take into account the dynamic changes over time. Our results provide crucial information needed for the update of guidelines, including the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness handbook. EU's Seventh Framework Programme.

A large number of prediction models are currently in use globally. As such, this study aimed to systematically review the published literature that used quantitative models to predict dengue outbreaks and provide insights about the current practices. A systematic search was undertaken, using the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases for published citations, without time or geographical restrictions. Study selection, data extraction and management process were devised in accordance with the 'Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies' ('CHARMS') framework. A total of 99 models were included in the review from 64 studies. Most models sourced climate (94.7%) and climate change (77.8%) data from agency reports and only 59.6% of the models adjusted for reporting time lag. All included models used climate predictors; 70.7% of them were built with only climate factors. Climate factors were used in combination with climate change factors (13.4%), both climate change and demographic factors (3.1%), vector factors (6.3%), and demographic factors (5.2%). Machine learning techniques were used for 39.4% of the models. Of these, random forest (15.4%), neural networks (23.1%) and ensemble models (10.3%) were notable. Among the statistical (60.6%) models, linear regression (18.3%), Poisson regression (18.3%), generalized additive models (16.7%) and time series/autoregressive models (26.7%) were notable. Around 20.2% of the models reported no validation at all and only 5.2% reported external validation.

        "abstract": "Many of the medicinally active molecules in the flavonoid class of phytochemicals are being researched for their potential antiviral activity against various DNA and RNA viruses. Quercetin is a flavonoid that can be found in a variety of foods, including fruits and vegetables. It has been reported to be effective against a variety of viruses. This review, therefore, deciphered the mechanistic of how Quercetin works against some of the deadliest viruses, such as influenza A, Hepatitis C, Dengue type 2 and Ebola virus, which cause frequent outbreaks worldwide and result in significant morbidity and mortality in humans through epidemics or pandemics. All those have an alarming impact on both human health and the global and national economies. The review extended computing the Quercetin-contained natural recourse and its modes of action in different experimental approaches leading to antiviral actions. The gap in effective treatment emphasizes the necessity of a search for new effective antiviral compounds. Quercetin shows potential antiviral activity and inhibits it by targeting viral infections at multiple stages. The suppression of viral neuraminidase, proteases and DNA/RNA polymerases and the alteration of many viral proteins as well as their immunomodulation are the main molecular mechanisms of Quercetin's antiviral activities. Nonetheless, the huge potential of Quercetin and its extensive use is inadequately approached as a therapeutic for emerging and re-emerging viral infections. Therefore, this review enumerated the food-functioned Quercetin source, the modes of action of Quercetin for antiviral effects and made insights on the mechanism-based antiviral action of Quercetin.",

Here, we report the immunogenicity of DENV envelope protein domain 3 (ED3) from all four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) in Swiss albino and BALB/c mice models. Firstly, we observed that despite having very similar sequences and structures, both the humoral and cellular immunogenicity of ED3s varied significantly, with strength ranging from DENV2 ED3 (2ED3)~3ED3 > 1ED3 > 4ED3, which was assessed through anti-ED3 IgG titers, and DENV1 ED3 (1ED3) > 2ED3~3ED3 > 4ED3 as determined by monitoring T-cell memory (CD44+CD62L+ T cells with IL-4 and IFN-Î³ expression). Secondly, anti-1ED3 sera cross-reacted with 2ED3 and 3ED3; anti-2ED3 and anti-3ED3 sera cross-reacted with each other, but anti-4ED3 was completely serotype-specific. The lack of reciprocity of anti-1ED3's cross-reaction was unanticipated. Such disparity in the ED3 responses and cross-reaction might underlie the appearance of hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Hence, the development of an ED3-based tetravalent subunit vaccine would require understanding the aforementioned disparities.",

        "title": "Increasing Dengue Burden and Severe Dengue Risk in Bangladesh: An Overview.",
        "abstract": "Dengue is a prevalent and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans. The geographic range of dengue is expanding, and much like in many other tropical regions of the world, dengue has become a major public health issue in Bangladesh. Until a large epidemic dengue outbreak in 2000, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh since 1964. After 2000, varying intensities of dengue activity were observed each year until 2018. However, in 2019, Bangladesh experienced the largest dengue epidemic in its history, with 101,354 dengue cases and 164 dengue-related deaths. Notably, this outbreak occurred in many regions that were previously considered free of the disease. As of 10 December 2022, a total of 60,078 dengue cases and 266 dengue-related deaths were reported in Bangladesh, with the 2022 outbreak being the second largest since 2000. There is an increased genetic diversity of the dengue virus (DENV) in Bangladesh and all four DENV serotypes are prevalent and co-circulating, which increases the risk for severe dengue owing to the antibody-dependent enhancement effect. Vector control remains the mainstay of dengue outbreak prevention; however, the vector control programs adopted in Bangladesh seem inadequate, requiring improved vector control strategies. In this review, we provide an overview of the epidemiology of DENV infection and the risks for a severe dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. Additionally, we discuss different dengue vector control strategies, from which the most suitable and effective measures can be applied in the context of Bangladesh for tackling future dengue epidemics.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a significant public health concern throughout the world, causing an estimated 500,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths each year, despite the lack of effective therapies. The DENV-2 RdRp has been identified as a potential target for the development of new and effective dengue therapies. This research's primary objective was to discover an anti-DENV inhibitor using <i>in silico</i> ligand- and structure-based approaches. To begin, a ligand-based pharmacophore model was developed, and 130 distinct natural products (NPs) were screened. Docking of the pharmacophore-matched compounds were performed to the active site of DENV-2 RdRp protease . Eleven compounds were identified as potential DENV-2 RdRp inhibitors based on docking energy and binding interactions. ADMET and drug-likeness were done to predict their pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and drug-likeproperties . Compounds ranked highest in terms of pharmacokinetics and drug-like appearances were then subjected to additional toxicity testing to determine the leading compound. Additionally, MD simulation of the lead compound was performed to confirm the docked complex's stability and the binding site determined by docking. As a result, the lead compound (compound-108) demonstrated an excellent match to the pharmacophore, a strong binding contact and affinity for the RdRp enzyme, favourable pharmacokinetics, and drug-like characteristics. In summary, the lead compound identified in this study could be a possible DENV-2 RdRp inhibitor that may be further studied on in vitro and in vivo models to develop as a drug candidate.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

        "abstract": "District public health officers (DPHO) are the major health care providers and vital resources for tackling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Thailand. No studies have been published on their experiences of combating COVID-19 in Thailand. To guide and improve COVID-19 control efforts, we aimed to describe their experiences and analyze associated factors for tackling the outbreak. This mixed-methods design involved providing structured questionnaires to selected DPHOs across 52 districts of seven provinces in the upper southern region Thailand. We performed data analysis using descriptive and multivariate statistics. The quantitative approach used questionnaires that demonstrated the content validity and reliability. Data collection involved Google forms, analyzed by multivariate statistics. The qualitative approach comprised an online in-depth interview of 11 DPHOs and a thematic analysis. Results found of the 52 DPHOs, 41 were men (78.8%), and the mean age was 50.02 years (SD = 8.52 years). Their proactive experiences were significantly associated with sex (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.11-3.30), age (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.09-2.76), the length of experience in the current position (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.43-3.63), and working time in the current position (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.43-3.63). There was no significant association between marital status, knowledge, understanding, opinion, proactive practice, and participation experiences. These results were related to six themes of the qualitative approach as follows: High morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, COVID-19 concomitant with several problems, Reaching out to the community for better COVID-19 solutions, The importance of regular reports and feedback, Solution planning based on the situation, and Providing relief to all stakeholders from COVID-19 issue. Proactive experiences of district public health officers are important for sustainable COVID-19 solutions. Disseminating relevant equipment, guidelines, policy, and government regulations is necessary to promote preparedness and efficacy in the crisis management of COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "In a tropical country like Bangladesh, where the climatic condition favors the growth of <i>Aedes</i> mosquito vectors, the success of dengue prevention depends largely on the proper identification and control of risk factors. Therefore this study was aimed to explore the potential risk factors and their association with dengue infection. A case-control study including 150 cases and 150 controls was conducted in Chattogram district of Bangladesh. Cases were confirmed dengue patients admitted in Chattogram medical college hospital and Bangladesh institute of tropical and infectious diseases during August and September 2019. On the other hand, controls were non-dengue patients admitted in other departments of the same hospitals through gender, age, and location matching. The questionnaire data were collected through telephone-based interviews, which included general demography, daily life activities, housing and surrounding environment of participants. Chi-square and binary logistic regression were performed to identify potential risk factors. The study found that travel history to the high incidence area, staying most of the daytime in office (AORÂ =Â 18.10), living in 21-40 years old houses (AORÂ =Â 9.74), and the temporary residency in the city (AORÂ =Â 10.20) were statistically significant risk factors for getting dengue infection. However, day time sleep, house type and structure, number of family members, morning and evening walk, plant in resident, and junk yard around 250Â m of the house were also showed a significant effect in chi square test. Results strengthen our understanding regarding the role of factors associated with daily lifestyle and living environment of people in the development of dengue and hence support the dengue control program in Bangladesh. The study will provide a basis for future extended research covering different parts of the country.",

        "abstract": "Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are mosquito-borne RNA viruses that can cause severe illness leading to death in the tropics and subtropics. Both of these viruses interact directly with the C-type lectin domain family 5, member A receptor (CLEC5A) on human macrophages which stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Since blockade of this interaction has been shown to suppress the secretion of cytokines, CLEC5A is considered a potential target for the development of new treatments to reduce virus-induced brain damage. Developing a vaccine against dengue is challenging because this virus can cause disease through 4 different serotypes. Therefore, the vaccine must immunize against all 4 serotypes to be effective, while unvaccinated people still contract JEV and suffer from its complications. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play an important role in regulating gene expression by causing the degradation of target mRNAs. In this study, we attempted to rationally design potential siRNA molecules using various software, targeting the <i>CLEC5A</i> gene. In total, 3 siRNAs were found to be potential candidates for CLEC5A silencing. They showed good target accessibility, optimum guanine-cytosine (GC) content, the least chance of off-target effects, positive energy of folding, and strong interaction with Argonaute2 protein as denoted by a negative docking energy score. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation of the siRNA-Ago2-docked complexes showed the stability of the complexes over 1.5 nanoseconds. These predicted siRNAs might effectively downregulate the expression of the CLEC5A receptor and thus prove vital in the treatment of dengue and JEV infections.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a vector-borne viral disease usually transmitted by <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes. Around the world, the relationship between local vector density and frequency of dengue cases is being explored and needs further evidence. This study aimed to analyze the potential spatial relationships between the dengue vector (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>) and dengue cases in the megacity of Bangladesh during the 2019 dengue outbreak. Vector density measures were used to estimate spatial associations with dengue case distribution. Location was determined for 364 dengue cases who were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital over a period of 4 months. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire, and prior consent was ensured before participation. The Moran global index, Getis-Ord Giâ, ordinary least squares regression, geographically weighted regression and count data regression methods were used for spatial analysis. We found that dengue case distribution was not associated with immature <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito (larvae) density across the city. The relationship between larval density measured by the Breteau Index (BI) and House Index (HI) with dengue cases was nonstationary and not statistically significant. The location of dengue cases appears to be unrelated to vector distribution and vector density. These findings should prompt the search for other transmission risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a disease that has been outbreak worldwide in the last few years. Dengue is a fatal disease; sometimes, it may cause life-threatening complications and even death. Dengue is considered to be one of the critical diseases which is spreading in more than 110 countries. Nearly 45,000 case reports have been found around Bangladesh in the last year. Dengue fever has become a major health hazard in Bangladesh. Hence, early detection would mitigate major casualties of Dengue disease. Distinct studies have been performed concerning Dengue disease; however, no effective study, particularly from Bangladesh's perspective, it seemed that reveals Dengue outbreaks prediction method. In this scenario, this research work aims to analyse the Dengue disease and build an apposite model to predict dengue outbreaks. This paper also aims to find the best technique to early predicts Dengue disease. The real-time data of the patients admitted to different hospitals in Bangladesh is accumulated to achieve the goal of the current research. Then different multilayer perceptron neural networks and a Decision tree are used for Dengue outbreaks prediction. Twenty-five parameters are analysed to find these parameters' infection rates in this work. A comparative study of the developed models' performances is also accomplished to obtain a better Dengue outbreaks prediction model. The results evidence that the Levenberg-Marquardt is the best technique with 97.3% accuracy and 2.7% error in Dengue disease prediction. On the other hand, the Decision tree may have the second choice to assess Dengue disease.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that claims the lives of millions of people around the world. A number of factors like disease's non-specific symptoms, increased viral mutation, growing antiviral drug resistance due to reduced susceptibility, unavailability of an effective vaccine for dengue, weak immunity against the virus, and many more are involved. Dengue belongs to the Flaviviridae family of viruses. The two species of the vector transmitting dengue areÂ Aedes aegyptiÂ andÂ Aedes albopictus, with the former one being dominant. Serotypes 2 of dengue fever are spread to the human body and cause severe illness. Recently, dengue has imposed an aggressive effect synergistically with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we concentrated our efforts on finding a potential therapeutic. For this, we chose natural compounds to fight dengue fever, which is currently regarded as successful among many drug therapies. Following this, we started the in silico experiment with 922 plant extracts as lead compounds to fight serotype 2. In this study, we used SwissADME for analyzing ligand drug-likeness, pkCSM for designing an ADMET profile, Autodock vina 4.2 and Swissdock tools for molecular docking, and finally Desmond for molecular dynamics simulation. Ultimately 45 were found effective against the 2'O methyltransferase protein of serotype 2. CHEMBL376820 was found as possible therapeutic candidates for inhibiting methyltransferase protein in this thorough analysis. Nevertheless, more in vitro and in vivo research are required to substantiate their potential therapeutic efficacy.",
