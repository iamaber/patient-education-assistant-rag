        "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic potential of five natural compounds from Carica papaya - olean-12-ene, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and kaempferol - against dengue virus (DENV) using a multi-faceted in silico approach. Quantum chemical analysis using density functional theory (DFT) revealed insights into the electronic properties and stability, with olean-12-ene exhibiting the highest stability (HOMO-LUMO gap: 6.91Â eV), while luteolin and apigenin showed balanced reactivity profiles suitable for biochemical interactions. ADMET profiling underlined the drug-likeness of these compounds: Quercetin showed good solubility (logS: -2.93) and hydrogen bonding potential, apigenin showed high oral bioavailability (HIA: 93.25%) and olean-12-ene exhibited remarkable permeability (Caco-2: 1.26). Molecular docking simulations against the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease, the NS1 protein and the envelope protein provided further insight into their binding affinities and interaction modes. Toxicity assessments indicated manageable risks, although flavonoids exhibited moderate hepatotoxicity and olean-12-ene showed cardiotoxic/nephrotoxic tendencies, suggesting a need for further optimization. Overall, these results highlight the potential of specific papaya-derived compounds, particularly the flavonoids, as candidates for further experimental validation in the development of anti-DENV therapeutics. This work lays a foundation for future in vitro and in vivo studies to combat DENV infection and associated complications such as thrombocytopenia.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever has been increasing in recent decades and has become a key concern for the health sector in the USA. This study aims to investigate the impact of meteorological conditions on the incidence of dengue fever in the USA. This research based on the evidence of weekly dengue cases from January 2015 to December 2021 in 56 regions in the USA. Besides descriptive statistics, association was examined between dengue fever incidence and specific environmental factors. A number of multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) for count data was applied to discover the elements that substantially influence the spread of dengue sickness. The hurdle negative binomial regression (NBR) model was considered the final model based on the AIC and BIC criteria. This study showed that temperature, humidity, rainfall, and surface pressure are positively correlated with dengue cases. However, the sky clearance index has negative relationships with dengue cases. The hurdle-NBR model revealed that humidity, temperature, and air-pressure are more prone to dengue cases. In contrast, precipitation, wind speed, and sky clearance index are negatively associated with dengue incidence. The findings of this research impart crucial information about meteorological parameters that could increase the risk of dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "The Mayaro virus (MAYV), an emerging arbovirus of the Alphavirus genus (family Togaviridae), shares clinical and epidemiological features with other arboviruses such as Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika. It causes Mayaro fever in humans, characterized by febrile illness and prolonged arthralgia, often leading to misdiagnosis. Given the absence of licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies and the presence of competent vectors in endemic regions, MAYV poses a significant threat of epidemic, particularly in rural South America. In this research, computational immunological methods were employed to construct a polypeptide vaccine, with a focus on the structural polyprotein of the Mayaro virus. A series of rigorous computational assessments were used to predict the most potent T and B lymphocyte epitopes for the vaccine candidate. The vaccine exhibited favorable physicochemical properties, stable secondary and tertiary structures, and high solubility. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated its structural stability, while docking studies indicated robust interactions with TLR2 and TLR4 receptors, essential for initiating immune responses. Codon optimization, along with in silico cloning, demonstrated efficient expression of the vaccine candidate in an <i>E. coli</i> system. Finally, an immune simulation indicated that the vaccine candidate could induce a robust and long-lasting immune response.

        "abstract": "We investigated a new outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Dhaka and nearby areas of Bangladesh in 2024, examining its epidemiology, clinical features, and genomic characteristics. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research enrolled suspected Chikungunya cases from October 19 to December 31, 2024. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed, and positive cases were followed up via telephone between days 21 and 28. The E1 gene of 12 samples was sequenced. Of 394 enrolled patients, 138 (35%) were CHIKV-positive, mostly male (64.5%) and over 30 years old (83.3%), with 98.6% residing in Dhaka. Common symptoms included fever (100%), arthralgia (97.8%), myalgia (83.2%), and headache (65.0%). While no fatalities were recorded, 14.5% required hospitalization with an average stay of 5.9 days, and patients lost an average of 10.5 workdays. At 28 days, 81% of 58 follow-up patients had persistent symptoms. Both hospitalization and persistent symptoms were associated with having >4 symptoms initially (incidence risk ratio: 1.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.27 and 1.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.39, respectively). Sequence analysis identified an E1-K211E substitution, with phylogenetics revealing a distinct East-Central-South-African (ECSA) sub-lineage compared to 2017 strains. CHIKV is likely to re-emerge in Bangladesh amid the ongoing dengue outbreak, posing a risk of a major outbreak soon. Strengthening efforts to control <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes is essential.",

        "abstract": "After a major outbreak in Bangladesh in 2017, chikungunya nearly vanished from its territory until its resurgence in late 2024. However, its symptomatic overlap with dengue virus (DENV), another major arbovirus, has hindered accurate diagnosis and reporting, resulting in limited molecular diagnostic efforts for chikungunya in this region. This diagnostic evaluation study aimed to detect and characterize arboviral infections at the molecular level, focusing on the re-emergence of chikungunya and implications for future outbreaks. Febrile individuals aged 5-65 years old presenting with fever onset within 2-5 days along with other corresponding febrile symptoms were prospectively recruited from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh diagnostic facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 569 of 1,280 screened individuals were enrolled, providing informed written consent/assent. Serum samples from 474 participants underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, revealing 213 positive cases for at least one arbovirus. Chikungunya cases totaled 55, including seven coinfections (six with DENV and the first documented chikungunya virus-Zika virus coinfection in Bangladesh). No infections were reported from January to August, with a peak in October and November. Most chikungunya virus infections (72.7%) had moderate to high viral loads, with symptoms of joint pain, myalgia, and headaches. This resurgence of chikungunya in late 2024 highlights the potential for a major outbreak in 2025, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate public health impact and ensure a robust response to this re-emerging threat.",

This study aims to identify the risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia based on the recent STEPS survey in Bangladesh. Secondary cross-sectional study. This study analyze the publicly available \"National STEPS Survey for Non-communicable Diseases Risk Factors in Bangladesh 2018\" dataset. The sample size was 6875, after cleaning the three phases of dataset. Frequency distribution, Spatial distribution, Chi-square test, and Logistic regression models were employed in data analysis. The nationwide prevalence of NCDs revealed 27.3Â % for hypertension, 9.8Â % for diabetes, and 30.2Â % for hypercholesterolemia. The NCDs prevalence significantly varied across divisions in Bangladesh, with Barisal having the highest hypertension (25Â %) and Sylhet the lowest (18.1Â %). Chittagong led in diabetes prevalence (12.0Â %), while Rangpur had the lowest (4.8Â %). For hypercholesterolemia, Barisal topped (34.9Â %), and Mymensingh had the lowest (20.9Â %).

Older age and obesity notably increased significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) the odds of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, while urban residence increased the odds of diabetes. Several factors, mostly age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category are responsible for higher prevalence of NCD diseases.

        "abstract": "Dengue represents a significant public health threat in Bangladesh, characterized by its complex ecological transmission dynamics. To improve dengue prevention and control efforts, firstly, we employ state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methods to identify the roles of eco-climatic factors in predicting dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. We utilize high-performance machine learning (ML) models, XGBoost and LightGBM, combined with explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to evaluate the predictive performance and impact of various dengue determinants in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2023. The LightGBM and XGBoost models were also utilized to predict dengue cases and early warning trends from 2024 to 2030. Climatic, socio-demographic, and landscape features were used to train these models; SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) were used to interpret the results. Between 2000 and 2023, Bangladesh experienced the highest number of dengue cases in August, while November saw the most fatalities. The XGBoost model excelled in predicting dengue outbreaks, achieving an AUC score of 0.89, a Log Loss of 0.64. Key predictors identified by the model include population density, precipitation, temperature, and land-use patterns. Additionally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) provided insights into the model's predictions, highlighting the significance of population density, relative humidity, and minimum temperature in dengue outbreaks. This study showcases the potential of XAI in uncovering the complexities of dengue outbreaks, providing a robust tool for public health interventions. Our AI-driven framework can be utilized to generate prompt and timely alerts to prevent imminent dengue and other infectious disease outbreaks.",

Despite whole blood being the gold standard for DENV detection, emerging evidence suggests that non-blood specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), may offer a less invasive alternative for diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of NPSs for detecting DENV RNA in pediatric patients in Bangladesh. We collected 130 paired NPS and blood specimens from children with suspected dengue (aged 1 month to 15 years) at Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute. Viral RNA was extracted from both sample types and subsequently detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 130 paired specimens, DENV RNA was detected in 115 blood samples and 104 NPSs. Compared with blood, NPS exhibited a sensitivity of 90.43%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 91.54%. An analysis of demographic and clinical factors revealed no significant differences between NPS-positive and -negative cases. This study underscores the potential of NPSs as a viable alternative diagnostic specimen for DENV detection, particularly, in settings where blood collection is difficult. Integrating NPS into existing diagnostic and surveillance systems could enhance early detection and outbreak management, ultimately improving patient care and public health response.",

Dengue infections can present with a wide range of symptoms, from fever to severe organ involvement like myocarditis. In this retrospective analysis, risk factors, clinic-laboratory profile, and outcomes of dengue myocarditis in hospitalised patients were investigated. Methods The study wasÂ a retrospective one, conducted in a tertiary private hospital in Dhaka between 2019 and 2023.Â Dengue infection was diagnosed by positive dengue nonstructural antigen (NS1) tests and/or dengue IgM or dengue RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) positivity. Dengue myocarditis was diagnosed with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013 consensus statement.Â For each myocarditis patient, we recruitedÂ age-, gender-, and year-of-admission-matched control dengue patients. Results Thirty-four dengue-myocarditis patients and 81 matchedÂ dengue patients were recruited as controls, with the mean age of myocarditis patients being 48.5 Â± 20.1 years; 20.7% were from the 60-69 age group, and 21 (61.7%) were male. Mean (Â±standard deviation)Â leucocyte count 9.1 (Â±4.7) Ã10<sup>9</sup>/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 604 (Â±937) IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2076 (Â±4202) IU/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 5.5 (Â±5.3) mg/dL were significantly higher in the myocarditis group. Among 34 myocarditis patients, four patients (11.7%) died, with procalcitonin 18.8 (Â±27.5) ng/mL, prothrombin time (PT) 28.7 (Â±12.4) seconds, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 102.6 (Â±46.9) seconds being significantly higher. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the presence of comorbidities (odds ratio [OR]: 10.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78-39.5])Â and a raised neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR 11.9; 95% CI: 2.82-50.7) were significantly associated with myocarditis.

        "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive statistical and graphical analysis of hematological parameters in a cohort of 1523 dengue patients in a thorough search for the determination of the clinical features of dengue fever. The most important parameters were hemoglobin level, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and total platelet counts, whose statistical analysis has been conducted with the vision to clarify their role in dengue pathology. Statistical significance finds the key hematological parameters such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red blood cells, and RDW-CV to be strongly associated with dengue, and the same is borne out by their p-values. The gender, hemoglobin, MCH, and PDW are less strongly related, however. The consistency of results using T-tests as well as Z-tests strengthens the findings, highlighting significant markers while also pointing out how more intricate interactions would be uncovered using multivariate analysis. Subsequently, several data visualizations were constructed using box plots, violin plots, and pair plots. Hematological parameters in dengue positive and negative patients are somewhat disparate, as shown by box plots; positive patients presented with lower WBC and RBC counts and higher hemoglobin levels and monocyte percentages. Although females tend to have greater monocyte percentages and platelet counts and males tend to have overall greater hematocrit levels, violin plots do not indicate any gender differences in the majority of the blood parameters. The pair plot indicates that younger patients with lower hemoglobin are more likely to have positive dengue results, with some overlap between total WBC count and lymphocyte percentage. In conclusion, this database will be very useful and will provide a tremendous benefit to dengue research studies, public health initiatives, and better patient diagnosis and treatment methods.",

This study aims to characterize dengue fatalities and analyze their determinants and spatial influence. Using data from the Management Information System of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, we characterized dengue mortality and conducted a linear regression analysis to determine the impact of age groups and gender on case fatality rate (CFR). We used a geographically weighted Poisson regression model to assess the spatial influence and impact of population factors. Women had a higher CFR than men (0.75% vs 0.38%, <i>P</i> <0.05). Among the recorded deaths, 74% (n = 1262) developed dengue shock syndrome, 17% (n = 290) expanded dengue syndrome, and 7% (n = 119) dengue hemorrhagic fever. The 10-year age groups significantly impacted CFR (estimate: 0.03, <i>P</i> <0.01), suggesting that each additional decade increased CFR by 30%, whereas gender was insignificant. Higher deaths were observed in the southern regions, whereas spatial clusters were primarily concentrated around Dhaka City, the epicenter of the outbreak. Substantial effects from neighboring districts were also identified. Bangladesh's 2023 dengue outbreak resulted in significant mortality, particularly, among older age groups.

In contrast, the random forest model outperformed others on the downscaled daily data, reaching an accuracy of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>95.8</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> , thereby supporting the efficacy of data downscaling for ML applications in epidemiology. Comparative analysis reveals that downscaling provided a <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>28.5</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> improvement in accuracy and an <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>89.3</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) over non-downscaled data which has been proven to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, illustrating the substantial advantages of employing downscaling for effective DENV forecasting. Based on the best-performing model, the study further projects a worst-case scenario for 2024, forecasting daily cases to peak at 1,382 ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>95</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> CI: 1,341-1,423) between August and October, with a gradual decline expected by December. The findings not only underscore the critical influence of meteorological variables on DENV transmission but also advocate for the adoption of sophisticated data preprocessing techniques, such as downscaling, to enhance prediction accuracy. This research marks a significant advancement in predictive epidemiology, offering a scalable framework for DENV and other vector-borne diseases, with implications for improving public health responses in vulnerable regions globally.",

        "abstract": "A life-threatening vector-borne disease, dengue fever (DF), poses significant global public health and economic threats, including Bangladesh. Determining dengue risk factors is crucial for early warning systems to forecast disease epidemics and develop efficient control strategies. To address this, we propose an interpretable tree-based machine learning (ML) model for dengue early warning systems and outbreak prediction in Bangladesh based on climatic, sociodemographic, and landscape factors. A framework for forecasting DF risk was developed by using high-performance ML algorithms, namely Random Forests, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), based on sociodemographic, climate, landscape, and dengue surveillance epidemiological data (January 2000 to December 2021). The optimal tree-based ML model with strong interpretability was created by comparing various ML models using the hyperparameter optimization technique. The feature importance ranking and the most significant dengue driver were found using the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) value. Our study findings detected a nonlinear effect of climatic parameters on dengue at different thresholds such as mean (27Â°C), minimum (22Â°C), maximum temperatures (32Â°C), and relative humidity (82%). The optimal minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed for dengue risk are 25-28Â°C, 32-34Â°C, 75%-85%, 10âmm, and 12âm/s, respectively. The LightGBM model accurately forecasts DF and agricultural land, population density, and minimum temperature significantly affecting the dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. Our proposed ML model functions as an early warning system, improving comprehension of the factors that precipitate dengue outbreaks and providing a framework for sophisticated analytical techniques in public health.",

        "abstract": "In 2023, the dengue virus (DENV) outbreak infected over 0.3âmillion cases and 1500 deaths in Bangladesh. Our study conducted serotyping and genomic surveillance in four districts of Southwest Bangladesh between September and October 2023. The surveillance data from 2019 to 2023 extracted from the Directorate General of Health Services in Bangladesh indicated a significant increase of Dengue infections in 2023, particularly during September-November. The two-layered hypothesis examination confirmed that, despite endemic months, 2023 dengue outbreak had a higher morbidity rate compared to previous years (2019-2022) in the southwest of Bangladesh. Serotyping using RT-PCR and E gene sequence analysis of 25 randomly selected positive samples reveals that DENV-2 was the dominant serotype circulating in this region during the study period. Genomic analysis (phylogenetic analysis and classical multidimensional scaling [cMDS]) exposed a new strain of DENV-2, classified under Cosmopolitan genotype within C clade, distinct from previous Bangladeshi strains until 2022. This strain, possibly migrating from India, might have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic years and exhibited higher morbidity rates, thus challenging our existing mitigation strategies. This investigation provides valuable insights for public health interventions and underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance in managing dengue outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease predominantly found in tropical and subtropical countries like Bangladesh. The Aedes species particularly Aedes aegypti carry and transmit the dengue virus thus causing dengue fever irrespective of age, gender, race or religion. Limited studies on dengue in low endemic zone of Bangladesh are available. This study attempted to investigate factors influencing dengue among suspected patients with dengue in a tertiary level hospital at Mymensingh region of Bangladesh. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 381 suspected patients with dengue admitted to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from June 2023 to December 2023. A face to face interview was performed and there were no ignored cases in this study. Dengue infection was confirmed by a positive result of NS1 dengue antigen test if the blood sample taken within 7 days of the onset of fever, and IgM antibody test if the blood sample taken after 7th day of symptoms. The chi-square test and binary logistic regression model were used to determine the influencing factors of dengue using SPSS software (IBM version 25). Most of the suspected patients came from urban environment (64.3%). The prevalence of dengue among suspected patients with dengue admitted at hospital was 74.3%, among them 45.9% and 28.3% were confirmed as dengue fever by NS1 antigen and IgM test respectively. Logistic regression model demonstrated that female had more likely to get dengue than male [aORâ=â2.08, CI:1.09-3.93; pâ<â0.05]. Similarly, patients came from urban environment [aORâ=â5.99, CI:3.09-11.64; pâ<â0.01], travel history to Dhaka in last two weeks preceding the survey [aORâ=â11.21, CI:5.30-23.72; pâ<â0.01], participants did not use mosquito net during sleeping at day time [aORâ=â2.74, CI:1.41-5.55; pâ<â0.01] and presence of water containers around the house [aORâ=â12.00, CI: 5.69-25.29; pâ<â0.01] had higher chance to get dengue compared to their counterparts. More than 25% suspected patients were not identified as dengue patients. Some factors were identified as risk for dengue. A safe working and living environment, self and community awareness and planned urbanization can help to prevent breeding of mosquito larvae that transmit dengue virus thus causing dengue.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Dengue virus (DENV) is the fatal pathogenic arthropod-borne virus (arboviruses) that belongs to the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family, which transmits to humans through mosquito bites from infected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes or maternal-fetal transmission. Despite antigenic differences, the four serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4) share 65-78% of their genome. Non-structural (NS) proteins amongst serotypes show analogous functions. Among NS proteins, NS3 and NS5 are frequently used as targets for antiviral drugs due to their multifunctional roles. <b>Methods</b>: To identify potential inhibitors of DENV, we created a phytochemical library of 898 compounds derived from 17 medicinal plants recognized for their medicinal and antiviral properties. The phytochemicals library has been docked against the target proteins. Phytochemicals with a docking score greater than -8.0 kcal/mol were selected for further evaluation using a machine learning approach. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to evaluate the root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, solvent-accessible surface area, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond count of the compounds. <b>Results</b>: From the docking results, Silibinin, Rubiadin, and Ellagic acid showed binding affinities of -8.5, -8.3, and -8.2 kcal/mol, respectively, for NS3, and NSC 640467, Bisandrographolide A, and Andrographidin A showed binding affinities of -9.3, -10.1, and -9.3 kcal/mol, respectively, for NS5 target proteins. These compounds exhibited strong interactions with target proteins. MD simulation results confirmed the stable formation of protein-ligand complexes. Further, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) and bioactivity predictions confirmed their pharmacological safety. <b>Conclusions</b>: Despite global public health concerns, DENV still lacks specific drug treatments. Our identified new drug candidates might help for developing effective antiviral inhibitors against the DENV. However, further confirmation is needed through in vivo and in vitro research.",

        "abstract": "Dengue cases in Bangladesh have surged in recent years. The existing insecticide-based control program is challenged by issues of insufficient household coverage and high levels of insecticide resistance in the primary dengue virus (DENV) vector, Aedes aegypti. A more sustainable, effective alternative could be the implementation of a Wolbachia-mediated disease management strategy. Hence, we created and characterised a Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti strain with a Dhaka wild-type genetic background, and compared its reproductive compatibility, maternal inheritance, fitness, and virus-blocking ability to the parental strains (Dhaka wild-type and wAlbB2-F4). The new Ae. aegypti strain wAlbB2-Dhaka demonstrated complete cytoplasmic incompatibility with the wild-type and complete maternal transmission, retaining levels of pyrethroid resistance of the Dhaka wild-type. No significant fitness costs were detected during laboratory comparison. Compared to the wild-type, wAlbB2-Dhaka mosquitoes demonstrated a significantly reduced genome copies of DENV in the bodies (44.4%, pâ=â0.0034); a two-fold reduction in dissemination to legs and wings (47.6%, pâ<â0.0001); and >â13-fold reduction of DENV in saliva expectorates (proxy of transmission potential) (92.7%, pâ<â0.0001) 14 days after ingesting dengue-infected blood.

Despite apparent symptoms, many patients tested negative on the NS1 rapid antigen test, the primary diagnostic tool. This study assesses the reliability of the NS1 rapid test results by analyzing its sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values using RT-PCR as the gold standard. It also explores how viral serotypes and secondary infections may impact test performance, especially in NS1-negative cases. This cross-sectional study recruited febrile patients at two tertiary hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, within 24Â hours to 7 days of fever onset. Patients were selected based on physician-advised NS1 antigen testing, without restrictions on age, sex, or occupation. NS1 antigen test reports were collected from hospitals, and RNA testing via RT-PCR was conducted on all samples. Additional IgG and IgM tests were carried out for NS1-negative, RT-PCR-positive cases, and serotyping was performed on all RT-PCR-positive samples. Of the 194 samples tested, 65 (33.5%) were RT-PCR positive for dengue. Among these, 25 (38.5%) were NS1-negative. Most RT-PCR-positive cases were male (67.7%), with the 16-45 age group most affected. Symptoms like body aches (83.1%) and headaches (70.8%) were common. The predominant serotype was DEN-2 (97.5% in NS1-positive and 84% in NS1-negative cases), known for lower NS1 sensitivity. NS1 test sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 61%, 97%, 91%, and 83%, respectively. Early IgG positivity in NS1-negative cases suggested secondary infections. Despite the high specificity of NS1 rapid tests, moderate sensitivity demands alternative diagnostics like RT-PCR, which are crucial for better dengue management, especially in the presence of DEN-2 infections and associated secondary infections in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, dengue fever and influenza pose serious public health risks due to their high rates of morbidity and fatality. Frequent outbreaks have been caused by dengue, a virus spread by mosquitoes that causes flu-like symptoms, particularly during the monsoon season. Another infectious respiratory illness that varies every year is influenza. Both illnesses frequently co-circulate in tropical areas like Bangladesh, raising the possibility of co-infection and putting vulnerable groups at higher risk. The purpose of the article is to explore the effects of dengue and influenza co-infection in Bangladesh, looking at present issues and possible solutions to this dual health burden. This perspective piece gathers data from authoritative sources, including PubMed, the World Health Organization, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Relevant literature on dengue and influenza incidence, control measures, and co-infection dynamics was reviewed. In Bangladesh, dengue incidence are still on the rise, while influenza infections have climbed, especially during the winter. The country's healthcare system may be overburdened by the simultaneous spread of both diseases, particularly if dengue rates keep rising and influenza cases rise. To lessen the effects of these illnesses, effective community awareness campaigns, vector control initiatives, and early diagnosis techniques are crucial. Bangladesh must emphasize increased preventative and preparation measures, such as better monitoring, public health communication, and vaccine development research, given the twin danger posed by dengue and influenza. To lower the likelihood of co-infection and avert future public health emergencies, coordinated actions are essential.",

This situation warrants the importance of quickly identifying severe dengue patients to expedite necessary medical interventions which could potentially reduce the adverse consequences. The aim of this study was to identify clinical features and laboratory parameters of the severe dengue patients in the 2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. This hospital based cross-sectional study included the demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 1313 Dengue patients from several secondary and tertiary hospitals across Bangladesh from August 2023 to December 2023. According to the 2009 WHO classification, dengue cases were classified into severe dengue and non-severe dengue (with and without warning signs). Chi-square test, Fischer's exact test and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify potential risk factors associated with severe dengue cases. Of the 1313 patients included in this study, nearly 20% had severe dengue, 36.71% of them were from the 16-25Â year age bracket and nearly two-thirds were male. Fever (99.54%) was the most common clinical symptom followed by anorexia (69.54%) and severe headache (66.03%); whereas most common warning signs were severe lethargy (43.64%), persistent vomiting (27.57%), and severe abdominal pain and tenderness (20.03%) across all patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are significantly more common in severe dengue cases compared to non-severe ones. Among the laboratory parameters, decrease of platelet level and increased ALT level was more prominent in severe patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that severe abdominal pain, severe lethargy, respiratory distress, altered mental status, decreased urine output, pleural effusion and ascites were positively associated with the development of severe dengue. This study presents warning signs, clinical symptoms and trends of laboratory parameters associated with severe cases of dengue in Bangladesh that can be used in improving patient management in the future.",

The sensitivity of widely used rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) varies due to factors like viral load, serotypes, secondary infections, and disease severity. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of RDTs compared to RT-PCR, identifying key factors affecting sensitivity. The study at Dhaka Medical College (DMC) involved 683 suspected dengue cases. Blood samples and metadata were collected, and RDTs (NS1, IgG, IgM) were performed on-site. Samples were analyzed at icddr,b using RT-PCR for viral RNA detection and serotyping. Diagnostic performance was assessed using MedCalc, while metadata and sensitivity differences were analyzed with SPSS. We found that vomiting was the most common symptom, followed by, diarrhea, restlessness, and abdominal tenderness. RDT sensitivity was highest in cases with high viral loads, reaching 94 % within 1-3 days of symptom onset and 82 % beyond three days. Moderate viral loads showed sensitivities of 70 % for NS1+IgM and 84 % for NS1+IgM+IgG within three days, decreasing thereafter. Sensitivity was low in low viral load cases but improved after three days with IgG incorporation. DENV-3 and secondary infections showed higher false-negative rates.

        "abstract": "Dengue fever remains a significant public health challenge in Bangladesh. This study aimed to characterize the clinical and epidemiological profiles of confirmed dengue cases during the 2024 outbreak in Bangladesh. This observational study was conducted from June to September 2024 in four tertiary care hospitals across Bangladesh located in four administrative divisions. A total of 401 laboratory-confirmed (NS1- or IgM-positive) dengue patients agedââ¥â12Â years were included. Demographic data, clinical presentations, and laboratory findings were collected through faceâto-face interviews. The revised WHO 2009 dengue case classification was used for severity assessment of dengue patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize the results. The mean age of patients with dengue fever was 29.81âÂ±â11.64 (SD) years, with 7.2% of the patients being adolescents (aged 12-17Â years). A clear male predominance (88.3%) was observed. Overall, 65.6% of patients had dengue with warning signs, and 9% had severe dengue. Fever (94.3%), headache (70.3%), myalgia (66.1%), and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea (49.9%) and abdominal pain (43.9%) were common symptoms. The median in-hospital stay of both non-severe and severe cases were 4 & 5Â days, respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.75%, which was significantly higher among severe dengue patients (5.6%). The 2024 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh predominantly affected young adult males, with a notable prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms alongside classic dengue manifestations.",

Managing outbreaks of dengue fever poses a challenge in tropical regions like Bangladesh, where consistently warm temperatures allow mosquitoes to breed and the virus to proliferate. This study introduces a deterministic model with four compartments to represent the transmission of the dengue virus, with parameters estimated using the 2023 outbreak data in Bangladesh. Utilizing the next generation method, we calculate the basic reproduction number (R<sub>b</sub>) and conduct sensitivity analysis to explore how various model parameters impact the transmission and spread of dengue in the population. Furthermore, personal protective measures and treatment are incorporated into our proposed model. Numerical simulations are conducted, using the average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to assess the cost-effectiveness of different control strategies, focusing on different control measures with varying cost weights. The findings demonstrate that the combined application of controls avert more infections at a minimal expenses. Additionally, there is a reciprocal relationship between the extent of control efforts and cost weights.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

This study intends to explore the circulating serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV) and their clinical associations across Bangladesh. The study enrolled 1317 febrile patients presenting with at least two symptoms (nausea or vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, and leukopenia) at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) between July and August 2023. They provided demographic data, clinical features, and blood samples. DENV was tested using a rapid detection test and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Of 1317 patients, 300 (23%) tested positive by rapid detection test and 775 (59%) by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The median age of participants was 20 years, with 61% of confirmed cases being male. The DENV-2 serotype was found in 88%, DENV-3 in 12%, and only one was found positive for DENV-4. Overall, 80 percent of dengue-positive cases showed warning signs (abdominal tenderness, persistent vomiting, rash, and bleeding). The severity of cases was significantly higher with DENV-2. This study generates insights into the distribution of dengue serotypes and their association with disease severity. The DENV-2 was found as the dominant serotype in the 2023 outbreak.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), presents a significant global health concern, with millions of cases reported annually. Despite significant progress in understanding Dengue fever, effective prognosis and treatment remain elusive due to the complex clinical presentations and limitations in current diagnostic methods. The virus, transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, exists in four closely related forms, each capable of causing flu-like symptoms ranging from mild febrile illness to severe manifestations such as plasma leakage and hemorrhagic fever. Although advancements in diagnostic techniques have been made, early detection of severe dengue remains difficult due to the complexity of its clinical presentations. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression in dengue fever patients using multiple microarray datasets from the NCBI GEO database. Through bioinformatics approaches, 163 potential biomarker genes were identified, with some overlapping previously reported biomarkers and others representing novel candidates. Notably, AURKA, BUB1, BUB1B, BUB3, CCNA2, CCNB2, CDC6, CDK1, CENPE, EXO1, NEK2, ZWINT, and STAT1 were among the most significant biomarkers. These genes are involved in critical cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation and mitotic checkpoint control, which are essential for immune cell function and response. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the dysregulated genes were predominantly associated with immune response to the virus, cell division, and RNA processing. Key regulatory genes such as AURKA, BUB1, BUB3, and CDK1 are found to be involved in cell cycle regulation and have roles in immune-related pathways, underscoring their importance in the host immune response to Dengue virus infection. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Dengue fever pathogenesis, highlighting key regulatory genes such as AURKA and CDK1 that could serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and targets for therapeutic intervention, paving the way for improved management of the disease.",

        "abstract": "A more accurate assessment of the disease's incidence and fatality rate over the previous years could help with future outbreak detection and containment. Therefore, this scoping review was conducted to compile the results of research on dengue investigation in Bangladesh in terms of knowledge, attitudes, and practices; risk factors; clinical presentations; and stereotypes of dengue. The final analysis included 27 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA 2020 guidelines served as the basis for data extraction. All included articles were retrieved from PubMed, BanglaJOL, Google Scholar, Embase, Web Sciences, Cochrane Library, and other databases up to October, 2024. The quality of included studies in terms of relevance, reliability, validity, and applicability was also evaluated. The present study recorded a moderate understanding of dengue infection among slum dwellers and people in rural areas due to a lack of knowledge about it. Insufficient practices regarding dengue fever were also found among them. However, the differences in perception regarding dengue infection were observed in different parts of Dhaka city. Additionally, between 2017 and 2022, different dengue serotypes were the most common at various times. The potential risk factors included monsoon sessions (July to September), static water, scrapyards, and indoor plants; urbanization; population density; being outside in the morning and evening; sleeping during the day; and so forth. Along with the common symptoms of dengue, hematological abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, as well as elevated levels of ALT and AST, were observed in Bangladeshi dengue patients. Knowledge gap, moderate understanding, insufficient practices regarding dengue infection among slum dwellers and rural people, and varieties in dengue serotypes are the main obstacles to control the dengue outbreak. Therefore, it is essential to undertake several preventive measures to reduce the dengue infection and also understand the dengue serotypes.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a viral disease caused by the dengue flavivirus and transmitted through mosquito bites in humans. According to the World Health Organization, severe dengue causes approximately 40,000 deaths annually, and nearly 4 billion people are at risk of dengue infection. The urgent need for effective treatments against the dengue virus has led to extensive research on potential bioactive compounds. In this study, we utilized a network pharmacology approach to identify the DENV-2 capsid protein as an appropriate target for intervention. Subsequently, we selected a library of 537 phytochemicals derived from <i>Azadirachta indica</i> (Family: Meliaceae), known for their anti-dengue properties, to explore potential inhibitors of this protein. The compound library was subjected to molecular docking to the capsid protein to identify potent inhibitors with high binding affinity. We selected 81 hits based on a thorough analysis of their binding affinities, particularly those exhibiting higher binding energy than the established inhibitor ST-148. After evaluating their binding characteristics, we identified two top-scored compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamics simulations to assess their stability and binding properties. Additionally, we predicted ADMET properties using <i>in silico</i> methods. One of the inhibitors, [(5S,7R,8R,9R,10R,13R,17R)-17-[(2R)-2-hydroxy-5-oxo-2H-furan-4-yl]-4,4,8,10,13-pentamethyl-3-oxo-5,6,7,9,11,12,16,17-octahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthren-7-yl] acetate (AI-59), showed the highest binding affinity at -10.4Â kcal/mol. Another compound, epoxy-nimonol (AI-181), demonstrated the highest number of H-bonds with a binding affinity score of -9.5Â kcal/mol. During molecular dynamics simulation studies, both compounds have exhibited noteworthy outcomes. Through molecular mechanics employing Generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations, AI-59 and AI-181 displayed negative ÎG_bind scores of -74.99 and -83.91Â kcal/mol, respectively. The hit compounds identified in the present investigation hold the potential for developing drugs targeting dengue virus infections. Furthermore, the knowledge gathered from this study serves as a foundation for the structure- or ligand-based exploration of anti-dengue compounds.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93Â·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89Â·6-96Â·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80Â·6 million (78Â·2-83Â·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emiratesâand Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15Â·6% (12Â·7-17Â·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14Â·2% (11Â·4-15Â·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16Â·5% [13Â·3-18Â·3]) than overweight (12Â·9% [12Â·2-13Â·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is a well-known epidemic zone for dengue fever. Several epidemiological and geographical factors influence the transmission and severity of dengue infection. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological and geographical factors that contributed to the severity of the dengue outbreak in Bangladesh in 2023. This hospital-based cross-sectional study investigated 1,313 dengue patients admitted to public hospitals in Dhaka, Chattogram and Kishoreganj, Bangladesh, between July and December 2023. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the independent risk factors for severe dengue infection. The average age of respondents was 29.5 years, with individuals aged 20-40 accounting for 59.5%. Of the 1,313 dengue patients, 19.3% (254) were diagnosed with severe dengue infection. Patients with low monthly income and those lacking awareness of dengue's spread from clogged rooftop water were respectively 2.35 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.35; P <0.05; 95% CI: 1.08-5.07) and 2.23 (aOR 2.23; P <0.05; 95% CI: 1.20-4.14) times more likely to develop severe dengue. The dengue outbreak has become a serious public health issue in Bangladesh, with factors such as low family income and lack of awareness contributing to the development of severe cases. These findings provide valuable evidence for policymakers to guide and implement preventive measures and raise awareness.",

        "abstract": "During the 2023-dengue outbreak in Bangladesh, a diagnostic evaluation study was conducted to investigate concurrent Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) transmission in Dhaka in 2023. The study explored to simultaneously detect the presence of ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV while considering relevant clinical and epidemiological risk factors, using a real-time multiplex RT-PCR system. Following this, it was planned to sequence the selected samples to identify genetic variations of the ZIKV infections within the population. This study was designed as a diagnostic evaluation, where participants meeting the inclusion criteria were prospectively recruited with written informed consent. A total of 399 febrile individuals were screened, with 185 meeting the inclusion criteria of having a fever onset within 2-5 days, along with one of the following clinical features, e.g. headache, myalgia, arthralgia or bone pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and 152 undergoing real-time RT-PCR testing. Five ZIKV-positive cases were identified, including one DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the ZIKV strains were part of the Asian lineage, closely related to Cambodian and Chinese strains from 2019. All ZIKV-positive cases were male, residing within a one-kilometer radius, with no prior travel history, suggesting community-level transmission. This study marks the first identification of ZIKV in Dhaka city and the first report of ZIKV-DENV co-infection in Bangladesh that highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by the symptomatic similarities between ZIKV and other arboviruses and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and public health interventions to mitigate the spread and impact of ZIKV in dengue-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that frequently causes seasonal outbreaks in Bangladesh, particularly during the monsoon months from June to September. Recent outbreaks have shown significant shifts in clinical manifestations, including changes in the timeframe and serotype mixing. This study focused on the clinical and hematological profiles of patients during the 2022 outbreak, which was notably severe. This quantitative cross-sectional study at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital classified 67 dengue-positive patients as having dengue fever (DF), dengue fever with warning signs (DFWS), and severe dengue (SD). Fisher's exact test, Pearson's chi-squared test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were conducted for statistical analysis using the R software (version 4.2), with significance established at <i>p</i>â<â0.05. Predominantly male patients (76%) aged 21-40 (63%) and middle-class patients from Dhaka (57%) formed the majority. Most patients (45%) lacked a regular drainage system. Laboratory tests showed 63% NS1 antigen (nonspecific antigen 1) positivity, and 16% tested positive for both NS1 and IgM (Immunoglobulin M). Symptoms included headache (84%), retroorbital pain (51%), joint pain (75%), myalgia (72%), vomiting (75%), abdominal pain (69%), diarrhea (39%), and shock (48%). Thrombocytopenia was present in 61% of patients, with 79% showing elevated hematocrit (HCT) levels. Pedal edema, pleural effusion, and ascites were observed in DF and DFWS cases, while SD cases exhibited distinct HCT level variations. Accurate clinical and laboratory assessments are vital for the treatment and prediction of dengue outcomes in Bangladesh, given the severe manifestations of dengue shock syndrome (DSS). It is characterized by headache, muscle pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, and potential neurological complications or mortality. Severe cases involve critical plasma leakage, leading to DSS with fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and potential multiorgan involvement. Enhancing physician awareness regarding dengue case detection and management, along with routine dengue testing, are recommended for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.",

Historically, most of the cases were recorded in the capital city, Dhaka. We aimed to characterize the geographical transmission of DENV in Bangladesh. From 1 January-31 December 2023, we extracted and analyzed daily data on dengue cases and deaths from the Management Information System of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. We performed a generalized linear mixed model to identify the associations between division-wise daily dengue counts and various geographical and meteorological covariates. The number of dengue cases reported in 2023 was 1.3 times higher than the total number recorded in the past 23Â years (321,179 vs. 244,246), with twice as many deaths than the total fatalities recorded over the past 23Â years (1705 vs. 849). Of the 1,705 deaths in 2023, 67.4% (<i>n</i>Â =Â 1,015) died within one day after hospital admission. The divisions southern to Dhaka had a higher dengue incidence/1000 population (2.30 vs. 0.50, <i>p</i>Â <0.01) than the northern divisions.

The aim of the study was to gauge liver dysfunction in patients with dengue infections. To judge the impact of dengue virus infection on liver function by measuring various liver function tests in blood samples of serologically diagnosed dengue patients. This study was undertaken as an observational cross-sectional study in the period of June 2019 to October 2020. Records of 120 serologically confirmed cases of dengue infection with available biochemical liver function tests, admitted to Bangladesh Medical College Hospital, were analyzed. Patients were classified as classical dengue fever (DF) - 64.1%, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) - 24.1% and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) - 11.6%. The mean age was 36.61Â±14.55 years. Normal values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had 27.0% of patients and 73.0% had values above normal.

The mean value of AST was significantly more than ALT. The degree of rise of ALT and AST was significantly more in DHF and DSS, as compared to DF. Mean serum ALT, AST and bilirubin values were significantly higher in patients with haemorrhage as compared to those without haemorrhage and in non-survivors. Serum albumin concentration was significantly lower in DSS than DHF or DF patients. Hepatic dysfunction was quite common altogether types of dengue infection, with AST rising significantly more than ALT.

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, continues to pose severe risks to public health and economic stability in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in developing nations like Bangladesh. The necessity for advanced forecasting mechanisms has never been more critical to enhance the effectiveness of vector control strategies and resource allocations. This study formulates a dynamic data pipeline to forecast dengue incidence based on 13 meteorological variables using a suite of state-of-the-art machine learning models and custom features engineering, achieving an accuracy of 84.02%, marking a substantial improvement over existing studies. A novel wrapper feature selection algorithm employing a custom objective function is proposed in this study, which significantly improves model accuracy by 12.63% and reduces the mean absolute percentage error by 70.82%. The custom objective function's output can be transformed to quantify the contribution of each variable to the target variable's variability, providing deeper insights into the workings of black box models. The study concludes that relative humidity is redundant in predicting dengue infection, while meteorological factors exhibit more significant short-term impacts compared to long-term and immediate impacts. Sunshine (hours) emerges as the meteorological factor with the most immediate impact, whereas precipitation is the most impactful predictor over both short-term (8-month lag) and long-term (26-30-month lag) periods. Forecasts for 2024 using the best-performing model predict a rise in dengue cases starting in May, peaking at 24,000 cases per month by August and persisting at high levels through October before declining to half by year-end. These findings offer critical insights into temporal climate effects on dengue transmission, aiding the development of effective forecasting systems.",

        "abstract": "Rapid human movement plays a crucial role in the spatial dissemination of the dengue virus. Nevertheless, robust quantification of this relationship using both spatial and temporal models remains necessary. This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue transmission under various human movement contexts. We obtained district-wise aggregated dengue incidence data from the Management Information System,Â Directorate General of Health Services of Bangladesh. The stringency index (SI), along with eight individual policy measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker database) and six mobility indices (as measured by Google's Community Mobility Reports) were obtained as human movement indicators. A multi-step correlative modelling approach, including various spatial and temporal models, was utilized to explore the associations of dengue incidence with the SI, fourteen human movement indices and the Eid festival. The global Moran's I indicated significant spatial autocorrelation in dengue incidence during the pre-pandemic (Moran's I: 0.14, Pâ<â0.05) and post-pandemic periods (Moran's I: 0.42, Pâ<â0.01), while the pandemic period (2020-2022) showed weaker, non-significant spatial clustering (Moran's I: 0.07, Pâ>â0.05). Following the pandemic, we identified the emergence of new dengue hotspots. We found a strong negative relationship between monthly dengue incidence and the SI (r<sub>spearman</sub>: -Â 0.62, Pâ<â0.01). Through the selection of an optimal Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we observed that the closure of public transport (Î²â=â-Â 1.66, Pâ<â0.10) and restrictions on internal movement (Î²â=â-Â 2.13, Pâ<â0.10) were associated with the reduction of dengue incidence. Additionally, observed cases were substantially lower than predicted cases during the period from 2020 to 2022. By utilising additional time-series models, we were able to identify in 2023 a rise in dengue incidence associated with the Eid festival intervention, even after adjusting for important climate variables. Overall, rapid human movement was found to be associated with increased dengue transmission in Bangladesh. Consequently, the implemention of effective mosquito control interventions prior to large festival periods is necessary for preventing the spread of the disease nationwide. We emphasize the necessity for developing advanced surveillance and monitoring networks to track real-time human movement patterns and dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "There is a shortage of rapid, accurate, and low-cost assays for diagnosing enteric fever. The dual-path platform for typhoid (DPPT) assay had high accuracy in retrospective studies with banked plasma samples. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DPPT assay in a prospective study using fingerstick capillary blood. For this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled children younger than 18Â years, who presented at the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with at least 3Â days of fever. We collected blood and nasal swabs, and did the following assays to assess the accuracy of DPPT: blood culture, serological assays for typhoid fever (DPPT assay, Widal, and Test-it), and molecular assays to identify alternative aetiologies (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza, dengue virus, and Rickettsia spp). The primary outcomes of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay for diagnosis of enteric fever. We evaluated the accuracy of combined anti-haemolysin EÂ and anti-lipopolysaccharide IgA readings using the DPPT assay in distinguishing culture-confirmed enteric fever from alternative aetiologies using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). Given the imperfect reference standard diagnostics for enteric fever, we used Bayesian latent class models, incorporating results from the typhoid and alternative aetiology diagnostics, to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay. We also did subgroup analyses for the assay across multiple biological variables. Between Aug 17, 2021, and July 16, 2022, we enrolled 501Â participants who presented with at least 3Â days of fever. 223 (45%) of 501Â participants were female and 278 (55%) were male. 77Â participants had culture-confirmed enteric fever (62 Salmonella entericaÂ serotype Typhi and 15 Salmonella entericaÂ serotype Paratyphi A) and 70Â were culture-negative with PCR-confirmed alternative aetiology (34 influenza AÂ or B, 22Â dengue virus, seven Rickettsia spp, six RSV, and one participant co-infected with RSV and dengue virus). The AUC for DPPT on fingerstick capillary blood in distinguishing typhoid from alternative aetiologies was 0Â·969 (95% CI 0Â·943-0Â·994). In latent class analysis, the sensitivity of DPPT was 93%Â (95% credible interval [CrI] 87-97) and specificity was 89% (85-93). The balanced accuracy was higher for DPPT (91%, 95% CrI 87-94) than blood culture (81%, 78-85), Test-it (77%,Â 74-79), or Widal (70%, 67-73). Assay performance did not vary by sex, age, duration of fever at presentation, antibiotic use before presentation, Salmonella serotype, or sample type. The point-of-care DPPT assay achieved high diagnostic accuracy for enteric fever in a highly endemic community. This assay has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for enteric fever, allowing rapid diagnosis and treatment, and could facilitate more appropriate antimicrobial use.

The disease is now endemic in some parts of the world, including Bangladesh. The disorder exhibits a wide range of clinical and laboratory features in children. Judicial fluid resuscitation during the critical phase and prompt referral to the appropriate health facility can be lifesaving. Objectives This research appraised clinical and laboratory features and treatment outcomes of DF in pediatric cases. Methods This prospective investigative work was conducted at Islami Bank Hospital, Dhaka, India, from July to October 2023. The study included 135 admitted pediatric cases of DF, either dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) or anti-dengue antibody IgM or IgG positive. Results Among the selected cases, boys were more predominant than girls, and most patients were in the age group of 5 to 10 years (n=46, 34%), most of them belonging to lower-middle-class families (n=56, 41.5%). All of the study participants had raised body temperatures, and most had abdominal pain (n=82, 60.7%), vomiting (n=77, 57%), cough (n=43, 31.9%), headache (n=38, 28.2%), body aches (n=32, 23.7%), and diarrhea (n=23, 17%). Dengue NS1 was positive in 91.1% (n=123) of cases. Raised hematocrit was found in 36.3% (n=49) of cases, leukopenia in 47% (n=63), and thrombocytopenia in 69.6% (n=94) of cases. Most of our patients were categorized as having DF (68.1%, n=92), followed by dengue with warning signs (16.3%, n=22), and severe dengue was present in 15.6% (n=21) of patients. Most were treated with crystalloid, and some with crystalloid and colloid solution. Fortunately, most of them recovered with no death. Conclusion DF may manifest with varied clinical and laboratory features in children. Appropriate treatment of critical phases, depending on clinical and laboratory features, is crucial to reducing dengue-induced miseries and fatal clinical outcomes among the pediatric population.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by <i>Leptospira</i> bacteria, which is reemerging in various regions and often poses a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms. While most infections are mild, severe cases occur in 5-10% of patients and are associated with high mortality, especially in areas with poor sanitation and urbanization. This study aims to investigate the association of specific parameters with leptospirosis diagnosis using a machine learning model and geographic mapping tools to identify spatial patterns and high-risk areas for the disease. Methods An observational retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care center analyzed patients clinically suspected of leptospirosis over the course of one year. The study utilized laboratory investigations, geographic mapping, and machine learning models to explore the association between various laboratory parameters and the predictive diagnosis of leptospirosis. Results The study, conducted over one year at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalyani, India, included 325 patients, of whom 43 (13.2%) tested positive for leptospirosis by IgM ELISA. Geographic mapping revealed case clusters around nearby districts of West Bengal, with a few cases from Tripura and Bangladesh. The study found no significant association between individual laboratory parameters and leptospirosis diagnosis. However, machine learning models, particularly k-nearest neighbors (KNN), demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy (accuracy: 74%, area under the curve: 0.6). Conclusion Geographic mapping identified clusters of leptospirosis cases; however, no significant association was found between individual laboratory parameters and the disease diagnosis. Machine learning models, particularly KNN, demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy. The study also highlighted the overlapping clinical features of leptospirosis, dengue, and scrub typhus in West Bengal, although it noted the absence of detailed clinical data as a limitation.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a serious public health issue in Bangladesh, where its incidence rises with the monsoon. Meteorological variables are believed to be responsible factors among others. Therefore, this study examines the effects of meteorological variables (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) on dengue incidence in Bangladesh. While previous studies have examined the relationship between dengue and meteorological variables using single model approaches, this study employs advanced econometric techniques to capture dynamic interactions. Furthermore, in the case of Bangladesh, this type of analysis is necessary due to the fact that dengue outbreak become one of the major issues. However, the analysis related to this issue is not available. For estimation purposes, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, Granger causality tests, Impulse Response Function (IRF), Variance Decomposition (VDC), and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) are employed. Rainfall has a significant impact on dengue incidence compared to temperature and humidity. The Granger causality test demonstrates that rainfall and dengue incidence are causally related unidirectionally. Rainfall can potentially have a short-term and long-term effect on the incidence of dengue, as per the estimates of the VECM model. These findings will assist policymakers in Bangladesh in developing a dengue fever early warning system depending on climate change. In order to efficiently avoid the spread of dengue in Bangladesh's dengue-endemic urban areas, this study suggests societal monitoring.",

Various forecasting models, including Seasonal ARIMA, Poisson regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and other statistical techniques, were applied to forecast dengue trends and generate future datasets. The results showed that Bangladesh has higher mean temperatures. The Poisson regression indicated that rainfall positively correlated with dengue cases in Bangladesh, while humidity and sunshine showed negative associations. In Singapore, temperature was positively associated with dengue cases, while rainfall and humidity had inverse relationships. ARIMA models predicted Singapore would experience the highest dengue cases by 2023. Based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the TBATS model was most accurate for predicting dengue cases in Bangladesh, while both ARIMA and TBATS models performed well in Singapore. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers in Singapore and Bangladesh to develop climate-based warning systems.",

        "abstract": "Dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, pose significant public health challenges. Effective treatments for these viruses remain elusive, highlighting the urgent need for new efficient antiviral therapies. This study explores prodigiosin, a microbial tripyrrole pigment, as an antiviral agent against both DENV and ZIKV employing advanced analytical approaches which integrate molecular docking, CASTp 3.0 validation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations providing insights into molecular interactions at an atomic level. Prodigiosin exhibited favourable drug-likeness properties, meeting Lipinski's rule of five and demonstrating optimal physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics according to Ghose's, Veber's, Egan's and Muegge's filters, essential for oral bioavailability. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity profiling indicated high intestinal absorption, minimal risk for drug-drug interactions and a low toxicity profile, with no AMES toxicity, hepatotoxicity, or skin sensitization. Molecular docking revealed prodigiosin's strong binding affinities to NS5 methyltransferases of both DENV (-7.6Â kcal/mol) and ZIKV (-7.7Â kcal/mol) viruses, suggesting potential disruption of viral replication. Notably, prodigiosin's binding affinities were comparable to ribavirin-5'-triphosphate and chloroquine, known inhibitors of DENV and ZIKV, respectively. MD simulations confirmed stable and specific interactions with prodigiosin with low root-mean-square deviation values. Additional analyses, including root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, indicated compact and stable complexes. These multi-parametric in-silico analytical strategies provide a novel perspective of prodigiosin as an antiviral agent, demonstrating its drug interactions at the molecular level. These promising results suggest that prodigiosin could serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent against both DENV and ZIKV, warranting further experimental validation for therapeutic development against flaviviral infections.",

        "abstract": "Historically, pandemics constitute a major nuisance to public health. They have a debilitating impact on global health with previous occurrences causing major mortalities worldwide. The adverse outcomes are not limited to health outcomes but ravage the social, economic, and political landscapes. The World Health Organization (WHO) stands at the front of the pandemic response, strategizing to contain and mitigate the impacts on humans and the environment. It also intervenes in regional disease outbreaks that pose a threat to global health through strategic technical guidance, resource allocations, and expert support. With emerging pathogens, and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions are currently underway on global preparedness for a potential future pandemic. The effects of previous pandemics underscore the need to improve global health preparedness for upcoming pandemics. The WHO's July 2024 updated list of emerging pathogens serves as a potential tool to foster global health readiness for a future pandemic. It represents a change in the world's approach to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, shifting focus from specific pathogens to adopting a broader family-focused approach. This new list recognizes the shortcomings of previous lists and adopts a more forward-thinking, proactive, and flexible approach to dealing with familiar and unfamiliar pandemic risks, now incorporating 'Prototype Pathogens' and 'Pathogen X' into its risk classification. The WHO has set the pace, developing tools and guidelines for practice. This updated list of high-priority pathogens seeks to gear research and development toward combating and neutralizing the virulence of these pathogens. Recent outbreaks of Cholera, Mpox, and Dengue fever in Africa, Avian influenza (H5N2) in Mexico, Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh, and Oropouche virus in the Americas necessitate intensifying regional disease surveillance Research organizations and institutions must prioritize incorporating these tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies in the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative as outlined by WHO.",

In total, 16 publications from 2007 to 2024 were manually screened for inclusion in this systematic review. The articles were divided into three categories: climate and water, climate and health, and climate, water, and health. Due to the climate change, 20 million individuals in Bangladesh have been suffering from water- and health-related illness. The results showed that among Bangladeshi vulnerable groups, cholera, infant diarrhea, pneumonia, dengue, malaria, mental illness, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and an increase in communicable diseases like water-, vector-, and food-borne infections, along with malnutrition, are common. Further findings of the study include health risks, water-related risks, and difficulties in determining the consequences of climate change. This review study focuses on Bangladesh, a developing country, and the correlation between climate change and the dangers of water and health-related diseases.

        "abstract": "Acute arboviral infections like dengue have a significant negative socioeconomic and health impact on many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. About 3.9 billion Individuals are at risk of contracting the dengue virus and Asia bears the brunt of that load. Bangladesh, like other south-east Asian countries faced a massive outbreak of dengue in 2019. This cross sectional study was done in three tertiary care centers in Dhaka, Bangladesh during this worst outbreak of dengue. The study was conducted from 1st July to 31st December, 2019 with an aim to describe the clinical and laboratory variations among severe dengue cases and to conduct a serotype survey. This might help to understand the future changes in the clinical or serological profile of the circulating dengue virus. The study enrolled 1978 participants who were grouped into group B (Patients with warning signs or risk factors who should be admitted for close observation as they approach critical phase) and C (Patients having severe plasma leakage leading to dengue shock and/or fluid accumulation with respiratory distress, severe organ impairment and severe metabolic abnormalities) according to national guidelines. Furthermore, 81 samples were serotyped using Qiagen One step RT-PCR kit (Cat. No: 210212). In addition sequencing (ABI sequencing platform) of partial C-prM gene of five DENV-3 isolates were done and analyzed (BLAST tool of NCBI) for phylogenetics (MEGA6 software package). Among the 1978 enrolled participants group B and C patients were 1580 (80%) and 398 (20%) respectively. The median (IQR) age of the patients were 26(11 to 41). Maximum proportion of the enrolled were male (72.3%) (p = 0.0002). Most common co- morbidities were hypertension (90; 4.5%) and DM (70; 3.5%). Group C patients more commonly presented with vomiting (p 0.133), diarrhea (p<0.0001) and abdominal pain (p 0.0203). The common mode of bleeding was melaena (12%). Thirteen (0.7%) patients succumbed to death, 12 of them belonged to group B who mostly presented with GI manifestations (99.9%) and melaena (12%). Only 5.6% of the cases were secondarily infected. In group C cases low hemoglobin and hematocrit was observed with high AST (p 0.004, 0.006 and 0.0016 respectively). Fluid requirement was also more in the same group (p<0.0001). Group B patients had a higher platelet requirement (p = 0.0070). Twelve patients (0.7%) required ICU. The management profile of these cases are showcased here which highlights minimal use of antibiotics and no application of steroids, which abides by the current national protocol. Furthermore, 81 samples from enrolled participants were serotyped and majority (79%) yielded DENV-3, followed by DENV 2 & 3 co-infection (13.6%) and DENV-2 alone (7.4%). Following phylogenetic analysis DENV-3 and DENV2 were deemed to be of genotype I and cosmopolitan variety respectively. This study presents the first instance of heterogeneous co-infection with several serotypes since 2000 in Bangladesh. It also gives an overview of serotype prevalence, management evaluation and clinical results that promises to navigate future control planning.",

        "abstract": "Dengue emerged as a significant health threat in endemic regions in recent years. However, inconsistent diagnostic accuracy in sequential dengue infections necessitate improved testing methods to ensure effective management of dengue cases. Here, we evaluated a portable, rapid, and sensitive molecular assay-reverse transcriptase recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RAA)-utilizing a mobile suitcase laboratory to detect infections in suspected dengue cases in Bangladesh. A total of 364 suspected patients with dengue were enrolled in the study. Dengue cases were confirmed by a positive result from any of the four tests: non-structural protein 1 (NS1) rapid diagnostic test (RDT), immunoglobulin (Ig) M RDT, quantitative reverse transcriptive-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and RT-RAA assay. IgG RDT was performed to differentiate between primary and secondary dengue infections. Of 364 suspected cases, 320 were confirmed dengue cases, with 55.94% classified as primary and 44.06% as secondary infections. Laboratory results showed comparable positivity rates between RT-RAA (78.8%) and NS1 RDT (77.1%) in primary dengue, followed by quantitative RT-PCR (57.5%) and IgM RDT (12.8%). RT-RAA demonstrated superior positivity rates in secondary dengue (76.6%), surpassing RT-PCR (60.3%), NS1 RDT (27%), and IgM RDT (24.8%). Combining RT-RAA with NS1 RDT detected infections in 89.95% primary and 81.56% secondary dengue. The findings suggest that complementing RT-RAA with NS1 RDT could significantly improve dengue detection rate, particularly, for secondary infections.",

This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

Integrated studies on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, seasonality, and genotype of dengue are limited. This study was conducted to determine recent trends in the molecular epidemiology, clinical features, and seasonality of dengue outbreaks. We analyzed data from 41 original studies, extracting epidemiological information from all 41 articles, clinical symptoms from 30 articles, and genotypic diversity from 11 articles. The study adhered to the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. A total of 565,438 dengue cases and 2,587 fatalities were documented from January 2000 to March 2024. Notably, 60% of cases during the 2019 and 2023 outbreaks were reported in regions previously considered non-endemic. Fatalities were more frequent among women (70%). The majority of the studies (95-100%) used the NS1Ag test, followed by IgG or IgM and RT-PCR tests. New hotspots of dengue transmission were identified in the southern (Khulna, 10.8% and Barishal, 11.8%) and southeastern (Chattogram, 13.8%) regions of Bangladesh. Serotyping was conducted on 92.4% (1,456 of 1,575) of isolates between 2012 and 2023. Of the four serotypes, DENV3 was the most prevalent (57%), followed by DENV2 (30%), DENV1 (11%), and DENV4 (<1%). Genotype DENV3-I (43 of 59 isolates) was the most prevalent, followed by DENV3-II (8 of 59). The highest frequency of dengue cases was observed in August (26.3%), followed by September (22.5%), October (20.2%), and November (13.08%). Fever (90.51, 95% CI 85-100%) was the most prevalent symptom, followed by headache (57.98, 95% CI 12-100%), vomiting (51.16, 95% CI 23-91%), abdominal pain (34.12, 95% CI 12-85%), and myalgia (25.53, 95% CI 13-85%), respectively.

This data set presents hematological parameters for the systematic record of patients suffering from dengue infection: age, sex, hemoglobin, WBC count, differential count, RBC panel, platelet count, and PDW. The dataset has in-depth records of patients admitted to Upazila Health Complex, Kalai, Jaipurhat, Bangladesh and thus offers an opportunity for further analysis of hematological changes produced by dengue infection. This dataset is valuable because of the potential contribution that these data will make to developing predictive models for disease severity and patient outcomes, enhancing clinical decision-making. It serves as a benchmark for the comparison of hematological responses across different demographics and geographical locations, adding value to the knowledge of dengue in the world. Moreover, the study has gone further to indicate how the characteristics related to blood may be affected by various treatment regimens, hence offering better treatment protocols. The data preprocessing in this study involved cleaning, normalization, and encoding of the variables before proceeding to perform the statistical analysis. This showed a Chi-Square test for no significant association of sex with the diagnostic outcome, as given by the <i>p</i>-value of 0.277. On the other hand, the Z-test and T-test results indicated a significant difference in the hemoglobin levels concerning gender; the obtained p-values are 2.534 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup> and 4.325 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively.

        "abstract": "Despite the initial hope inspired by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world is now dangerously close to breaching its target of limiting global multiyear mean heating to 1Â·5Â°C. Annual mean surface temperature reached a record high of 1Â·45Â°C above the pre-industrial baseline in 2023, and new temperature highs were recorded throughout 2024. The resulting climatic extremes are increasingly claiming lives and livelihoods worldwide. The <i>Lancet</i> Countdown: tracking progress on health and climate change was established the same year the Paris Agreement entered into force, to monitor the health impacts and opportunities of the worldâs response to this landmark agreement. Supported through strategic core funding from Wellcome, the collaboration brings together over 300 multidisciplinary researchers and health professionals from around the world to take stock annually of the evolving links between health and climate change at global, regional, and national levels. The 2024 report of the <i>Lancet</i> Countdown, building on the expertise of 122 leading researchers from UN agencies and academic institutions worldwide, reveals the most concerning findings yet in the collaborationâs 8 years of monitoring. Data in this yearâs report show that people all around the world are facing record-breaking threats to their wellbeing, health, and survival from the rapidly changing climate. Of the 15 indicators monitoring climate change-related health hazards, exposures, and impacts, ten reached concerning new records in their most recent year of data. Heat-related mortality of people older than 65 years increased by a record-breaking 167%, compared with the 1990s, 102 percentage points higher than the 65% that would have been expected without temperature rise (indicator 1.1.5). Heat exposure is also increasingly affecting physical activity and sleep quality, in turn affecting physical and mental health. In 2023, heat exposure put people engaging in outdoor physical activity at risk of heat stress (moderate or higher) for a record high of 27Â·7% more hours than on average in the 1990s (indicator 1.1.2) and led to a record 6% more hours of sleep lost in 2023 than the average during 1986â2005 (indicator 1.1.4). People worldwide are also increasingly at risk from life-threatening extreme weather events. Between 1961â90 and 2014â23, 61% of the global land area saw an increase in the number of days of extreme precipitation (indicator 1.2.3), which in turn increases the risk of flooding, infectious disease spread, and water contamination. In parallel, 48% of the global land area was affected by at least 1 month of extreme drought in 2023, the second largest affected area since 1951 (indicator 1.2.2). The increase in drought and heatwave events since 1981â2010 was, in turn, associated with 151 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity across 124 countries assessed in 2022, the highest recorded value (indicator 1.4.2). The hotter and drier weather conditions are increasingly favouring the occurrence of sand and dust storms. This weather-environmental phenomenon contributed to a 31% increase in the number of people exposed to dangerously high particulate matter concentrations between 2003â07 and 2018â22 (indicator 1.2.4). Meanwhile, changing precipitation patterns and rising temperatures are favouring the transmission of deadly infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria, West Nile virus-related illness, and vibriosis, putting people at risk of transmission in previously unaffected locations (indicators 1.3.1â1.3.4). Compounding these impacts, climate change is affecting the social and economic conditions on which health and wellbeing depend. The average annual economic losses from weather-related extreme events increased by 23% from 2010â14 to 2019â23, to US$227 billion (a value exceeding the gross domestic product [GDP] of about 60% of the worldâs economies; indicator 4.1.1). Although 60Â·5% of losses in very high Human Development Index (HDI) countries were covered by insurance, the vast majority of those in countries with lower HDI levels were uninsured, with local communities bearing the brunt of the physical and economic losses (indicator 4.1.1). Extreme weather and climate change-related health impacts are also affecting labour productivity, with heat exposure leading to a record high loss of 512 billion potential labour hours in 2023, worth $835 billion in potential income losses (indicators 1.1.3 and 4.1.3). Low and medium HDI countries were most affected by these losses, which amounted to 7Â·6% and 4Â·4% of their GDP, respectively (indicator 4.1.3). With the most underserved communities most affected, these economic impacts further reduce their capacity to cope with and recover from the growing impacts of climate change, thereby amplifying global inequities. Concerningly, multiple hazards revealed by individual indicators are likely to have simultaneous compounding and cascading impacts on the complex and inter-connected human systems that sustain good health, disproportionately threatening peopleâs health and survival with every fraction of a degree of increase in global mean temperature. Despite years of monitoring exposing the imminent health threats of climate inaction, the health risks people face have been exacerbated by years of delays in adaptation, which have left people ill-protected from the growing threats of climate change. Only 68% of countries reported high-to-very-high implementation of legally mandated health emergency management capacities in 2023, of which just 11% were low HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Moreover, only 35% of countries reported having health early warning systems for heat-related illness, whereas 10% did so for mental and psychosocial conditions (indicator 2.2.1). Scarcity of financial resources was identified as a key barrier to adaptation, including by 50% of the cities that reported they were not planning to undertake climate change and health risk assessments (indicator 2.1.3). Indeed, adaptation projects with potential health benefits represented just 27% of all the Green Climate Fundâs adaptation funding in 2023, despite a 137% increase since 2021 (indicator 2.2.4). With universal health coverage still unattained in most countries, financial support is needed to strengthen health systems and ensure that they can protect people from growing climate change-related health hazards. The unequal distribution of financial resources and technical capacity is leaving the most vulnerable populations further unprotected from the growing health risks. As well as exposing the inadequacy of adaptation efforts to date, this yearâs report reveals a world veering away from the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1Â·5Â°C, with concerning new records broken across indicators monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and the conditions that enable them. Far from declining, global energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reached an all-time high in 2023 (indicator 3.1.1). Oil and gas companies are reinforcing the global dependence on fossil fuels andâpartly fuelled by the high energy prices and windfall profits of the global energy crisisâmost are further expanding their fossil fuel production plans. As of March, 2024, the 114 largest oil and gas companies were on track to exceed emissions consistent with 1Â·5Â°C of heating by 189% in 2040, up from 173% 1 year before (indicator 4.2.2). As a result, their strategies are pushing the world further off track from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, further threatening peopleâs health and survival. Although renewable energy could provide power to remote locations, its adoption is lagging, particularly in the most vulnerable countries. The consequences of this delay reflect the human impacts of an unjust transition. Globally, 745 million people still lack access to electricity and are facing the harms of energy poverty on health and wellbeing. The burning of polluting biomass (eg, wood or dung) still accounts for 92% of the energy used in the home by people in low HDI countries (indicator 3.1.2), and only 2Â·3% of electricity in these countries comes from clean renewables, compared with 11Â·6% in very high HDI countries (indicators 3.1.1). This persistent burning of fossil fuel and biomass led to at least 3Â·33 million deaths from outdoor fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2Â·5</sub>) air pollution globally in 2021 alone (indicator 3.2.1), and the domestic use of dirty solid fuels caused 2Â·3 million deaths from indoor air pollution in 2020 across 65 countries analysed (indicator 3.2.2). Compounding the growth in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, almost 182 million hectares of forests were lost between 2016 and 2022 (indicator 3.4), reducing the worldâs natural capacity to capture atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. In parallel, the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which contributed to 11Â·2 million deaths attributable to unhealthy diets in 2021 (indicator 3.3.2), has led to a 2Â·9% increase in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions since 2016 (indicator 3.3.1). Health systems themselves, although essential to protect peopleâs health, are also increasingly contributing to the problem. Greenhouse gas emissions from health care have increased by 36% since 2016, making health systems increasingly unprepared to operate in a net zero emissions future and pushing health care further from its guiding principle of doing no harm (indicator 3.5). The growing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is pushing the world to a future of increasingly dangerous health hazards and reducing the chances of survival of vulnerable people all around the globe. With the availability of financial resources a key barrier to tackling climate change, a rapid growth in predictable and equitable investment is urgently needed to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change. A growing body of literature shows that the economic benefits of a transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions will far exceed the costs of inaction. Healthier, more resilient populations will further support more prosperous and sustainable economies (indicators 4.1.2â4.1.4). However, although funding to enable potentially life-saving climate change adaptation and mitigation activities remains scarce, substantial financial resources are being allocated to activities that harm health and perpetuate a fossil fuel-based economy. The resulting reliance on fossil fuel energy has meant many countries faced sharp increases in energy prices following Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine and the resulting disruption of fossil fuel supplies. To keep energy affordable to local populations, many governments resorted to increasing their explicit fossil fuel subsidies. Consequently, 84% of countries studied still operated net negative carbon prices (explicit net fossil fuel subsidies) in 2022, for a record high net total of $1Â·4 trillion (indicator 4.3.3), with the sums involved often comparable to countriesâ total health budgets. In addition, although clean energy investment grew by 10% globally in 2023âexceeding fossil fuel investment by 73%âconsiderable regional disparities exist. Clean energy investment is 38% lower than fossil fuel spending in emerging market and developing economies outside China. Clean energy spending in these countries only accounted for 17Â·4% of the global total. Moreover, investment in energy efficiency and end use, essential for a just transition, decreased by 1Â·3% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1). The resulting expansion of fossil fuel assets is increasingly jeopardising the economies on which peopleâs livelihoods depend. On the current trajectory, the world already faces potential global income losses ranging from 11% to 29% by 2050. The number of fossil fuel industry employees reached 11Â·8 million in 2022, increasing the size of a workforce whose employment cannot be sustained in a world that avoids the most catastrophic human impacts of climate change (indicator 4.2.1). Meanwhile, ongoing investments in coal power have pushed the value of coal-fired power generation assets that risk becoming stranded within 10 years (between 2025 and 2034) in a 1Â·5Â°C trajectory to a cumulative total of $164Â·5 billionâa value that will increase if coal investments persist (indicator 4.2.3). The prioritisation of fossil fuel-based systems means most countries remain ill-prepared for the vital transition to zero greenhouse gas emission economies. As a result of an unjust transition, the risk is unequally distributed: preparedness scores for the transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy were below the global average in all countries with a low HDI, 96% of those with a medium HDI, and 84% of those with a high HDI, compared with just 7% of very high HDI countries (indicator 4.2.4). Following decades of delays in climate change action, avoiding the most severe health impacts of climate change now requires aligned, structural, and sustained changes across most human systems, including energy, transportation, agriculture, food, and health care. Importantly, a global transformation of financial systems is required, shifting resources away from the fossil fuel-based economy towards a zero emissions future. Putting peopleâs health at the centre of climate change policy making is key to ensuring this transition protects wellbeing, reduces health inequities, and maximises health gains. Some indicators reveal incipient progress and important opportunities for delivering this health-centred transformation. As of December, 2023, 50 countries reported having formally assessed their health vulnerabilities and adaptation needs, up from 11 the previous year, and the number of countries that reported having a Health National Adaptation Plan increased from four in 2022 to 43 in 2023 (indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2). Additionally, 70% of 279 public health education institutions worldwide reported providing education in climate and health in 2023, essential to build capacities for health professionals to help shape this transition (indicator 2.2.6). Regarding the energy sector, the global share of electricity from clean modern renewables reached a record high of 10Â·5% in 2021 (indicator 3.1.1); clean energy investment exceeded fossil fuel investment by 73% in 2023 (indicator 4.3.1); and renewable energy-related employment has grown 35Â·6% since 2016, providing healthier and more sustainable employment opportunities than those in the fossil fuel industry (indicator 4.2.1). Importantly, mostly as a result of coal phase-down in high and very high HDI countries, deaths attributable to outdoor PM<sub>2Â·5</sub> from fossil fuel combustion decreased by 6Â·9% between 2016 and 2021 (indicator 3.2.1), showing the life-saving potential of coal phase-out. Important progress was made within international negotiations, which opened new opportunities to protect health in the face of climate change. After years of leadership from WHO on climate change and health, its Fourteenth General Programme of Work, adopted in May, 2024, made responding to climate change its first strategic priority. Within climate negotiations themselves, the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) featured the first health thematic day in 2023: 151 countries endorsed the COP28 United Arab Emirates Declaration on Climate and Health, and the Global Goal on Adaptation set a specific health target. The outcome of the first Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement also recognised the right to health and a healthy environment, urging parties to take further health adaptation efforts, and opened a new opportunity for human survival, health, and wellbeing to be prioritised in the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) due in 2025. The pending decision of how the Loss and Damage fund will be governed and the definition of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance during COP29 provide further opportunities to secure the financial support crucial for a healthy net zero transition. Although still insufficient to protect peopleâs health from climate change, these emerging signs of progress help open new opportunities to deliver a healthy, prosperous future. However, much remains to be done. With climate change breaking dangerous new records and emissions persistently rising, preventing the most catastrophic consequences on human development, health, and survival now requires the support and will of all actors in society. However, data suggest that engagement with health and climate change could be declining across key sectors: the number of governments mentioning health and climate change in their annual UN General Debate statements fell from 50% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, and only 47% of the 58 NDCs updated as of February, 2024, referred to health (indicator 5.4.1). Media engagement also dropped, with the proportion of newspaper climate change articles mentioning health falling 10% between 2022 and 2023 (indicator 5.1). The powerful and trusted leadership of the health community could hold the key to reversing these concerning trends and making peopleâs wellbeing, health, and survival a central priority of political and financial agendas. The engagement of health professionals at all levels of climate change decision making will be pivotal in informing the redirection of efforts and financial resources away from activities that jeopardise peopleâs health towards supporting healthy populations, prosperous economies, and a safer future. As concerning records continue to be broken and people face unprecedented risks from climate change, the wellbeing, health, and survival of individuals in every country now hang in the balance.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection, spread by <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes, is a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the four distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4), DENV-2 is associated with the highest number of fatalities worldwide. However, there is no specific treatment available for dengue patients caused by DENV-2. This study aimed to identify inhibitory phytocompounds <i>in silico</i> in <i>Vernonia cinerea</i> (<i>V. cinerea</i>), a widely used traditional medicinal plant, for treating DENV-2 associated illnesses. The chemical structures of 17 compounds from <i>V. cinerea</i> were sourced from the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry, and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) database. These compounds underwent geometry optimization, were screened against nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of DENV-2, and further validated through molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). Baicalein, an established drug against DENV-2, was used for validation in molecular screening, MDS, and MM-GBSA analyses. Among these compounds, Beta-amyrin, Beta-amyrin acetate, Chrysoeriol, Isoorientin, and Luteolin showed promising potential as inhibitors of the NSP1 of DENV-2, supported by the results of thermodynamic properties, molecular orbitals, electrostatic potentials, spectral data and molecular screening. Besides, these compounds adhered to the Lipinski's \"rule of 5\", showing no hepatotoxicity/cytotoxicity, with mixed mutagenicity, immunotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, final validation through MDS confirmed their potential, demonstrating stable tendencies with significant inhibitory activities against NSP1 of DENV-2 over the control drug Baicalein. Among the screened compounds, Chrysoeriol emerged as the most promising inhibitor of NSP1 of DENV-2, followed by Luteolin and Isoorientin. Taken together, our results suggest that Chrysoeriol is the best inhibitor of NSP1 of DENV-2, which could be evaluated as a therapeutic agent or a lead compound to treat and manage DENV-2 infections.",

This prospective observational study analysed 805 confirmed dengue cases during August-December 2023. Data on demographic, clinical and laboratory profiles, as well as outcomes, were gathered using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 25. The mean age of dengue patients was 31.5 (Â±12.2) y, with the majority being males (81.2%). All 805 patients experienced fever, 792 (98.4%) had headaches, 698 (86.7%) had myalgia, 601 (74.7%) had persistent vomiting and 598 (74.3%) had abdominal pain. Bleeding was observed in 191 (23.7%) patients and neurological symptoms were seen in 209 (25.9%) patients. Most patients (n=781, 97%) exhibited non-severe symptoms, while 3% (n=24) had severe symptoms. Among the 24 severe cases, four (16.7%) patients were reported to have encephalitis and one (4.2%) patient had meningoencephalitis. Moreover, 365 patients (45.3%) had travelled to an endemic region who were predominantly males (n=327, 89.6%). Most dengue patients recovered well with rapid fluid replacement therapy (n=754, 93.7%). The 2023 dengue outbreak in a non-endemic area of Bangladesh primarily impacted males, young adults, with the majority presenting non-severe symptoms. Further studies are essential to validate and build upon these results.",

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia, also known as diabetes, is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of glucose in the bloodstream. It can lead to the prolonged dysfunction, injury, and deterioration of several organs. In addition, dengue is a viral illness transmitted by mosquitoes that has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. In this article, we focused on the severity of comorbidities, difficulties in managing them, and preventive measures meant to lessen the risks associated with comorbidities in diabetic patients with dengue infection. We explored a number of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library, for this review article using various related keywords. The findings of this review article indicate that elderly dengue patients with diabetes should be admitted to the hospital for close observation and early management using fluid therapy. An observed association exists between dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and diabetes, indicating a possible consequence in this specific group. Additionally, patients with diabetes who contract dengue show elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Diabetes mellitus deteriorates the immune system, which exacerbates the progression of dengue fever. Cutting-edge technology and scientific research may assist in addressing the challenges that diabetes and dengue viruses pose in low- and middle-income countries. Implementing innovative diabetic care management is essential to ensuring consistency of care, improving a healthy lifestyle, and lowering patient risk factors and comorbidities. Dengue fever has spread to epidemic levels throughout the world. Inflammatory markers increase and the prevalence of DHF is greater in diabetes individuals with dengue infection. Given the continued growth of dengue in Asian nations, it is imperative that we concentrate our efforts and resources on providing more precise and effective treatment for this emerging issue.",

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes, has become a substantial public health issue in Bangladesh. The high population density and subtropical-tropical climate of the nation create conducive environments for the transmission of the virus. The recent increase in dengue cases in Bangladesh prompts an inquiry into the potential for the virus to progress into an epidemic manifestation. Bangladesh is prone to dengue outbreaks due to a multitude of contributing factors. To commence, the virus is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, and climate change is contributing to the expansion of its range. Additionally, the high population density in Bangladesh amplifies the vulnerability to dengue transmission. Intimate human proximity elevates the probability of contracting mosquito stings and transmitting viruses. The escalating incidence of dengue in Bangladesh is substantiated by the growing count of documented cases. The emergence of severe dengue is a contributing aspect that raises concerns about the potential worldwide consequences of the disease. It could potentially head from Bangladesh to neighboring nations via an infected individual. There exist apprehensions due to the substantial employment of Bangladeshi laborers overseas, compounded by the presence of foreign laborers within Bangladesh. The endeavor to control dengue in Bangladesh continues to face ongoing challenges. This review addresses the complexities of dengue transmission, assesses Bangladesh's readiness for managing epidemics, analyzes risk factors associated with dengue, and suggests preventive measures to mitigate the possibility of worldwide consequences of dengue originating within the nation.",

We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2Â·5th and 97Â·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7Â·3 million [95% UI 6Â·6-7Â·8] deaths; 10Â·7% [9Â·8-11Â·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160Â·5 million [147Â·8-171Â·6] DALYs; 5Â·6% [5Â·0-6Â·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93Â·8 million (89Â·0-99Â·3) prevalent and 11Â·9 million (10Â·7-13Â·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65Â·3% (62Â·4-67Â·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28Â·8% (28Â·3-28Â·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5Â·8% (5Â·7-6Â·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88Â·2% [53Â·4-117Â·7]), high ambient temperature (72Â·4% [51Â·1 to 179Â·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32Â·1% [26Â·7-38Â·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23Â·4% [12Â·7-35Â·7]), low physical activity (11Â·3% [1Â·8-34Â·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6Â·7% [2Â·5-11Â·6]), lead exposure (6Â·5% [4Â·5-11Â·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5Â·3% [0Â·5-10Â·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

        "title": "Spatio-temporal patterns of dengue in Bangladesh during 2019 to 2023: Implications for targeted control strategies.",
        "abstract": "Dengue, a viral infection transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, presents a substantial global public health concern, particularly in tropical regions. In Bangladesh, where dengue prevalence is noteworthy, accurately mapping the distribution of high-risk and low-risk areas and comprehending the clustering of dengue cases throughout the year is essential for the development of effective risk-based prevention and control strategies. Our objective was to identify dengue hotspots and temporal patterns over the years across Bangladesh in the years 2019-2023 excluding year 2020. A sequential spatial analysis was employed for each year to identify high-risk areas for dengue cases. Choropleth graphs were used to visualize the geographic distribution of dengue incidence rates per million population across the areas. Monthly distribution analysis was performed to identify temporal trends over the year 2022 and 2023. Additionally, the global Moran's I test was used to assess the overall geographical pattern. Subsequently, Anselin local Moran's I test was employed to identified clustering and hotspots of dengue incidences. Dengue cases in Bangladesh exhibited a significant increase from 2019 to 2023 (excluding 2020 data), with a cumulative total of 513,344 reported cases. Dhaka city initially bore substantial burden, accounting for over half (51%) of the 101,354 cases in 2019. The case fatality rate also demonstrated a steadily rise, reaching 0.5% in 2023 with 321,179 cases (a five-fold increase compare to 2022). Interestingly, the proportion of cases in Dhaka city decreased from 51% in 2019 to 34% in 2023. Notably, the southeast and central regions of Bangladesh showed the highest dengue rates, persisting throughout the study period. Cases were concentrated in urban regions, with Dhaka exhibiting the highest caseload in most years, followed by Manikganj in 2023. A distinct temporal shift in dengue transmission was observed in 2023, when the peak incidence occurred three months earlier in July with complete geographic coverage (all the 64 districts) compared to the peak in October 2022 (covering 95%, 61 districts). Positive global autocorrelation analysis revealed spatial dependence, with more stable trends in 2023 compared to previous years. Several districts like, Bagerhat, Barisal, and Faridpur remained persistent hotspots or emerged as new hotspots in 2023. Conversely, districts like Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Nilphamari, Rangpur and Sylhet consistently exhibited low caseloads, categorized as dengue coldspots throughout most of the years. Jhalokati in 2019 and Gopalganj in 2022, both initially classified as low-incidence district surrounded by high-incidence districts, emerged as hotspots in 2023. This study sheds light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue transmission in Bangladesh, particularly by identifying hotspots and clustering patterns. These insights offer valuable information for designing and implementing targeted public health interventions and control strategies. Furthermore, the observed trends highlight the need for adaptable strategies to address the region's evolving nature of dengue transmission effectively.",

        "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019 has accumulated a series of point mutations and evolved into several variants of concern (VOCs), some of which are more transmissible and potentially more severe than the original strain. The most notable VOCs are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, which have spread to various parts of the world. This study conducted surveillance in Jashore, Bangladesh to identify the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 coinfected with dengue virus and their genomic effect on the emergence of VOCs. A hospital-based COVID-19 surveillance from June to August, 2021 identified 9 453 positive patients in the surveillance area. The study enrolled 572 randomly selected COVID-19-positive patients, of which 11 (2%) had dengue viral coinfection. Whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed and compared between coinfection positive and negative group. In addition, we extracted 185 genome sequences from GISAID to investigate the cross-correlation function between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and VOC; multiple ARIMAX(p,d,q) models were developed to estimate the average number of amino acid (aa) substitution among different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. The results of the study showed that the coinfection group had an average of 30.6 (Â±1.7) aa substitutions in SARS-CoV-2, whereas the dengue-negative COVID-19 group had that average of 25.6 (Â±1.8; <i>P</i>â<â.01). The coinfection group showed a significant difference of aa substitutions in open reading frame (ORF) and N-protein when compared to dengue-negative group (<i>P</i>â=â.03). Our ARIMAX models estimated that the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta required additional 9 to 12 aa substitutions than Alpha, Beta, or Gamma variant. The emergence of Omicron accumulated additional 19 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.74, 21.95) aa substitution than Delta. Increased number of point mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome identified from coinfected cases could be due to the compromised immune function of host and induced adaptability of pathogens during coinfections. As a result, new variants might be emerged when series of coinfection events occur during concurrent two epidemics.",

        "title": "Demographic-environmental effect on dengue outbreaks in 11 countries.",
        "abstract": "Dengue outbreaks are common in tropical or temperate countries, and climate change can exacerbate the problem by creating conditions conducive to the spread of mosquitoes and prolonging the transmission season. Warmer temperatures can allow mosquitoes to mature faster and increase their ability to spread disease. Additionally, changes in rainfall patterns can create more standing water, providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between environmental and demographic factors and the dissemination of dengue fever. The study will use yearly data from 2000 to 2021 from 11 countries highly affected by dengue, considering multiple factors such as dengue cases, temperatures, precipitation, and population to better understand the impact of these variables on dengue transmission. In this research, Poisson regression (PR) and negative binomial regression (NBR) models are used to model count data and estimate the effect of different predictor variables on the outcome. Also, histogram plots and pairwise correlation plots are used to provide an initial overview of the distribution and relationship between the variables. Moreover, Goodness-of-fit tests, t-test analysis, diagnostic plots, influence plots, and residual vs. leverage plots are used to check the assumptions and validity of the models and identify any outliers or influential observations that may be affecting the results. The findings indicate that mean temperature and log(Urban) had a positive impact on dengue infection rates, while maximum temperature, log(Precipitation), and population density had a negative impact. However, minimum temperature, log(Rural), and log(Total population) did not demonstrate any significant effects on the incidence of dengue. The impact of demographic-environmental factors on dengue outbreaks in 11 Asian countries is illuminated by this study. The results highlight the significance of mean temperature (Tmean), maximum temperature (Tmax), log(Urban), log(Precipitation), and population density in influencing dengue incidence rates. However, further research is needed to gain a better understanding of the role of additional variables, such as immunity levels, awareness, and vector control measures, in the spread of dengue.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most significant mosquito-borne diseases in Nepal. In 2023, DENV outbreaks began in Eastern Nepal, near the border with India, and rapidly spread nationwide. The study aims to describe the outbreak's epidemiological pattern, laboratory characteristics, DENV serotypes, and genotypes. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in four hospitals in Jhapa, Eastern Nepal, in 2023. Acute serum samples were obtained from dengue suspected patients within 7 days of illness and subjected to virus isolation, conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and phylogenetic analysis. Out of 60 samples, 42 (70 %), 11 (18.3 %) and 7 (11.7 %) were primary, secondary and non-dengue infection, respectively. Among 53 dengue confirmed patients, 46 (86.7 %) were positive for NS1 and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for both NS1 and IgM. Out of 42 dengue isolates, a new clade of the cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2 was the most prevalent (28, 66.7 %), followed by genotype III of DENV-3 (11, 26.2 %) and genotype V of DENV-1 (3, 7.1 %). Genotype III of DENV-3 was first introduced in 2022-2023 in Nepal. Phylogenetic analysis of the E gene revealed the DENV-2 isolates from Nepal had 98 % homologous nucleotide similarity with the strains from India and Bangladesh. To our knowledge, this is the first report of circulating serotypes and genotypes of DENV in Jhapa. Integrating molecular findings into the dengue control plan can enhance surveillance efforts, monitor disease trends, and implement proactive measures to reduce the burden of dengue and prevent fatalities in future outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is an important vector-borne disease occurring globally. Dengue virus (DENV) infection can result in a potentially life-threatening disease. To date, no DENV-specific antiviral treatment is available. Moreover, an equally effective pan-serotype dengue virus vaccine is not available. Recently, two DENV vaccines, Dengvaxia and Qdenga, were licensed for limited use. However, none of them have been approved in Bangladesh. DENV is transmitted by <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes, and global warming caused by climate change favoring <i>Aedes</i> breeding plays an important role in increasing DENV infections in Bangladesh. Dengue is a serious public health concern in Bangladesh. In the year 2023, Bangladesh witnessed its largest dengue outbreak, with the highest number of dengue cases (<i>n</i>â=â321,179) and dengue-related deaths (<i>n</i>â=â1,705) in a single epidemic year. There is an increased risk of severe dengue in individuals with preexisting DENV-specific immunoglobulin G if the individuals become infected with different DENV serotypes. To date, vector control has remained the mainstay for controlling dengue; therefore, an immediate, strengthened, and effective vector control program is critical and should be regularly performed for controlling dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. In addition, the use of DENV vaccine in curbing dengue epidemics in Bangladesh requires more consideration and judgment by the respective authority of Bangladesh. This review provides perspectives on the control and prevention of dengue outbreaks. We also discuss the challenges of DENV vaccine use to reduce dengue epidemics infection in Bangladesh.",

We retrospectively analyzed dengue fever cases reported by national health surveillance systems, focusing on incidence, geographical spread, and fatalities. Statistical methods were used to explore correlations between population density, healthcare capacity, and disease prevalence. Our study revealed that in 2023, dengue cases and deaths surged five-fold (from 62,382 to 320,835) and nearly six-fold (from 281 to 1699) compared with 2022. Major cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong emerged as epicenters with significantly higher caseloads and mortality rates. The analysis identified a strong positive correlation between population density and disease prevalence, suggesting urbanization as a contributing factor. In addition, a shift in the peak dengue season from August to September was observed. Furthermore, disparities in health care infrastructure were identified, with densely populated areas experiencing critical shortages of hospital beds, potentially impacting fatality rates. This unprecedented dengue outbreak in Bangladesh highlights the need for a multifaceted approach. Prioritizing vector control, targeted public awareness in identified hotspots, addressing healthcare resource inequities, and further research on environmental and demographic determinants of transmission are crucial for mitigating future outbreaks in Bangladesh.",

Bangladesh has a noticeable rise in VBDs attributed to climate change. Despite the severity of this issue, the interconnections between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this research gap, our review meticulously examined existing literature on the relationship between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, we identified 3849 records from SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Ultimately, 22 research articles meeting specific criteria were included. We identified that the literature on the subject matter of this study is non-contemporaneous, with 68% of studies investing datasets before 2014, despite studies on climate change and dengue nexus having increased recently. We pinpointed Dhaka and Chittagong Hill Tracts as the dengue and malaria research hotspots, respectively. We highlighted that the 2023 dengue outbreak illustrates a possible shift in dengue-endemic areas in Bangladesh. Moreover, dengue cases surged by 317% in 2023 compared to 2019 records, with a corresponding 607% increase in mortality compared to 2022. A weak connection was observed between dengue incidents and climate drivers, including the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). However, no compelling evidence supported an association between malaria cases, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Bay of Bengal, along with the NINO3 phenomenon. We observed minimal microclimatic and non-climatic data inclusion in selected studies. Our review holds implications for policymakers, urging the prioritization of mitigation measures such as year-round surveillance and early warning systems.

Dengue fever remains a significant public health challenge in Southeast Asia, with complex epidemiological patterns. Previous research has mainly focused on den serotypes in Dhaka. Therefore, this study aims to identify serotypes in the Rajshahi district under endemic conditions. Blood samples from suspected dengue patients were collected at Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. Initial rapid detection of dengue-positive cases was performed using (Nonstructural Protein 1Â L) NS1, (Immunoglobulin G) IgG, and (Immunoglobulin M) IgM tests. Upon confirmation of dengue positivity, viral RNA was extracted for molecular testing. The dengue serotype was identified using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The study revealed that 93.3Â % of the patient were infected with (Dengue virus type 2) DENV2 and rest 6.7Â % of the patient were (Dengue virus type 3) DENV3 among 30 dengue positive patients. Demographic observations show the distribution of dengue over nine upazilas. In Paba upazila, we found two DENV3 alongside DENV2. The study concludes that the 2023 dengue outbreak in Rajshahi district, Bangladesh, predominantly involved the DENV2 serotype.

Coinfection with these pathogens presents significant diagnostic challenges for clinicians due to overlapping clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. This case report aims to elucidate two clinical scenarios where the coinfection of dengue and leptospirosis complicates the disease course, creating a diagnostic conundrum. We present the clinical scenarios of two Bangladeshi males, aged 25 and 35Â years, who were admitted to our hospital with acute febrile illness. The first patient exhibited hepatic and renal involvement, while the second presented with symptoms initially suggestive of meningoencephalitis. Both cases were initially managed under the presumption of dengue infection based on positive serology. However, further evaluation revealed coinfection with Leptospira, complicating the disease course. Both patients received appropriate treatment for dengue and antibacterial therapy for leptospirosis, ultimately resulting in their recovery. These case scenarios underscore the critical importance for clinicians in regions where dengue and Leptospira are endemic to consider both diseases when evaluating patients presenting with acute febrile illness.",

In this study, we have critically analyzed the factors contributing to the escalation of the dengue burden in recent years in Bangladesh and discussed the strategies for effective control. This retrospective observational study analyzed the dengue data collected from the five most dengue-affected countries (Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and the Philippines) from 2019 to 2023. An increased number of dengue-related deaths has been recorded in Bangladesh since 2021. The year 2023 has witnessed a record high dengue-related deaths in Bangladesh, with cumulative deaths for the year surpassing all totals of the previous 23 years (2000-2022: 853 deaths vs 2023: 1705 deaths). Comparing the epidemiologic data of major dengue-endemic countries over the last 5 years, Bangladesh recorded higher dengue fatality rates consecutively for 3 years. Besides the environmental and viral host factors, which are also applicable to many other dengue-endemic countries, there is concern about the failures and mismanagement of authorities to manage dengue patients properly. This study provided evidence that Bangladesh recorded higher dengue fatality rates in recent years. By implementing multi-pronged proactive approaches that can ensure proper prevention programs and appropriate patient management, Bangladesh or similar other countries can significantly reduce the current dengue burden and the associated deaths.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue. Although most infected individuals are asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms, severe manifestations could potentially devastate human populations in tropical and subtropical regions. In hyperendemic regions such as South Asia and Southeast Asia (SEA), all four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) have been prevalent for several decades. Each DENV serotype is further divided into multiple genotypes, reflecting the extensive diversity of DENV. Historically, specific DENV genotypes were associated with particular geographical distributions within endemic regions. However, this epidemiological pattern has changed due to urbanization, globalization, and climate change. This review comprehensively traces the historical and recent genetic epidemiology of DENV in Asia from the first time DENV was identified in the 1950s to the present. We analyzed envelope sequences from a database covering 16 endemic countries across three distinct geographic regions in Asia. These countries included Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka from South Asia; Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam from Mainland SEA; and Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore from Maritime SEA. Additionally, we describe the phylogenetic relationships among DENV genotypes within each serotype, along with their geographic distribution, to enhance the understanding of DENV dynamics.",

A total of 1,705 people died in Bangladesh, representing the highest case fatality rate (0.5%) due to dengue in the world for that year. The severity of dengue infection is to some extent related to the emergence of new circulating serotypes. To identify the possible predominant serotype in 2023, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-based identification technique was used on stored serum samples of suspected dengue patients during the period between July and December 2023. The overall result of molecular serotyping showed that dengue virus (DENV-2) reappeared as the predominant serotype (74.1%), followed by a moderate number of samples with DENV-1 (19.8%) and DENV-3 (6.1%), in 2023. However, DENV-1 was found to be dominant in a few rural areas of Cox's Bazar districts. During the 2019 outbreak, DENV-3 was the dominant serotype, which seemed to be replaced by the DENV-2 serotype; this may have impacted the increased case fatality in 2023.",

        "abstract": "Traditional medicine (TM) interventions are plausible therapeutic alternatives to conventional medical interventions against emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases, particularly in low-and middle-income countries that may lack resources and infrastructure. Despite the growing popularity in the usage of TM interventions, their clinical safety and effectiveness are still contested within conventional healthcare in many countries. We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature that synthesises and maps the evidence on TM interventions for the treatment and prevention of zoonoses on the Indian subcontinent. The region, a global hotspot of biodiversity and emerging infections, is characterised by high prevalence of TM use. Based on the scientific literature (mostly case study research, n=l06 studies), our review (1) maps the scope of the literature, (2) synthesises the evidence on the application of TM interventions for zoonoses, and (3) critically reflects on the state of TM and identifies areas for future research focus. The evidence synthesis confirmed widespread usage of TM interventions for zoonoses on the subcontinent, with the majority of research reported from India (n=99 studies, 93.4%), followed by Pakistan (n=3 studies, 2.8%), Bangladesh (n=2 studies, 1.9%), and Sri Lanka (n=1, 0.9%). Most of the reviewed studies reported on ethno-medicinal uses of plant species, primarily for treating dengue (n=20 studies), tuberculosis (n=18 studies), Escherichia coli infection (n=16 studies), lymphatic filariasis and cholera (n=9 apiece). However, the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these reported TM interventions is limited, indicating that these data are rarely collected and/or shared within the peer-reviewed literature. This review thus highlights that, whilst TMs are already being used and could offer more widely accessible interventions against emerging and endemic zoonoses and ectoparasites, there is an urgent need for rigorous clinical testing and validation of the safety and effectiveness of these interventions.",

We conducted a nationally representative seroprevalence survey in 70 randomly selected communities immediately before the epidemic. We found that 69 of 2938 sampled individuals (2.4%) were seropositive to CHIKV. Seropositivity to dengue virus (adjusted odds ratio, 3.13 [95% confidence interval, 1.86-5.27]), male sex (0.59 [.36-.99]), and community presence of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1.80 [1.05-3.0]7) were significantly associated with CHIKV seropositivity. Using a spatial prediction model, we estimated that across the country, 4.99 (95% confidence interval, 4.89-5.08) million people had been previously infected.

        "abstract": "Climate change affects the transmission of vector-borne diseases like dengue, posing a substantial public health threat. Bangladesh, with its favorable conditions for Dengue transmission, has experienced periodic outbreaks. This study explores the relationship between climate change knowledge, perceptions of the Dengue-climate link, and the associated factors among Bangladeshi youth. In the Dhaka district of Bangladesh, a cross-sectional study was conducted between September and October 2023, involving face-to-face interviews with 1,358 participants. Convenient (non-probability) sampling was utilized for participant selection. Data collection involved the administration of a semi-structured questionnaire encompassing informed consent, socio-demographic information, and inquiries pertaining to climate change-related knowledge (13 items) and perception (11 items). Data analysis utilized STATA (Version 15.0) and SPSS (Version 26.0). The mean scores for knowledge and perceptions were determined to be 7.10âÂ±â3.20 (out of 13) and 26.60âÂ±â4.12 (out of 33) respectively. Participants had a mean age of 22.02âÂ±â1.58âyears. The study revealed that unmarried status, living in a nuclear family, being a non-smoker, good self-perception of physical health, regular sleep patterns, moderate social media usage, older age, unemployment, and daily media consumption are factors associated with higher knowledge and perception regarding the Dengue-climate change link. Moreover, a positive association was observed between knowledge of climate change and favorable attitudes toward the Dengue-climate connection. This study underscores the importance of tailored climate change education for youth in Bangladesh and highlights key variables influencing their knowledge and perceptions. Notably, there exists a positive association between climate change knowledge and favorable attitudes toward the Dengue-climate connection. These insights underscore the importance of targeted educational campaigns and policy interventions aimed at enhancing climate consciousness among the youth population, thereby fostering proactive measures to mitigate the impact of Dengue fever in the context of climate change.",

A study was conducted to identify the contribution of bamboo stumps to these disease vectors that were used in the flower garden as pillars to hold the bamboo flex fence. Two sizes of whole bamboo were used to hold fences around gardens at Dhaka University, Bangladesh, and were painted red and green. Mosquito larvae and pupae were collected from bamboo stumps between July and August, and vectors were identified up to the species level. The data were analyzed using the STATA/MP 14.2 version. 83.5% and 0.2% were Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti, respectively, and the remaining were Culex and Ar-migeres species. Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and both species-positive bamboo stumps were 46.9, 0.7, and 47.1%, respectively. 54.5% of the bamboo stumps had at least one mosquito species. The average stump depth for Aedes positive stumps (mean=11.7 cm, SE = 0.5) was significantly (p <0.001) higher than the Aedes negative stumps (mean = 9.5 cm, SE = 0.4). 53.8% and 38.0% stumps were found Aedes positive on the ground and upper sides of fences, respectively, and found significant (p<0.01) differences between both sides. A zero-inflated negative binomial count model is significant at a 5% level of significance, Ï2(4) = 11.8, p = 0.019 (<0.05) for Ae. albopictus.

For different amplitudes (A) within a sequence of values (AÂ =Â 0.1 to 0.5), the highest number of infected mosquitoes occurs in July. However, simulations project that when Î²<sub>M</sub>Â =Â 0.5 and AÂ =Â 0.1, the peak of human infections occurs in late September. Not only the next-generation matrix approach along with the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are observed, but also a cutting-edge Machine learning (ML) approach such as the Prophet model is explored for forecasting future Dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. Remarkably, we have fitted our solution curve of infection with the reported data by the government of Bangladesh. We can predict the outcome of 2024 based on the ML Prophet model situation of Dengue will be detrimental and proliferate 25Â % compared to 2023.

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, poses a significant public health challenge in Pakistan, with a significant outbreak in 2023, prompting our investigation into the serotype and genomic diversity of the dengue virus (DENV). NS-1 positive blood samples from 153 patients were referred to the National Institute of Health, Pakistan, between JulyÂ and October 2023. Among these, 98 (64.1%) tested positive using multiplex real-time PCR, with higher prevalence among males (65.8%) and individuals aged 31-40. Serotyping revealed DENV-1 as the predominant serotype (84.7%), followed by DENV-2 (15.3%). Whole-genome sequencing of 18 samples (DENV-1â=â17, DENV-2â=â01) showed that DENV-1 (genotype III) samples were closely related (>99%) to Pakistan outbreak samples (2022), and approx.â>â98% with USA (2022), Singapore and China (2016), Bangladesh (2017), and Pakistan (2019).

No coinfection with dengue serotypes or other viruses were observed. Comparisons with previous DENV-1 sequences highlighted genetic variations affecting viral replication efficiency (NS2B:K55R) and infectivity (E:M272T).

        "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is an endemic disease that has become a public health concern around the globe. The NS3 protease-helicase enzyme is an important target for the development of antiviral drugs against DENV (dengue virus) due to its impact on viral replication. Inhibition of the activity of the NS3 protease-helicase enzyme complex significantly inhibits the infection associated with DENV. Unfortunately, there are no scientifically approved antiviral drugs for its prevention. However, this study has been developed to find natural bioactive molecules that can block the activity of the NS3 protease-helicase enzyme complex associated with DENV infection through molecular docking, MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics-generalized born surface area), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Three hundred forty-two (342) compounds selected from twenty traditional medicinal plants were retrieved and screened against the NS3 protease-helicase protein by molecular docking and MM-GBSA studies, where the top six phytochemicals have been identified based on binding affinities. The six compounds were then subjected to pharmacokinetics and toxicity analysis, and we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on three protein-ligand complexes to validate their stability. Through computational analysis, this study revealed the potential of the two selected natural bioactive inhibitors (CID-440015 and CID-7424) as novel anti-dengue agents.",

        "abstract": "Epidemics of the dengue virus can trigger widespread morbidity and mortality along with no specific treatment. Examining the spatial autocorrelation and variability of dengue prevalence throughout Bangladesh's 64 districts was the focus of this study. The spatial autocorrelation is evaluated with the help of Moran <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mrow></math> and Geary <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow></mrow></math>. Local Moran <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mrow></math> was used to detect hotspots and cold spots, whereas local Getis Ord <i>G</i> was used to identify only spatial hotspots. The spatial heterogeneity has been detected using various conventional and spatial models, including the Poisson-Gamma model, the Poisson-Lognormal Model, the Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model, the Convolution model, and the BYM2 model, respectively. These models are implemented using Gibbs sampling and other Bayesian hierarchical approaches to analyze the posterior distribution effectively, enabling inference within a Bayesian context. The study's findings show that Moran <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><mi>I</mi></mrow></mrow></math>and Geary <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow></mrow></math>analysis provides a substantial clustering pattern of positive spatial autocorrelation of dengue fever (DF) rates between surrounding districts at a 90% confidence interval. The Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation cluster mapped spatial clusters and outliers based on prevalence rates, while the local Getis-Ord <i>G</i> displayed a thorough breakdown of high or low rates, omitting outliers. Although Chattogram had the most dengue cases (15,752), Khulna district had a higher prevalence rate (133.636) than Chattogram (104.796). The BYM2 model, determined to be well-fitted based on the lowest Deviance Information Criterion value (527.340), explains a significant association between spatial heterogeneity and prevalence rates. This research pinpoints the district with the highest prevalence rate for dengue and the neighboring districts that also have high risk, allowing government agencies and communities to take the necessary precautions to mollify the risk effect of DF.",

        "abstract": "Dengue and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection is commonly encountered and constantly reported in particularly the dengue-endemic regions thus posing a co-epidemic threat. Coinfection is also significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. Comorbidity risk during a coinfection is of a greater concern. Although the pathophysiologies of the two infections vary, their identical clinical symptoms during coinfection result in diagnostic and therapeutic complexities. A literature search for the current relevant reports was carried out. The searched databases were Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar and the Web of Science, with health agencies like the WHO. Based on the selection criteria, the most recent and pertinent reports published in English language were included for the ease of understanding, deciphering and analysing the secondary data. A delay in proper diagnosis of coinfection could result in serious complications with poor patient outcome. Whether it is a standalone dengue or COVID-19 infection or a coinfection, specific biomarkers may be utilized for its foolproof diagnosis. This article highlights the various diagnostic techniques and immune responses from the perspective of prompt and appropriate public health management for patients suffering from COVID-19 and dengue viral coinfections, both being independently or collectively capable of damaging a human body. As coinfection poses significantly large burden on an already-fragile healthcare facility, constant monitoring of a coinfected patient is needed for prompt and suitable therapeutics. Also, to maintain high vigilance and invoke appropriate preventive measures particularly in dengue endemic regions, the government, healthcare authority and the general public need to collaborate and cooperate.",
