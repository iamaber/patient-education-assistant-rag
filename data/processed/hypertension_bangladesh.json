        "abstract": "Tart cherry (TC; <i>Prunus cerasus</i>) has high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potentials due to its rich bioactive components like anthocyanins, polyphenols, vitamins, beta-carotene, ellagic acid, and chlorogenic acid. Oxidative damage and inflammation are underlying reasons to chronic disease pathogenesis. Oxidative stress usually caused by the imbalance between antioxidants and pro-oxidants. Additionally, a chronic inflammatory state is typically modulated by oxidative stress. Inflammation plays a critical role in chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, insulin resistance, arthritis and cancer. Numerous studies indicate that there is a strong relationship between TC and the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative damage by regulating different epigenetic and metabolic pathways. In this review, the recent developments of TC components and their metabolites on inflammatory and oxidative damages will be discussed, and the challenges and limitations to better support future research, including clinical trials to confirm these findings.",

        "title": "Towards the Integration of an Anti-Contractile Compound Within Drug-Coated Balloon Therapy.",
        "abstract": "Drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy is a promising approach to treat peripheral artery disease (PAD), wherein lesion site preparation, balloon inflation, and the local delivery of anti-proliferative drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX) restores and retains lumen patency. Although largely successful in PAD applications, broader clinical deployment is in part limited by the occurrence of late lumen loss due to inward vessel remodeling at the treatment site, a maladaptive chronic response that has been clinically-observed to coincide with elevations in resident vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC) tone. This study aims to explore a novel strategy to improve DCB efficacy via drug-based attenuation of vSMC tone at the treatment site. As a strategy to mitigate this post-DCB failure mode, we consider the local co-delivery of PTX and an additional drug that induces relaxation of vSMCs, specifically the clinically-approved anti-hypertensive drug valsartan (VAL). The potential benefit of drug-based regulation of vSMC tone is supported by recent theoretical studies that predict inward remodeling in the presence of hypertension and endothelial cell dysfunction, both common co-morbidities in PAD patients and established causes of elevated vSMC contractility. The specific selection of VAL as the anti-contractile payload constituent is motivated by its well-known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and the notion that current clinical use and familiarity could promote rapid translation in the context of DCBs. Our obtained results quantify the potency of VAL to induce local vSMC relaxation in arterial tissue, demonstrate the feasibility of PTX and VAL co-delivery using the canonical excipient urea for balloon coating formation, and elucidate key structure-function relations to facilitate efficient drug delivery with these novel coatings. Our study supports the continued evaluation of VAL for inclusion in DCB formulations due to its potential to redirect post-treatment arterial remodeling. Future in-vivo studies which examine the co-delivery of PTX and VAL in the context of DCBs are needed to establish both the safety and efficacy of this novel approach.",

        "abstract": "The high burden of blood pressure-related cardiovascular diseases in Bangladesh is potentially caused by excessive dietary sodium and insufficient potassium intake. Our objective is to estimate dietary salt and potassium intake among Bangladesh rural and urban adults from urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. We conducted a cross-sectional study between December 2017 and June 2018, including participants aged 30-59 years from three urban and three rural sites in Bangladesh. Data included urinary excretion of sodium and potassium estimated from one 24-hr urine collection and blood pressure measurements. Among 840 enrolled participants, complete data was available in 509 individuals. Mean age was 43.0 (SD ±7.9) years; 20.9% had hypertension, 50.9% were women, and 50.9% resided in urban areas. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 118.6 (SD ± 16.6) mmHg and 76.3 (SD ± 11.3) mmHg, respectively. Overall, the mean urinary sodium excretion was 3.9 g/day (95% CI = 3.8 to 4.0), corresponding to a mean salt intake of 9.7 g/day (95% CI = 9.4-10.1). Mean urinary potassium excretion was 1.4 g/day (95% CI = 1.3-1.4), corresponding to an estimated mean dietary potassium intake of 2.0 g/day. Men and urban residents had slightly but non-significantly higher sodium and potassium excretion than women and rural residents. In Bangladesh, salt intake exceeded WHO's recommended <5g/day limit, while potassium intake was substantially lower than the recommended intake of ≥ 3.5g/day for adults. Promoting low-sodium and potassium-rich diets through nationwide campaigns and policies, including advocating for accessible low-sodium and potassium-enriched salt substitutes, is recommended to mitigate cardiovascular disease risks.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

In this multi-cohort study, we recruited adults aged 35 to 70 years from 21 countries. Data on health effects of tobacco smoking (10 questions) and health actions to prevent heart disease or stroke (11 questions) were collected at baseline. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship with the outcomes of smoking cessation and use of antihypertensive treatment adjusting for adjusting for possible confounders. Of the 12,962 included in the descriptive analysis, 50.0% were female, 42.9% had no or primary education, and 53.3 % were residing in low or lower middle-income country.

However, the relationship is largely understudied in developing countries like Bangladesh. The aim of the study was to determine the correlation between maternal medical conditions and subsequent language disorders in children experiencing fetal distress in context of Bangladesh. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between June, 2021 to June, 2022 at Z.H. Sikder Women's Medical College and Hospital, Bangladesh. Eighty children between 4 to 12 years with documented histories of antenatal or intrapartum fetal distress were recruited and assessed for language disorder by experienced clinicians using standardized diagnostic criteria. SPSS Version 12 was used for statistical analysis. The mean age of children was 6.54 ± 1.9 years, with 70% being male. Most children (70%) lived in rural areas with parents of low socioeconomic status. The reported maternal medical conditions included hypertensive disorders (40%), diabetes mellitus (30%), hypothyroidism (20%), and malnutrition (10%). Language disorders included delayed language acquisition (90%), receptive/perceptive disorders (60%), motor speech production impairments (60%), metalinguistic competence disorders (70%), cognitive linguistic disorders (80%), and pragmatic disorders (80%). Statistical analysis revealed significant associations (P < .05) between maternal medical conditions and all domains of language disorders. The results indicate significant relationship between maternal medical conditions, presence of fetal distress, and language disorders in children.

        "abstract": "This study assessed the association between various routes of tobacco use and hypertension while exploring the roles of confounders and effect modifiers among the adult rural people of Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a combination of open and closed-ended questionnaires. Data were collected from 496 adult rural patients during their doctor visits. All the data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 statistical software. Continuous variables were summarized as Means (M) and Standard Deviations (SD), and categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and proportions. Logistic regression model assessed associations with Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CIs). Among the 496 participants, 50.8% were female, with an average age of 49.5 ± 11.8 years (M ± SD). 19/496 (3.83%) of inhaled smoker participants had hypertension. 58/496 (11.69%) of the chewing tobacco users were discovered to be hypertensive. The combined use of both inhalation and chewing tobacco was associated with higher odds of hypertension (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.64-2.49), while inhalation tobacco was not (OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05-0.53). Betel leaf use was prevalent among chewing tobacco users but did not significantly modify the association with hypertension. Age was identified as an independent variable that did not confound or modify the association between tobacco use and hypertension. Together, inhalation and chewing of tobacco may increase hypertension risk, necessitating targeted public health interventions to curb its use among adult Bangladeshi rural populations. Nevertheless, we cannot establish temporality or causality from this study.",

        "abstract": "Climate change and health issues pose a global threat, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh. Within the socio-economic structure in coastal regions, women played a crucial role in contributing livelihood and living resources, while new climatic ecology creates chaotic relationships between environment and human health. The emerging adverse climatic ecology is directly and indirectly affecting them in the sphere of their both outdoor and indoor activism. This study explores the health impacts of climate change on the women of reproductive age (ages between 14 and 49 from the Bangladeshi perspective) living in coastal communities, i.e., Satkhira, Bangladesh. To choose study locations, this study conducted a literature survey to find out the most vulnerable coastal region of Bangladesh. The study has selected the five most vulnerable unions of Shyamnagar upazila in Satkhira district. This study adopted a multi-method approach combining in-depth interviews and KIIs. Based on this methodological guide, this study interviewed 25 women and 5 married men, while their responses have further been supplemented and validated by KIIs with health workers and medical officers. Findings show that climate change posture to new climatic ecology facilitating adverse situations that lead to the intrusion of saline water within communities, lack of fresh and drinkable water, women exposure to waterborne diseases resulting from both salinity and scarcity of fresh usable water, skin disorders, gynaecological and reproductive illnesses, and vector-borne diseases. Women also bear an encountered burden in their struggle to acquire water and good health, including limited hygiene facilities and maternal care. This dilemma is even worsened during the summer season, which exposes women to heat waves, resulting in physical complications such as anaemia, pregnancy risks, heat stroke, dehydration, hypertension and psychological complications like anxiety, stress and depression. Breaches in awareness and prevention practices were outlined from the study, as there is a need to realize integrated solutions to address the environmental and health challenges of the populations. Further, there is an absolute need to continue improving access to safe water, healthcare services, and education as a way to build resilience in affected communities.",

        "abstract": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of endocrine hypertension. Current screening uses the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) followed by confirmatory testing with one of several tests. The saline suppression test (SST) is widely used but contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure. The captopril challenge test (CCT) offers a safe, inexpensive and convenient alternative to the SST, but diagnostic thresholds and reported accuracy vary between centres. Furthermore, none of the previous comparative studies have been carried out in low- and middle-income countries, where the affordability of the CCT may offer distinct advantages. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the CCT compared to the SST in a Bangladeshi population. In this prospective study, consecutive hypertensive patients with an ARR >50 ​pmol/mIU underwent both the SST and CCT. Using the SST as the reference standard, where plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) post SST ≥170 ​pmol/L is considered diagnostic of PA, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of different diagnostic criteria for the CCT were calculated. A total of 103 patients completed both confirmatory tests. The diagnostic accuracy of the post-captopril PAC at both 1 ​h and 2 ​h outperformed post-captopril ARR or the percentage suppression of PAC (AUC 0.77, 0.70 and 0.56, respectively; p<0.001). PACs >333 ​pmol/L at 1 ​h and 2 ​h post administration of captopril demonstrated sensitivities of 54.5% and 44.4%, with specificities of 91.5% and 93.6%, respectively. A post-captopril PAC <151 ​pmol/L effectively ruled out PA with 96.4% sensitivity, while a PAC >380 ​pmol/L ruled in the diagnosis of PA with 95.7% specificity. Overall, our findings indicate that the CCT, based on post-captopril PAC, achieves comparable diagnostic accuracy to the seated SST. The diagnostic performance was similar at either 1 ​h or 2 ​h post administration of captopril, suggesting that 1 ​h may be preferred in a CCT protocol for efficiency. The CCT represents a safe and convenient confirmatory test to guide decisions on PA subtyping or medical treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.",

In Bangladesh, the Health Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program has shown effectiveness in resource-limited settings. Estimating causal relationships on hypertension while adjusting for nonlinear observed confounders in adult population is complex. This study aims to identify predictors of hypertension, and explore observational causal inference on hypertension. The hypertension data was analyzed using Bangladesh Demographic and Health surveys data from the 2011 and 2022. We used 11,815 individuals aged 34 years and above. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of > 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mm Hg and/or having a history of hypertension. We used logistic regression, Random forest model, Double Machine Learning (DML), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) based on a pre-defined causal structure. The dataset included 11,815 individuals, and the prevalence of hypertension was 38.40%. The average age of individuals was 52.76 years (SD: 12.97), and 6826 (58.77%) were male. The Random forest model achieved 93% accuracy, with evaluation f1-scores of 95% for non-hypertension and 91% for hypertension, and identified older age, female gender, urban residency, workers, wealthier, self-awareness, and excessive body weight as key predictors of hypertension. The individual conditional expectation and SHAP plots reveal that age, and body mass index (BMI) are nonlinear relation with hypertension. The crude OR between excessive body weight and hypertension was 2.24 (95%CI: 2.07 - 2.42). Adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and self-awareness, the OR was 1.97 (95%CI: 1.79 - 2.17), and using de-biased method, it was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17 - 1.43). The study highlights important predictors of hypertension, including age, sex, residency, and socioeconomic status (SES), self-awareness and body weight. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting hypertension. The de-biased methods provided a more refined risk estimate. Age and excessive body weight were found to significantly contributed to hypertension, demonstrating complex interactions and varying marginal effects across different levels of these factors. Awareness programs and targeted interventions are vital to effectively reduce excessive body weight and prevent hypertension.",

The comparative immunogenicity of homologous (same vaccine type) versus heterologous (different vaccine types) booster regimens remains understudied, particularly in diverse settings. This study assesses anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody responses to these regimens in Bangladesh. A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from March 2022 to February 2023. Seventy-three participants, selected via convenience sampling, were grouped into homologous (n=40) or heterologous (n=33) vaccine regimens based on primary and booster vaccine types. Anti-RBD IgG levels were measured pre-booster and three weeks post-booster using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant Reagent Kit (Abbott, Ireland). Demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, BMI, diabetes, and blood pressure) were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used, with p≤0.05 indicating significance. Participants (mean age: 35.51 years, 79.5% male) showed higher pre-booster (median: 4499.65 vs. 1863.7 AU/mL, p<0.001) and post-booster (median: 13835.15 vs. 10423.3 AU/mL, p=0.014) anti-RBD IgG levels in the homologous group compared to the heterologous group. However, the heterologous group exhibited a greater fold increase (median: 4.6 vs. 3.65, p=0.024) of anti-RBD IgG levels. A higher proportion of participants in the homologous regimen achieved high post-booster IgG levels (>20,000 AU/mL, p=0.016). Diabetes significantly reduced antibody responses in the heterologous group (p=0.006). Hypertensive participants had significantly reduced antibody responses before (p=0.005) and after (p=0.001) the booster in the heterologous group and after (p=0.033) the booster in the homologous group. Age, sex, and BMI had no significant effect on the results. Homologous regimens yield higher anti-RBD IgG levels, while heterologous regimens produce greater fold increases of anti-RBD IgG levels, indicating robust recall. Diabetes and hypertension impair responses, particularly in heterologous regimens. These findings support the need for tailored vaccination strategies to enhance immune protection.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) is an uncommon extra-articular manifestation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) that typically affects patients with a more aggressive form of the disease. The diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis is suggested based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and confirmed through biopsy. We describe the case of a 28-year-old man who initially presented with myalgia and weakness in all four limbs. Subsequently, he developed hypertension and testicular tenderness. Neurological examination revealed painful sensory-motor neuropathy involving the bilateral median and ulnar nerves, as well as the right tibial and left common peroneal nerves- findings consistent with mononeuritis multiplex. Laboratory investigations showed a high titer of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1 gm daily for 3 days), followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg body weight) and six pulses of intravenous cyclophosphamide. This was later transitioned to maintenance therapy with azathioprine. The patient showed dramatic clinical improvement, and at one-and-a-half-year follow-up, he remained reasonably well. This case highlights that mononeuritis multiplex due to rheumatoid vasculitis can be the initial presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis in similar clinical scenarios, and prompt immunosuppressive treatment should be initiated to prevent further complications.",

Alhough the pathophysiology of CAKUT is still not completely understood, several maternal risk factors have been identified associated with children with CAKUT so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the proportion of risk factors of mothers gave birth to the infants with CAKUT. This cross-sectional study was conducted over a six-month period in the Departments of Pediatrics, Pediatric Nephrology, Neonatology and Pediatric Urology in Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Bangladesh from May 2018 to November 2018. A total of 200 infants aged ≤60 days and with a confirmed diagnosis of CAKUT were included in this study. Informed ascend was taken from the parents of the child. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0. This research was undertaken in conjunction with the ethical principles of Declaration of Helsinki. The mean age of the infants with CAKUT was 22.25±15.08 (SD) days with a male to female ratio of 1:1. The presenting anomalies were primary vesico-ureteral reflux (38.0%), pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (20.0%), agenesis of the kidney (16.0%), posterior urethral valve (12.0%), dysplasia of the kidney (10.0%) and multicystic dysplastic kidney (3.5%). The most common pregestational risk factors were overweight (76.0%), diabetes mellitus (32.5%) and hypertension (29.5%) among the mothers. On the other hand, oligohydramnios (87.5%), gestational diabetes mellitus (67.0%) and gestational hypertension (45.5%) were the most frequently identified gestational risk factors. Pregestational overweight in women, maternal diabetes and oligohydramnios were most commonly identified risk factors among the mothers of CAKUT infant.",

The progression of Carotid Intima Media Thickness (CIMT) has been established as a strong predictor of future vascular events recently. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between CIMT and acute ischemic stroke. This cross sectional comparative study was conducted in the Department of Neurology and Medicine, at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from January 2019 to September 2020. Total 120 patients (60 cases of acute ischemic stroke and 60 age and sex matched apparently healthy controls) were included in the study. Participants were studied for the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors and CIMT by high resolution ultrasonography. Mean age of the patients with acute ischemic stroke was 62.85±9.30 years and 70.0% were male. No significant difference was noted between cases and controls in terms of age, sex, occupation, education and socioeconomic class. The mean right CIMT in the patient group was 0.94±0.24mm and it was 0.66±0.19mm in the control group (p<0.001). The mean left CIMT in the patient group was 0.97±0.30mm and it was 0.63±0.18mm in the control group (p<0.001). The average CIMT in the patient group was 0.96±0.23mm and it was 0.65±0.17mm in the control group (p<0.001). CIMT was found to be higher among acute ischemic stroke patients who were smoker and hypertensive than that of nonsmoker and normotensive stroke patients. On multivariate analysis, CIMT remained associated with ischemic stroke as compared to other variables {OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.57-13.05), p<0.01}. CIMT measurements are independent markers of acute ischemic stroke.",

It has an enormous impact on mothers, families, health care professionals and the community. Bangladesh has high stillbirth rate due to lack of access to antenatal care, home trial, high parity, social norms and customs etc. Multiple maternal and fetal risk factors have been identified that are associated with stillbirth. This study is intended to provide information for proper antepartum surveillance and also build up awareness in the community to prevent perinatal mortality. Objective of this study was evaluation of risk factors associated with stillbirth. This was cross-sectional observational study conducted from 10th February 2019 to 10th August 2019. Consecutive 100 pregnant women admitted in Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of MMCH and had delivered stillbirth baby were included in the study. Data was collected through a pre-designed questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS Version 26.0. In this study, 76.0% women were found between 20 to 30 years of age. Most of the women studied were gravida second and third (72.0%). Most stillbirth baby were preterm with gestational age between 35 to 36 weeks (60.0%). Maternal hypertensive disorder was the commonest medical disorder associated with stillbirth (34.0%), followed by DM (6.0%). Obstetric complications associated with stillbirth were PROM (12.0%), prolonged labour (8.0%), obstructed labour (5.0%), abruptio placentae (6.0%), placenta praevia (2.0%) and cord accident (6.0%). Fetal factor accounted for 8.0% of stillbirth of which majority was due to multiple congenital anomalies (6.0%). Apparently no identifiable risk factors were found in 8.0% cases. It was observed that maternal hypertensive disorders were the predominant risk factors of stillbirth. Majority of women had emergency admission and did not receive adequate antenatal care at all. Significant proportion of stillbirth was preventable by proper and regular antenatal checkup, timely referral and hospital delivery.",

Postpartum eclampsia is one of the deadliest complications which may drag a mother up to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Limited resource of critical care must be used for those patients who are most likely to get benefit. Timely recognition and treatment of the critically ill patient may improve the outcome and reduce morbidity and mortality. To find out the clinical characteristics and outcome of Postpartum eclampsia patients admitted to the intensive care unit of tertiary level hospital. It is a cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study conducted in the ICU of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), over a period of one year from July 2019 to June 2020. All women admitted to ICU during this period were considered for inclusion and 65 patients with diagnosis of postpartum eclampsia were selected. For each eligible patient, sociodemographic profile, indication of ICU admission, Data of ICU interventions and maternal outcome was then classified, edited, coded and entered into computer for statistical analysis by using SPSS V22.0 and presented in graph, pie chart and tabulated form. Out of 65 patients highest 25(38.46%) belonged to the age group (21-25) years and majority 52(80.0%) of patients from rural area. Most of the patients were primiparous 35(53.84%) among them 19(29.23%) patients were unbooked.

This study aims to identify the risk factors for hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia based on the recent STEPS survey in Bangladesh. Secondary cross-sectional study. This study analyze the publicly available \"National STEPS Survey for Non-communicable Diseases Risk Factors in Bangladesh 2018\" dataset. The sample size was 6875, after cleaning the three phases of dataset. Frequency distribution, Spatial distribution, Chi-square test, and Logistic regression models were employed in data analysis. The nationwide prevalence of NCDs revealed 27.3 % for hypertension, 9.8 % for diabetes, and 30.2 % for hypercholesterolemia. The NCDs prevalence significantly varied across divisions in Bangladesh, with Barisal having the highest hypertension (25 %) and Sylhet the lowest (18.1 %). Chittagong led in diabetes prevalence (12.0 %), while Rangpur had the lowest (4.8 %). For hypercholesterolemia, Barisal topped (34.9 %), and Mymensingh had the lowest (20.9 %). The significant risk factors of NCDs included age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category. Older age and obesity notably increased significantly (p < 0.05) the odds of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, while urban residence increased the odds of diabetes. Several factors, mostly age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category are responsible for higher prevalence of NCD diseases.

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to be the leading cause of death globally, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Traditional risk factors alone fail to explain the individual variability in disease susceptibility and progression. Recent advances in genomics and epigenomics have revealed key molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiovascular function, highlighting the importance of gene network dynamics and epigenetic regulation. This review systematically analyzes peer-reviewed literature from the past decade sourced from electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. It compiles the multifaceted roles of DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNAs in regulating cardiovascular gene expression, cellular phenotypes, and disease pathogenesis. DNA methylation influences the transcriptional activity of gene expression associated with atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and hypertension, while histone modifications and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling regulate cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and regeneration. Noncoding RNAs further act as critical regulators of angiogenesis, inflammation, and myocardial remodeling. Therapeutically, these findings have facilitated the development of epigenetic drugs and gene-editing technologies targeting specific molecular pathways involved in CVD progression. Emerging technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9, RNA-based therapies, and small-molecule inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes hold potential for correct abnormal gene expression patterns. Moreover, integrative multi-omics and systems biology approaches are advancing personalized treatment strategies, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of cardiovascular interventions. Collectively, unraveling the complex molecular interactions among gene networks, epigenetic alterations, and targeted therapeutic mapping aims to combat CVD with better precision and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, hypertension is more prevalent among men aged 30 and older, but a national survey from Bangladesh shows a different trend. This paper explores the differences in hypertension by sex and age among the Bangladeshi adult population throughout their life span. We conducted the secondary analysis using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. This nationally representative survey involved a two-stage stratified sample of 675 households in urban (250) and rural (425) enumeration areas (EAs). The analytical sample comprised 12 476 individuals aged 18 or older (6955 women and 5521 men). We performed univariate and bivariate tests to investigate variations in hypertension across sex, age, and other factors. We applied multivariable logistic regression models and logit-based marginal probabilities to explore age and sex differences as well as their interactions in hypertension while estimating the marginal effects of sex for each age group to assess the significance of sex differentials in hypertension throughout the life course. Our study revealed a noteworthy trend: Women have a hypertension prevalence that is five percentage points lower than that of men in their early twenties. However, this trend reverses in their early thirties, with women exhibiting a five-percentage point higher prevalence than men. After adjusting for confounders and age-sex interactions in women, the odds of hypertension were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.6) in the 35-39-year-old age group, which may contribute to a combined burden of chronic and reproductive morbidity. With rising hypertension and stagnant maternal health in Bangladesh, women of reproductive age face higher risks of chronic and reproductive complications. The complex health system in Bangladesh, which starts at the community level, primarily focuses on maternal and child health; however, some recent initiatives show a shift in focus to address significant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through public health facilities. Considering that more women seek health care from public facilities, recognising common factors contributing to early hypertension in Bangladeshi women enables targeted interventions, model testing, and strategic adjustments to the primary health care-focused national non-communicable disease management pathway.",

        "abstract": "Acute mountain sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) are three common forms of altitude sickness. These conditions can be life-threatening, with symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. Ascending to high elevations increases the likelihood of developing these conditions, with some individuals adapting quickly while others need to descend. Early acclimatization is beneficial for avoiding AMS and HACE, but it takes weeks to months to improve job performance and performance at high altitudes. HAPE is a leading cause of mortality from altitude sickness, characterized by foamy mucus, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Treatment is most effective when it is administered quickly, with mild cases resolving with additional time spent at altitude. Oxygen therapy and chemicals such as acetazolamide, spironolactone, and dexamethasone are used to restore fluid balance and prevent complications. Genes and environmental factors influence genetic reactions to low oxygen levels at high altitudes. This review explores pharmacological interventions currently used or under investigation, such as acetazolamide, dexamethasone, and novel HIF stabilizers. By integrating molecular insights with pharmacological data, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of altitude-related illnesses. Studying altitude sickness is highly relevant not only for climbers and high-altitude workers but also for broader medical contexts like hypoxia-related diseases. This manuscript aims to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical practice, facilitating improved strategies for management and prevention of high-altitude disorders.",

Western-developed assessment tools present an incomplete picture of the regional Nepali beliefs that guide patient treatment adherence, and the present study seeks to substantiate qualitative findings that suggest a reorientation of patient education content for more effective patient-oriented, culturally consonant care. We conducted a cross-sectional structured interview of 500 men and women under treatment for hypertension in three urban Kathmandu hospital clinics. Interview items were developed from a qualitative survey and investigated patient beliefs about hypertension causes, symptoms, and consequences; treatment costs and sequelae; and general health maintenance. Patients reported experiencing multiple and wide-ranging symptoms that affected how they felt physically and emotionally as well as how they behaved; these were expected to respond to treatment. They were distressed by their condition and were concerned about short- and long-term treatment effects, specifically that long-term treatment may impair the body's natural ability to maintain a healthy blood pressure. While hypertension was described as life-long, there was a range of beliefs on whether successful blood pressure control would, or should, allow a switch to natural remedies, lifestyle management, or no treatment at all. Kathmandu Valley hypertension beliefs suggest adaptation of Western-developed patient communications to address Nepali patient experience and concerns. While Western communications address the \"silent\" nature of the disease, our Kathmandu population experienced multiple and varied symptoms that guided their behavior. Patient also expressed concerns about medication habituation and dependence reflecting Nepali health models.",

        "abstract": "Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by both the aorta and pulmonary artery originating from the right ventricle. It accounts for 1%-3% of all congenital heart defects and is often associated with additional structural anomalies such as ventricular septal defects (VSDs), which exacerbate hemodynamic complications. We present a case of a 16-year-old female with DORV and 2 VSDs, leading to bidirectional shunting and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented with progressive exertional dyspnea, central cyanosis, and clubbing of the fingers, indicative of chronic hypoxia. Echocardiography and Doppler studies confirmed the diagnosis, revealing significant bidirectional shunting and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Two distinct VSDs were identified in the interventricular septum (IVS): the first, a larger perimembranous VSD involving the inlet part with extensions toward the subaortic region, measured 11 mm × 16 mm; the second, a smaller VSD in the mid-part of the trabecular septum, measured 4 mm × 4 mm. Both VSDs permitted bidirectional shunting, predominantly left-to-right, contributing to the patient's cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, with the larger VSD being routable to the aorta. Treatment involved stabilization with medical management to address pulmonary hypertension and preparation for corrective surgery. Timely surgical correction, including the closure of VSDs and rerouting of the ventriculo-arterial connections, is crucial for improving outcomes. Ongoing follow-up is essential to monitor for complications such as arrhythmias, right heart failure, and progression of pulmonary hypertension. The case underscores the complexity of DORV and the need for a multidisciplinary approach in its management.",

        "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are among the most prevalent sexual disorders in men, significantly impairing quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to assess and compare QoL among patients with PE and ED. A cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted where participants aged ≥18 years with complaints of either PE or ED were included, while those with both conditions were excluded. PE, ED, and QoL, along with depression, were assessed using validated tools. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables (e.g., QoL domain scores) were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Differences in QoL domain scores between patients with PE and ED were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. An independent samples t-test was used for the unadjusted analysis to compare mean differences in World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) domain scores between the PE and ED groups. For the adjusted analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed, controlling for potential confounders including depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), physical illness, smoking status, physical activity, and education level. Among the 245 participants, 140 (57.1%) presented with PE and 105 (42.9%) with ED. Based on diagnostic tools, 87.1% of PE cases were confirmed using the Bengali-validated Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), and 95.2% of ED cases were confirmed using the IIEF-6. Both groups scored highest in the physical domain and lowest in the social domain of WHOQOL-BREF, with PE generally showing better scores. Depression was prevalent in both groups, affecting 72.9% of PE and 65% of ED participants, with severe depression slightly more common in ED (7%). Physical illnesses like hypertension and diabetes were more frequent in ED patients. Education level, active lifestyle, smoking status, and living place (urban vs. rural) were significantly linked to the environmental and psychological domains (p = 0.028, p = 0.008, p = 0.013, p = 0.030). A history of physical illness significantly impacted the physical domain (p = 0.032). Statistical analyses revealed that PE participants had significantly better physical and psychological QoL scores than ED participants, both before and after adjusting for confounders such as depression severity (PHQ-9), physical illness, smoking status, physical activity, and education level.  This study highlights that men with PE report significantly better physical and psychological QoL compared to those with ED, even after adjusting for key confounding factors. Depression and physical illnesses were more prevalent among ED patients, negatively influencing their QoL. Sociodemographic and lifestyle variables also played a notable role in shaping QoL outcomes. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing both sexual dysfunction and associated psychosocial factors.",

        "abstract": "In-hospital mortality during COVID-19 treatment is a crucial metric used to assess the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of medical interventions. By identifying mortality risk factors, we aim to inform policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve preparedness for future pandemics. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Data were gathered from the hospital's electronic medical records between July 2021 and September 2021. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 218 patients with complete medical records were selected for the analysis. The independent variables examined included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. To assess in-hospital mortality, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis employing the Delta method. The study included 218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, primarily male (51.4%) with an average age of 56.4 years (standard deviation of 15 years). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 18.3%. Older age (≥60) (RR:3.10, 95% CI: 1.16-8.29), long-standing hypertension (≥5 years) (RR:2.78, 95% CI:1.54-5.02), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR:4.43, 95% CI:2.93-6.70) were significant risk factors for mortality. Patients with diabetes (≥3 years) had a moderately increased risk (RR:1.68, 95% CI: 1.01-2.83). Notably, shorter hospital stays (≤7 days) were associated with higher mortality, potentially due to delayed treatment initiation. Moreover, Vaccinated patients have a significantly lower risk of death (RR: 0.07) compared to unvaccinated patients, highlighting the protective effect of vaccination. Greater lung involvement (especially in lower lobes) and higher Total Severity Scores (TSS ≥ 14) strongly predict COVID-19 mortality, with non-survivors exhibiting significantly worse radiographic damage. Age, particularly when combined with chronic conditions like hypertension or chronic kidney disease, is a key predictor of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. While gender is not an independent risk factor, males tend to have higher mortality rates. Delayed treatment, reflected by shorter hospital stays, also increases risk. Vaccination markedly lowers mortality. In resource-limited settings, lower lobe involvement >50% and TSS ≥ 14 can serve as early triage markers to guide ICU admission or intensified care. These indicators should inform risk assessment tools, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to reduce pandemic-related mortality.",

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

This study aims to determine the prevalence of antihypertensive medication adherence and its associated factors among patients with hypertension receiving treatments at a Hypertension Center in Bangladesh. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 352 adult patients with hypertension registered in the Rangpur Hypertension and Research Center. The outcome variable for the study was medication adherence to the antihypertensive drug, which was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Descriptive analysis was conducted to show the distribution of the study participants, Pearson's chi-square test was applied to explore associations between categorical response and explanatory variables, and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore factors associated with medication adherence. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 17.0. The prevalence of good medication adherence among patients with hypertension in the HRC, R was 54.83%. Among various reasons for taking the medicine irregularly, forgetfulness (20.29%) was the most common cause reported by the participants, followed by a busy work schedule (7.71%). Among the study participants, married patients were found to have higher medicine adherence (AOR= 3.81; 95% CI: 1.34-10.89) than unmarried patients. Compared to patients who had hypertension for less than or equal to 5 years, patients suffering from hypertension for 6-10 years had 68% (AOR= 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11-0.95) and patients suffering for more than 10 years had 72% (AOR= 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09-0.84) lower odds of medicine adherence, respectively. Patients who were diagnosed by non-professionals had 81% (AOR= 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.61) lower odds of medicine adherence compared to the patients who were diagnosed by health professionals. This study observed low medication adherence among patients with hypertension, where forgetfulness and a busy work schedule were reported to be the primary reasons for such non-adherence. Patients who are not married, who have been suffering for a long, and who have not been diagnosed by a health professional manifested as significant influencing factors for non-adherence.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

Data from 365 bankers from five public and private banks in Bangladesh were collected using a pretested semistructured questionnaire. The Seventh Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC 7) guideline was followed to define prehypertension and undiagnosed hypertension. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to investigate the associated factors. The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and prehypertension were 22.5% and 55.3%, respectively. Most of the bankers were males and 35-44 years of age. The risk of hypertension and prehypertension was significantly higher among males (Odds ratio [OR], 16.6; OR, 6.4), longer service duration (F, 3.6), prolonged working hours (OR, 3.8; OR, 3.1), smoking (OR, 6.2; OR, 3.4), overweight (OR, 6.8; OR, 2.4) and obese (OR, 8.9; OR, 3.4) bankers, respectively.

Several tools are available for measuring health literacy, including the HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire using Rasch measurement theory to assess general health literacy among adults in rural Bangladesh. Baseline data was collected through a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) in the Narail district of Bangladesh from 1 December 2020 to 31 January 2021, involving 307 adults aged 30-75 with hypertension. The HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire, which has 12 items, was validated using the Rasch measurement model and analyzed using RUMM2030. The analysis was focused on differential item functioning (DIF) across gender and age, targeting, multidimensionality, response dependency, and item categorization. The sample consisted of almost equal proportions of females (50.2%) and males (49.8%), and control (50.8%) and intervention participants (49.2%). Initial examination indicated that the tool had a poor overall fit with the Rasch model, shown by a significant item-trait interaction (χ2 = 100.5 df = 48, p < 0.001). The reliability, measured by person separation index (PSI), was 0.746, which was considered satisfactory. The overall item fit residual (IFR) (M = 0.236, SD = 1.318) and the person fit residuals (PFR) (M = -0.186, SD = 1.03) were within the acceptable range of SD ± 1.4. All items were found to have ordered thresholds, suggesting that respondents had no difficulty differentiating between response options on the 4-point Likert-type scale. Only item 12 (\"Join a sports club or exercise class if you want to\") had a fit residual value outside the acceptable range. Removing item 12 resulted in a good overall fit (χ2 = 60.35 df = 44, p = 0.05) and a slight improvement to the PSI (0.746 for 12 items vs.0.756 for 11 items). None of the items showed significant DIF for age and gender. Only two items showed residual correlation coefficient 0.20, indicating possible redundancy. The analysis demonstrated the scale's unidimensionality, as shown by the lower bound of a binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed proportion (5.2%) being within the 95% confidence limit. The study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the HLS-EU-Q12 as a tool for assessing health literacy among adults in Bangladesh. However, further study is needed to evaluate the tool across different populations, including an in-depth investigation of item 12 to determine its inclusion or removal.

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

        "abstract": "Serum uric acid (SUA) has been suggested to be associated with obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension. However, whether uric acid is independently associated with the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), a major type of cardiovascular disease (CVD), remains debatable, especially across different populations. This study aims to examine the relationship between SUA levels and MI in an adult population group in Bangladesh. The study included 392 participants: 188 with a history of MI in the CVD group and 204 healthy individuals without CVD in the control group. Anthropometric, blood pressure, SUA, and other biochemical parameters were measured. A multivariate regression model was used to assess the relationship between elevated SUA levels and the risk of CVD. The mean level of SUA was significantly higher in the CVD group (7.6 ± 4.5 mg/dL) compared to the non-CVD group (5.3 ± 1.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.001). The prevalence of hyperuricemia was also observed to be higher in the CVD group (46.3%) compared to the non-CVD group (18.2%) (p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed in the levels of blood glucose and lipid profile between the CVD and non-CVD groups (p < 0.001 for all cases). No significant differences were observed in the mean level of SUA or the prevalence of hyperuricemia between the gender groups. When SUA was divided into four quartiles, a significant difference was observed for systolic blood pressure across the quartile groups. After adjusting for potential confounders in the regression models, SUA was found to have a significant association with CVD. Elevated levels of SUA were associated with increased odds of CVD among the study participants. Managing SUA levels and implementing intervention strategies could be effective in preventing and controlling cardiovascular events.",

This study investigates the independent predictors of HS among Bangladeshi women. The Multidimensional Approach of Genotype and Phenotype in Stroke Etiology (MAGPIE) study is a Bangladeshi observational study that recruited nationwide HS patients between 2022 and 2024. We utilized univariate analysis to identify risk patterns in the data sets, whereas a multivariate logistic regression (LR) analysis identified the independent predictors of HS in women. We evaluated a total of 1080 hemorrhagic patients with female predominance (59.5%) and similar age of onset to males (<i>p</i> = 0.38). Although males had significantly higher rates of hypertension (<i>p</i> < 0.001), diabetes (<i>p</i> = 0.008), chronic constipation (<i>p</i> = 0.03), and systolic blood pressure (<i>p</i> < 0.001), females were found to have significantly higher body mass index (23.1 ± 3.1 vs. 21.4 ± 2.9; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and paternal diabetes (9.6% vs. 4.8%; <i>p</i> = 0.004) compared to male. Further, the age-adjusted multivariate LR model found paternal diabetes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.5, <i>p</i> = 0.007) as a potential independent predictor of HS in females compared to males. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.67 (95% CI 0.63-0.70, <i>p</i> < 0.001) with 67.7% sensitivity and 58.2% specificity presents the goodness of fit of the model.

        "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most common factors contributing to cardiac remodeling that links to changes in both heart and kidney functions. Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ<sub>10</sub>) in reducing oxidative stress due to its antioxidant properties. However, the cardioprotective and nephroprotective roles of CoQ<sub>10</sub> against the toxicity induced by fludrocortisone acetate (FCA) have yet to be investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the CoQ<sub>10</sub> effects on FCA-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in a rat model (FCA-Salt). We analyzed various oxidative stress parameters and antioxidant enzyme activities using biochemical assays. In addition, we examined inflammatory and fibrosis via histological staining of heart and kidney tissues. CoQ<sub>10</sub> significantly reduced lipid peroxidation product-malondialdehyde (MDA) while increased nitric oxide (NO) in the FCA-Salt rats. Antioxidant enzyme activities were also enhanced by CoQ<sub>10</sub> in these rats. Histopathological examination detected tissue damage and fibrosis in the FCA-Salt group, which was significantly reduced by CoQ<sub>10</sub>. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated the activation of Transforming growth factor-β1/Tumor necrosis factor-α (TGF-β1/TNF-α) by CoQ<sub>10</sub>. Consequently, our study suggests that CoQ<sub>10</sub> can effectively protect heart and kidney health against cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in FCA-Salt hypertensive rats via TGF-β1/TNF-α pathway.",

        "abstract": "Genetic association studies have focused on testing additive models in cohorts with European ancestry. Little is known about recessive effects on common diseases, specifically for non-European ancestry. Genes & Health is a cohort of British Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals with elevated rates of consanguinity and endogamy, making it suitable to study recessive effects. We imputed variants into a genotyped dataset (n = 44,190) by using two reference panels: a set of 4,982 whole-exome sequences from within the cohort and the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed-r2) panel. We performed association testing with 898 diseases from electronic health records. 185 independent loci reached genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) under the recessive model, with p values lower than under the additive model, and >40% of these were novel. 140 loci demonstrated nominally significant (p < 0.05) dominance deviation p values, confirming a recessive association pattern. Sixteen loci in three clusters were significant at a Bonferroni threshold, accounting for multiple phenotypes tested (p < 5.4 × 10<sup>-12</sup>). In FinnGen, we replicated 44% of the expected number of Bonferroni-significant loci we were powered to replicate, at least one from each cluster, including an intronic variant in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3; rs66812091) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a previously reported additive association. We present evidence suggesting that the association is recessive instead (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3, recessive p = 2 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, additive p = 2 × 10<sup>-11</sup>, dominance deviation p = 3 × 10<sup>-2</sup>, and FinnGen recessive OR = 1.3 and p = 6 × 10<sup>-12</sup>). We identified a novel protective recessive association between a missense variant in SGLT4 (rs61746559), a sodium-glucose transporter with a possible role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and hypertension (OR = 0.2, p = 3 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, dominance deviation p = 7 × 10<sup>-6</sup>).

        "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between knowledge of healthy lifestyles and the age of hypertension diagnosis among hypertensive individuals within Bangladeshi rural population. This cross-section study was conducted among hypertensive adults (18-80 years) in a rural population. We obtained data from 3600 adults with hypertension from 40 randomly selected community pharmacies. We gathered data on demographics, health knowledge, and measured vital signs, including hypertension diagnosis year. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the lifestyle and knowledge factors about hypertension with the age of diagnosis of hypertension. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis was 45.84 years. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis of male participants was higher than female (48.1 vs 44.4 years). Our study found that males and individuals with primary education are more likely to receive a later hypertension diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-3.10 and odds ratio = 5.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.09-11.48 respectively) for those aged ≥65. The poorest and those lacking physical exercise faced higher odds of later diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.15 and odds ratio = 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.78-3.17 respectively). Conversely, a family history of hypertension reduces the odds (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.55). Increased knowledge of healthy lifestyle factors and engagement with health-related media correlate with later diagnosis, highlighting the influence of education and awareness on hypertension detection age. Our study reveals that knowledge of a healthy lifestyle is associated with the age of hypertension diagnosis. Targeting specific age groups based on health education programs may reduce hypertension-related complications.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive impairment has a major impact on health, quality of life and survival and its increasing burden presents a critical global health challenge. Empirical population-based studies of cognitive function and its association with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors among older adults in low-resource setting are rare. This study describes the burden of cognitive impairment and associations with demographic, health and behavioural factors among older adults in rural Bangladesh. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of a random sample of men and women aged 60 years and above in 96 rural villages in Bangladesh. Cognitive function was measured using the Bangla Adaptation of the Mini-mental State Examination (BAMSE), where higher score indicates higher function. Blood pressure, height and weight were measured using standard protocols and fasting glucose and 2-h oral glucose test were used to identify diabetes risk. Interviewer administered survey questionnaires assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety and self-reported health behaviours. Analyses were carried out separately for men and women and examined associations between sociodemographic, health and behaviour factors with BAMSE scores using robust Poisson regression. Data were gathered from 403 (216 female, 187 male) eligible participants. More than 50% of the population had at least mild cognitive impairment and women had lower cognitive scores than men. Younger age, higher education, wealth, and literacy were significantly associated with higher BAMSE scores among women and men. Associations with marital status varied between men and women, with being married having a positive association with BAMSE among women, i.e. higher cognitive function (relative score ratio (95% CI) 1.08 (1.02, 1.15), p = 0.013), but no association among men (0.94 (0.87, 1.02), p = 0.13). No clear associations were observed with diabetes or hypertension, but overweight and obesity were associated with an increased BAMSE score among women (1.10 (1.02, 1.19), p = 0.011) but not men (1.01 (0.94, 1.10), p = 0.70). Moderate and severe depressive symptoms were associated with lower BAMSE scores among men (0.90 (0.82, 0.99), p = 0.037), but not women (0.94 (0.83, 1.06), p = 0.31). Physical activity was associated with a relative increase in BAMSE score (1.08 (1.01, 1.16), p = 0.020) among women, though no association was seen in men (1.01 (0.95, 1.07), p = 0.76). The consumption of betel was associated with lower BAMSE among women (0.94 (0.89, 1.00), p = 0.056), but there was no evidence of association among men (1.01 (0.96, 1.07), p = 0.61). A large proportion of older adults in rural Bangladesh have impaired cognitive function and there are important gender differences in the distribution of cognitive scores and their association with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors in this population. Improvement in health and social care systems, taking into account the specific social, economic and gender dimensions of the context, are needed to prevent and manage the burden of cognitive decline in rural Bangladesh. This survey and analysis were part of the Bangladesh Diabetes Community-Led Awareness, Response and Evaluation (DClare) study funded by UKRI/MRC (MR/T023562/1) under the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases Scale-Up Programme.",

        "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used to manage autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sjogren's syndrome. However, HCQ can cause cardiotoxicity, a dose-dependent complication linked to the accumulation of metabolites in lysosomes that alters cellular pH. HCQ-induced cardiotoxicity can lead to various cardiac abnormalities, including conduction defects, hypertrophy, and heart failure (HF). Importantly, this toxicity may be reversible with early detection and prompt discontinuation of HCQ. Three cases of SLE patients with prolonged HCQ use are presented, all of whom exhibited signs of cardiomyopathy and HF. The first case involved a 70-year-old male with a 30-year history of HCQ use, who presented with Mobitz II A-V block and other cardiac abnormalities. The second case was a 45-year-old female with a 26-year history of HCQ therapy who developed sinus tachycardia and biatrial enlargement. The third case involved a 75-year-old woman with 30 years of HCQ use, presenting with shortness of breath and pulmonary hypertension. In all cases, HCQ was discontinued, and supportive HF therapy was initiated, leading to improved ejection fraction and resolution of symptoms within months. HCQ cardiotoxicity, although rare, is an important consideration in patients on long-term therapy, particularly as it is potentially reversible. The diagnosis can be challenging due to the nonspecific nature of cardiac symptoms and overlaps with other conditions. Imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, plays a crucial role in early detection, while endomyocardial biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis. These cases underscore the need for clinicians to be aware of HCQ cardiotoxicity, as early intervention can improve patient outcomes.",

Common risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, obesity and smoking, whereas rare causes include haematologic disorders, premature atherosclerosis, vasculopathy and arteritis. Treatment barriers include inadequate infrastructure, a lack of trained staff and high intervention costs. Bangladesh faces a scarcity of neurologists and well-equipped hospitals, necessitating strategies to mitigate the burden of stroke among young people. This editorial summarises the current knowledge regarding the aetiology, pathophysiology and challenges in diagnosing and treating stroke in young people in Bangladesh, while addressing rare vasculopathy. Initiatives to support young stroke survivors and their families were also discussed. Prospective cohort studies, such as the Norwegian Stroke in the Young Study, provide insights into optimising prevention and early intervention by assessing family history and subclinical vascular diseases, which have also been highlighted. Recommendations include advanced neuroimaging for risk assessment, incorporating patient care and rehabilitation into medical education, conducting relevant research and promoting healthy lifestyles through campaigns and training of the healthcare staff.",

Digital tracking may improve primary care workers' ability to follow recommended antenatal and chronic disease practices, quality of patient records, patient health outcomes and service use. However, these interventions led to small or no outcome differences in most studies.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy in individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension, especially when undiagnosed, untreated, or uncontrolled, can result in severe consequences, including maternal and child mortality. Contraception is crucial for the management of pregnancy in individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension. However, the decision-making and experiences related to contraception use among this population in low- and middle-income countries are poorly understood. This study aims to explore the barriers to contraception use among sexually active men and women living with diabetes and/or hypertension. We conducted a qualitative study using the empirical phenomenological approach. We interviewed participants diagnosed with diabetes and/or hypertension, as well as stakeholders involved in providing care to individuals living with at least one of these two conditions and family planning service providers. Semi-structured interview guides were used, and data were collected through four focus group discussions, four in-depth interviews, and ten key informant interviews. All interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically. People living with diabetes and/or hypertension encounter misunderstandings and various barriers when it comes to using contraception. These experiences were categorised into four main themes and nine sub-themes. The themes identified were: (i) lack of awareness/inadequate knowledge and misunderstanding, (ii) social and religious beliefs, (iii) barriers to available and affordable contraceptives, and (iv) lack of coordination between facilities providing family planning services and treatment and management for diabetes and/or hypertension. Findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and considerations involved in contraceptive use-related decision-making among individuals with diabetes and/or hypertension. These findings can be used in policymaking and programme development to promote contraceptive use and improve the reproductive health outcomes of this population.",

Little is known about their effectiveness in improving hypertension outcomes. We conducted a narrative literature review to document features of select supply-side (pay-for-performance, capitation) and demand-side [conditional cash transfers (CCT), vouchers] financing interventions focused on improving hypertension outcomes in primary care settings. Our review confirmed the paucity of studies, especially from LMICs. Pay-for-performance and capitation had small effects on screening, prescription practices, and blood pressure (BP) control. CCTs had mixed effects on screening and modest effects on BP control. Information on causal pathways, unintended consequences, and the use of vouchers was sparse. We then developed a conceptual model identifying pathways through which financing interventions influence hypertension outcomes. Based on this model, simulations in the context of Bangladesh indicated that pay-for-performance demands substantial financial resources but could become more favorable with increased treatment coverage.",

        "abstract": "While undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) presents a substantial global concern, there is a dearth of research examining its prevalence and characteristics specifically within the regional context of Bangladesh. The study focused on assessing the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in Bangladesh and examining regional disparities. The study analyzed data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted between 2017 and 2018. The analysis focused on 11,911 participants aged 18 and above. Prevalence rates of both diagnosed and undiagnosed DM were calculated across various demographic and regional factors. To understand the impact of socio-demographic and regional variables on diagnosed and undiagnosed DM, the study employed multinomial regression analysis. The study encompassed 11,911 participants with an average age of 39, of whom 57% were females. Among them, 333 individuals (2.8%) were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM), while 667 participants (5.6%) had undiagnosed DM. The prevalence of both diagnosed and undiagnosed DM was notably higher in elderly, hypertensive, overweight or obese, and rural residents. Regression analysis indicated that individuals aged 70 and above faced 2.14 times more likely of diagnosed diabetes compared to those aged 30-39 (RRR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.35-3.58). Regarding residential regions, individuals from the city exhibited significantly higher prevalence rates for both diagnosed DM (RRR: 1.83; 95% CI = 1.31-2.57) and undiagnosed DM (RRR: 1.52; 95% CI = 1.18-1.95) compared to those from the rural of Bangladesh. The high prevalence of undiagnosed DM in city areas suggests potential shortcomings in routine diabetes screening practices. Prioritizing screening, particularly for high-risk groups like older adults, individuals with elevated BMI, hypertension, and urban residents from the central region of the country, is crucial. These groups have elevated diabetes risk and face higher complications without timely detection and treatment. To address this issue, collaborative efforts among the Bangladeshi government, healthcare providers, and community organizations are imperative.",

This study examines the influence of cardiorenal risk factors, socioeconomic status, and ethnic and cardiovascular comorbidities on ESKD outcomes in the general population. This cross-sectional study analysed data from 502,408 UK Biobank study participants recruited between 2006 and 2010. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to assess risk factors for ESKD, with results presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 1191 (0.2%) of the study participants reported ESKD. Diabetes increased ESKD risk by 62% [1.62 (1.36-1.93)], with early-onset diabetes (before age 40) conferring higher odds compared to later-onset (after age 40) [2.26 (1.57-3.24)]. Similarly, early-onset hypertension (before age 40), compared to later onset (after age 40), increased ESKD odds by 73% [1.73 (1.21-2.44)]. Cardiovascular comorbidities, including stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction and angina, were strongly associated with ESKD [5.97 (3.99-8.72), 5.35 (4.38-6.56), 4.94 (3.56-6.78), and 4.89 (3.47-6.81)], respectively. Males were at 22% higher risk of ESKD than females [1.22 (1.04-1.43)]. Each additional year of diabetes duration increased ESKD odds by 2% [1.02 (1.01-1.03)]. Non-white ethnicity, compared to white and socioeconomically most deprived, compared to the least deprived quintiles, were at 70% and 83% higher odds of ESKD. Each unit of HbA1c rise increased the odds of ESKD by 2%. Compared to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria increased the odds of ESKD by almost 10-fold [9.47 (7.95-11.27)] while normoalbuminuria reduced the odds by 73% [0.27 (0.22-0.32)]. Early onset of diabetes and hypertension, male sex, non-white ethnicity, deprivation, poor glycaemic control, and prolonged hyperglycaemia are significant risk factors for ESKD. These findings highlight the complexity of ESKD and the need for multifactorial targeted interventions in high-risk populations. Not applicable.",

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and presentations of metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetic (T2DM) of Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the department of Endocrinology in BIRDEM General Hospital, Bangladesh from July 2019 to June 2020 including 151 T2DM patients. Face-to-face interview, anthropometric measurements and review of laboratory records were used for data collection. Four different criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome: WHO criteria, IDF criteria, NCEP ATP III criteria and Harmonized Criteria. Frequency distribution for categorical variables and mean with standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables were calculated. Chi-squared test was used to explore the factors associated with metabolic syndrome. Overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome in our included patients was 70.0% according to the WHO criteria, 79.5% according to the IDF criteria, 74.8% according to the NCEP ATP III criteria and 90.7% according to the Harmonized Criteria. Central obesity was the most prevalent component of metabolic syndrome among our patients followed by hyperglycemia, hypertension, low HDL and high TG level. Prevalence was high in elderly and female patients. Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent among T2DM patients of Bangladesh. Adequate screening for early diagnosis and management is crucial to mitigate the burden of morbidity and mortality related to metabolic syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a primary contributor to tissue damage in multiple organs, including the heart and kidneys. In this study, we explored the protective roles of L-arginine in a mineralocorticoid-induced rat model of hypertension. To induce hypertension and subsequent organ damage, rats were nephrectomized unilaterally and fed with the mineralocorticoid fludrocortisone acetate and dietary salt (FCA-Salt). These rats were treated with L-arginine for 28 days, and subsequent tests were performed. Biochemical analysis revealed the increased level of inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers in the plasma, heart, and kidney of the FCA-salt-treated rats. L-arginine treatment decreased the oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA) by 18 %, 22 %, and 18 % in the heart, kidney, and plasma, respectively. L-arginine also attenuated the advanced oxidative protein products (AOPP). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased by 62 %, 45 %, and 16 % in the heart, kidney, and plasma, respectively, in the L-arginine-treated animals compared to the FCA-Salt group. Significant augmentation was also revealed for the nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT), and reduced glutathione (GSH). The plasma levels of the kidney function biomarkers uric acid and creatinine were significantly improved after L-arginine treatment. Furthermore, L-arginine remarkably reduced the elevated plasma cytokines IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 in FCA-salt-induced hypertensive rats. Histopathological data showed a reduction in fibrosis and tissue damage by L-arginine in the FCA-salt-treated group. We propose that L-arginine could be an effective agent in preventing cardiac and renal dysfunction in hypertensive rats.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension among adolescents in Asia is an emerging public health concern that is directly associated with early onset cardiovascular risks. As such, it can also lead to further health issues and challenges for health care in the future. As existing studies have predominantly focussed on adult populations, we sought to provide targeted insights into adolescent hypertension across Asia, elucidating the impact of rapid lifestyle and environmental changes on this younger population. Therefore, in this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and trends of elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension among adolescents aged 10-19 years across Asia, address gaps in region-specific data, and determine any demographic risk factors. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Scopus for cross-sectional studies on adolescent hypertension/elevated BP in Asia published from January 2019 to June 2024, after which we narratively synthesised their findings. Of the 2634 retrieved studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, covering over 200 000 adolescents in Asia. The prevalence of hypertension ranges from 0.7% in urban Bangladesh to 24.5% in urban Malaysia, with urban areas generally showing higher rates than rural areas (e.g. India: 8.4% urban vs. 5.7% rural). By region, East Asia has the highest overall prevalence (14.25%), followed by West Asia (14.14%), South Asia (13.77%), Southeast Asia (13.16%), and Central Asia (12.37%). Males had higher prevalence rates (for example, 22.3% in Chinese males vs. 20% in females). The increasing prevalence of adolescent hypertension in urban Asia is a significant public health concern. Although extensive research has been conducted in East and South Asia, there is a dearth of studies in Western, Southeast, and Central Asia, emphasising a need for future research. Standardised diagnostic criteria and targeted interventions are crucial for addressing regional disparities and reducing long-term cardiovascular risks.",

        "abstract": "The high prevalence of hypertension in coastal regions poses a significant public health challenge due to factors such as high salt intake, air pollution, poor diets, limited healthcare access, and increased stress levels. However, disparities in diagnosed hypertension between coastal and non-coastal areas in Bangladesh remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate and address the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension among adults in both regions. In 2020-2021, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to assess hypertension prevalence in coastal and non-coastal regions. The study included 3917 adults from six districts, including non-coastal and coastal regions. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were determined using a modified Poisson regression model, to quantify the relationship between hypertension prevalence in the two regions. The study finds that 438 (11.2%) of the 3917 respondents [446 females [11.7%]; mean age 44.73 years] had been diagnosed with hypertension. Notably, adults residing in coastal areas had a higher prevalence of hypertension (13.4%, 95% confidence interval: 11.8%-15.0%) than their non-coastal counterparts (9.5%, 95% CI: 8.3%-10.7%). In coastal areas, the prevalence ranged from 7.8% in the 18-24 age group to 16.4% in the 55 + age group. In non-coastal areas, the prevalence ranged from 2.9% in the 18-24 age group to 15.8% in the 55 + age group. The results of the multivariable analysis revealed that adults from coastal areas were 29% more likely to have hypertension than those in non-coastal areas (aPR:1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.56). Moreover, age, physical activity, occupation, and body mass index (BMI) were identified as factors associated with the development of hypertension within these regions. Hypertension is a major health issue across Bangladesh, with coastal regions facing added challenges from high salinity in drinking water. While both coastal and non-coastal areas experience high rates of undiagnosed hypertension, environmental factors unique to coastal areas may intensify the issue. Targeted interventions that account for environmental and socioeconomic factors are essential to addressing this growing health concern in both regions.",

Antihypertensive FDC pills often contain a renin-angiotensin inhibitor (RASI) or diuretic. Thus, screening and monitoring for dyskalemia (hypokalemia or hyperkalemia) before and after starting these classes of medications are recommended, a significant barrier for implementation in resource-limited settings. However, the need for blood tests may be overemphasized if the prevalence of dyskalemia in patients with hypertension is uncommon and the incidence of dyskalemia is rare after initiation of FDC. We conducted a community-based blood pressure (BP) screening program in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and determined the prevalence of dyskalemia, as defined by K < 3.0 or K > 5.5 mmol/L, in untreated adults with SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg. Among those with a baseline serum K of ≥3.0 or ≤5.0 mmol/L and creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min, we determined the incidence of dyskalemia 2 months after initiation of a daily FDC of telmisartan 40 mg and amlodipine 5 mg. Secondary outcomes were BP change, medication adherence, and symptoms. In 2022-2023, we recruited 1,073 adults with SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg. The mean age was 54 years, with 71% men and mean baseline BP 157/94 (SD 12/9.3) mmHg. The prevalence of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia was 1.6% and 0.2%, respectively. FDC was initiated in 1,017 eligible patients, and 864 completed the 2-month follow-up visit. Incident hypokalemia occurred in 1.5% of patients, but there was no case of incident hyperkalemia. The mean change in serum potassium after initiating FDC was -0.05 (0.53) mmol/L. At follow-up, 92% had BP <140/90 mmHg with a mean SBP change of -29.8 mmHg. 1% self-reported mild symptoms (e.g., leg swelling), and there was one death of undetermined cause. Given low prevalence and incidence of hyperkalemia and evident reduction in BP, our study suggests initiating FDC with telmisartan and amlodipine may be a practical and safe option for newly diagnosed hypertension, especially in resource-constrained settings where blood tests cannot be easily obtained.",

        "abstract": "Elevated blood pressure poses a significant global health challenge, affecting over 1.28 billion adults worldwide, with a staggering 46% unaware of their condition. Despite its pervasive impact and association with cardiovascular disease, hypertension remains inadequately controlled, highlighting the urgent need for innovative treatment approaches. This review explores the potential of small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics, focusing on zilebesiran, as a promising strategy for hypertension management. SiRNA therapy represents a groundbreaking approach to selectively modulate protein production, offering targeted intervention in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hypertension. Zilebesiran, a siRNA, targets hepatic angiotensinogen (AGT) synthesis through interaction with the asialoglycoprotein receptor, ultimately reducing angiotensin II levels and reducing blood pressure. Zilebesiran demonstrates remarkable pharmacokinetic properties, with sustained efficacy observed after single-dose administration. Clinical trials evaluating zilebesiran have shown significant reductions in blood pressure, with effects lasting up to 24 weeks post-administration. Moreover, combination therapy with angiotensin receptor blockers has demonstrated enhanced efficacy, highlighting the potential for synergistic effects in hypertension management. Importantly, zilebesiran exhibits a favorable safety profile, with manageable adverse events, primarily injection site reactions. Zilebesiran represents a transformative therapy in hypertension management, offering targeted and potent blood pressure reduction with favorable safety and dosing characteristics. Its emergence highlights the ongoing evolution of cardiovascular pharmacology and underscores the importance of innovative approaches to address the global burden of hypertension. Moving forward, concerted efforts in research and clinical practice are necessary to realize the benefits of zilebesiran into hypertension management protocols, ultimately advancing cardiovascular health worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a global health challenge, with hypertension emerging as a leading risk factor. Hypertension, characterized by elevated arterial blood pressure (BP), significantly increases the risk of stroke and other CVDs. Despite advancements in antihypertensive medication, the effectiveness of hypertension treatment is often hindered by poor bioavailability and limited drug efficacy. In this quest, nanoparticles (NPs) offer a promising avenue for addressing the limitations associated with conventional antihypertensive drugs in hypertension treatment. Among several NPs, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) have emerged as a potential candidate, presenting a multifaceted approach to revolutionize drug delivery within this domain. SLNs, characterized by a lipophilic matrix and stabilized by surfactants, offer scalability and compatibility with biological systems compared to several polymer-based nanosystems. By encapsulating antihypertensive drugs, SLNs enhance drug solubility and bioavailability and provide sustained release, thereby improving treatment efficacy. In this context, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of hypertension and the role of SLNs in drug delivery. Various preparation techniques of SLNs are discussed, highlighting their versatility and potential in pharmaceutical applications. Furthermore, the role of SLNs in the management of hypertension is thoroughly examined, with a focus on enhancing the physicochemical properties of antihypertensive drugs. Overall, SLNs represent a promising strategy for optimizing hypertension treatment by addressing the limitations of conventional drug delivery systems. By enhancing drug stability, bioavailability, and efficacy, SLNs offer new possibilities for improving patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. This review aims to contribute to the ongoing research and development of innovative therapies for hypertension management.",

Given the rising prevalence of DM and HTN and their significant public health burden, this research aims to identify key socioeconomic, demographic and lifestyle-related determinants to inform targeted interventions. The study used nationally representative cross-sectional data extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2017-2018. Bangladesh. The study included 8013 women and 6691 men aged 18 and older who were eligible for blood pressure and blood glucose measurements. Type 2 DM, HTN. HTN was significantly associated with higher odds of diabetes (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.28, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.43), while diabetes was associated with increased odds of HTN (AOR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.39). Individuals aged 40 years and older had 74.8% higher odds of diabetes (AOR=1.748, 95% CI: 1.58 to 1.993) and were 3.21 times more likely to have HTN (AOR=4.208, 95% CI: 3.781 to 4.685).

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository.

This study examines the association between these factors in a nationally representative Indian population aged 20-54 years (males: N = 78 832; females: N = 559 059). We analyzed data from the National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5). Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or use of blood pressure-lowering medication. Abdominal obesity was defined by waist-hip ratio (>0.90 for men, >0.85 for women). BMI categories were underweight (<18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal (18.5-<25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (25.0-<30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and obese (≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for demographic and lifestyle factors was used to assess the link between BMI, abdominal obesity, and hypertension. Individuals with both obesity and abdominal obesity had significantly higher odds of hypertension, with males having 3.3 times (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-3.7) and females 2.8 times (95% CI: 2.6-2.9) odds compared to those with normal BMI and no abdominal obesity. Both genders showed increased SBP and DBP by 3.0-5.0 mm Hg when abdominal obesity was present, regardless of BMI. Indian health programs should emphasize the risks of high BMI and abdominal obesity to reduce hypertension.",

This study aims to analyze trends in maternal hypertensive disorders across South Asia from 1990 to 2021, leveraging data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to evaluate the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and provide actionable recommendations. We conducted a retrospective analysis using GBD 2021 data for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Health trends such as prevalence, incidence, and maternal mortality ratios (MMR) were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Join point regression. This approach allowed us to identify significant changes and trends over the studied period. The study revealed significant declines in the prevalence and MMR associated with maternal hypertensive disorders across the region. Notable reductions were observed in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal, while Pakistan showed minimal improvement, indicating ongoing healthcare challenges. The analysis underscores substantial regional disparities, particularly in Pakistan, which reported higher prevalence rates and MMR across all age groups. The findings suggest that targeted healthcare interventions can effectively reduce the burden of maternal hypertensive disorders in South Asia. However, persistent disparities in Pakistan highlight the need for region-specific strategies to address gaps in healthcare access and quality. Strengthening healthcare policies and improving intervention coverage could further mitigate the burden of HDP in South Asia.",

We determined burdens, incidence, evolution, and associated factors of long COVID-19 over two years among these groups. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and recruited confirmed COVID-19 survivors from December 2020 to May 2021 (previously reported). 346 survivors underwent in-person follow-ups at five, nine, 18 months and two years post-infection. The assessment included long COVID symptoms, cardiorespiratory function, neuropsychiatric conditions, quality of life, and laboratory tests. The outcomes included one or more symptoms and/or signs indicative of long COVID, aligning closely with the World Health Organization definition of post-COVID-19 condition. Of the 346 participants, we included 326 in the analysis. 78% of HS (n/N = 171/219) and 62% of NHS (n/N = 55/89) reported at least one sequela symptom. HS had higher odds of palpitations, headaches, dizziness, sleeping difficulties, brain fog, muscle weakness, joint pain, hypertension, insulin requirement, poor quality of life, and prolonged corrected QT intervals on electrocardiogram compared to NHS at two years (95% confidence interval (CI)>1). Regarding evolution, sequelae-symptoms, neurological outcomes, restrictive spirometry findings, and electrocardiogram abnormalities remained unchanged, although psychiatric sequelae, quality of life, and exercise capacity improved in both groups. Hospital readmission rates significantly increased (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of palpitations, cough, and hypertension were higher in HS compared to NHS (95% CI>1). Two or more vaccine doses decreased the risk of respiratory (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.63-0.91) and psychiatric sequelae (aRR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.66-0.92) than one or no doses. COVID-19 survivors, particularly HS, experienced a higher burden of persistent symptoms and health issues two years after infection. However, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of respiratory and psychiatric outcomes.

Patient adherence to cardiovascular medicine is crucial since stopping it increases the risk of cardiac adverse events and poses a bigger risk to health. Perception of manufacturers, prescribers and patients were taken into account to identify the most important variables that can have a positive impact on patient satisfaction and thereby increase adherence to prescribed cardiovascular drug therapy. The empirical study was conducted using quantitative survey method. Questionnaire contained variables influencing patient compliance measured by a 5-point Likert scale where 1 is <i>strongly disagree</i> and 5 <i>strongly agree</i>. Questions were handed over by drop-off and collect method. This study was conducted in 15 tertiary health-care service centers and 18 pharmaceutical companies across Dhaka district, Bangladesh. A total of 156 cardiologists, 200 cardiac patients and 180 marketing professionals (manufacturers) were included in the survey. A total of 11 variables that can affect patient compliance were utilized to create correlation matrix and subsequently to carry on exploratory factor analysis. Hypothesis testing was done by using the regression model. Forty-eight percent of respondents strongly agreed that efficacy of cardiac medicine influences patient compliance. Most of the stakeholders (69%) agreed that the company reputation of cardiac medicine suppliers is an important criterion. Availability and affordability were highly positively correlated variables. The variables were grouped under four categories according to factor loading scores. The four factors were medicinal issues of product strategies, economic issues of price strategies, convenience issues of place strategies and communication issues of promotional strategies. The findings of this study contribute to the comprehension of the factors influencing patient compliance from multiple dimensions.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the prevalence of UHTN among adults aged 18 years and older, using data from studies conducted in Bangladesh and published between 2010 and 2024. A comprehensive search of major databases yielded 1028 records, from which nine relevant studies, encompassing a total of 28949 participants, were selected and evaluated for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, providing valuable insights into the prevalence of UHTN within the Bangladeshi population. The pooled prevalence of UHTN was 11% (95% CI: 6%-19%) based on a random-effects model, with substantial heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 99.5%, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses revealed higher prevalence in rural areas (13%; 95% CI: 4%-35%) compared to urban areas (12%; 95% CI: 1%-54%) and elevated occupational risk among bankers (17%; 95% CI: 0%-94%). While funnel plot asymmetry was noted, Egger's test (p = 0.3113) indicated no significant publication bias. Sensitivity analyses, including Leave-One-Out Analysis, affirmed the robustness of the pooled estimate. The findings underscore notable geographic, occupational, and sociodemographic disparities in UHTN prevalence, highlighting the need for nationwide screening programs and targeted community awareness campaigns, particularly in underserved rural areas.

        "title": "Prevalence of Hypertension and Its Determinants Among Adult People Living in Riverine Island, Sirajganj, Bangladesh: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Assessing the prevalence of hypertension and associated determinants in riverine island populations is crucial due to their unique socio-environmental characteristics and restricted healthcare access, which increase sensitivity to hypertension-related problems and should lead targeted interventions. So, this study investigates the concerning issue of hypertension, focusing on its prevalence and influential factors among adults in Sirajganj's Riverine Island. By employing a cross-sectional approach, the research utilized a structured questionnaire. A total of 309 people took part in this study via face-to-face interviews by following convenience sampling technique. The investigators performed frequency analysis for getting prevalence of HTN and other variable's percentage and binary logistic regression analysis for getting associated determinants. Analysis was conducted by using a statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25. The prevalence of hypertension was 41% among all individuals. People who were illiterate were 1.23 times more hypertensive. Some key risk factors were discovered, including smoking (<i>p</i> = 0.04), adding salt to meals (<i>p</i> < 0.001), eating fatty or fat-type foods (<i>p</i> < 0.001), sleeping late (<i>p</i> < 0.001), worrying about their lifestyle and future (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and not exercising (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Males were 1.43 times more hypertensive (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-2.0, <i>p</i> = 0.002) than females. Smokers were 4.21 times more hypertensive (AOR = 4.21, 95% CI: 1.12-17.13, <i>p</i> = 0.04) than nonsmokers. Consumers oil/fat with food were 2.18 times more hypertensive (AOR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.78-2.54, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than others. Respondents who were worried about their lifestyle and future were 3.38 times more hypertensive (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI: 1.27-6.01, <i>p</i> = 0.001) than others. People should consume a healthy diet and refrain from smoking. Regular physical activity and going to bed early are recommended. Medical camps and workshops should be held on riverine islands to promote a healthy lifestyle and prevent hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has been experiencing a rapid demographic shift from the younger population to older adults, with the older adults facing significant challenges due to the absence of residential and formal home care models. This perspective aimed to evaluate the status of residential and formal home care models and propose potential strategies to improve elderly care in Bangladesh. This perspective utilized a narrative review approach to search existing literature on elderly care in Bangladesh on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The perspective reviewed and presented the status of elderly care and identified gaps in residential and formal home care infrastructure by analyzing existing literature. In Bangladesh, there was no evidence found that any authority had ever initiated or evaluated residential and formal home care programs, showing systematic neglect that resulted in the suffering of older adults. The collapse of the traditional informal family care model, fueled by urban migration and shifting socioeconomic dynamics, has further isolated older adults, leaving them with considerable unmet care needs. The issue is being worsened by a high prevalence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, as well as the collective inability to meet the growing demand for elderly care. Furthermore, limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, emphasized the urgent need for comprehensive elderly care models in Bangladesh. The proposed strategies involve developing residential care facilities, probably on a small scale, and integrating formal home care services in Bangladesh. However, conducting preliminary investigations is essential, including investigating the model to be implemented, training caregivers, and establishing financial support programs and regulatory frameworks. Thus, the government and private sector organizations should collaborate to address these challenges of older adults in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Gynura procumbens, known as longevity spinach, is a plant traditionally used in tropical Asian countries for its anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-hypertensive, and anti-hyperglycemic properties. The current study aimed to enhance the hepatorenal protective activity of Gynura procumbens leaf extract (GLE) by developing a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS). SMEDDS-GLE exhibited the formation of small micelles with a mean droplet size of 231 nm. This resulted in a significant enhancement in the dispersion of GLE in water, as evidenced by a dispersibility that was at least 4.8 times greater than that of GLE alone. In the rat model of hepatic injury induced by cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.), the administration of SMEDDS-GLE (75 mg-GLE/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced liver damage, observed by histological examination and reduced levels of plasma biomarkers associated with hepatic injury. Furthermore, according to histological examination findings and plasma biomarkers assessment, SMEDDS-GLE enhanced the nephroprotective benefits of GLE in the rat model of acute kidney injury. Based on these findings, a strategic application of the SMEDDS-based approach could be a viable choice to enhance GLE's nutraceutical properties.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension kills more people than any other condition; approximately 80% of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Only about 1 in 5 adults with hypertension worldwide and less than 1 in 10 in LMICs have their condition controlled. Adherence to antihypertensive medications increases control and decreases hospitalizations, strokes, heart attacks, and health care costs. Eliminating patient copayments for antihypertensive medications increases adherence and hypertension control. This powerful but underutilized strategy can advance universal health coverage and reduce economic hardship. Medication access with no out-of-pocket cost to patients is feasible and economically sound, but requires increased investment and careful implementation to avoid unintended consequences of reducing flexible funding needed for primary health care systems. Provision of medications that are free to patients at the point of care should be part of a multi-component, sustainable approach to addresses systemic barriers to treatment of hypertension, the world's leading cause of death.",

        "abstract": "We present a case of a 64-year-old male with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), characterized by systemic involvement, including renal, hepatic, and neurological complications. The patient presented with persistent micturition difficulties, hematuria, and abdominal pain, compounded by hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Imaging revealed bilateral renal enlargement with hemorrhagic cysts, a kidney stone, and hepatic cysts causing hepatomegaly. Neurological evaluation identified chronic and recent intracerebral hemorrhages associated with poorly controlled hypertension, underscoring ADPKD's multisystem impact. ADPKD, caused by PKD1 or PKD2 mutations, often leads to progressive renal dysfunction, hypertension, and extrarenal manifestations such as hepatic cysts and intracranial aneurysms. Advances like tolvaptan demonstrate efficacy in slowing renal disease progression, while somatostatin analogs offer promise for hepatic cyst management. This case emphasizes the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach, including strict blood pressure control, regular imaging, and pharmacological intervention, to address ADPKD's complexities and optimize patient outcomes. Early diagnosis and vigilant monitoring remain crucial for preventing complications and enhancing quality of life. This report underscores the importance of integrated care in managing ADPKD, highlighting emerging therapies and the ongoing need for personalized treatment strategies in such challenging cases.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic exposure is associated with obesity- or excess adiposity-related disorders, including cardiometabolic diseases. Previously, many human studies attempted to establish the association of arsenic exposure with obesity, mainly through body mass index (BMI) but failed to provide any concrete evidence. Our study aimed to investigate the arsenic-related adiposity and its relationship with cardiometabolic diseases. Of the 524 participants, 126 and 398, respectively, were chosen from low- and high-arsenic exposure areas in Bangladesh. Obesity or body fat (adiposity) of the participants was measured by anthropometric measures [BMI, waist circumference (WC), and triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT)] and a serum biomarker, leptin. Sarcopenic characteristics were assessed by lean body mass (LBM) and serum creatinine levels. Insulin resistance, as measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), hypertension, and hyperglycemia, were considered as the risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. There were significant positive associations between drinking water, hair, and nail arsenic concentrations and the levels of WC and TSFT after adjusting for potential confounders. However, there were no significant associations with BMI. Increased arsenic exposure levels were associated with increased leptin levels [(Regression coefficient (β) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53, 1.46) for water, (β = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.42, 2.46) for hair, and (β = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.32, 2.61) for nail arsenic]. Notably, leptin levels had inverse associations with LBM (β = -7.87, 95% CI: -13.30, -2.45) and creatinine levels (β = -15.65, 95% CI: -21.50, -9.81). Furthermore, the elevated leptin levels associated with arsenic exposure were connected to higher HOMA-IR levels (β = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.24), higher odds of hypertension [Odds ratio (OR) = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.53], and hyperglycemia (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.47). Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated a unique association between arsenic exposure and adiposity, which could promote arsenic-induced cardiometabolic disorders by mirroring the distinctive characteristics of age-associated sarcopenic obesity.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a significant impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of affected individuals due to its progressive and disabling nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the HRQoL and its predictors among CKD patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out at kidney foundation Hospital and research Institute at Dhaka, Bangladesh. Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL™ -36) questionnaire were used to measure the HRQoL of CKD patients. The study also used kidney-targeted KDQoL-36 Summary Score (KSS). Socio-demographic and medical records were also collected. Descriptive statistics, and multiple linear regression were performed. Out of 430 patients, 77.9% were in moderate to advanced stage of CKD. Patients aged, occupation, income, co-morbidities such as diabetes or hypertension, medication used, and serum hemoglobin were found significantly (p <0.05) associated at different stages of CKD. The mean domain scores of physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS), burden of kidney disease (BKD), effect of kidney disease (EKD), symptoms and problems of kidney disease (SPKD) subscales were 37.19, 45.94, 31.49, 63.95, and 73.35, respectively. The KSS was 63.24. The stage of CKD has been documented as an important predictor of HRQoL of all subscales of KDQoL-36 as well as KSS. The older age group also showed a clear link with a lower HRQoL in all subscales of KDQoL-36, except SPKD. In multiple linear regression analysis, stage of CKD, patients age, employment status and use of medication were found significant predictors of KSS. Further, higher levels of education, being married, absence of diabetes and heart disease were all independent predictors of a higher MCS. Whereas retirement, low duration of CKD and the use of three or more drugs strongly linked to worse scores of PCS. By addressing the determinants of poor HRQoL, healthcare providers can tailor treatment plans to better meet the needs of these individuals and ultimately enhance their overall well-being.",

Assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among hypertensive patients in Bangladesh can highlight the broad impacts of the condition on morbidity and mortality. Such insights are essential for developing targeted healthcare and prevention strategies to reduce complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. In this cross-sectional study, 5,086 hypertensive patients aged between 18 and 80 were recruited from 75 pharmacies in Bangladesh. We assessed the participants' health using the EQ-5D-5 L descriptive system and the EQ-VAS. Utility scores were calculated using the Indian EQ-5D-5 L value set. Regression models were employed to identify factors associated with overall HRQoL and individual health dimensions. Study participants were mean aged 52 years old, with average systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 140.79 mmHg and 85.98 mmHg, respectively. The average EQ-index and EQ-VAS score were 0.83 and 67.47, respectively. 39% reported difficulties with self-care, 43.5% had mobility problems, 80.6% had pain, and 61.2% had anxiety. HRQoL scores decreased significantly with age, according to the multilevel model. Higher education levels, however, were associated with better HRQoL scores. Male respondents reported fewer problems with mobility, self-care, activity, pain, and anxiety. A decrease in HRQoL scores was observed among older individuals, those without formal education, those in lower quintiles, those unemployed, and those with poor blood pressure control, obesity, or fasting glucose.

This study across 17 high-, middle- and low-income countries described variations in secondary CVD prevention medication use over a median follow-up of 12 years. In the multinational PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) cohort study, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis to examine temporal variations in the use of secondary prevention medications in participants with CVD. In participants with coronary artery disease, we focused on antiplatelet agents, statins, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, and β-blockers. In participants with stroke, we focused on antiplatelet agents, statins, RAS inhibitors, and other blood pressure-lowering drugs. Medications were collected at baseline and on 4 subsequent follow-up visits. The analysis included 7,409 participants with a diagnosis of CVD at the baseline visit, 8,792 at the second visit, 9,236 at the third visit, 11,082 at the fourth visit, and 11,677 at the last visit. The median age at baseline was 58.0 years, and 52.9% of the participants were female. The median follow-up was 12 years, with the median year of the baseline visit in 2007 and the fifth visit in 2019. Over this period, use of 1 or more classes of medications for secondary CVD prevention was 41.3% (95% CI: 40.2%-42.4%) at baseline, peaked at 43.1% (95% CI: 42.0%-44.1%), and then decreased to 31.3% (95% CI: 30.4%-32.1%) by the last study visit. In high-income countries, this use decreased from 88.8% (95% CI: 86.6%-91.0%) to 77.3% (95% CI: 74.9%-79.6%). In upper-middle-income countries, this use increased from 55.0% (95% CI: 52.8%-57.3%) to 61.1% (95% CI: 59.1%-63.1%).

Blood samples were collected from each participant to measure biochemical parameters such as liver enzymes (ALT and GGT), lipid profile (TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C), glucose, and creatinine levels in the serum. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with liver dysfunction and lipid profile abnormalities. The average age of the participants was 25 ± 5 years. Overall, the prevalence of preeclampsia was 12.4%. Among participants, 27% had increased ALT levels, most in their third trimester, while 11.8% had elevated GGT levels, mostly in early pregnancy. 83.8% of the study subjects had general dyslipidemia, with the highest prevalence in the second trimester and 5.2% had mixed dyslipidemia. Several factors were significantly associated with ALT elevation, such as preeclampsia, elevated blood pressure, low HDL-C levels, high parity number, having a higher number of children, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and inadequate knowledge about pregnancy diet. On the other hand, advanced maternal age, high gravidity, and mixed dyslipidemia were associated with elevated GGT levels. Conversely, age, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, preeclampsia, and diabetes were associated with dyslipidemia. In conclusion, elevated levels of liver enzymes and an abnormal lipid profile are common among pregnant women in Bangladesh. Various factors are linked to abnormal liver enzymes and dyslipidemia in these participants. Monitoring liver function and lipid levels, along with proper prenatal care, can help reduce the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, is a medical condition associated with maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Previous studies reported conflicting correlations between the eNOS rs2070744 variant and the occurrence of preeclampsia. Due to inconsistencies in findings, the purpose of the present meta-analysis was to explore the precise link between the eNOS rs2070744 variant and the development of preeclampsia. The articles were retrieved from various online sources, including Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases up to February 2024. Data were analyzed by Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4. We adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines to conduct this meta-analysis. A total of 26 articles containing 3741 cases and 4920 controls were included for qualitative and quantitative data synthesis. In the overall population, we found a strong correlation between the eNOS rs2070744 variant and higher preeclampsia risk in recessive (CC vs. CT + TT: OR = 1.31, p = 0.017) dominant (CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.14, p = 0.051), co-dominant 2 (CC vs. TT: OR = 1.37, p = 0.011) and allelic (C vs. T: OR = 1.14, p = 0.022) models. Our study also explored similar outcomes among the Caucasian population in dominant (CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.16, p = 0.048), recessive (CC vs. CT + TT: OR = 1.46, p = 0.027), allele (C vs. T: OR = 1.18, p = 0.044), co-dominant 2 (CC vs. TT: OR = 1.53, p = 0.027), and co-dominant 3 (CC vs. CT: OR = 1.46, p = 0.002) models. Besides, a significant risk of preeclampsia in the African population was observed in co-dominant 2 (CC vs. TT: OR = 2.11, p = 0.009), dominant (CC + CT vs. TT: OR = 1.58, p = 0.002) and allelic (C vs. T: OR = 1.45, p = 0.001) models. However, no association of this polymorphism with preeclampsia risk was reported in Asian and mixed populations. This study suggests a significant correlation between eNOS rs2070744 polymorphism and preeclampsia. However, more research on various ethnic groups is necessary to confirm the association.",

        "abstract": "The human body requires a relatively little quantity of sodium to transmit nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and maintain appropriate water and mineral balance and which is typically added from diets. The study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding high salt intake and their association with hypertension among rural women of a selected community in Chandpur. A cross-sectional study was adopted to collect data from 250 households of Chandpur district. The study was conducted during May 2022 to July 2022. The semi-structured pretested WHO-modified step-wise approach to the non-communicable disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS). Instrument version 3.1 module was used to administer the knowledge, attitude and practice questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the participants. Binary logistic regression was performed to examine the factor related with knowledge, attitude, and practices. The result gives evidence that participant who added always salt to their meals were three times more likely to be hypotensive (AOR: 2.99; CI: 1.40, 6.42). Besides, participants who avoid eating outside are significantly less likely (AOR: 0.19; C.I: 0.05 to 0.70) to be hypertensive. Findings showed that daily salt consumption and \"avoid eating out\" were significantly associated with hypertension status. These findings imply that further educational intervention is needed to increase understanding of healthy dietary salt intake among rural women.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that estimates the trends and mortality due to AF/AFL from 1999-2020 in older adults in the United States. In this 21-year analysis of mortality data, we found a constant increase in mortality rates due to AF/AFL in older adults. From 1999 to 2020, the overall mortality in older adults aged 65 and above, regardless of sex and race, is found to be almost doubled <i>i.e.</i> about a 50.2% increase in the number of deaths due to AF/AFL.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has experienced a rapid epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in recent decades. There is, however, limited evidence about multidimensional determinants of NCDs in this population. The BangladEsh Longitudinal Investigation of Emerging Vascular and nonvascular Events (BELIEVE) study is a household-based prospective cohort study established to investigate biological, behavioural, environmental and broader determinants of NCDs. Between January 2016 and March 2020, 73 883 participants (aged 11 years or older) were recruited from 30 817 households across urban, urban-poor ('slum') and rural settings in Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was administered by trained personnel recording participants' demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural, medical, environmental and other factors. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded for each participant. Biological specimens were collected and aliquoted for long-term storage and analysis. Of the 73 883 study participants (mean [SD] baseline age: 39 [15] years), 43 470 (59%) were females, and 38 848 (52%) had no or only primary-level education. Focusing only on the 65 822 adult participants aged 20-79 years at baseline, 15 411 (23%) reported being diagnosed with hypertension; 10 578 (16%) with type 2 diabetes and 7624 (12%) with hypercholesterolaemia. Age and sex-standardised prevalences of these conditions were much higher in urban than slum and rural settings. Overall, the mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 25 (5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with 10 442 (16%) participants aged 20-79, classified as obese (ie, BMI≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Mean BMI was also higher in urban than slum and rural areas. The collection of information during the baseline visit was completed in 2020. Regular longitudinal follow-up is ongoing for ascertainment and adjudication of a range of fatal and non-fatal health outcomes among participants. This cohort will provide a powerful resource to investigate multidimensional determinants of incident NCDs across diverse settings in Bangladesh, helping to advance scientific discovery and public health action in an archetypal low-middle-income country with pressing public health needs.",

        "abstract": "Adherence to antihypertensive medication is crucial to control blood pressure (BP) and hypertension management outcomes. In Bangladesh, as in many other countries, poor adherence to medication represents a challenge to effective hypertension management. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and relationship between medication adherence and BP management among hypertensive patients in Bangladesh. The PREDIcT-HTN study in Northern Bangladesh aims to evaluate major adverse clinical events in treated hypertensive patients. The study involves 2643 hypertensive patients from a medical center, with data collected through baseline information and yearly follow-ups until 2025. The first follow-up visit was conducted between January and March 2021. Following the 2020 ISH-global hypertension guideline, patients were classified as having controlled BP, grade-I, or grade-II uncontrolled BP. Patients were divided into three groups (good, moderate, and poor) based on their 9-item Hill-Bone medication adherence scale. A multinomial regression analysis was conducted to identify the association between medication adherence and BP control after adjusting potential confounders. Analysis of 2276 hypertensive patients (mean age 51.31 ± 11.58 years) revealed that 36.1% had grade-I and 24.2% had grade-II uncontrolled hypertension. Most patients (78%) displayed moderate adherence, and 15% showed poor medication adherence. Certain patient subgroups had higher rates of poor adherence: females (17.1%) compared to males (12.2%), rural residents (22.4%) compared to city-dwellers (12.2%), and newly diagnosed patients (17.2%) compared to those diagnosed 2-5 years earlier (12.6%). Multivariable analysis found a strong association between medication adherence and BP control. Compared to poor adherence, moderate adherence (relative risk ratio (RRR):0.50, 95%CI:0.36-0.68) and good adherence (RRR:0.56, 95%CI:0.35-0.91) were associated with better control. Increasing age, rural living, and uncontrolled hypertension were also linked. Comorbidities worsened BP control, and managing multiple medications contributed to poor adherence and grade-II hypertension in patients. The high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in Bangladesh underscores the need for improved treatment strategies. Addressing medication adherence is essential for better BP control, with particular attention needed for women, rural residents, and newly diagnosed individuals. A comprehensive approach is warranted, including strategies to enhance adherence, early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and simplified medication regimens. These efforts align with the UN's 2030 SDGs, emphasizing targeted interventions for equitable healthcare access and outcomes.",

It included a non-institutionalized adults' population of 6189 men and women aged 18-69 years. Their daily salt consumption was estimated using the spot urine sodium concentration following the Tanaka equation and reported according to the standard nomenclature proposed by the World Hypertension League and partner organizations involved in dietary salt reduction. Out of a total of 6189 participants, 2.4% consumed the recommended amount of salt (<5 g/day), 67.8% consumed a high amount of salt (≥5-10 g/day), 27.2% consumed a very high amount of salt (>10-15 g/day), and 2.6% consumed an extremely high amount of salt (>15 g/day). In univariate analysis, a higher than recommended level of salt intake (≥5 g/day) was significantly prevalent among rural residents (high = 78.4%, very-high = 81.6%, extremely-high = 84.9%, p = 0.01), literates (high = 51.6%, very-high = 57.9%, extremely-high = 59.1%, p = 0.02), newly diagnosed hypertension (high = 20.6%, very-high = 23.6%, extremely-high = 24.1%, p = 0.008), and overweight/obese (high = 25.9%, very-high = 33.3%, extremely-high = 29.8%, p = 0.000). Similarly, in ordinal logistic regression analysis, the categories of daily salt consumption showed a significant association with rural residence (OR: 1.300, CI: 1.109-1.524, p = 0.001), literates (OR: 0.777, CI: 0.671-0.900, p = 0.001), newly diagnosed hypertension (OR: 1.204, CI: 1.022-1.419, p = 0.026), and overweight/obesity (OR: 1.353, CI: 1.145-1.598, p = 0.000).

        "abstract": "Hypertension remains a major chronic disease morbidity across the world, even in the twenty-first century, affecting ≈40% of the global population, adversely impacting the healthcare budgets in managing the high incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications and mortality because of elevated blood pressure (BP). However, evaluation and management of endocrine hypertension are not optimal in clinical practice. With three unique clinical case scenarios, we update the evidence base for diagnostic evaluation and management of endocrine hypertension in this review to inform appropriate day-to-day clinical practice decisions. Although most individuals with high BP suffer from essential hypertension (≈85%), some patients may have a clear underlying etiology (termed secondary hypertension), and a significant proportion of these patients have endocrine hypertension (≈10%) consequent to hormone excess from dysfunction of one or more endocrine glands. Even if a relatively common disease in the general population, the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of endocrine hypertension is often delayed because of poor awareness among clinicians, including primary care providers and physicians in the secondary care settings. An accurate and timely diagnosis of endocrine hypertension is crucial to potentially cure or at least properly manage these patients because the consequences of delays in diagnosis can be catastrophic, with markedly higher end-organ complications such as CVD, chronic kidney disease, and even premature mortality among sufferers.",

        "abstract": "South Asians may be particularly susceptible to premature myocardial infarction (MI) owing both to conventional cardiovascular risk factors and practices distinctive to South Asia. Identifying modifiable risk factors for MI in these populations could inform prevention strategies. We have, therefore, studied conventional risk factors and other characteristics in relation to occurrence of first MI in Bangladesh. In a case-control study involving 8133 first-onset MI cases and 8124 controls recruited in Bangladesh, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for MI adjusted, for age, sex, smoking status, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, family history of MI, and LDL-cholesterol. We assessed the potential public health impact of risk factor modification using population attributable fractions (PAFs). The median (IQR) age of first MI was 53 (45-60) years. Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were 2.80 (2.57-3.05) for cigarette smoking, 2.17 (1.94-2.43) for family history of MI, 2.27 (2.07-2.48) for history of hypertension, 1.91 (1.72-2.13) for history of diabetes, and 1.53 (1.47-1.58) per 1-SD higher LDL-cholesterol. The highest PAFs (95% CIs) were with current cigarette smoking (49% [46%-52%]), higher LDL-cholesterol (31% [29%-33%]) and history of hypertension (15% [13%-16%]). As for regionally distinctive practices, ORs were 4.02 (3.13-5.17) with <i>biri/hukkah</i> smoking, 2.09 (1.52-2.87) with chewing tobacco, and 1.26 (1.05-1.51) with parental history of first-cousin marriage. Our results confirm the relevance of several conventional risk factors to risk of first MI in Bangladesh, and identify associations with MI of practices distinctive to South Asia, including indigenous modes of tobacco consumption and parental first-cousin marriage. These findings suggest opportunities for cardiovascular disease prevention in Bangladesh that embrace both conventional and regionally distinctive risk factors.

Herein, we present Japan's experience in training medical coordinators to combat NCDs, with a focus on hepatitis, early-onset dementia, and children with medical complexity. Coordinators play an important role in bridging the gap between patients and healthcare services. We examined the training and roles of the coordinators. In the Japanese model, medical coordinators, including both medical and non-medical personnel, have successfully strengthened the delivery of healthcare services for specific diseases. However, challenges persist, including the uneven distribution of coordinators, inconsistencies in training programs, the program's relatively recent establishment, and limited awareness of coordinators' roles and activities. Training medical coordinators can strengthen comprehensive patient support in managing NCDs. Despite its limitations, this model provides valuable insights for developing interventional strategies in other Asian countries facing similar medical human resource shortages. Collaboration among governments, hospitals, and related organisations in training coordinators holds promise in addressing the growing prevalence of NCDs in these regions.",

There is a wide range in age- and sex-standardised stroke incidence, highest in China, lowest in Bhutan. Geographically, incidence is highest in East Asia, lowest in South Asia. Stroke mortality is highest in Papua New Guinea, lowest in Singapore. There are variations in mortality within regions - in East Asia, it is higher in Mongolia and North Korea, lowest in Japan; in South Asia, it is higher in Bangladesh and Pakistan, lowest in Sri Lanka; in Southeast Asia, it is higher in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, lowest in Singapore. Stroke disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost is highest in Papua New Guinea, lowest in Singapore. There is intra-regional variation - in East Asia, it is higher in Mongolia and North Korea, lowest in Japan; in South Asia, higher in Bangladesh and Pakistan, lowest in Sri Lanka; in Southeast Asia, it is highest in Papua New Guinea, lowest in Singapore. Among the stroke subtypes, ischaemic stroke (IS) has the highest incidence, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is second, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is third. IS incidence is highest in China, lowest in Bhutan. The burden due to ICH is highest in Mongolia; ICH incidence is lowest in Sri Lanka, mortality and DALYs are lowest in Japan. SAH has a high incidence in Japan, Singapore, Brunei, and Republic of Korea. In hospital-based registries, the frequency of ICH was highest in Myanmar, low in Mongolia. Among IS, based on the Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) is more frequent in some countries (e.g., China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, and Republic of Korea), but small artery occlusion (SAO) in most others (Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam); cardioembolism is third. Of the stroke risk factors, hypertension is the most frequent, diabetes mellitus (DM) is usually second, with varying positions for hyperlipidaemia, smoking, and prior stroke or transient ischaemic attacks, obesity, and insufficient physical activity. Asia carries a particularly heavy burden of stroke, higher in some countries. IS is the most common subtype. Among IS, the more common mechanisms are LAA and SAO. Hypertension and DM are the more common risk factors. A greater understanding of stroke epidemiology and risk factors will help in healthcare planning for the prevention and management of stroke.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to assess the correlation between clinical features and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with COVID-19. A systematic literature search was conducted for cohort, cross-sectional, and case series that reported co-infection with HIV and COVID-19 published from January to September 2020. Clinical features such as age, comorbidities, CD4<sup>+</sup>T lymphocyte counts, HIV RNA levels, and antiretroviral regimens were evaluated using meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 15.0 software. A total of 24 articles with 939 cases of HIV/COVID-19 co-infection were included in this study. The overall mortality rate was 10.3% (97/939). Older age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, and tumors were significantly associated with increased mortality (95% confidence interval 0.005-0.050, 0.042-2.294, 0.390-2.754, 0.513-2.848, 0.348-3.743, and 1.943-7.101, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.021, 0.043, 0.012, 0.008, 0.022, and 0.005). There was no significant correlation between mortality and CD4<sup>+</sup>T lymphocyte count <200/μL or >500/μL, HIV RNA level below the detection limit, or antiretroviral drugs (including tenofovir) (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). Improved HIV treatment, complex immune interactions, study population variability, and lack of direct SARS-CoV-2 targeting by ART likely obscure the correlation between CD4<sup>+</sup> counts or ART and COVID-19 mortality in HIV patients. HIV-infected individuals with COVID-19 have a similar prognosis to the general population. However, older age, comorbidities (hypertension and diabetesetc.), and lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts are associated with increased mortality. Mainstream anti-HIV drugs do not offer significant protection against COVID-19.",

        "title": "Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease: Exploring Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Treatment Strategies.",
        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 537 million people as of 2021, and is projected to rise to 783 million by 2045. This positions DM as the ninth leading cause of death globally. Among DM patients, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Notably, the prevalence rates of CVD is alarmingly high among diabetic individuals, particularly in North America and the Caribbean (46.0%), and Southeast Asia (42.5%). The predominant form of CVD among diabetic patients is coronary artery disease (CAD), accounting for 29.4% of cases. The pathophysiology of DM is complex, involving insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and associated cardiovascular complications including diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). These conditions exacerbate CVD risks underscoring the importance of managing key risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and genetic predisposition. Understanding the genetic networks and molecular processes that link diabetes and cardiovascular disease can lead to new diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. Imeglimin, a novel mitochondrial bioenergetic enhancer, represents a promising medication for diabetes with the potential to address both insulin resistance and secretion difficulties. Effective diabetes management through oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) can protect the cardiovascular system. Additionally, certain antihypertensive medications can significantly reduce the risk of diabetes-related CVD. Additionally, lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise are vital in managing diabesity and reducing CVD risks. These interventions, along with emerging therapeutic agents and ongoing clinical trials, offer hope for improved patient outcomes and long-term DM remission. This study highlights the urgent need for management strategies to address the overlapping epidemics of DM and CVD. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms and risk factors, this study aims to guide future perspectives and enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of CVD complications in patients with DM, thereby guiding more effective treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is the leading risk factor for death and disability globally, particularly in Bangladesh. Serum calcium is supposed to be linked with the pathophysiology of hypertension, though various studies have shown contradictory results. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate the role of serum calcium level in essential hypertensive patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Shaheed Monsur Ali Medical College and Hospital, Bangladesh following ethical clearance. Total 107 essential hypertensive patient who fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria, were included in this study following informed written consent. Blood pressure was measured according to the protocol of American Heart Association (AHA). Serum calcium, albumin and creatinine were measured by HITACHI analyzer. Data was collected using questionnaire with closed ended questions which has been pretested. Collected data were analyzed by the SPSS 24.0. Mean age of study participants was 45.44±7.13 years (range: 21-63). Most of the patients were middle-aged (78.5%), male (54.2%), hailed from urban residence (95.3%), were overweight or obese (97.2%). Among comorbidities, 17.76% had DM, 7.48% had stroke and only 2.80% had cardiovascular diseases. Mean±SD SBP and DBP was 161.21±12.91 and 98.26±6.31 mmHg, respectively. Overall of the assessment showed, 23.36% patients were hypocalcemic, only 4.67% were hypercalcemic and rest of them were within physiological limit. Mean serum calcium was 9.04±0.84 mg/dL (7.36-11.72 mg/Dl). Systolic BP was significantly higher among patients with corrected calcium >8.5 mg/dL compared to ≤8.5 mg/dL (163.05±12.48 versus 155.87±13.04 mmHg, p<0.05). There was a positive linear relation between serum calcium and SBP (Beta=0.201, p=0.024). This study result revealed a significant association of corrected calcium with systolic BP. However, further larger multicenter study is recommended.",

Due to an increase in the incidence of systemic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, which are the two main causes of CKD and kidney damage, the prevalence of CKD is rising globally. Chronic Kidney Disease results in mineral disorders as well as profound lipid disorders due to improper balancing of the mineral & hormone levels in the body. This cross-sectional study was completed in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, during the period of July 2022 to June 2023. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. Total 120 subjects were included in this study. Out of them, 60 were selected chronic kidney disease patient (Group II) and another 60 apparently normal healthy persons were selected as control (Group I). In this study, serum magnesium levels were measured for analytical study. All the values were demonstrated as mean±SD and values of serum magnesium were in Group I (1.99±0.50 mg/dl) and in Group II (2.24±0.19 mg/dl). Statistical analysis was performed using by statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 26.0. The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control was evaluated using Student's unpaired 't'-test (p<0.001).

Recognizing the critical importance of vision and the challenges posed by visual impairments, particularly in low-resource settings, this study explores an innovative solution to enhance eye care accessibility. The app, developed for Android devices, integrates features such as VA testing using adapted Bengali letters, color blindness tests, and eye health education, aiming to make eye care more user-friendly and accessible. Inspired by the Snellen chart, the app employs a simplified method for VA assessment, suitable for the constraints of mobile devices. The study involved a cross-sectional comparative design, conducted between June and September 2022, to clinically validate the app's feature of testing distant vision and near vision. Participants were recruited from one government eye hospital, one semi-private eye hospital, one high school, and a private clinic in Bangladesh, encompassing a diverse demographic. The validation study revealed promising results in terms of the app's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in both distant and near vision testing, although some variability was observed across different data sources. The study also identified a significant number of participants with diabetes and hypertension, common comorbidities affecting eye health. Overall, \"<i>Dristi</i>\" demonstrates potential as a valuable tool in the early detection and management of visual impairments in Bangladesh. Its development marks a significant step towards utilizing mHealth solutions to overcome healthcare barriers and improve eye care services in low-resource settings. Future directions include expanding the app's features, enhancing its integration with healthcare systems, and extending its reach to other similar contexts.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension (HTN) prediction is critical for effective preventive healthcare strategies. This study investigates how well ensemble learning techniques work to increase the accuracy of HTN prediction models. Utilizing a dataset of 612 participants from Ethiopia, which includes 27 features potentially associated with HTN risk, we aimed to enhance predictive performance over traditional single-model methods. A multi-faceted feature selection approach was employed, incorporating Boruta, Lasso Regression, Forward and Backward Selection, and Random Forest feature importance, and found 13 common features that were considered for prediction. Five machine learning (ML) models such as logistic regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and a stacking ensemble model were trained using selected features to predict HTN. The models' performance on the testing set was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was utilized to examine the impact of individual features on the models' predictions and identify the most important risk factors for HTN. The stacking ensemble model emerged as the most effective approach for predicting HTN risk, achieving an accuracy of 96.32%, precision of 95.48%, recall of 97.51%, F1-score of 96.48%, and an AUC of 0.971. SHAP analysis of the stacking model identified weight, drinking habits, history of hypertension, salt intake, age, diabetes, BMI, and fat intake as the most significant and interpretable risk factors for HTN. Our results demonstrate significant advancements in predictive accuracy and robustness, highlighting the potential of ensemble learning as a pivotal tool in healthcare analytics. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to optimize HTN prediction models, ultimately supporting early intervention and personalized healthcare management.",

        "abstract": "The global health concern regarding the low prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) is evident, but the prevalence of DDM is increasing. This is attributed to the frequent underestimation of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM). Given the limited research on this matter in Bangladesh, there is a need to investigate sex differences in both the prevalence and risk factors of DDM among Bangladeshi adults. This study utilizes the latest data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) conducted between 2017 and 2018, involving 11,911 adult participants. The research focuses on exploring sex-specific differences in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM). Multinomial logistic regression models are applied to examine the sex effect after adjusting socio-demographic, household, and community-related factors associated with these conditions. In the group of 5127 (43%) males, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM) stood at 344 (7%) and 94 (2%), respectively. Among 6784 (57%) females, these figures were slightly lower at 424(6%) for DDM and 138 (2%) for UDM. In males aged 30-39, UDM exhibited significantly (RRR: 6.83, 95% CI: 2.01-23.18), associations, in contrast to the nonsignificant association observed for DDM. Unemployed female had a high risk of diagnosed (RRR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.6) and undiagnosed (RRR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.01-2.31) diabetes. Age, hypertension, wealth, overweight status, and residing in Dhaka had significant relationship with DDM and UDM for both males and females. This study reveals that diabetes prevalence in Bangladesh is influenced by various risk factors, with distinct impacts on men and women. Women living in Dhaka who are unemployed are at a significantly higher risk of both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compared to men. To effectively combat the rising diabetes rate, we must implement targeted interventions that address these sex-specific disparities. These interventions should focus on age, wealth, regional variations, and especially on unemployed women in Dhaka, considering their heightened risk.",

        "abstract": "Early gestational diabetes mellitus (eGDM) refers to elevated blood glucose levels not meeting the criteria for overt diabetes before 20 weeks gestation. Observational studies link eGDM to adverse outcomes, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence on early intervention benefits remains inconclusive. To address this, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) of RCTs on this subject. We searched electronic databases to identify RCTs comparing early treatment vs observation for eGDM. The primary neonatal outcomes analyzed were large-for-gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia. The primary maternal outcome was pregnancy-related hypertension. Secondary neonatal outcomes included neonatal respiratory distress (NRD), neonatal intensive-care unit admission, small-for-gestational age, cord-blood C-peptide ≥90th percentile, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Secondary maternal outcomes were cesarean section (CS), emergency CS, labor induction, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. Seven RCTs involving 4427 pregnancies were analyzed. The studies differed in their timing and methods of inclusion. Six studies used a combination of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions, while 1 relied solely on lifestyle modifications. Early treatment did not reduce LGA [odds ratio (OR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.32; P = .44], macrosomia (OR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.43-1.06; P = .09), or pregnancy-related hypertension (OR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.68-1.57; P = .87). Among the secondary outcomes, only NRD was significantly reduced in the treatment arm (OR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.80; P = .003). However, sensitivity analysis, omitting the lifestyle-only study, demonstrated a lower risk of macrosomia with early intervention (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.91; P = .02). The SRM demonstrates early intervention does not improve most pregnancy outcomes, except NRD. Sensitivity analysis, excluding the lifestyle-only study, additionally revealed a reduction in macrosomia. The findings must be interpreted cautiously due to the variability in study designs.
