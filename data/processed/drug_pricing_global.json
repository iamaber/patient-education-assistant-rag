        "abstract": "In March 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved naloxone nasal spray for over-the-counter (OTC) sale, creating a direct-to-consumer path that can increase access. We utilized weekly NielsenIQ (NIQ) retail sales data of OTC naloxone for local areas within Kentucky (KY), Massachusetts (MA), New York (NY), and Ohio (OH) during the week ending 9/9/2023 to week ending 4/27/2024, for sales occurring in physical stores (e.g., grocery, pharmacy). We analyzed the percentage of stores selling, average price per kit, and sales. We assessed patterns in local sales by a Social Deprivation Index accounting for poverty, housing, transit, education, and employment. The brand Narcan made up approximately 99 % of all recorded OTC naloxone sales from September 2023 through April 2024. Weekly sales of OTC naloxone in KY, MA, NY, and OH spiked initially in September and October 2023, and stabilized through April 2024. The average price per OTC naloxone kit was $45 across states and brand. Between 5.0 % and 8.6 % of NIQ participating stores in each state sold OTC naloxone. A large proportion of local areas in three states demonstrated high social deprivation and low OTC naloxone sales. OTC naloxone increases access, though the price may deter people with low income, as evidenced by our findings of lower sales among areas with high social deprivation, emphasizing the importance of naloxone access laws, opioid education and naloxone distribution programs, and Medicaid coverage. OTC naloxone creates a new channel for market penetration, satisfying a previously untapped demand, and supports naloxone saturation.",

        "abstract": "Pakistan's highest diabetes prevalence necessitates equitable access to anti-diabetic medicines. This study evaluated the access to Oral antidiabetics (OADs) and the effect of Pakistan's recently launched price deregulation policy-applicable to medicines not included on the National Essential Medicines List (non-NEML)-on their prices and affordability by comparing NEML and non-NEML OADs. A WHO/HAI methodology-based survey in 30 private pharmacies across six regions gathered prices and availability data of 30 OADs, including the Lowest Price Generic (LPG), Highest Price Generic (HPG), and originator brand (OB). These selected OADs consisted of 11 products from NEML and 19 non-NEML products, comprising 17 single-active ingredient and 13 multi-active ingredient formulations. Published and surveyed retail prices of OADs (in Pakistani Rupees, PKR) before and after deregulation were compared, and the policy's effect was determined by difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis. Affordability for the lowest-paid employee and medicine availability in percentages were calculated. The DiD analysis revealed that the unit prices of OADs were significantly increased by PKR 15.08 (OB), PKR 5.89 (HPG), and PKR 2.81 (LPG) (<i>p</i> < 0.05) within just 6 months of the policy's introduction. Medicines listed on the NEML remained consistently cheaper than non-NEML, with differences of -30.20 for OBs, -9.83 for HPGs, and -7.51 for LPGs in PKR (<i>p</i> < 0.001). As per DiD interaction terms (NEML enlistment status × deregulation), a greater increase in prices of non-NEML OBs was observed compared to NEML counterparts (PKR -10.85, <i>p</i> ≈ 0.05), while differences observed for LPGs (PKR 0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.73) and HPGs (PKR -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.95) were insignificant. Prices of both single and multi-active ingredient formulations also increased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Although most OADs had fair availability from 47% to 97% after deregulation, seven out of 30 OADs remained unaffordable at both time points, and the overall affordability declined significantly post-deregulation (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The study revealed significant price escalations for most OADs, particularly those not enlisted on NEML, highlighting access challenges for diabetic patients and necessitating targeted policy reforms that address key market-related factors to ensure equitable access to OADs.",

Anti-obesity medications (AOMs) have become integral to managing obesity, but trends in their utilization and spending within Medicaid remain underexplored. To examine Medicaid's utilization, reimbursement, and price trends for AOMs from 1999 to 2023. A retrospective analysis assessing the utilization, reimbursement, and pricing of older and newer AOMs. Yearly prescription numbers and reimbursement were calculated for seven AOMs billed through Medicaid between 1999 and 2023. The average expenditure per prescription was used as an indicator of drug pricing. AOM prescriptions rose from 13,855 in 1999 to 938,663 in 2023, a 6,674% increase. Spending surged by over 77,805,466% due to the introduction of newer, more effective medications, including Wegovy and tirzepatide. The largest share of the market growth in 2023 was driven by these medications. The significant increase in AOM utilization and spending highlights the growing burden of obesity on Medicaid, emphasizing the need for policy measures to manage rising costs and ensure equitable access to treatment.",

        "abstract": "Drug development costs for orphan and non-orphan drugs range greatly because of variations in market size, legal constraints, and financial incentives. In order to overcome tiny patient populations and high per-patient costs, orphan drugs that target rare diseases frequently need customized techniques. Since non-orphan drugs are intended for larger populations, they require more thorough clinical trials and fierce rivalry in the market. Clinical trial data for orphan and non-orphan drugs authorized between 2010 and 2020 were compared in terms of cost in this study. Trial duration, overall development expenditures, and per-patient costs were important criteria. To estimate cost components, secondary data sources such as industry reports and regulatory filings were consulted. Significant cost drivers and variations were found using statistical analysis. The study show the orphan pharmaceuticals had generally lower overall clinical development costs, the cost per patient was much higher than that of non-orphan drugs. Financial incentives including tax credits and accelerated regulatory processes helped orphan drug trials save money overall. However, non-orphan drugs required more extensive safety and efficacy evaluations and larger Phase III trials, their costs were higher. The study emphasizes orphan and non-orphan drugs have different clinical cost structures and economic trade-offs. The necessity for sustainable financing options is highlighted by the high costs per patient, even as regulatory incentives successfully lower barriers for orphan drug research. The economic impact of drug research costs on various stakeholders, including drug companies, physicians, and lawmakers, enables them to make sound choices regarding resource allocation and investments in drug development. Policymakers and industry stakeholders can use these data to help create fair and effective frameworks for drug development.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems for chemotherapy preparation offer improved accuracy and staff safety but require substantial capital investment. This study assessed the economic performance of a domestically developed robotic chemotherapy compounding system at Udon Thani Cancer Hospital and its service expansion to a network hospital in Thailand. A descriptive study with economic evaluation was conducted, including cost-benefit analysis, unit cost analysis, and break-even analysis from both provider and health system perspectives. Data from fiscal year 2023 were used. Direct and indirect costs were assessed, and clinical outcomes were documented. A scenario-based sensitivity analysis was performed to examine cost variations under different capacity utilisation levels. Robotic preparation had a higher per-dose cost (THB 538 for 4,173 doses) than manual preparation (THB 250 for 20,310 doses), but was associated with total estimated economic benefits of THB 1.88 million, including labour and training savings and improved pharmaceutical care. The break-even point was estimated at 41,802 doses for robotic compounding and 5,122 doses for service expansion. The incremental benefit-cost ratio (IBCR) was 1.566 and increased to 3.018 when including delivery to the network hospital. The robotic system demonstrated potential economic and operational advantages, particularly when scaled to serve additional facilities. These findings offer preliminary evidence to inform future policy considerations under Thailand's Cancer Service Plan. Further evaluation is needed to assess long-term sustainability and broader system-level outcomes.",

        "title": "'Industry still has too loud a voice': expert views on government policy consultations about gambling marketing.",
        "abstract": "Marketing is part of the suite of tactics used by the gambling industry and its allies to promote and normalize gambling. While there have been increased public calls for restrictions on gambling marketing, few governments have developed comprehensive policy responses to counter this public health threat. Consultation processes are widely seen as an important part of public decision-making and policy formation. However, there has been limited focus on these processes in gambling policy development. Using an online qualitative survey this study gathered opinions from 33 experts from Australia, the UK, and the USA (including from local governments, academia, not for profits, and lived experience organizations) about the consultation processes related to gambling marketing policy, and how current processes could be improved. A reflexive approach to thematic analysis was used to construct three themes from the data. First, participants perceived that current consultation processes were inconsistent with public health values and approaches with limited meaningful opportunities for community actors to shape and strengthen policy responses to gambling marketing. Second, participants stated that consultation practices prioritized industry views and concerns, with industry actors (and their allies) having disproportionate access to policymakers and decision-makers. Finally, participants commented that there were few mechanisms to ensure that policy developments related to gambling marketing are protected from vested interests. This paper provides new information about the factors that influence policy decisions about gambling marketing. Mechanisms to protect policy from vested interests are essential in developing comprehensive public health responses to gambling marketing.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Developing countries face significant challenges in accessing high-quality pharmaceutical products due to resource constraints, limited regulatory capacity, and market dynamics that often prioritize cost over quality. This review addresses the critical gap in regulatory frameworks that fail to ensure pharmaceutical quality equity between developed and developing nations. <b>Objective:</b> This comprehensive review examines a novel dual-pathway regulatory framework that leverages stringent regulatory authority (SRA) approvals, artificial intelligence-based evaluation systems, and harmonized pricing mechanisms to ensure pharmaceutical quality equity across global markets. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive systematic analysis of current regulatory challenges, proposed solutions, and implementation strategies was conducted through an extensive literature review (202 sources, 2019-2025), expert consultation on regulatory science, AI implementation in healthcare, and pharmaceutical policy development. The methodology included an analysis of regulatory precedents, an economic impact assessment, and a feasibility evaluation based on existing technological implementations. <b>Results:</b> The proposed framework addresses key regulatory capacity gaps through two complementary pathways: Pathway 1 enables same-batch distribution from SRA-approved products with pricing parity mechanisms. At the same time, Pathway 2 provides independent evaluation using AI-enhanced systems for differentiated products. Key components include indigenous AI development, which requires systematic implementation over 4-6 years across three distinct stages, outsourced auditing frameworks that reduce costs by 40-50%, and quality-first principles that categorically reject cost-based quality compromises. Implementation analysis demonstrates a potential for achieving a 90-95% quality standardization, accompanied by a 200-300% increase in regulatory evaluation capability. <b>Conclusions:</b> This framework has the potential to significantly improve pharmaceutical quality and access in developing countries while maintaining rigorous safety and efficacy standards through innovative regulatory approaches. The evidence demonstrates substantial public health benefits with projected improvements in population access (85-95% coverage), treatment success rates (90-95% efficacy), and economic benefits (USD 15-30 billion in system efficiencies), providing a compelling case for implementation that aligns with global scientific consensus and Sustainable Development Goal 3.8.",

        "abstract": "Financial protection, an important objective of universal health coverage, ensures that individuals can access necessary healthcare without financial hardship. It is typically assessed through two indicators: catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending and impoverishing health spending. Despite the introduction of Georgia's Universal Health Coverage Programme (UHCP) in 2013, which covers nearly 90% of the population, the incidence of impoverishing and catastrophic health spending remains high compared with other European countries and has not changed much over the past decade. This study aims to identify the factors associated with impoverishing health expenditures among Georgian households to inform financing policy decisions and prevent individuals from being driven into or deeper into poverty due to healthcare costs. We used data from the Georgian Household Income and Expenditure Surveys, spanning 2009-2023 (n=198 292 households). A survey-weighted logistic regression accounted for complex design elements such as stratification, clustering and unequal selection probabilities. The outcome variable was impoverishing health spending, defined using the relative poverty line. Andersen's behavioural model of healthcare utilisation guided explanatory variable selection. OOP spending on drugs was the strongest determinant of impoverishment (OR 43.3, 95% CI 39.3 to 47.7, p<0.001). The poorest quintile was especially burdened (OR 44.5, 95% CI 22.1 to 89.7, p<0.001), with the second quintile also at elevated risk. The odds of impoverishment declined from 2009 to 2013-when benefits were targeted to the poor-but rose slightly afterwards. From 2014 to 2023, the average probability of impoverishment was around 0.34, compared with 0.28 in 2013. The findings suggest that targeted benefits before UHCP may have offered stronger protection than the broader, less targeted approach post-2013. Enhanced coverage for outpatient drug costs-especially for the poorest-through increased public investment and progressive benefit expansion could improve financial protection.",

        "abstract": "Gabapentinoids use is accompanied by increased misuse, particularly for pregabalin. In May 2021, France introduced secure prescription requirements for pregabalin. This paper aims to analyse variations in gabapentinoid dispensing, with a focus on changes in prescription rules. We performed an ecological study using the French national health insurance database from January 2012 to December 2023. We analysed pregabalin and gabapentin doses sold by city pharmacies expressed in monthly defined daily dose per thousand inhabitant a day (DDD/TID) between January 2012 and December 2023. Dose sales trends before and after May 2021 were compared using segmented analysis of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models. Descriptive analysis was performed to analyse associated expenses expressed in euros. Between 2012 and 2020, pregabalin doses sold rose from 3.228 DDD/TID to 4.908 DDD/TID. After the reform, they declined to 3.923 DDD/TID in 2023. Gabapentin doses sold increased from 1.042 DDD/TID to 1.257 DDD/TID between 2012 and 2020, then rose further post-reform, reaching 1.705 DDD/TID. Costs related to the pregabalin doses sold decreased from €132.47 to €51.36 million from 2012 to 2023. Costs related to gabapentin decrease from €32.31 to €26.84 million between 2012 and 2021, then increase to €37.70 million in 2023. These data suggest that the May 2021 reform has reduced pregabalin consumption and induced an increase of gabapentin use. Cost implications remain of difficult interpretation due to multiple confounding factors. Further research could clarify these trends and be used to optimize prescription practices.",

        "abstract": "To estimate effects of a policy introducing universal, no-cost public coverage for prescription contraception on use in British Columbia, Canada. Population based, controlled, interrupted time series analysis. 10 Canadian provinces. Prescription medications dispensed to reproductive aged (15-49 years) female residents of British Columbia, Canada, compared with a synthetic control derived from the nine other Canadian provinces and a population based cohort of 859 845 female individuals in British Columbia (age 15-49 years) between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2024. Introduction of a universal contraception coverage policy in April 2023, where the public insurer pays 100% of prescription costs. Number of monthly dispensations for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and number of monthly dispensations for all forms of prescription contraception (including LARC), percentage of reproductive aged female residents using LARC and using all forms of prescription contraception, and the proportion of people using prescription contraception who use LARC (LARC market share). Segmented regression models were used to estimate policy effects by comparing the expected outcome values after 15 months of the policy (ie, the counterfactual, derived from trends before the policy and changes in the control) with the observed values, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated using bootstrapping. In April 2021, 3249 (95% CI 3066 to 3391) LARC prescriptions were dispensed in British Columbia, with a declining slope trend of -17 (-30 to -7) fewer dispensed per month before the policy. Monthly LARC dispensations increased by 1050 (942 to 1487) immediately after British Columbia's policy change and saw a steady increasing trend after the policy introduction. An additional 1273 (963 to 1698) monthly LARC prescriptions were dispensed 15 months after policy implementation compared with the expected volume, representing an estimated 1.49-fold (1.34 to 1.77) increase. Dispensations for all prescription contraception (including LARC) increased by 1981 (356 to 3324) per month, representing a 1.04-fold (1.01 to 1.07) increase. Among the 859 845 female residents aged 15-49 years in the population, 9.1% were using LARC in April 2021. 15 months after the policy, 11 375 (10 273 to 13 013) more individuals were using LARC than expected without the policy, representing an additional 1.3% (1.2% to 1.5%) of the population. The policy led to an additional 1.7% (1.5% to 2.3%) of the population using any prescription contraception. 15 months after the policy, the LARC market share was 1.9% (1.2% to 2.3%) higher than expected. Universal, no-cost public coverage in British Columbia increased prescription contraception use overall, driven by increased LARC use. As such, cost seems to be an important contributor to contraception use and method selection at the population level.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines how symbolic violence contributes to the persistence of geographic inequalities in deaths of despair (DoD), those from drug, suicide, and alcohol-specific mortality, in two deindustrialised towns in North East England. Although there is evidence that DoD are driven by structural determinants, such as economic policies, inadequate social safety nets, and poverty, less is known about how these determinants are ideologically obscured. Drawing on qualitative data collected from 30 residents of Middlesbrough and South Tyneside, two towns with above average rates of DoD, the analysis explores how symbolic violence, in the form of moralisation, stigma, and downstream interventions, frames behaviours as individual failings, downplays structural determinants, and sustains inaction while maintaining the appearance of intervention. By diverting attention away from the root causes of DoD, symbolic violence functions as a mechanism through which these inequalities are reproduced. By highlighting the cultural and ideological processes that allow structural determinants to go unaddressed, this study deepens our understanding of how inequalities in these deaths are sustained and legitimised in marginalised places. The findings point to the need for future interventions to not only improve material conditions but also critically engage with the symbolic forces that reinforce geographic disparities in DoD.",

        "abstract": "Although taxes that raise retail tobacco prices and industry-initiated price increases have been shown to decrease tobacco consumption, the scarcity of studies in Latin America and the Caribbean using household- or individual-level data in existing reviews limits their policy relevance. To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between prices and taxes and the use of tobacco products in Latin America and the Caribbean. We searched six electronic bibliographic databases, two online search engines, two working paper repositories, and hand-searched seven journals. We included all quantitative studies that used any measures of individual or household tobacco use as an outcome, written in English, Portuguese or Spanish. We used random-effects meta-analyses to pool results across studies. We found consistent evidence that in Latin American countries, higher cigarette prices were associated with lower cigarette smoking participation, consumption and initiation and that effect sizes were large enough to be policy meaningful. Pooled own-price elasticities indicate that higher prices were associated with a less than proportional decrease in tobacco use (pooled own-price elasticities, participation: 0.14 [95% CI -0.22, -0.06]; consumption: 0.54 [95% CI -0.75, -0.34]; total: 0.75 [95% CI -1.14, -0.36]). We found no consistent evidence that socioeconomic status, age, sex, rurality, or geographic regions affected price responsiveness. Our review confirms that taxes that raise tobacco prices can effectively lower tobacco use. Moreover, raising tobacco prices through increased taxes is anticipated to boost tax revenue due to the inelastic nature of the demand for tobacco.",

This study examines factors influencing rebates in the United States, focusing on specialty drugs-ie, high priced therapies (often biologics) for which payers issue specific coverage policies. Rebate data came from SSR Health and drug attributes from the Tufts Medical Center Specialty Drug Evidence and Coverage Database. We stratified rebate data by drug type and characteristics. We identified 161 drugs found in SSR Health and SPEC as of December 2023. We found that rebates vary substantially across drugs (median of 27%, IQR 16%-53%). Biosimilar and originator drugs have the highest, most variable rebates (median of 71%, IQR 53%-79%), while rebates for cancer treatments and orphan drugs are lower (medians of 19% and 23%, respectively) and vary less (IQR of 12%-28% and 14%-29%, respectively). Drugs that face more competition from alternative options within the same therapeutic class, are self-administered, or received Food and Drug Administration approval further in the past have higher rebates. Our findings indicate that rebates are sizeable and vary along several dimensions, many relating to market competition, complicating policy discussions around drug pricing.",

        "abstract": "Despite policy interest in pharmaceutical innovation, little is known about the investment needed for venture capital-backed startups to develop innovative biologics, a growing segment of the pharmaceutical marketplace. In a cross-sectional analysis of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approval data, investment deal records, and clinical trials data, we estimated the investment needed for a biotechnology startup company to independently develop a biologic approved by the US FDA with priority review, an indicator of innovation. To isolate a homogenous set of cases, the sample focused on independent drug development of 13 drugs by 9 biotechnology startup companies that retained ownership of the drug from the start of development to FDA approval without being acquired or licensing the product. We found that the median investment per FDA-approved biologic was $304.1 million (IQR: $289.9-$790.3 million) in uncapitalized costs, accounting for the cost of failures. This estimate represents the direct drug R&D investment needed for independent development of innovative biologic products by biotechnology startup companies.",

        "abstract": "Economic evaluations are helpful for efficient resource use. This paper aims to clarify the relationship between economic evaluation methods and two types of health care efficiency, aiding implementation scientists in selecting the appropriate approach for their research. We clarify the connection between cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and allocative efficiency, and explain how budget impact analysis (BIA) more closely connects with productive efficiency. We also discuss other methods that researchers can use to analyze an organization's productive efficiency, given increasing pressure for health care organizations to be efficient. Allocative efficiency seeks to maximize social welfare through optimal resource distribution. Productive efficiency focuses on an organization's ability to maximize its output given its resource constraints. CEA, particularly when incorporating a societal perspective, assesses allocative efficiency. BIA, which often has a short time horizon and more focused perspective, assesses productive efficiency. When organizational leaders ask implementation scientists for an economic evaluation, it is important to determine whether they want a CEA or a BIA, given they answer different questions, often employing different methods. We also present other methods for measuring efficiency and causes of inefficiency stemming from fixed costs, scale, scope, regulations, labor, and decision-making. Implementation scientists must recognize that CEA and BIA serve distinct purposes and are not interchangeable. Choosing the right economic evaluation tool is crucial for answering specific research questions and building research teams. Future implementation work will also need to measure efficiency so that it is sustainable.",

        "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, 20-40% of people living with HIV present with advanced HIV disease (AHD), which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented using a package of care recommended by WHO. We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

        "abstract": "To estimate the cost-effectiveness of Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r) versus best supportive care (BSC) in patients at high-risk for progression to severe COVID-19 from a German health payer perspective. A closed cohort static model of 1,000 COVID-19 patients capturing the short-term (<1 year) <i>via</i> decision-tree and long-term (lifetime) outcomes <i>via</i> Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of NMV/r versus BSC. Model inputs were derived from the EPIC-HR clinical trial and published contemporary real-world data. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses (PSA, DSA) were conducted to test the robustness of model results. In the base case, treatment with NMV/r versus BSC reduced COVID-19 related hospitalisations (-0.042), intensive care unit admissions (-0.006) and inpatient deaths (-0.003), while increasing life-years (LY) (0.047) per patient, which results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10,845 € per hospitalisation avoided and 9,773 € per LY gained. Sensitivity analysis suggests the magnitude of the benefits increased with increasing hospitalisation risk. NMV/r emerged as the dominant strategy in a population with a hospitalisation risk equivalent to 60 years and older. Outcomes were similar with real world effectiveness data. DSA showed the model was most sensitive to hospitalisation and inpatient mortality risk, NMV/r medication cost and efficacy/effectiveness of NMV/r in reducing hospitalisation. PSA confirmed the robustness of the model results. As COVID-19 is a dynamic disease, caution should be taken in generalizing these results. Contemporary data is essential to ensure the model inputs and the outcomes remain relevant as there may be changes in natural disease course or effectiveness of NMV/r. This cost-effectiveness analysis of NMV/r treatment from a German healthcare payer perspective demonstrates how by preventing progression to severe COVID-19, NMV/r reduces healthcare resource use, associated costs and preserves LY of patients. This analysis provides crucial economic rationale for decision making by policy makers.",

        "abstract": "Recent concerns over rising drug prices have focused on the role of pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs. While multiple players make up the pharmaceutical supply chain, PBMs are the conductors who effectively decide which drugs are covered and at what cost. Most PBM contracts tie their compensation to a percentage of a drug's list price, creating a financial incentive to favor high-cost, high-rebate drugs on plan formularies at the expense of lower-cost generics and biosimilars. Furthermore, the PBM industry is highly concentrated and vertically integrated with the country's largest health insurers, making it even harder to assess PBM performance and profitability. A simple analysis of annual drug spending at different reporting levels provides important insight into where the money goes and where savings could be achieved. We find that simply delinking compensation to the list price of a drug throughout the supply chain could reduce annual drug spending by more than $95b or nearly 15% of net spending without adversely affecting manufacturers' incentive to innovate.",

        "abstract": "Despite price advantages, local direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C (hep C) have not been widely used in China compared with the imported ones. There is no evidence on their relative efficacy and safety, nor whether the small market share of local DAAs was attributable to the potential differences. This study systematically evaluated the efficacy and safety evidence of 5 local and 6 imported DAAs with valid Chinese registration numbers as of January 25, 2024. Meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to synthesize evidence and compared the outcomes by using the random-effects empirical Bayes model. Nineteen randomized controlled trials and 82 single-arm trials (SATs) were included. The results demonstrated no statistically significant difference in 12-week sustained virological response [0.97, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 0.99) vs 0.96, (95% CI: 0.94, 0.98), P = 0.21], relapse [0.02, (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04) vs 0.02, (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03), P = 0.65], virological breakthrough [0.003, (95% CI: < 0.001, 0.02) vs 0.0000002, (95% CI: < 0.001, 0.0006), P = 0.51] and serious adverse events (SAEs) [0.04, (95% CI: 0.03, 0.06) vs 0.03, (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03), P = 0.12] between local and imported DAAs. By controlling for ethnicities of patients in multiple meta-regression, the local DAAs had a 33.7% higher rate of adverse events (AEs) [0.337, (95% CI: 0.188, 0.486), P < 0.001]. No statistically significant difference was found in the interaction test between local and imported pan-genotypic DAAs regarding the rate of AEs [0.72, (95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) vs 0.73, (95% CI: 0.65, 0.50), P = 0.81]. Current evidence demonstrates no statistically significant differences in efficacy and SAEs between local and imported DAAs. Given that simplified pan-genotypic DAA regimens are now standard care, local pan-genotypic DAAs hold potential to increase hepatitis C virus treatment rates in China. It is critical for local DAA developers to generate more evidence with expanded patient population in terms of age, treatment experience and genotype of hepatitis C virus, conducting head-to-head studies directly comparing the efficacy and safety. Clinical and policy decision-making should be adaptive and evolve as new evidence is generated.",

        "abstract": "The quality of care that patients receive in the private sector has been reported to be poor. Madhya Pradesh began adopting the PPSA model in September 2020, initially covering 44 districts. By April 2022, the state achieved 100% coverage, becoming the first state in the country to implement PPSA across all 52 districts. Although PPSA is now operational in every district, health indicators in the private sector have shown little improvement, and notifications from the private sector remain significantly below the annual targets The patient provider support agency (PPSA) pilot program has demonstrated newer strategies for private sector engagement to be able to deliver significant outcomes. the study explores the strengths and limitations of the private sector engagement model from the healthcare providers' perspective. This was a mixed-methods study in which both quantitative and qualitative data were simultaneously collected. Quantitative data collection (using routinely collected programmatic data) is supported by qualitative data collection (in-depth interviews). This study was conducted to study the impact of the PPSA service implementation model on notification status, patient care activities and outcomes through record review among all 52 districts of Madhya Pradesh between October 2020-December 2022 as well as to explore the strengths and limitations of the PPSA model from the healthcare providers' perspectives using a mixed-methods approach. There was a increase in the number of TB patients notified in the private sector (62%), number of patients receiving benefits of the Nikshay Poshan Yojna through Direct Bank Transfer (91%), number of patients tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (100%), Diabetes, and universal drug susceptibility testing (25%), as well as successful treatment outcomes in the post-PPSA period as compared to the pre-PPSA period. Seventeen in-depth interviews of health care providers from the public (n = 8) and private sector (n = 9) highlighted the operational challenges and solutions to implementation of the PPSA. Inadequate Human resource, poor coordination with NTEP Staff, poor mapping of PP's, mobile based counselling & limited home visit to TB patients were the perceived challenges and regular support to the private health facilities and MIS data, trainings and hand-holding, supportive supervision from the State, and strict need based tendering policies were few of the suggestions to improve the PPSA model were some of the solutions. The implementation of the Patient Provider Support Agency (PPSA) model in Madhya Pradesh has not only improved notification rates and successful treatment outcomes but also strengthened the overall engagement of private healthcare providers in TB management. Enhanced collaboration, regular facility mapping, and sustained educational efforts have led to a more robust approach to TB care that extends across both public and private sectors. While challenges such as funding inconsistencies and service delivery fluctuations highlight areas for further improvement, the overall success of the PPSA model in Madhya Pradesh provides a promising framework for other regions aiming to enhance TB care through public-private partnerships. Future efforts should focus on addressing the identified gaps and scaling up these successful practices to ensure high-quality care for all TB patients, irrespective of where they seek treatment.",

Qualitative study. Participants were leaders and high-level employees from large health insurance organizations in the US. Our aim was to survey 20 participants, 10 from organizations that covered IMWM and 10 that excluded coverage for IMWM. Participants completed a 30-minute interview. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using directed content analysis. Twenty individuals completed an interview; 9 interviewees were from organizations that covered IMWM at the time of the study, and 11 were from organizations that excluded coverage for IMWM. We identified 5 key themes: (1) high cost as the primary barrier to coverage of IMWM, (2) perception of obesity as a lifestyle choice, (3) current or planned use of varied utilization management strategies to limit initial and ongoing prescribing of IMWM, (4) coverage for lifestyle-change programs to support weight management, and (5) perceived responsibility of pharmaceutical companies to lower list prices for IMWM to enable broad coverage and advance health equity. High cost of IMWM is the primary limiting factor in coverage policies. There is variability in plan design, with utilization management strategies that aim to reduce near-term spending. Health plan leaders call on pharmaceutical companies to reduce list prices to increase equitable access to IMWM.",

        "abstract": "Benmelstobart and anlotinib plus etoposide-carboplatin (EC) group has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in improving survival outcomes for patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). However, the high treatment cost raises concerns regarding its affordability and cost-effectiveness across healthcare systems with heterogeneous pricing and reimbursement mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of benmelstobart and anlotinib plus EC group compared to EC alone group and anlotinib plus EC group from both US and Chinese payer perspectives. The findings are intended to inform value-based pricing strategies and evidence-based reimbursement decision-making. A partitioned survival model (PSM) with a lifetime horizon and 21-day cycles was constructed using clinical data from the ETER701 trial. Direct medical costs and health utility inputs were obtained from national databases, local hospitals, and published literature. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated by comparing costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between treatment strategies. Scenario analyses, including drug price simulations and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, were conducted to evaluate model robustness. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were set at $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY (US) and $40,011/QALY (China). In the US, the benmelstobart and anlotinib plus EC group yielded ICER of $121,560.40/QALY versus EC alone group and $127,579.09/QALY versus anlotinib plus EC group, both below the $150,000/QALY threshold. However, at the $100,000/QALY threshold, cost-effectiveness would require reducing benmelstobart's price to $1316.12/600 mg. In China, the ICER of $117,667.17/QALY exceeded the local threshold. Price simulations suggested that cost-effectiveness could be achieved if prices were reduced below $2230.60/600 mg (US) and $328.47/600 mg (China). Sensitivity analyses identified progression-free survival (PFS) utility and benmelstobart pricing as major cost drivers. Probabilistic analysis indicated a 75.1% probability of cost-effectiveness at $150,000/QALY in the US. However, the probability of cost-effectiveness is 0% at WTP thresholds of $100,000/QALY in the US and $40,011/QALY in China. Benmelstobart plus anlotinib and EC group is likely to be cost-effective in the US at a WTP threshold of $150,000/QALY, but not in China at current prices. An 80% price reduction in China would be necessary to align with its WTP threshold, emphasizing the need for policy interventions in drug pricing and reimbursement to improve patient access.",

        "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) is an opportunistic infection frequently seen in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and can cause blindness. Intravenous (IV) ganciclovir is a typical CMVR treatment in Thailand, but oral valganciclovir is a more convenient alternative. However, its cost-effectiveness and budget impact remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the cost-utility and budget impact of oral valganciclovir compared with IV ganciclovir for CMVR treatment in PLHIV in Thailand. A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to estimate costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and life years (LYs). Cost, utility, and probability parameters were obtained from the published literature and national databases. A cost-utility analysis was performed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, whereas a budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed to assess the financial implications. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess model uncertainty. Oral valganciclovir was the dominant treatment, providing higher QALYs (3.50 vs. 3.23) and LYs (4.78 vs. 4.75) and lower total costs (133,630 THB vs. 163,024 THB) than IV ganciclovir. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that retinal detachment probability, drug cost, and inpatient service cost were the most influential parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that 94.3% of the simulations placed oral valganciclovir in the dominant quadrant. BIA revealed an annual cost reduction of 6,408,714 THB when replacing IV ganciclovir with oral valganciclovir. Oral valganciclovir was cost-effective and demonstrated budget reduction compared with IV ganciclovir. These findings provide valuable insights into enhancing CMVR management and ensuring efficient healthcare resource allocation.",

A cross-sectional survey employing mystery shoppers to purposively sample the widest possible range of amoxicillin products available to patients across different areas in Indonesia. Licensed and unlicensed medicine outlets in remote, rural and urban areas and online. Amoxicillin products that are sold to patients as oral solid and dry liquid formulations. Quality of amoxicillin products, assessed using compendial testing of active pharmaceutical ingredient content and dissolution. Samples that failed any quality test were classified as substandard or out-of-specification (OOS). The raw prevalence of substandard amoxicillin was adjusted based on the national market volume of each product variant. We surveyed 476 outlets, mostly pharmacies (68.5%), websites (19.7%) and drug stores (10.9%). Among the 120 collected samples, there were 59 distinct products, collectively representing 95% of the estimated market volume for oral solid products and 65% for dry syrups. 12 out of 110 oral solid samples tested OOS (10.9%), as did 3 out of 10 dry syrups (30%). The samples that failed originated from various areas and types of outlets. We found no relation between the price and quality of amoxicillin. The oral solid amoxicillin products that tested OOS represent an estimated 12.7% of the national market volume. We found no relation between the price and quality of amoxicillin. Combining product-variety sampling with data on market volume presents a promising approach to gain insight into the prevalence of poor-quality medical products using a relatively small sample size.",

        "abstract": "Prior research indicated low genotypic resistance testing (GRT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) utilization in China due to partial cost coverage under national antiretroviral therapy policies, limited testing accessibility, and financial barriers. Temporal and spatial data on GRT trends were also scarce. We analyzed GRT patterns among 6,895 untreated individuals at a tertiary hospital using Joinpoint regression, multivariable logistic modeling, and spatial analysis (GeoDa/SatScan). GRT rates showed a significant two-phase upward trend, increasing from 5.36 % in 2014 to 74.17 % in 2023, with an average annual percentage change of 31.30 % (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Beijing residency (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.596, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2.307-2.921) and older age were associated with higher GRT uptake. Specifically, ages 35-44 years (aOR = 1.207, 95 % CI: 1.026-1.420), 45-54 years (aOR = 1.335, 95 % CI: 1.104-1.613), and ≥ 55 years (aOR = 1.424, 95 % CI: 1.126-1.802) had significantly higher odds of testing. Lower testing rates were observed in individuals with lower education attainment (high school or technical secondary: aOR = 0.827; junior high school: aOR = 0.835; primary school: aOR = 0.695), unknown sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) history (aOR = 0.415), and non-heterosexual transmission routes (homosexual: aOR = 0.834). Spatial analysis identified GRT clustering across Beijing until 2021, with two space-time clusters identified in 2019-2023 and 2018-2022. This study demonstrates substantial increase in GRT uptake achieving more balanced district-level distribution since 2021. Age, educational attainment, STDs history, and transmission route influence GRT utilization. Improving access, reducing costs, and implementing targeted interventions are critical for optimizing testing and guiding antiretroviral therapy decisions.",

        "abstract": "Off-label prescribing-when medications are used for indications not approved by the Food and Drug Administration-is widespread in the US health care system. This study used trazodone, a drug approved in 1981 for depression, as a case study to examine broader issues surrounding off-label utilization and spending. Although only approved to treat depression, trazodone is frequently prescribed off-label for indications of uncertain clinical value (insomnia, anxiety). Using nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we estimated that approximately 24 million trazodone prescriptions were filled in 2019, with health care spending of $294 million. At least 85% of prescriptions (∼20 million) and 84% of spending ($247 million) were for off-label indications, primarily insomnia. Health plan reimbursement per prescription was nearly identical for on-label and off-label use, despite the significant evidence gap. These findings illustrate the scale and inefficiency of off-label prescribing and highlight challenges facing clinicians, patients, and payers. We propose a set of policy solutions-including public and private investment in evidence generation, pricing drugs to account for off-label use, and value-based reimbursement-to advance a more efficient system of off-label use. Trazodone presents a revealing case of the broader systemic problem of off-label prescribing for indications of uncertain clinical value.",

This study aims to assess the utilization and influence factors of anticancer drugs under NDPN policy in China. Gastric cancer patients within chemotherapy were included. Independent variables were measured by age, gender, insurance type, total medical expenditure (THE), length of stay (LOS), drug-to-total-expense ratio (DTR). The primary outcomes were negotiated drugs usage, costs and treatment outcome. Two-part model was used to identify influence factors of anticancer drugs utilization. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was employed to evaluate the impact of negotiated drug utilization on treatment outcomes among inpatients. The sample included 9868 gastric cancer patients from three cities. Outpatient patients demonstrated limited utilization of negotiated drugs (1.33%). Patients aged 61-75 (β=0.923, P < 0.01) and over 75 years (β=0.946, P < 0.05) were more likely to use negotiated drugs. Key factors influencing inpatient drug utilization included medical insurance type (β=-0.245, P<0.01), LOS (β=-0.122, P<0.001), and the DTR (=0.037, P<0.001). The use of negotiated drugs had no significant effect on treatment outcomes. Their limited utilization of negotiated drugs for outpatients arises an urgent necessity for more comprehensive insurance coverage, and the no significant outcome effect dedicated the importance to rigorously validate the effectiveness of these drugs with abundant real-world evidence in the foreseeable future.",

In the United States, neglected tropical diseases such as Chagas, soil-transmitted helminthiases, and other infections historically affected immigrants but are increasingly relevant for US residents with climate change. We examined the pricing, prescribing rates, and supply of therapies used to treat neglected tropical diseases in the United States and their implications for accessibility and patient care. A retrospective analysis of prescription rates, wholesale acquisition costs, and shortages was conducted for 11 treatment products from 2019 to 2024, aggregating data from Symphony Metys, First Databank, NAVLIN, Red Book, and the University of Utah Drug Information Service. While prices for most neglected tropical diseases were stable, albendazole prices decreased by 78% while mebendazole prices rose by 60%. Miltefosine remained expensive at $48 000 per treatment course. There are limited manufacturers of neglected tropical disease treatments in the United States, increasing vulnerability to shortages. Addressing pricing irregularities and supply vulnerabilities requires legislative and policy interventions to enhance generic competition, expand public manufacturing, and strengthen supply chains. Such measures are critical to ensuring affordable and accessible treatment options for neglected tropical diseases in the United States.",

This study quantified the impact of the pandemic on disease-specific measures of health dynamics, such as mortality rates, healthcare resource utilization (HRU), and disease burden. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed by examining temporal trends across disease categories over two periods: pre-pandemic and pandemic (after January 2020). Monthly mortality data were collected from 31 countries, while monthly HRU and disease burden data were collected from South Korea. We defined primary outcomes as disease-specific mortality rate, number of patients, outpatient visits, days of hospitalization, disease burden, and per capita cost. We used a generalized least squares model with AR (1) residuals and an automated SARIMA model and Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted q-values were applied for statistical significance (q < 0.05). A significant increase in disease-specific mortality was observed across multiple countries, with circulatory diseases showing the most widespread rise. HRU declined across most disease categories, including reductions in patient numbers, outpatient visits, and hospital stays; however, patient number showed sustained increase in neoplasm and mental disorder. Although changes in total direct medical costs varied by disease, per capita costs initially increased despite a decrease in the number of patients. The pandemic led to increased mortality and disease burden with limited access to healthcare services. Establishing resilient healthcare systems and appropriate public health policies are key to ensure continuity of care during national crises.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), semaglutide, tirzepatide, and HBI compared to no treatment in preventing cardiometabolic complications among Canadian adults with class III obesity. We developed a cohort-based Markov model with a 40-year time horizon. We examined cardiometabolic complications in 40-year-olds with class III obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) without type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease at baseline. We compared SG, RYGB, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 15 mg, HBI, and no treatment. We obtained data on treatment effects, probabilities, utilities, and costs from published literature. We expressed effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and estimated costs from a Canadian public payer perspective. Outcomes included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) evaluated at a CAD $50 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. RYGB and HBI were cost-effective strategies. HBI was cost-effective versus no treatment (ICER $14 279/QALY). RYGB demonstrated the highest QALYs (20.20) and was the most cost-effective strategy versus tirzepatide (ICER $44 667/QALY). Semaglutide and SG were strongly dominated due to higher costs and lower effectiveness. Tirzepatide was extendedly dominated by RYGB. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings and showed that lower drug prices could improve pharmacotherapy cost-effectiveness. RYGB and HBI are cost-effective for managing class III obesity. While RYGB provided the greatest health gains, access remains limited. Neither pharmacotherapy was cost-effective at current prices.

        "abstract": "The RENOTORCH trial found that toripalimab plus axitinib extended progression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), though its financial burden may limit widespread use. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of toripalimab plus axitinib compared with sunitinib monotherapy as a first-line therapy for patients with previously untreated or intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC from a US third-party payer perspective. A three-state partitioned survival model (progression-free, progression, death) was utilized, with clinical outcomes obtained from the RENOTORCH trial. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were modeled using various parametric functions over a 5-year horizon, applying a 3% annual discount rate. Costs of treatments, administration, monitoring, and management of grade 3/4 adverse events (≥ 5% occurrence) were sourced from Micromedex® and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) databases. Life years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental costs per LY and QALY were estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Subgroup analyses for intermediate- and poor-risk patients, as classified by the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria, were performed using similar methods. Toripalimab plus axitinib increased total costs by $332,359, gained 0.68 LY and 0.36 QALY compared with sunitinib, resulting in incremental costs of $489,747 per LY and $923,962 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental cost per QALY was most sensitive to changes in toripalimab plus axitinib's cost. At a $150,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed a nearly 0% probability of toripalimab plus axitinib being cost-effective. Similarly, toripalimab plus axitinib was still not cost-effective for intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Compared with sunitinib monotherapy, our study suggested that toripalimab plus axitinib was not cost-effective for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma from a US third-party payer perspective. Further analyses are warranted when more data are available. Despite benefits across different risk groups, toripalimab plus axitinib was not cost-effective for intermediate- and poor-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "A growing number of US states have legalized adult \"recreational\" cannabis; however, there is little evidence on the impact of cannabis policies on cannabis marketing exposure to date. The current study examined marketing exposure in the US, including differences between states where cannabis is illegal ('illegal' states), legal for medical use ('medical'), and legal for recreational use ('recreational'). Data are from the US component of the International Cannabis Policy Study: national repeat cross-sectional data from surveys conducted with 187,573 respondents aged 16-65 over 6 annual survey waves (2018-2023). Adjusted mixed effects logistic regression (GLIMMIX) models examined differences in self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing ('noticing') by state-level cannabis laws. Self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing differed across policy changes. Noticing cannabis marketing was lowest in illegal states and increased in the first 12-months following medical legalization (35.4 % vs. 39.2 %: AOR=1.16; 95 % CI=1.01-1.33; p = 0.034). Noticing marketing was highest in 'recreational' states, with increases in the first 12-months following legalization (50.0 % vs. 41.1 %: AOR=1.41; 95 % CI=1.34-1.48; p < .001), and additional increases 1-3 years (56.2 %: AOR=1.20; 95 % CI=1.14-1.25; p < .001) and 4 or more years following legalization (63.9 %: AOR=1.21; 95 % CI=1.16-1.27; p < .001). Noticing was highest among people who consume cannabis and younger ages. Self-reported exposure to cannabis marketing increases following medical and recreational legalization and is disproportionately noticed by underaged people.

This study analyzes direct costs and cost drivers of perioperative and adjuvant systemic treatments for stage I-II NSCLC from Jordanian healthcare providers' perspective using micro-costing methodology. We employed micro-costing to analyze direct medical expenses including drug acquisition, preparation, administration, pre/post-medications, diagnostics, labor, and wastage costs for perioperative regimens used in stage I-II NSCLC. International guidelines defined therapeutic regimens, while drug prices were extracted from Jordan Food and Drug Administration's database. Published data and surveys quantified micro-costs. Among 26 assessed regimens (2 targeted therapy, 10 chemotherapy, 10 chemo-immunotherapy, 4 immunotherapy), targeted/immunotherapy agents significantly increased costs. Chemotherapy regimen cost differences ranged from $633.68 (squamous) to $1,763.91 (non-squamous) per cycle. Antineoplastic agents were primary cost drivers, highest for Durvalumab (98.72% of cycle cost). Laboratory costs comprised up to 50.73% in chemotherapy and 7.24% in immunotherapy regimens. Wastage contributed up to 10.36% of total cycle costs. Average administration cost was $35 per cycle. Maximum cycle costs were: targeted therapy (Osimertinib) $7,206.44, immunotherapy (Durvalumab) $9,057.71, immune-chemotherapy (Durvalumab-Carboplatin-Pemetrexed) $11,358.43, and chemotherapy (Carboplatin-Pemetrexed) $2,300.72. Our results highlight the substantial economic impact and cost variability among treatment regimens. This variability presents opportunities for cost reduction through careful selection of therapeutically equivalent regimens based on pricing and toxicity profiles. The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive and precise cost analysis to inform healthcare policies and clinical practices. Future research should focus on cost-effectiveness analyses of these expensive agents to ensure value for money, support evidence-based decision-making, and strengthen price negotiations with suppliers.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, China has witnessed a remarkable digital health movement, wherein online pharmacies or drug e-commerce have emerged as disruptive business models. In 2019, China amended the Drug Administration Law to permit the online sale of prescription drugs to customers, albeit with certain limitations. This marked China's first national congress-level regulatory policy on online pharmacy regulation. The policy comprises two sub-policies: one targeting third-party online platforms involved in drug sales and another aimed at controlled drugs and other drugs under special administration that are prohibited from being sold online. However, this regulatory policy has sparked legal and ethical debates. The first revolves around whether or not online platforms engaged in drug sales can enjoy liability protection and to what extent; while the second centers on an ethical dilemma concerning access to controlled drugs due to their blanket ban on online sales. This article thoroughly examines the aforementioned regulatory policy. Moreover, during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there was a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) applications within China's healthcare sector, leading to phenomenal growth of AI-driven online pharmacies staffed by so-called AI doctors and pharmacists. The article outlines a future research agenda for regulating emerging AI-enabled online pharmacies in the post-pandemic age before concluding.",

Employing Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology on quarterly data from A-share listed pharmaceutical firms (2003-2021, sourced from WIND/CSMAR databases), we demonstrate that NCDP participation significantly reduces Total Factor Productivity . Robustness is confirmed through index substitution, propensity score matching, and lag tests. The negative effect is amplified in non-state-owned enterprises, non-TCM manufacturers, and firms with high analyst coverage. Mechanistically, NCDP suppresses TFP through: (i) tightened financing constraints (↑KZ index) impairing capital allocation efficiency, and (ii) an indirect pathway where short-term R&D surges (↑RD) trigger resource crowding-out effects, compounded by diminished investment efficiency (↑INV), ultimately forming an \"R&D→investment inefficiency→TFP↓\" transmission chain. To reconcile public welfare objectives with corporate sustainability, we propose dual optimization strategies: <i>differentiated financing support</i> and <i>innovation incentive reform</i>. These establish a sustainable equilibrium between price control and TFP enhancement, providing actionable solutions for nationwide NCDP scaling.",

Specialty medications, particularly biologics, have transformed dermatologic care but are expensive and may be factors in disproportionate growth in spending. To assess the role of specialty medications in Medicare Part D drug spending among physician dermatologists and dermatology-focused advanced practice clinicians (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) from 2013 to 2022. This economic analysis used Medicare Part D prescriber data on drug prescriptions from 2013 to 2022 to report on prescription drug claims from physician dermatologists and dermatology-focused advanced practice clinicians, identified using validated administrative claims-based definitions. Data were analyzed from December 17, 2024, to May 31, 2025. Prescription volumes, average prices, and the introduction of new drugs. The primary outcome was growth in inflation-adjusted total dermatology drug spending, decomposed by specialty status, prescriptions, prices, and US Food and Drug Administration approval year assessed from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Part D prescriber data from 2013 to 2022. In 94 900 359 drug claims from 24 731 dermatology care professionals, inflation-adjusted Medicare Part D spending increased by 16.1% annually, from $768 million in 2013 to $2.95 billion in 2022. Specialty medications contributed 98.4% of this growth, increasing from 30.8% of all dermatology drug spending in 2013 to 80.9% in 2022, despite being only 2.9% of prescriptions. Average inflation-adjusted prices per 30-day prescription for specialty medications increased by 5.1% per year, from $3738 in 2013 to $5872 in 2022. In contrast, prices for nonspecialty medications decreased by 5.3% annually relative to inflation, from $68 in 2013 to $42 in 2022. Most of the growth in specialty medication spending was due to increased prescribing (80.5%) rather than higher prices (19.5%). New therapies approved after 2013 (Otezla, Cosentyx, Taltz, Dupixent, Tremfya, Skyrizi, and Odomzo) accounted for 69.5% of all spending growth. Prescription rates increased more slowly for older specialty drugs (Humira, Enbrel, Stelara, and Erivedge), but their prices increased more (9.2% annually) than prices for newer agents. Results of this economic evaluation suggest that specialty medications have become a substantial factor in dermatology drug spending. While the price of the average dermatologic medication has increased rapidly, this primarily reflects increased prescribing of newly introduced specialty drugs. While these therapies expand treatment options, their rising share of costs highlights the need for policies that balance innovation, access, and affordability.",

We characterized clinic flow and implementation costs of POC adherence testing for persons initiating ART in HIV care clinics in South Africa. We conducted a microcosting within a randomized controlled implementation trial of POC TFV test in government clinics in Durban, South Africa (STREAM HIV). Time-and-motion observation was conducted between 1st March and 31st December 2022, to assess staff and client time needed for POC TFV testing and counselling. We estimated both financial and economic costs for capital, clinic consumables and personnel using a provider (national government) perspective. The estimated cost of POC TFV was USD $13 per client, assuming a clinic volume of 20 individuals initiating ART per month. The largest component costs of POC TFV testing were the test strip consumables, which accounted for 53% of the test cost. The median total time of a clinic visit with a POC TFV test, starting from client registration, was 49:19 (minutes: seconds) (IQR: 29:19-89:35). TFV testing took 9:22 (IQR: 7:35-14:11), taking up 19% of the total clinic visit time, including sample collection, sample loading, TFV test processing and counselling provision based on test results. Overall, 29% of the clinic visit time included direct clinical care and assessment with a provider, with clients spending a median 14:09 (IQR: 10:35-21:22) getting vitals checked, receiving adherence monitoring via POC TFV testing, and collecting their ART refill. Waiting in line for ART took most (48%) of the clinic visit time. POC TFV testing can be administered at reasonable costs, requires less than 10 minutes of healthcare provider time, and, therefore, may be feasible to implement in South African clinics. Findings can inform policy and budgetary planning for ART monitoring in South Africa and future cost-effectiveness analyses of POC TFV testing. NCT04341779.",

        "abstract": "To examine whether the new Medicare inflation rebate policy was associated with changes in manufacturer pricing behavior. In this cross-sectional study of 156 top-selling brand-name drugs, we used linear regression to evaluate whether there was an association between drugs' exposure to the policy (i.e., Medicare's share of net US sales) and differences in year-over-year price changes before (2021-2022) versus after (2022-2023, 2023-2024) the policy took effect. The study used Medicare spending data and average sales prices from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, wholesale acquisition costs from Eversana NAVLIN's Price & Access database, and sales revenue and estimated rebates from SSR Health. Vaccines, biosimilars, drugs approved after 2020, and those with generic or biosimilar competition before 2023 were excluded. Drugs were stratified by whether they derived most sales from Medicare Part B or Part D. The median Medicare share of net sales was 28% (IQR: 18%-37%) for 50 Part B drugs and 32% (IQR: 16%-49%) for 106 Part D drugs. Median year-over-year price changes in 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 were 3.2%, 2.9%, and 3.4% for Part B drugs and 5.0%, 5.9%, and 4.9% for Part D drugs. There was no association between drugs' Medicare share of net sales and differences in price changes pre- vs. post-policy for Part B drugs (2023: p = 0.99; 2024: p = 0.09). For Part D drugs, each 10% increase in drugs' share of Medicare sales was associated with a 0.18% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.35%, p = 0.04) higher price change in the first year after policy implementation; there was no significant association in the second year (p = 0.17). Medicare inflation rebates were not associated with smaller price increases among the top-selling drugs most affected by the policy. Additional measures are needed to prevent drug manufacturers from raising prices each year, such as extending inflation rebates to commercially insured patients.",

        "abstract": "While state cigarette taxes have been shown to reduce disparities in prenatal smoking and birth outcomes, less is known about the effects of local tobacco control policies. We examined the associations between county-level cigarette and e-cigarette prices and smoke-free legislation with racial/ethnic and educational disparities in prenatal smoking and birth outcomes. Using 2013-2018 county-level natality data on 18,663,683 singletons linked to cigarette and e-cigarette price data and smoke-free legislation, we conducted conditional mixed-process models to examine the associations between tobacco control policies and prenatal smoking, then on the associated changes in birth outcomes. We included interactions between race/ethnicity, education, and prices. Cigarette price increases were associated with larger declines in prenatal smoking than e-cigarette prices, with effect sizes decreasing across the educational gradient. Among women with 0-11 years of education, a 10 % increase in cigarette prices was associated with a decrease in smoking by 8.61 percentage points for White women and 2.92 percentage points for Black women and subsequently an increase in their infants' birth weights by 8.01 and 2.72 g, respectively. Increases in cigarette and e-cigarette smoke-free legislation coverage were associated with small declines in prenatal smoking, but no subsequent changes in birth outcomes. Local cigarette price increases contribute to the flattening of educational gradients in prenatal smoking and birth outcomes, particularly among White and Black women. Local cigarette prices may be more indicative of how fiscal policies influence smoking behavior than state cigarette taxes, particularly for low-educated pregnant women who are more likely to be price sensitive.",

We examined the perspectives of the South Korean public on high-cost cancer drugs and policy options to improve reimbursement for these treatments. We conducted a self-rated, web-based survey from November to December 2023. We used a quota sampling method based on South Korean census data to recruit study participants. The questionnaire comprised four sections: socio-demographics, definitions of high-cost cancer drugs and reasons for their reimbursement, uncertainties associated with high-cost cancer drugs, and policy options to improve reimbursement for these treatments. Of the 11,974 invitations sent, 1,000 participants completed the survey, resulting in a response rate of 8.35%. Three-quarters of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that high-cost cancer drugs should be reimbursed. More than 70% accepted the need for price negotiations, even if they lead to drug withdrawals or delays in reimbursement decisions. A similar proportion agreed that new policy options, such as dual pricing and additional funding, should be introduced with caution. The South Korean public perceives the reimbursement of high-cost cancer drugs as both a human rights measure and a government responsibility. However, they support reimbursement only when they are confident that the drug is safe, effective, and cost-effective.",

        "abstract": "Evidence supports the long-term efficacy of Nucleos(t)ide Analogs (NAs) therapy in improving chronic hepatitis B (CHB) prognosis. However, determining the most cost-effective first-line NAs remains unclear. China's implementation of the New Volume-Based Procurement Policy (NVBP Policy) in 2019 led to substantial price reductions for entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of ETV, TDF, and TAF, both with and without NVBP, for CHB in China. A state-transition model, parameterized using data from published literature, was utilized to compare treatment strategies encompassing non-NAs best support care (BSC), ETV, TDF, and TAF, with or without NVBP. A simulated lifetime cohort was employed, measuring outcomes such as predicted liver-related deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In comparison to Non-NAs BSC, TAF yielded an additional 2.68 QALYs per person, with an ICER of 7,853.22 USD/QALY. Subsequently, TDF generated an additional 2.61 QALYs/person at an ICER of 7,153.39 USD/QALY, and ETV produced an additional 2.01 QALYs/person with an ICER of 9,366.74 USD/QALY without NVBP. Incorporating NVBP, the ICERs for TAF, TDF, and ETV decreased to -745.62 USD/QALY, -729.33 USD/QALY, and -871.11 USD/QALY, respectively, compared to non-NAs BSC. At willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds ranging from 12,500 USD/QALY to 37,500 USD/QALY, TAF with NVBP showed an increased probability (51.15-52.47%) of being the optimal treatment strategy, followed by TDF and ETV with NVBP exhibiting a reduced likelihood 43.09-42.45% and 6.40-4.48% in the iterations. Our analysis suggests that TAF with NVBP represents the most cost-effective long-term therapy for CHB. Both TDF and ETV, with or without NVBP, and TAF without NVBP were considered cost-ineffective.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background:</i> Illegal opioids can create substantial harms, but the extent depends on multiple factors, including the amount consumed.<i>Objectives:</i> To examine how consumption varies across time and context, with implications for treatment and drug policy.<i>Methods:</i> We searched EBSCOhost and PubMed for literature on individuals: (1) not-in-treatment and purchasing from illegal markets, (2) reporting pre-treatment use at treatment intake, and (3) with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving medically supplied opioids. A total of 135 articles were deemed relevant.<i>Results:</i> Average consumption intensities vary enormously, from below 100 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day for use outside of treatment where prices are high, to ~600 MME in typical illegal markets, and 1,100-1,800 MME per day when supply is free, as in heroin assisted treatment and injectable hydromorphone treatment. MME in methadone programs (190-460) is less than in the traditional British heroin prescribing system (600-1,300). Intensities tended to be higher in recent times, whereas the prices have been lower. Studies during the fentanyl era suggest MMEs per day may be much higher than in the past.<i>Conclusion:</i> The adaptability of consumption has several potential implications. Expansions in supply could have greater effects on quantity consumed than on prevalence. Treatment protocols and overdose prevention strategies may need to adjust for higher baseline consumption. Furthermore, assumptions about health harms from long-term use may need revisiting if they are predicated on lower, historical consumption intensities. These findings are caveated by limitations in reporting of data and variations in methodologies. Hence, greater investments in monitoring consumption intensities are warranted.",

        "abstract": "The Chinese government is advancing the development of the County Medical Community (CMC) to establish an integrated healthcare delivery network and ensure health equity. Recently, Global Budget (GB) economic incentives have been implemented in CMC. Although the impact of GB on medical expenditure has been demonstrated, there is little evidence on whether GB promotes collaboration among various providers. This article takes Sanming City, a typical example of China's healthcare reform, as a case study, and uses data from 2016 to 2023 on the operation of CMC. Interrupted time series analysis was used to evaluate the long-term impact of GB on inpatient costs, cost structure and service delivery. The analyses indicate that, although the direct impact of the GB on inpatient costs is not significant, it sustains a rational structure of inpatient cost and optimizes the delivery of inpatient services at all levels of institutions. With respect to inpatient cost structure, the proportion of drug costs in secondary hospitals (SHs) (β<sub>3</sub> = 0.127, P < 0.001) and tertiary hospitals (THs) (β<sub>3</sub> = 0.120, P < 0.05) increased after the GB, the proportion of testing and inspection costs in primary healthcare institutions (PHIs) decreased (β<sub>3</sub> = -0.215, P < 0.05). In terms of service delivery, the average length of stay in SHs (β<sub>3</sub> = -0.053, P < 0.05) and THs (β<sub>3</sub> = -0.032, P < 0.001) decreased, and the admission per 100 outpatients (β<sub>3</sub> = 0.058, P < 0.001) in PHIs increased. The robustness analysis corroborated the robustness of the results. This article provides empirical evidence that GB mechanisms can enhance service coordination among different levels of healthcare providers, which provides valuable lessons for promoting integrated healthcare and achieving health equity in China and in low- and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of treatment-free remission marks a significant shift in clinical management for chronic myeloid leukemia patients. It involves the discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy while maintaining a sustained molecular response. In light of this, the study aims to evaluate the budget impact associated with this healthcare strategy among tunisian patients treated with nilotinib. This economic evaluation seeks to provide insights into the affordability of implementing treatment-free remission from the perspective of the Tunisian National Health Insurance Fund. Over a three-year time horizon, a Markov model assessed the introduction of treatment-free remission in an eligible population. The input data used for transition probabilities and identification of the target population were obtained from a systematic literature review. The economic evaluation considered only the drug acquisition cost as the direct cost covered by the public payer. To account for the variability of results, a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying key model parameters. From an initial cohort of 32 eligible patients within the health insurance database, the model estimated the evolution of the target population to 230 patients after three years. The introduction of treatment-free remission as a new strategy in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia would result in a cost-saving estimated at 23.4 million Tunisian Dinars. The uncertainty analysis revealed the significant impact of drug prices on the overall outcomes. This study provides transparent and interpretable results for decision-makers. The economic evaluation reveals a financial gain that can be allocated to address other health priorities within the Tunisian National Health Insurance Fund's budget. The budget impact analysis advocates for implementing treatment-free remission as a cost-saving intervention for the Tunisian National Health Insurance Fund's budget.",

        "abstract": "Pembrolizumab shows effectiveness in treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (metNSCLC), with a subgroup of patients experiencing long-term survival (LTS) benefits. The existence of a LTS subgroup may influence the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with platinum-based chemotherapy. This study aims to assess the potential implications of such a subgroup on the cost-effectiveness for patients with non-squamous metNSCLC and PD-L1 ≥ 50% who are ineligible for targeted therapies. This study used a decision analytic model based on Dutch real-world data (2008-2014). Two strategies were simulated: (1) a chemotherapy strategy: patients receive chemotherapy in the first-, second-, and third-line; and (2) a pembrolizumab strategy: patients receive first-line pembrolizumab followed by chemotherapy for those progressing to second- and third-lines. The pembrolizumab strategy is evaluated with and without the assumption that there is a LTS subgroup. The LTS subgroup is assumed to be free from metNSCLC-related progression after treatment. Costs (2022 €), including drug costs, other direct medical costs, family costs, and healthcare costs in life years gained, are considered from first-line treatment to death. Effects are measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is assessed using an €80,000/QALY threshold. Threshold analyses are performed on the size and mortality rate of the LTS subgroup and on the price of pembrolizumab. QALYs per patient were 0.65 for chemotherapy, 1.24 for pembrolizumab without LTS, and 3.52 for pembrolizumab with LTS. Average costs per patient were €58,800 for chemotherapy, €154,600 for pembrolizumab without LTS, and €178,600 for pembrolizumab with LTS. Pembrolizumab without LTS was not cost-effective compared with chemotherapy (ICER €167,600/QALY), but pembrolizumab with LTS (30% of simulated population) was cost effective (ICER of €43,100/QALY). Threshold analyses showed that a LTS subgroup size of at least 10% or halving the price of pembrolizumab was needed for pembrolizumab to be cost-effective. Pembrolizumab is a cost-effective first-line treatment for patients with metNSCLC and PD-L1 ≥ 50% in the Netherlands when at least 10% of patients are long-term survivors. Without long-term survivors, this treatment is not cost-effective. Therefore, it is crucial to consider long-term survivors in assessing the cost-effectiveness of immunotherapy in metNSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are often designed to not only bind targets via their antigen-binding domains (Fabs) but to also engage with cell surface receptors, FcγRs and FcRn, through their Fc regions, which may result in a variety of functional outcomes, including antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and alteration of circulating half-lives. Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs.",

        "abstract": "Globally, drug shortages affect low-, middle- and high-income countries to different degrees. The challenges associated with drug shortages in health systems, particularly in public health facilities, and the consequent multiple adverse effects on patients and the health systems have led countries to continue to explore and implement different strategies to combat this challenge. Various factors implicated in drug shortages range from manufacturing concerns, demand issues, supply chain disruptions and regulatory issues. The effects of drug shortages in health systems range from poor patient compliance and therapeutic failure to antimicrobial resistance, low morale among healthcare workers and public distrust in government services. Furthermore, the effects of drug shortages in public health facilities include unavailability of drugs to patients, hospitalisation and readmissions, and associated costs that could be avoided, high out-of-pocket expenditures suffered by patients as patients resort to buying drugs from private pharmacies where the prices are usually exorbitant and prohibitive, putting patients at risk of treatment default due to lack of affordability. Successful mitigation strategies deployed to prevent and manage drug shortages in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remain unshared despite the potential of these strategies to serve as valuable lessons if the evidence is scientifically synthesised and reported. The scoping review will synthesise evidence to provide policy guidance for better planning of health services and resources, resulting in improved quality of life for citizens, underscoring the importance of functional and responsive health systems. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review methodology, a five-stage review is outlined: (1) determining the research question, (2) search strategy, (3) inclusion criteria, (4) data extraction and (5) analysis and presentation of the results. The literature search will use PubMed, SCOPUS and the Elsevier Science Direct search interfaces, reflecting empirical and grey literature. We will focus on literature published between 2000 and 2025. The study start and end dates are 1 September-30 November 2025. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles. All articles will be individually assessed for eligibility by two reviewers, while a third reviewer will resolve any disagreements. The data from eligible articles will be extracted and charted using a standardised form. Extracted data will be analysed using narrative and descriptive analyses. Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review as it will use only previously published data. It does not require human participation.

It provides a systematic framework for decision-makers in the pharmaceutical industry, government, and private sectors to optimize healthcare delivery and spending. This review aimed to explore the role of pharmacoeconomic models in assessing the economic and clinical value of therapies. It emphasizes the importance of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, and cost-minimization analyses in balancing costs with outcomes and guiding healthcare resource allocation. Pharmacoeconomic methodologies involve evaluating costs, processes, and outcomes associated with therapeutic interventions. Key methods include cost-minimization, costeffectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit analyses. These approaches are critical in regulatory compliance, reimbursement decisions, cost assessments, and sustaining pharmaceutical models. The review reveals that pharmacoeconomic tools such as Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) are widely used to guide healthcare policy decisions, particularly in resource-constrained settings. CEA is the most commonly applied method due to its simplicity, while CUA is gaining traction in advanced policy frameworks like Health Technology Assessment (HTA). In India, pharmacoeconomic research is emerging but faces barriers such as limited access to real-world data, the absence of national reimbursement systems, and high out-of-pocket costs. Innovative methods like machine learning and pharmacogenomics are being explored to improve the relevance and precision of these evaluations. While pharmacoeconomic models offer valuable insights for healthcare decisionmaking, their real-world impact is limited by inconsistencies in data quality and variations in implementation standards. In India, fragmented governance, low public health spending, and a lack of coordination among stakeholders further hinder effective application. Addressing systemic challenges-such as establishing interoperable data systems, standard treatment guidelines, and equitable healthcare access-is crucial. Tailored approaches, including localized utility values and digital health initiatives, are essential to make pharmacoeconomics a practical and influential tool in policy formulation and resource allocation in India and similar settings. Pharmacoeconomic studies evaluate clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and production costs while incorporating perspectives from patients, providers, payers, and communities. For India, unique challenges such as limited rural healthcare access, infrastructure disparities, and high out-of-pocket expenses necessitate tailored adaptations. Strategies such as integrating accessibility metrics, localized data, equity considerations, preventive care, tiered pricing, and public-private partnerships can enhance healthcare delivery. Pharmacoeconomic models are essential for improving health outcomes, ensuring equitable resource allocation, and addressing the diverse needs of India.",

        "abstract": "Limited research has evaluated the impact of cannabis policies on young adult cannabis use, after full implementation (retail outlets opened), nor on cannabis product type. This study examined the relationship between adult-use cannabis retail sales in New Jersey (United States) and young adult cannabis use by type. Data on New Jersey young adults (18-23 years) were from the Policy Communication and Evaluation (PACE) New Jersey Study. Generalized estimating equations models estimated differences in prevalence of ever and past 30-day use of cannabis and sub-types before (Waves 1-3 [March-November 2021], n = 1439) and after (Wave 4 [June-July 2022], n = 1127) adult-use retail sales began. Ever cannabis use among New Jersey young adults was higher in the post-retail sales period than pre-sales (58.1 % vs. 48.9 %, p < 0.01). The odds of ever cannabis use were 42 % higher (95 % CI = 32 %-54 %) in the post-retail period. Ever use of dried herb (post vs. pre: 44.4 % vs. 38.5 %, p < 0.01), drinks (7.0 % vs. 4.8 %, p < 0.01), edibles (45.9 % vs. 35.6 %, p < 0.01), and topicals (6.4 % vs. 4.6 %, p < 0.05), and past 30-day edible use (11.8 % vs. 9.0 %, p = 0.01) were higher post-retail; use of other product types did not differ. Cannabis use overall and among certain subtypes (e.g., edibles) increased among New Jersey young adults in the three months after adult-use cannabis retail sales began, demonstrating that increased access to legal cannabis for sale may encourage use. Continued monitoring is needed over longer follow-up periods in New Jersey and other states legalizing cannabis.",

The aim of this study was to assess the perspective of drug developers on the acceptance of non-traditional trial designs by HTA bodies in Europe. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts to gain insights on their perception of non-traditional trial design acceptance by HTA bodies from the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden, and France. Future perspectives on and recommendations for facilitating the acceptance of non-traditional trials were provided. All experts highlighted the HTA bodies' preference for randomized controlled trials over non-traditional trial designs. The degree of acceptance varied between countries. Experts recommended multistakeholder discussions between drug developers and HTA bodies for early scientific advice and reevaluation of evidence requirements. The EU-HTA regulation was viewed as both a potential opportunity for harmonization and limiting innovative approach. The results of this study highlighted significant variations in the acceptance of non-traditional trial designs by HTA bodies across Europe.

        "abstract": "COVID-19 remains common in the US, but up-to-date data on health care resource utilization and cost remain limited, particularly during Omicron predominance. This study was conducted using administrative claims data from the HealthVerity database. All available records in medical claims, pharmacy claims, laboratory tests, charge data master, and related enrollment, including COVID-19 events, from December 24, 2021 to April 30, 2022, were extracted. Outpatient and inpatient health care resource utilization (HCRU) and cost for the 28-day follow-up period after COVID-19 index date were calculated. A total of 1,203,769 patients with COVID-19 were included in the HCRU analysis; of these, 377,945 had non-missing cost data and were included in the costing analysis. The median age was 43 years, and 90.3% were < 65 years of age. A total of 70.4% had at least one comorbidity, and 40.5% had filled at least one medication prescription with potential major drug-drug interaction (DDI) with ritonavir in the preceding 12 months. Among these COVID-19 patients, 44.4% had outpatient, 5.3% had emergency room, and 1.2% had urgent care visits; 1.9% were hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients, median length of stay was 3 days; 18.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit and 3.4% required invasive mechanical ventilation. Total mean treatment cost during the follow-up period was 4,965 (outpatient: 2,686; pharmacy: 2,278) among patients who were never hospitalized, and 33,329 among hospitalized patients (with $22,919 for inpatient care). HCRU and treatment costs were higher in patients aged 65 or older, and in those with comorbidities or medication prescriptions with ritonavir DDIs, regardless of whether they required hospitalization. During the first four months of the Omicron wave, the economic burden of COVID-19 remained substantial. Older age and co-morbidities were associated with higher HCRU and treatment costs. This study provides data for future research evaluating the full economic impact of COVID-19 in the US.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of innovative anticancer medicines has revitalized cancer treatment prospects, and improving the accessibility of innovative anticancer medicines is a key goal of national pharmaceutical policies. Despite significant efforts by the National Medical Security Administration to reform the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), concerns regarding the utilization of these newly included anticancer drugs persist. This study aims to assess the accessibility of 23 Innovative Negotiated Anticancer Medicines (INAMs) in Jiangsu Province, a developed region in eastern China. A retrospective survey was conducted across 319 healthcare institutions in Jiangsu Province, with 285 included for analysis. Data were obtained from procurement records of 23 INAMs. We evaluated the use of these medicines based on three aspects: availability, price measured by the defined daily dose cost (DDDc), and affordability. 43.5% of the 23 INAMs encountered difficulties in obtaining them, and 30.4% of 23 INAMs were very difficult to obtain. There was a notable disparity in the availability of 23 INAMs between secondary and tertiary healthcare institutions. The median DDDc for Group A and Group C showed a progressive annual reduction. The DDDc of 19 INAMs decreased during the study period, while three drugs remained unchanged, and one drug's DDDc actually increased. Family poverty caused by medicines was more pronounced among rural residents. The affordability of rural patients was significantly lower than that of urban patients (p < 0.05) in 2021 and 2022. The accessibility of INAMs improved from 2020 to 2022. However, the accessibility of INAMs is influenced by various factors, and disparities still exist in access across different healthcare institutions and between urban and rural areas. Effective and sustainable policies need to be developed to ensure equitable access to medicines for all patients.",

        "abstract": "The Trump Administration issued an Executive Order on May 12, 2025, with the intent to \"equalize pricing across developed countries\" through a \"Most-Favored Nation\" approach with international reference pricing (IRP). IRP has been used extensively in Europe and resulted in short-term budget savings. However, list prices quickly converged to those of major high-income markets, such as Germany and France, without evidence of reduced prices. Despite frequent use of confidential price agreements to differentiate net prices in countries that cannot afford those price levels, access to innovative medicines has been delayed and reduced. This suggests that introduction of IRP in the United States could further limit access in designated reference countries, without sustainable reductions in US price levels. Instead of referencing prices from other countries, the United States should establish its own system for value assessment of medicines, whether at the time of launch or after drugs have been on the market for several years.",

To assess trends in prescription use and spending among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries at a national health insurer during the first year of clinician access to an RTPB tool. This cohort study used 2018 to 2020 administrative data from a national insurer to compare prescription fills for beneficiaries receiving prescriptions from clinicians at practices with an RTPB tool with fills prescribed by clinicians without access to the tool. Trends in prescription spending and fills in the year after practices adopted an RTPB tool (in March 2019) were measured using a difference-in-differences design. Data were analyzed from November 2022 to June 2024. Access to an RTPB tool within a national electronic health record software vendor. The main outcomes were total prescription spending, beneficiary out-of-pocket spending, and number of prescription fills. Secondary outcomes included percentage of fills with the insurer-owned mail-order pharmacy, percentage of fills with a 90-day supply, and subgroup analyses in drug classes appearing most frequently in the RTPB tool and high-cost prescription drug classes. The sample included 2 805 060 beneficiaries (mean [SD] age 70.9 [9.2] years; 56.7% female; 14.7% Black individuals; 80.5% White individuals), with mean (SD) monthly out-of-pocket costs of $29.1 ($90.4), total prescription costs of $213.2 ($1066.3), and 2.6 (2.1) prescription fills per month. After introduction of the RTPB tool, there was no change in prescription spending (estimated out-of-pocket spending change, 1.2% [95% CI, -0.7% to 3.0%]; estimated total prescription spending change, 0.5% [95% CI: -0.2% to 1.2%]) or number of prescription fills (estimated change, 0.01 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02]) among beneficiaries prescribed medication by clinicians at practices with the RTPB tool.

To evaluate the health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of alternative HCV testing frequencies for PWID. This cost-effectiveness analysis extended a previously published agent-based network simulation model of HCV transmission through the sharing of injection equipment among PWID. Network-based HCV transmission was calibrated to longitudinal data from the Social Networks Among Appalachian People study and published literature on PWID networks in the US to evaluate HCV testing strategies in both a sparse PWID network setting with lower HCV transmission and a dense network setting with higher HCV transmission. Data were collected from November 2008 to August 2010, and data were analyzed from September 2017 to December 2019. Periodic HCV testing and treatment, with alternative average testing frequencies among PWID who have access to and use HCV care. Changes in cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health care costs over 60 years (in 2021 US dollars) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) discounted at 3% annually. The mean initial age of 1552 simulated PWID was 32 years. Compared with no testing, HCV testing and treatment among PWID over a 10-year intervention period increased QALYs by 2.5% to 4.6% and costs by 0.5% to 2.3% across average testing frequencies ranging from once every 2 years to once monthly. In a lower transmission setting, testing every 2 years was weakly dominated by more frequent testing strategies; testing every year, every 6 months, every 3 months, and every month had ICERs of $6000 per QALY, $9300 per QALY, $24 200 per QALY, and $138 400 per QALY, respectively. In a higher transmission setting, testing every 2 years and every year were both weakly dominated, while testing every 6 months, every 3 months, and every month had ICERs of $14 000 per QALY, $30 100 per QALY, and $93 300 per QALY, respectively. Results were sensitive to risks of primary infection and reinfection as well as access to and utilization of HCV testing services among PWID. In this economic evaluation study, based on common benchmarks for cost-effectiveness, frequent HCV testing among PWID was cost-effective in both lower and higher transmission settings.",

        "abstract": "Provision of high-quality, evidence-based patient care that is sustainable for our universal health system is a core Canadian Medical Education Directions for Specialists (CanMEDs) expectation. The Transplant Manitoba Adult Kidney Program (TMAKP) embraced this responsibility by addressing inefficiencies in its practices through multipronged quality improvement (QI) strategies, including reducing unnecessary interventions, implementing innovative strategies, and aligning clinical practices with emerging evidence. Using seamlessly embedded continuous QI and clinical research with a learning health system, the program achieved substantial cost savings and increased opportunities for deceased donor kidney transplantation. The purpose of this analysis is to measure the cost savings associated with these QI initiatives. Transplant Manitoba Adult Kidney Program database and quality metrics, Manitoba Health Physician's Manual (April 1, 2024), PubMed. To quantify the potential cost savings, we employed a 3-pronged approach. For reduced testing, a cost-counting exercise was conducted using historical transplant activity (831 prevalent and 83 incident patients) to project number of tests avoided and direct costs per test. Second, cost savings for generic mycophenolic acid was presented as ratios of generic to brand name drug costs, and projected cost savings for prevalent patients receiving average dosing. Third, for increased kidney utilization, cost savings per kidney transplant were derived from published studies and extrapolated using predicted additional transplants. Net health care system savings across payers were assessed at a 1-year time horizon. The TMAKP reduced unnecessary testing, adopted generic medications, and implemented innovative strategies, achieving $2,530,026 in projected annual 1-year cost savings. These QI initiative savings augment the overall cost-effectiveness of kidney transplantation compared with dialysis. Implementing evidence-based protocols using personalized risk-stratified approaches to viral monitoring and novel donor-specific antibody surveillance strategies aligned testing with clinical risk while minimizing patient burden, highlighting the benefits of seamlessly integrating research with learning health systems. Programs for hepatitis C-viremic donor kidneys and age-targeted allocation increased transplant opportunities and optimized deceased donor organ use. Manitoba's initiatives demonstrate the importance of validation, stakeholder engagement, and iterative adaptation in driving sustainable improvements in transplantation care. Critically, this requires the foresight of health care administrative systems to invest in effective and ongoing QI and embed research with clinical practice, to improve patient and health system outcomes. This analysis is limited by reliance on projected cost savings, which require validation through real-world audits to confirm impact. In addition, some valuable QI efforts, while improving patient outcomes, may increase costs, highlighting the need for balanced perspectives in assessing stewardship initiatives. Finally, this analysis is limited to projected cost savings and does not evaluate clinical outcomes, process adherence, or implementation effectiveness. This experience highlights the potential for QI initiatives to optimize care and resource utilization within Canada's publicly funded health system. These efforts reduced unnecessary testing, minimized patient burden, and expanded transplant opportunities, illustrating how stewardship can balance fiscal responsibility with high-quality state-of-the-art patient care. By implementing evidence-based protocols, TMAKP achieved an additional $2,530,026 in projected cost savings at 1 year. Future annual cost savings will continue rising in a growing prevalent kidney transplant population in Manitoba. These savings can be reallocated to other critical health care services, expanding access and improving outcomes for patients beyond transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Tariffs on U.S. pharmaceutical imports have been recently proposed. This article examines the potential effects of tariffs on U.S. domestic drug manufacturing, focusing on the differential impact on branded and generic drugs. We contend that generic manufacturing is labor-intensive, operates on thin profit margins, and has strong competition that usually constrains price increases. However, where supply is dominated by a tariff-affected country, capacity limits may lead to spot-market prices increases. Unless tariff-driven global price increases outweigh the amortized costs of relocation and higher domestic production costs, U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers for generics is likely to continue. By contrast, branded manufacturers have greater incentives to reshore production. Branded manufacturers' patent-protected monopolies provide sufficient pricing power to absorb the costs of relocation. Branded manufacturers also have an incentive to relocate production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to the U.S. Domestically-produced branded APIs could be exported for final processing at lower costs and imported back into the U.S. as finished drugs without incurring tariffs. Tariff policy uncertainty may influence manufacturers' relocation decisions. Among the possible unintended consequences from the added pressure from tariffs on global pharmaceutical manufacturers, compromised product quality, drug shortages, higher prices, retaliatory actions like export quotas or bans, and reciprocal tariffs stand out.",

        "abstract": "As the global population ages, the burden of drug use disorders (DUDs) among the elderly is rising. It is imperative to conduct a quantitative analysis of the disease burden affecting this vulnerable population. Utilize the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 database to obtain incidence rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, and cannabis among the elderly (aged 60-89) across 204 countries and 5 SDI regions from 1990 to 2021. Employ Joinpoint regression analysis to calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and age-standardized DALYs rates (ASDR). Use the Das Gupta method to decompose and analyze the impacts of changes in age structure, population growth, and epidemiology on DALYs during this period. Finally, apply the Nordpred model to predict DALYs for global and high-burden regions from 2022 to 2035. Of the four DUDs, opioids have the highest disease burden. Joinpoint analysis indicates that from 1990 to 2021, the ASIR and ASDR remained stable. Cocaine use disorder ASIR remained stable, but ASDR increased with an AAPC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.77-1.11). The burden of amphetamine and cannabis use disorders generally stabilized. Geographic heterogeneity was evident at regional and national levels, with ASDR for all four DUDs increasing in high-SDI areas while remaining stable or declining in other SDI areas. High-income North America, represented by the United States, shows a higher burden of disease. Decomposition analysis shows that population growth is the main factor affecting the change in the burden of DUDs in most regions, and high-income North America is mainly affected by epidemiological changes. According to the Predictive models, the DALYs of DUDs in the global elderly population is still on the rise, especially in the man group in North America. The burden of DUDs among the elderly varies across countries, regions, SDI levels, and genders, underscoring the need for targeted public health policy adjustments and strategic allocation of medical resources to mitigate this burden.",

        "abstract": "Current guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) primary prevention mostly recommend risk scores that predict risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal ischemic heart disease (IHD), and fatal or non-fatal ischemic stroke (hard outcomes), ignoring the burden from other non-fatal IHD outcomes. We explored the optimal risk thresholds for statin initiation using non-laboratory-based soft and hard ASCVD outcome models and compared the cost-utility of such models in the Chinese population. We constructed Markov cohort models to estimate the incidence of ASCVD events, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime from a social perspective. The simulation cohort was constructed using data from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). Input data included cost, utility, statin efficacy, and other parameters were derived from published literature. We used CKB-ASCVD models to predict 10-year risk and different risk thresholds to guide statin initiation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as cost per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the uncertainty in the models. The optimal risk threshold was 18% for the soft ASCVD model and 10% for the hard ASCVD model, with ICERs of $7013.48/QALY and $6540.71/QALY, respectively. The optimal thresholds were robust in stratified analyses by region and sex, and one-way sensitivity analyses over a wide range of input parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that these optimal thresholds had around 70% chance of being cost-effective. When analyzed by age group, above optimal thresholds were cost-effective in adults aged 30-59 years but not in those aged 60-75 years. The threshold strategies based on soft ASCVD model were mostly cost-saving compared with those based on hard models to treat the same proportions of the population. The risk threshold of 18% for soft ASCVD model and 10% for hard ASCVD model have acceptable cost-utility profiles in the Chinese population. The soft ASCVD model is more cost-effective than the hard model and should be used as a screening tool for ASCVD primary prevention.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of Automated Dispensing Cabinets (ADCs) on workflow efficiency, cost savings, and medication therapy management in the Emergency Department of a Taiwanese regional hospital. ADCs are a key technology in healthcare, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of medication management processes. Data were collected from the hospital’s information system, comparing one year before and one year after the ADC implementation. The study focused on the Emergency Department of Dajia Hospital and included a comparison with Shalu Hospital. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nurses and pharmacists to gather qualitative insights. The implementation of ADCs significantly improved workflow efficiency by reducing the time required for drug preparation and administration, leading to an average time savings of 25.68 min per patient. Cost savings were realized through a 10.99% reduction in nursing activity costs, amounting to $83,326.25 annually. The ADCs also enhanced medication therapy management by improving drug tracking and availability. However, challenges such as manual errors in medication dispensing and system limitations were identified. ADCs improve operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness in Emergency Departments, reducing healthcare professionals’ workload and enhancing medication management. Despite these benefits, ongoing training and system optimization are necessary to address remaining challenges and enhance overall performance.

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a global health challenge. Iran faces significant HIV issues with rising incidence and mortality rates. While antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy, projections indicate an above-average increase in the next years. We aimed to report the national and subnational burden of HIV/AIDS and risk factors in Iran from 1990 to 2021 by sex, age, and socio-demographic index (SDI). The analysis used the Global Burden of Disease 2021 data on age-standardized incidence rates, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The Cause of Death Ensemble Model was used to estimate HIV mortality and DisMod-MR 2.1 for non-fatal outcomes. Comparative risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the burden of HIV/AIDS attributable to risk factors such as condomless sex, drug use, and intimate partner violence. A smoothing splines model was used to determine the relationship between SDI and age-standardized DALY rates for HIV/AIDS. The counts and rates were reported with 95% uncertainty intervals. In 1990, the age-standardized incidence rate of HIV/AIDS in Iran among both sexes was 0.2 (0.1, 0.7), the prevalence rate was 1.5 (1.0, 2.5), the death rate was 0.1 (0.1, 0.1), and the DALY rate was 4.2 (4.1, 4.4) per 100,000. In 2021, age-standardized proportions per 100,000 were as follows: incidence 2.3 (1.8, 3.0), prevalence 21.6 (17.6, 26.4), death 0.6 (0.6, 0.6), and DALY 31.7 (30.8, 32.9). Males had higher age-standardized rates than females in 2021. However, females showed a higher relative increase in age-standardized rates from 1990 to 2021. In 2021, the 35-39 age group observed the highest DALY rates. Drug use was the leading risk factor 19.9 (18.7, 21.1), followed by condomless sex at 5.1 (4.5, 5.8). The age-standardized DALY rate increased with SDI up to the SDI of 0.65, after which it decreased. The most affected provinces were Kermanshah, Hormozgan, and Fars. The burden of HIV in Iran has risen significantly, with males and young adults most affected. Drug use was the leading risk factor for the infection. In the following years, interdisciplinary education, policy, and healthcare efforts are necessary to reduce the burden and incidence.",

Here, we evaluate the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introduction of a new combination of long-acting injectable drugs of lenacapavir + cabotegravir to increase levels of sustained viral suppression. We find there is potential for a significant impact on HIV deaths and disability adjusted life years, including due to a decrease in mother to child transmission. If lenacapavir + cabotegravir can be sourced at a cost of around $ 80 per year or less, our analysis suggests there is potential for a policy to introduce it to be cost-effective in settings in ECSWA.

        "abstract": "This study was an investigation of the utility of behavioral economic demand curves (quantitative models showing how consumption changes with price) in assessing acceptance of hypothetical HIV vaccines among sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). Two experiments used simulated purchase tasks (hypothetical scenarios measuring purchasing decisions). SGMs were recruited through Reddit and LGBTQ+ community organizations across the United States. In Experiment 1, participants were randomly assigned to nine instructional sets combining varying vaccine administration modes (oral, mucosal, or subcutaneous) with different dosage schedules (one dose, two doses, or one dose annually). Experiment 2 examined how bundling HIV vaccines with one of nine health commodities affected demand. Participants also responded to questions assessing demographics, HIV risk behaviors, experiences of racial discrimination, and trust in institutions. The results demonstrated that the exponentiated demand equation effectively modeled vaccine acceptance across conditions (median R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92). Contrary to expectations, vaccine characteristics had a minimal influence on demand (Q₀: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.007; log α: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.001). Instead, individual factors significantly influenced demand intensity (consumption when price = 0; Q₀) and price sensitivity (sensitivity of consumption to increasing price; α). Significant predictors of Q₀ included injection drug use history, experiences of racial discrimination, and trust in science. Low household income was the strongest predictor of log α. Bundling HIV vaccines with other health commodities showed subtle effects on acceptance, with condoms and dental examinations significantly differing from the reference category. These findings suggest that behavioral economic approaches can inform policy decisions about pricing, bundling strategies and targeted interventions to maximize HIV vaccine uptake among SGMs who face disproportionate HIV risk without requiring exposure to non-market-ready vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Reports of hospitalization associated with Diamond Shruumz-branded mushroom-containing products in October 2024 led to a manufacturer's recall that restricted the sale, distribution, and accessibility of this new and emerging psychoactive product. This study seeks to assess the continuing online availability of a mushroom-containing edible product in a diverse e-commerce landscape, specifically aiming to identify and characterize its online availability before and after recall initiation. A retrospective online market surveillance of Diamond Shruumz products using structured and automated search queries was employed to identify online product marketing and availability. Online surveillance included the monitoring of multiple social media platforms, cannabis e-commerce websites, and search engine queries between June 22 and June 27, 2024, immediately preceding the manufacturer-initiated recall. Post-recall simulated purchases were then conducted on July 12, 2024, on platforms, websites and domains identified as continuing to actively market and sell the products through online product listings. Prior to product recall, a total of 4117 product listings across 1600 (38.86%) social media posts and user-generated comments, 11 (0.27%) cannabis e-commerce websites, and 2509 (60.94%) hyperlinks from internet search queries were generated for further content analysis. Review of online sources revealed 49 social media posts, 8 e-commerce shops, and 67 domains that were identified as actively marketing and selling products prior to recall. Post-recall, we identified 45 (67.16%) remaining domains that continued to market the product from these different online sources. Simulated purchases revealed that 15 (33.33%) domains successfully transacted test purchases and 30 (66.66%) transactions failed because of account verification or payment failure. The Diamond Shruumz recall exemplifies the ongoing challenge of unknown consumer harm associated with new and emerging substances marketed and sold on the internet, which is especially concerning as these products appeal to younger audiences with a variety of edible flavored products. While a recall was initiated and products became unavailable, our study found that post-recall online vendors continued to market and sell the products. This indicates that there are ongoing challenges to effectuate recalls and online enforcement in a diverse e-commerce landscape that can rapidly bring new and novel psychoactive substances to the market.",

        "abstract": "To provide the first national study examining the impact on the health care costs of treating an episode of urinary tract infection as a function of the time delay in receiving antimicrobial susceptibility test results. We used a nationally representative data set of privately insured adults and dependents. Our retrospective analysis included those receiving a urine bacteria test and susceptibility testing and ultimately diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. Using regression analysis, we estimate episode of care-based treatment costs associated with each day of delay in receiving susceptibility test results controlling for patient age, gender, and number of comorbid conditions. Delays in receiving test results that allow for filling a prescription or a diagnosis increase health plan treatment costs. The analysis looked at patients with a susceptibility test and an ultimate diagnosis of urinary tract infection. We examined the days between the test and two outcomes, the diagnosis and the prescription filled. Even 1 day of delay added over $1,600 (2022 US dollars) in health plan spending to treat the condition. These additional costs were traced to increased hospitalizations for the condition for each day of delay. Delays in prescriptions filled added the most to treatment costs. Receiving test results on the day of test could reduce treatment costs by 40%. There are a whole range of bacterial tests. The analysis focused on only one - a urine bacterial and susceptibility culture test - and was limited to patients ultimately diagnosed with urinary tract infection. The analysis provides the first national estimates of the increased costs of treating urinary tract infections due to delays in receiving test results. Slow turnaround times in receiving test results for bacterial infections increase hospitalizations and health plan and employer spending for treating infections. We need new technologies that allow for rapid results for these tests.",

        "abstract": "Access to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in sub-Saharan Africa is limited due to prohibitive upfront costs, making warfarin the standard of care for many patients, especially those relying on public-sector healthcare. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using the DOAC, rivaroxaban, compared to warfarin for treating venous thromboembolism (VTE), a cardiovascular disorder caused by blood clots in the veins, in western Kenya. We developed a discrete-time individual state-transition Markov model to simulate a VTE patient's quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and annual treatment costs under a rivaroxaban or warfarin therapy strategy. Transition state probabilities were derived from real-world event-rate data observed in patients treated with rivaroxaban (n = 160) or warfarin (n = 116) for VTE at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in western Kenya. Base-case parameter values were obtained from cohort event rates, local costs, and literature-derived utility values. Cost-effectiveness was assessed over a 1-year time horizon using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold of (US)$6020.40 per QALY gained (equivalent to three times Kenya's 2021 per capita GDP). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess parameter and model uncertainty. After 12 months, total mean treatment costs per patient were $216.00 and $173.00 using warfarin and rivaroxaban, respectively. In the base-case analysis, rivaroxaban therapy resulted in an additional 0.023 QALYs per patient compared to warfarin, with an ICER of $- 1862.00 per QALY gained. Based on probabilistic sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulation, when costs, utility values, and event rates were varied, rivaroxaban was cost-effective compared to warfarin in 84.1% of all simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $6020.40 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were stable with rivaroxaban therapy, resulting in fewer costs and higher QALYs. In this study, rivaroxaban is a clinically and economically superior alternative to warfarin. This research may catalyze further discussions with policymakers and industry partners to scale up the appropriate use of rivaroxaban in resource-constrained settings.",

The Triple Pill vs Usual Care Management for Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial evaluated the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of early use of low-dose triple fixed-dose combination of BP-lowering drugs ('triple pill') compared with usual care in the management of hypertension. The TRIUMPH trial showed superior BP control with the triple pill strategy compared with usual care. This process evaluation of the TRIUMPH trial aimed to explore the contextual factors that influenced the trial outcomes, implementation of the triple pill strategy, mechanisms of its effects and potential barriers and facilitators for implementing the triple pill strategy in routine practice. Guided by the UK Medical Research Council's framework, semistructured interviews were conducted with 23 patients and 13 healthcare providers involved in the TRIUMPH trial. Data were analysed using the framework analysis method in NVivo. Hypertension care in Sri Lanka was hindered by the absence of systematic screening and overcrowded public clinics. Despite free medication provision at public clinics, long waiting times and occasional stock-outs posed challenges. In the TRIUMPH trial, both intervention and usual care were delivered in the context of 'better than usual' care, including team-based management, reduced waiting times, monetary assistance for travel, routine adherence monitoring and intensive follow-up. The triple pill strategy provided a simplified regimen, better access to BP-lowering medications and better BP-lowering efficacy. Key barriers to implementation in routine practice included the triple pill's large size, therapeutic inertia and restrictive regulatory policies regarding fixed-dose combinations. Implementation of the triple pill strategy into routine practice requires health system strengthening, provider training and supportive policy measures to replicate its effectiveness seen in the trial.

        "abstract": "Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have a greater than 50% lifetime risk of developing comorbid chronic kidney disease (CKD). Glycemic control can reduce diabetes-related complications and slow CKD progression. Adding sotagliflozin to insulin therapy reduced A1c by 0.46% compared with insulin monotherapy in patients with T1D. However, the long-term economic value for patients with both T1D and CKD remains unknown. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sotagliflozin as an add-on to insulin in patients with T1D and CKD from a US payer perspective. A Markov model was generated for individuals diagnosed with both T1D and comorbid CKD stage 3 from a US payer's perspective. Clinical and economic outcomes were assessed over 30 years and included number of patients prevented from dialysis and transplantation, life-years, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains, incremental costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net monetary benefit. Dynamic pricing, through genericization, was incorporated to account for the economic impacts of market entry by generics. Sotagliflozin add-on therapy improved survival, extending life expectancy by 1.27 years (13.08 with sotagliflozin vs 11.81 with insulin monotherapy). During the first 10 years after treatment initiation, dialysis and transplant utilization decreased by 3.06 (99.35 vs 102.41) and 1.73 (30.59 vs 32.32) per 1,000 patients, respectively. QALYs per patient increased by 0.63 (7.70 vs 7.07), largely driven by prolonged time in pre-end-stage renal disease health states (0.59; 6.75 vs 6.16). Total costs rose by $72,914 ($484,674 vs $411,760), primarily because of pharmacy costs increasing by $69,060 ($96,242 vs $27,364). The ICER was $115,677 per QALY and the model was most sensitive to pharmacy costs. Sotagliflozin is a cost-effective adjunct to insulin therapy for T1D and CKD patients, providing clinical benefits and falling below the $150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in 59% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulations.",

        "abstract": "The cost of anticancer drugs and their wastage has become a major concern for patients and health policy makers in developing countries. To date, no figures have been reported on the rate of loss of anticancer drugs in Iran. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a real-world analysis on the anticancer drug wastage in a public hospital. During a 3-month time span, we observationally collected drug information of all patients admitted for receiving anticancer drugs in the inpatient or outpatient unit of chemotherapy center by two oncology nurses. The amount of drug wastage and its financial cost were calculated based on the price approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) during the survey period. A total of 626 patients were admitted for receiving twenty-four injectable anticancer drugs in 2023 infusions. The percentage of total drug wastage was 9.31% (95% CI, 5.90 -12.71%). Overall, these results indicated that the cost of drug wastage in this 3-month period was roughly 31,473 US dollars (USD) and estimated annual cost of wastage was nearly 125,894 USD (5,287,553,080 Iranian Rial). This is the first report of investigating anticancer drug wastage in Iran. According to this real-world survey, it was shown that the amount of drug wastage in this center is substantial and imposes a heavy financial burden on patients and the health system that need to be taken into account by policy makers.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has allowed countries to reduce the health and economic burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, access to DAAs remains expensive and limited in many countries globally due to wide disparities in HCV drug pricing. We assessed how global use of HCV drugs has changed over time and the effect that COVID-19 might have had on DAA utilisation. We assessed longitudinal changes in DAA sales by country income group, geographical region and drug type. We also conducted an interrupted time series analysis to assess COVID-19-related changes in the trend of DAA units sold globally. Our analysis used DAA sales data from the IQVIA multinational integrated data analysis database of 52 countries and two regions and HCV prevalence data from Polaris from 2014 to 2020. Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of DAAs sold per 100 000 people living with HCV per country, country income group and geographic region. We then compared the pre-post change in DAA units by drug type and country income group. We fitted autoregressive moving average models with a ramp function to assess the impact of COVID-19 on monthly DAA units sold. Across all countries, from August 2014 to August 2020, a monthly average of 44 219 DAA units per 100 000 HCV cases was sold. High-income countries purchased more units than other groups. In terms of geographic location, North America (124 144 per 100 000 HCV cases) and Europe (81 001 per 100 000 HCV cases) had the highest DAA sales over time; the newer generation of combination DAAs was mainly used in high-income countries. In contrast, first-generation and second-generation DAAs were the predominant types of DAAs sold in lower middle-income countries (LMICs). The pre-post analysis showed a 23% (p<0.001) average decrease in global sales of DAAs during the first phase of COVID-19. The decrease in LMICs (69%, p<0.001) was approximately double that of high-income countries (33%, p<0.001), while upper middle-income countries (UMICs) had a 34% (p<0.001) increase in DAA sales. The pandemic was associated with an immediate and sustained decrease of 9263 units per month (95% CI -14 668 to -3857.46) in high-income countries, a 73.14 (-850.96 to 997.24) unit increase in UMICs and a 742.58 (95% CI -5505.91 to 4020.75) unit decrease in LMICs. Our study showed uneven access to DAAs globally, with higher prevalence-adjusted utilisation in high-income countries compared with lower-income countries. Our study also found that the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly decreased DAA sales in many countries. To counter these trends, additional strategies, such as price reductions, increased competition among manufacturers and licensing agreements, may help to improve access and utilisation of DAAs globally.",

This review combines findings from over 600 studies on biosimilars found in PubMed (showing that no biosimilar with proven analytical similarity has ever failed a CES), looks at the differences in global regulations on this topic, and explains how the Food and Drug Administration's pharmacokinetic testing rules for biosimilars are similar to the bioequivalence testing for generics. Finally, specific changes to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) are suggested to make US rules match the growing global scientific agreement, which could lower development costs and speed up patient access to biosimilars while still keeping safety and effectiveness intact.",

        "abstract": "From the perspective of Chinese healthcare system, this study compared the cost-utility of aripiprazole once-monthly (AOM) and paliperidone palmitate once-monthly injectable (PP1M) in the treatment of adult patients with schizophrenia in China. A 5-state Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of 10 years of long-acting injections (LAI) treatment for schizophrenia. The long-term costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the primary outcome. The annual discount rate was set at 5%. A cost-effectiveness threshold (CET) of 0.51 times China's 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) (US$ 6,394.536) was used to judge the economics of intervention. The current price of AOM in China is relatively high (US$418.140). To assess its cost-effectiveness in the context of potential price negotiations with China Healthcare Security Administration (CHS) for inclusion in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), we simulated a 40% price reduction (US$257.619). At a CET of 0.51 times GDP per capita (US$6,394.536), the base-case analysis showed that the incremental costs of AOM relative to PP1M after 10 years of treatment were US$1,926.373 with an incremental gain of 0.306 QALYs. The ICER for AOM was US$6,285.303 per QALY, which is below the CET, indicating that AOM is cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis identified AOM's drug cost as the parameter with the greatest impact on results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that with a 40% price reduction, the probability of AOM being cost-effective is only 41.70%. However, with a 60% price reduction, AOM became dominantly cost-effective, with the probability increasing to 100%. When the CET was relaxed to 0.90 times GDP per capita (US$11,284.476), the probability of cost-effectiveness for AOM after a 40% price reduction rose to 85.10%. Scenario analyses conducted over a time horizon extending from 10 to 30 years showed that the ICER decreased significantly with longer follow-up, gradually approaching the 0.51GDP threshold and remaining below the 0.90 GDP threshold throughout the analysis. The cost-effectiveness of AOM relative to PP1M is highly influenced by its price and the CET. Healthcare decision makers or clinical users need to balance innovation incentives and accessibility.",

This study quantified the significant variability in treatment costs for unresectable HCC from payer and provider perspectives. An Excel-based price analysis model was developed to estimate the prices of ST and TARE over a 21-month time horizon using 2015-2021 data. Median prices were calculated from Medicare Average Sales Price (ASP), provider Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), and Average Wholesale Price (AWP). Sensitivity analyses evaluated price fluctuations associated with a ±10% variation in treatment duration. ST prices demonstrated marked variability across perspectives, with the median ASP at $175,625, WAC at $198,719, and AWP at $262,892. However, TARE prices were stable, ranging from $21,594 to $24,052. Sensitivity analyses revealed that treatment duration variation resulted in price changes of $35,000-$50,000 for ST, compared with ~$5000 for TARE. The variability in ST pricing was driven by treatment duration and drug-specific pricing mechanisms, particularly immunotherapy-based regimens, which accounted for the higher cost range. Conversely, TARE's consistent pricing is attributed to standardized procedural costs. Substantial variability exists in ST prices compared with the consistent costs of TARE, underscoring the economic advantage of TARE in appropriate clinical contexts.",

This research endeavors to investigate the influence of MAH on the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) performance of companies through the application of the difference-in-differences model, leveraging firm data from China's A-share-listed pharmaceutical manufacturing sector spanning from 2012 to 2019. First, MAH markedly enhances the ESG performance of pharmaceutical manufacturing entities. Secondly, MAH impacts firms' ESG performance via three pathways, namely, boosting research and development (R & D) investment, diminishing the internal pay disparity, and lowering supply chain concentration. Thirdly, the effect of MAH on firms' ESG performance is more pronounced in non-state-owned firms, those with elevated management shareholding, and firms with enhanced internal control levels. Furthermore, this study ascertained that MAH exerted no influence on firm ESG variance and real earnings management. The results offer actionable policy recommendations for refining the MAH system and promoting the sustainable development of pharmaceutical manufacturing firms. This study not only expands the research boundary of the economic consequences of the MAH system, but also affirms the key role of institutional innovation in the sustainable development of enterprises.",

This study utilizes game theory to analyze the strategic interplay and conflicts of interest among these three sectors within China's reform context, exploring the strategic choices and interactions that occur during the reform process. This study utilizes game theory to analyze the strategic interplay among pharmaceutical companies, healthcare institutions, and the health insurance regulator in China's healthcare reform. The model examines key variables and behaviors of each stakeholder, with MATLAB simulations analyzing evolutionarily stable strategies and parameter sensitivity. The findings reveal complex dynamic interactions among the strategies adopted by the various stakeholders within the healthcare reform, with the optimal strategies converging at the equilibrium point. Specifically, pharmaceutical companies seek maximum economic gains through drug pricing and quality control; healthcare institutions strive to enhance service efficiency and quality to meet patient needs; and medical insurance regulatory bodies play a crucial role in ensuring the efficiency and fairness of fund utilization. Such strategic alignments contribute to the stable operation of the healthcare system and maximize the interests of all parties involved. The study concludes that coordinated strategies among pharmaceutical companies, healthcare institutions, and health insurance regulator can achieve equilibrium and enhance the efficiency and equity of China's healthcare system. Changes in penalties for pharmaceutical companies, costs of medical service quality, and medical insurance regulatory costs critically influence healthcare reform, providing empirical support and a theoretical basis for effective policy-making. Refining policy adjustments and strategic optimizations can effectively coordinate the interests of all parties, propelling China's healthcare system toward greater efficiency and fairness.",

Despite the program's growth, size, and impact, there is little published research on the factors causing 340B growth, with different stakeholders offering divergent explanations. Program advocates contend that manufacturer price increases are the primary driver of 340B growth, while program critics argue that 340B hospitals are driving utilization. This study used price-volume-mix decomposition to examine the relative importance of price vs utilization for 340B growth using a national sample of over 28 000 National Drug Code drugs. From 2018 to 2024, utilization accounted for an average of 79.6% of 340B growth based on list price, and close to 100% of growth based on 340B discount prices. Utilization also accounted for the majority of 340B growth for the top 10 drugs reported by HRSA and for the segment of drugs with price increases above inflation. These findings show that utilization increases, not manufacturer pricing decisions, are the main driver of 340B growth, a conclusion that may have significant public policy implications.",

We examined Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHAs) for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Essential Medicines and Health Supplies List for Uganda (EMHSLU), assessed all criteria, and proposed alternative medicines to improve cost-savings and health outcomes. We conducted a literature review followed by budget impact analysis (BIA) to evaluate potential cost-savings from refining EMHSLU. In our literature review, we identified metrics for measuring availability, accessibility, and affordability of medicines and evaluated evidence on cost-effectiveness, safety, and efficacy of OHAs. According to the country context and available data, we used applicable methods to analyze five classes of OHAs available in Uganda. Since the government covers essential medicines in the public sector based on BIA, we assessed affordability for the government by examining potential savings in two scenarios (#1: shifts within the EMHSLU; #2: use of non-EMHSLU drugs). OHAs added to the EMHSLU 2023 are less available and accessible compared to OHAs in EMHSLU 2016. BIA scenario 1 revealed that the complete replacement of glimepiride 2 mg and gliclazide 80 mg with glibenclamide 5 mg could save the government up to USD 2.65 million per year. Additionally, scenario 2 showed that full replacement of dapagliflozin 10 mg and glimepiride 4 mg instead of their lower doses can save up to United States Dollar (USD) 230,000 and USD 600,000 per year, respectively. A review and adaptation of a published cost-effectiveness analysis highlights that sitagliptin is a cost-effective OHA in Uganda with an estimated Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio of $6,132/Quality-Adjusted LifeYear. The findings suggest several potential type 2 diabetes oral medication substitutions which would reduce costs.",

We developed an open-source index economic evaluation of entrectinib, a tumor-agnostic therapy with conditional market authorization. Our objective was to replicate the initial HTA report from publicly available information, aiming to identify key operational and methodological aspects for operationalizing life-cycle decision-making. We used partitioned survival analysis to determine tumor-agnostic and tumor-specific cost-effectiveness, using publicly available HTA reviews for parameterization. We estimated incremental costs in 2021 Canadian and US dollars (CAD and USD) from a public-payer healthcare perspective, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). We assessed the impact of treatment effectiveness, extrapolation assumptions, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) costs. One-third of the parameters (<i>n</i> = 30) were unavailable in the Canadian reimbursement review and were sourced from international reviews. Tumor-agnostic incremental costs were CAD 68,451 (95 percent confidence interval: 35,466, 92,155) and USD 54,608 (28,294, 73,518), and QALYs were 0.13 (-0.42, 0.42), yielding INMB CAD -55,803 at 100,000/QALY (USD -44,518). Full extrapolation of treatment effectiveness also yielded negative INMB (CAD -66,664). Inclusion of NGS costs diminished the expected value. Heterogeneity was considerable across tumor indications. We developed an open-source index economic evaluation to operationalize life-cycle HTA for a conditionally authorized tumor-agnostic therapy. Our findings outline key operational and methodological considerations necessary for the development of index economic models that support life-cycle HTA, offering insights into their potential integration into regular HTA and policy decision-making processes.",

The aim of our systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the length of hospital stay and associated treatment costs for patients with susceptible and antibiotic-resistant <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, Paratyphi and non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> infections. Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched EMBASE, Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Hinari and LILACS databases for studies published between 1 January 2005 and 15 May 2024, with no language restrictions. We included 30 studies that reported the length of hospital stay or treatment costs for patients with susceptible or antibiotic-resistant <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi, Paratyphi and non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> infections. We excluded studies with sample sizes of less than 30 patients, those focused on non-human subjects and those not reporting our outcomes of interest. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data on the length of hospital stay and associated costs, with monetary values converted to 2019 USD. We aggregated data according to GDP per capita quantiles using a random-effects meta-analysis. We conducted a quality assessment using an adapted Joanna Briggs Institute tool. Patients with drug-resistant <i>Salmonella</i> infections had longer hospital stays, with an additional 0.5-2.2 days compared with drug-susceptible <i>Salmonella</i> infections. Based on our meta-analysis, the mean hospital stay for typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> infections was 6.4 days (95% CI 4.9 to 7.8) for drug-susceptible cases and 8.4 days (95% CI 5.1 to 11.7) for resistant cases in the lowest income quartiles. While there were insufficient data to perform a pooled analysis, individual studies inferred that treatment costs for resistant typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> infections were higher than for susceptible infections, and resistant non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> infections had longer hospital stays and higher costs compared with susceptible infections. Data were scarce from high-<i>Salmonella</i>-burden countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Patients with antibiotic-resistant <i>Salmonella</i> infections experience a greater healthcare burden in terms of hospitalisation length and direct costs compared with those with susceptible infections. We highlight the economic burden of AMR in <i>Salmonella</i> infections and emphasise the need for preventive measures.",

        "abstract": "Globally, shifts in United States foreign-aid policy have put HIV funding under duress. South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV program is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the potential epidemiological impact of ceasing provision of services currently supported by PEPFAR and the costs and cost-effectiveness to the South African government (SAG) of potentially taking over these services. We used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFAR's funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV program costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars. Over 2025-2028, discontinuing activities currently funded by PEPFAR in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150 000-296 000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56 000-65 000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519 000-712 000 additional AIDS-related deaths. Sustaining these services would cost an additional $620 million to $1.4 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP for key populations. Unmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.",

        "abstract": "To (1) develop a metric that quantitatively measures the risk that utilization management (UM) policies pose to patients and (2) measure the relationship between this metric and payers' real-world UM use. We conducted a targeted literature review and an expert elicitation exercise to create the Data-Based Utilization Management Risk Designation (BURDEN) score. Real-world data analysis measured the relationship between BURDEN and actual payer policies. The BURDEN score was based on 9 UM factors impacting patient outcomes. Factors were weighted based on an expert elicitation procedure with 6 stakeholders. UM policy restrictions were drawn from Tufts Medical Center's Specialty Drug Evidence and Coverage database, and net price data came from SSR Health. Ordinary least square regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the BURDEN score and coverage policies. Among 98 treatments identified across 30 unique diseases, UM policies on treatments for myasthenia gravis, multiple myeloma, and lupus nephritis posed the highest risk to patients, according to the BURDEN score. When treatments had a high BURDEN score, payers were 22.0% less likely to impose any UM restriction (P = .041) and 36.2% less likely to impose step edits (P = .039). This study developed a quantitative measure (BURDEN) to estimate the relative risk to patients of payer UM policies. Payers appeared modestly sensitive to treatments that posed a high risk to patients should UM be implemented. However, coverage decisions did not appear to be fully patient-centered, as some higher BURDEN products experienced increased UM usage.",

        "abstract": "In Ireland, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act represents the first Irish policy attempt to address alcohol harms through an explicitly public health approach. Lauded internationally, the Act aligns with 'best buy' policy recommendations, encompassing a suite of measures targeting the pricing, visibility, advertising and health labelling of alcohol products. Recognising the importance of implementation in the policy process, this study sought to examine the implementation of this multi-component alcohol policy. We conducted 15 qualitative interviews with a range of participants with direct knowledge or experience of implementing the Public Health (Alcohol) Act. Participants included policy stakeholders, private sector implementation actors and public health/alcohol policy experts. In the analysis, we used the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to map barriers and facilitators to implementation of this policy. The study found that barriers and facilitators to implementation were reported for all five domains of CFIR across 21 constructs. Private sector actors placed a greater emphasis on cost-related factors as perceived barriers, whereas policy stakeholders and public health policy experts underlined the reported persistence of industry lobbying as a barrier. All categories of participant perceived a lack of planning for both implementation and policy evaluation, a dearth of resources for inner setting actors and a lack of high-level leadership during policy implementation. Participants also noted the complexity of implementation, lack of relational connections and gaps in innovation design as barriers to implementation. Facilitators included the reported expertise of and relational connections with key individuals, and the policy's alignment with international 'best buy' policy recommendations. Given the range of challenges perceived in implementing this comprehensive alcohol policy, our study underlines the need for strategic implementation planning, for ongoing evaluation and monitoring of the policy measures, and for adequate resourcing of inner setting actors. The study also notes the importance of anticipating and planning for continued industry lobbying during the implementation phase, acknowledging the reality of the \"politics of implementation\".",

        "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance (ABR) may increase hospital costs, utility loss and mortality risk per patient. Understanding these losses at national, regional and global scales is necessary for efficiently tackling ABR. Our aim is to estimate the global economic burden of antibiotic-resistant infections and the potential for bacterial vaccines to mitigate this burden. We take healthcare system and labour productivity perspectives. Hospital cost-per-case and length-of-stay estimates were calculated through meta-analyses and reviewing published systematic reviews. Unit labour productivity losses were estimated through a human capital approach. Modelled estimates were used where secondary data were missing. Death and incidence data were combined with unit cost data to estimate the economic burden associated with ABR in 2019, and the potential costs averted (in 2019 US$) based on uptake scenarios of vaccines that currently exist or are likely to be developed. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis had the highest mean hospital cost attributable to ABR per patient, the range was US$3000 in lower-income settings to US$41 000 in high-income settings, with carbapenem-resistant infections associated with a high cost-per-case of US$3000-US$7000 depending on syndrome. ABR was associated with a median value of US$693 billion (IQR: US$627 bn-US$768 bn) in hospital costs globally, with US$207 bn (IQR: US$186 bn-US$229 bn) potentially avertable by vaccines. Productivity losses were quantified at almost US$194 billion, with US$76 bn avertable by vaccines. The economic burden of ABR is associated with high levels of hospital bed-days occupied, hospital spending and labour productivity losses globally and should, therefore, remain high on national and international policy agendas. Vaccines against <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> would avert a substantial portion of the economic burden associated with ABR. More robust evidence, particularly in low-income countries, on the hospital costs, associated with and attributable to ABR, is needed.",

Based on inpatient data from 2019 to 2023, the study employed Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models to compare inpatient cost differences between the DRG payment group and the non-DRG payment group. Concentration indices were used to assess the consistency of inpatient cost distribution. The DRG payment reform significantly reduced the total inpatient costs for surgeries in general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, and urology, particularly in terms of drug and material expenses. Additionally, the inpatient cost distribution in the DRG payment group became more concentrated, indicating a significant reduction in the proportion of high-cost cases. The DRG payment reform effectively controlled inpatient costs in Chinese tertiary hospitals, particularly for complex surgical procedures, and improved the efficiency of healthcare resource utilization. This study provides empirical support for the further implementation of DRG payment reform and offers policy recommendations for optimizing China's healthcare payment system.",

        "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous respiratory condition often classified into distinct phenotypes. Severe asthma, characterized by uncontrolled symptoms despite optimal treatment, imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of mepolizumab compared with other interleukin (IL)-5 pathway inhibitors, benralizumab and reslizumab, in treating severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype in Chile. A Markov cohort model was developed to compare mepolizumab (100 mg subcutaneously every four weeks) with benralizumab (30 mg subcutaneously every four weeks for the first three doses, every eight weeks subsequently) and reslizumab (3 mg/kg intravenously every four weeks), both as add-on therapies to standard care. Data from the Mepolizumab as Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Severe Asthma (MENSA) clinical trial and a network meta-analysis were used. Utility values were extracted using the EuroQoL 5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses assessed model robustness. Mepolizumab demonstrated dominance with probability over 95% when compared with benralizumab and reslizumab. Cost savings ranged from 37,000 United States dollars (USD) to 104,000 USD, with an increase of 0.52 to 0.55 quality-adjusted life years. Mepolizumab was also associated with a lower incidence of exacerbations and asthma-related deaths. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of the model outcomes across key parameters. Limitations of the economic model are related to the lack of direct comparisons between mepolizumab and other biologics. Additionally, the absence of data on continuation criteria required estimating relative risks for the overall population. Mepolizumab offers greater efficacy and cost savings compared to benralizumab and reslizumab for eosinophilic asthma, providing essential insights for improving asthma management and informing healthcare policies in Chile.",

To ensure safe treatment with primaquine, point-of-care glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing was rolled out in Cambodia at the health facility level, although most malaria patients are diagnosed in the community. The current study aims to explore the acceptability and feasibility of implementing community-level G6PD testing in Cambodia. Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted. Across eight study sites in three provinces, 142 respondents, including policymakers, programme officers, healthcare providers and patients, participated in 67 interviews and 19 FGDs in 2022 and 2023. Data were analysed thematically using an adapted framework derived from Bowen <i>et al</i>'s feasibility framework and Sekhon <i>et al</i>'s acceptability framework. All stakeholders attributed value to the intervention. Acknowledging an intervention's different values can help discern policy implications for an intervention's successful implementation. Building and maintaining confidence in the device, end users, infrastructure and health systems were found to be key elements of acceptability. In general, health centre workers and village malaria workers (VMWs) had confidence that VMWs could conduct the test and administer treatment given appropriate initial training, monthly refresher training and the test's repeated use. More is required to build policymakers' confidence, while some implementation challenges, including the test's regulatory approval, stability above 30°C and cost, need to be overcome. Implementation of G6PD testing at the community level in Cambodia is an acceptable and potentially feasible option but requires addressing implementation challenges and building and maintaining confidence among stakeholders.",

Cancer care costs in the United States are expected to rise to 245 billion by 2030. In this health policy session, we focused on three cost-containment strategies, and their potential impact on cancer care delivery. <i>Site Neutrality: Curbing the Cost of Cancer Care, but at What Risk?</i>, explores legislation that would introduce payment parity across differing sites of care: elimination of facility fees in hospital owned practices and shift of billing for oncology infusions away from hospital owned practices. Unintended consequences could reduce access to care for vulnerable populations, shift costs to patients, and reduce safety. <i>Post-Pandemic Digital Health Reimbursement: Impact on Access to Care</i>, explores how the emergency waivers, licensure flexibilities, and parity reimbursement necessitated by COVID-19 shepherded innovation that outpaced the regulatory framework needed for long-term sustainability. Today, telehealth services, hospital at home, remote patient monitoring, and decentralized clinical trial enrollment face reintroduction of regulatory and payment barriers. <i>Will we live to see efficacy-based pricing for cancer drugs?

Our goal is to formulate policy recommendations that can effectively alleviate the financial strain on these patients and their families. The pulmonary tuberculosis cases, which were non-drug-resistant, registered across the province during May-June 2020, and successfully treated at the time of the survey, underwent questionnaire interviews conducted through probability proportional sampling. Utilizing the WHO methodology, the household economic burden borne by these patients was computed, with the mean and median (interquartile range), abbreviated as \"M (IQR),\" employed to describe the economic burden, and the proportion (%) used to depict catastrophic expenditures. Further analysis of the factors influencing catastrophic expenditures within these families was conducted using chi-squared (<i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>) tests and binary logistic regression. The average total out-of-pocket expenses (OOP) incurred by 2,283 non-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Guizhou Province amounted to 10,581.82 RMB ($1453.11), with a median expenditure of 5,277 RMB (IQR: 2,110-12,352 RMB). Notably, indirect expenses comprised 58.07% of the total expenditure. Taking the time of diagnosis as the cut-off point, the majority of these expenses occurred during the treatment phase, but the before diagnosis stage also imposed a significant economic burden, averaging 3,191.58 RMB ($438.27). Among the 2,283 patients, 50.37% (1,150 patients) experienced catastrophic events due to their medical expenses. Key risk factors for these catastrophic events included poverty, employment status, before diagnosis visits, hospitalization, mobility issues, and delayed diagnosis. The economic burden imposed on households by tuberculosis patients in the province remains considerable, with the indirect burden accounting for the lion's share. The likelihood of catastrophic expenditures persists, significantly influenced by factors such as poverty, hospitalization, delayed diagnoses, and before diagnosis visits. Recommendations include reinforcing targeted public health education, enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of medical institutions, regulating their practices, curbing unnecessary hospitalizations, and instituting a long-term framework aimed at alleviating the indirect economic burden. By doing so, we can collaboratively diminish the economic strain on patients and mitigate the risk of catastrophic expenditures, ultimately striving for the achievement of zero catastrophic expenditures among households.",

        "abstract": "The intersection of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a significant global health challenge, marked by complex disease interactions with profound clinical and public health consequences. TB, a historically prevalent infectious disease, and DM, a rising non-communicable disease, together fuel a syndemic in which each condition exacerbates the other. DM increases susceptibility to TB by weakening immune defenses, facilitating the proliferation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and accelerating TB progression. Mechanistic insights reveal that hyperglycemia-driven immune dysfunction impairs both innate and adaptive immunity, with effects such as reduced T-helper cell activity, impaired macrophage and neutrophil responses, and altered cytokine profiles. These immune changes allow for easier MTB survival, lung damage, and systemic inflammation, thus worsening TB outcomes in diabetic patients. The combined burden of TB and DM disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, particularly in resource-limited settings and developing nations where TB remains endemic, and diabetes prevalence is increasing. Population health data highlight the increasing occurrence of DM among TB patients, with studies reporting comorbidity rates as high as 45 % in some regions. Furthermore, TB worsens glycemic control in DM patients, creating a cyclical burden that complicates disease management. Evidence also highlights the role of social and demographic characteristics, including age, urban residence, and financial standing, along with behavioral factors like tobacco and alcohol use, as significant risk enhancers for TB-DM comorbidity. Screening for tuberculosis in individuals with diabetes and for diabetes in those with tuberculosis is crucial in high-burden regions to enable timely detection and intervention. Effective screening methods include clinical assessments, radiological imaging, and both rapid and conventional microbiological testing for TB, while plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) tests are standard for detecting diabetes. Latent tuberculosis utilizing the Mantoux tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for screening is particularly recommended for high-risk diabetic patients to help prevent the progression of the disease. These dual screening efforts are essential for reducing morbidity, mortality, and the transmission of TB among individuals with diabetes. Therapeutic strategies for TB-DM management involve tailored anti-diabetic regimens and cautious selection of anti-TB medications to avoid adverse interactions. Insulin is the preferred treatment for severe cases of diabetes in TB patients due to its anabolic properties and lack of interaction with TB medications. Oral agents like metformin are widely used in mild cases but require monitoring for renal and hepatic health. Innovative approaches and meticulous monitoring can improve TB outcomes in DM patients by achieving better glycemic control. Meanwhile, challenges persist due to the risk of drug resistance, complications from multi-drug-resistant TB, and heightened mortality. In conclusion, TB-DM comorbidity calls for an integrated healthcare response, combining individualized treatment with strengthened health systems and public health policies. Addressing the \"syndemic\" of TB and DM requires targeted screening, synchronized management protocols, and sustained community-based interventions. Integrating these strategies with better healthcare access and policy reforms can help reduce the burden of TB-DM and improve outcomes for affected populations globally.",
