        "abstract": "Drug-related infectious diseases (DRID), such as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), contribute to high morbidity and mortality among people who inject drugs (PWID). The European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) is responsible for monitoring DRID and related behaviours for PWID in Europe. We updated the EUDA DRID technical protocol which covers all steps from planning to data analysis needed for a survey among PWID. Drug-related infectious disease-specific indicators were revised. To enable a more effective monitoring of the current epidemiological situation, we added specific core indicators, such as prevalence of viraemic HBV, HCV and HIV care cascades and harm reduction-related indicators. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and take-home naloxone were added as optional indicators. The process was informed by a European working group, who shared best-practice examples of (repeated) cross-sectional and cohort surveys using different methods in various settings. To reach the World Health Organization's goal of ending HIV and the viral hepatitis epidemics, comprehensive DRID monitoring among the disproportionately affected PWID population is needed.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including type 2 diabetes mellitus, are emerging as major health concerns across India. Diabetes, once considered a predominantly urban condition, is increasingly being reported from rural populations as well, reflecting broader lifestyle and epidemiological transitions. National reports highlight a growing prevalence of high blood glucose levels, particularly among adults, with a rising trend in both awareness and disease burden. India is now among the countries with the highest number of individuals living with diabetes, necessitating urgent public health attention. This study examines the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its associated risk factors among adults in a rural area of Haryana, contributing to the evidence base required for targeted NCD prevention and control strategies in similar settings. The study was conducted among 910 adults aged ≥18 years from villages under the Primary Health Center (PHC) Garhi Harsaru, Haryana, India. Cluster random sampling, using probability proportional to size (PPS), was employed to recruit study participants. All the study participants were subjected to the WHO STEPS questionnaire, and random blood glucose estimation was done. Apart from these, demographic, socioeconomic, and anthropometric details, along with blood pressure and physical activity, were recorded, and their association with the prevalence of diabetes was studied. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 26.0 (Chicago, IL: IBM Corp.). Pearson's chi-squared test was used to evaluate differences between groups for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the independent associations.  The prevalence of newly detected diabetes was 6.2%. Adults aged 50-59 years (OR: 3.4), overweight, and obesity (OR: 5.80) were found to be the independent risk factors significantly associated with diabetes mellitus in the study population.  The prevalence of diabetes is rising, even in the rural population of Haryana. Targeted preventive strategies focusing on lifestyle modification and education should be prioritized in primary care settings to address this growing rural health challenge.",

        "abstract": "Inactivated COVID-19 vaccines exhibit more rapid declines in antibody levels than other vaccine platforms, likely owing to transient antigen exposure and limited germinal center persistence. Moreover, although homologous boosting effectively restores humoral immunity, concerns persist regarding potential T cell exhaustion with repeated antigen exposure. We evaluated the effectiveness of delayed homologous CoronaVac booster immunization in reactivating immune memory. A prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 83 healthy adults who received two CoronaVac vaccine doses (14-day interval) and a homologous booster shot after 12 months. Peripheral blood samples were collected 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after booster vaccination. Neutralizing antibodies were analysed using live-virus microneutralization assays. Anti-receptor-binding domain immunoglobulin subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cytokine secretion (interferon [IFN]-γ/interleukin [IL]-2/IL-4/IL-5) was assessed using enzyme-linked immunospot assay. T cell polarization and exhaustion markers (T-bet/GATA3 and CD69/CTLA-4/PD-1) were evaluated using flow cytometry. The geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibodies reached 254.5 on day 14. The initial immune response was dominated by IgG3, which subsequently shifted to IgG1. A significant Th1-type cellular immune response was characterized by increased IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion, and upregulated T-bet expression. Transient CD69+ T cell activation occurred between days 3 and 10 without sustained PD-1 and CTLA-4 elevation. Delayed homologous CoronaVac booster immunization effectively reactivates immune memory, facilitated by Th1 polarization and transient T cell activation, which do not result in T cell exhaustion. These findings suggest the potential application of long-interval immunization strategies against COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "This document is a detailed proposal addressing the management of spirometry and other pulmonary function tests in the post-COVID-19 pandemic context in Spain. The introduction discusses how the pandemic has affected the performance of these essential tests and underscores the need for a pragmatic assessment of risks and benefits, given that the absence of pulmonary function studies may lead to significant diagnostic and therapeutic errors.The section on the epidemiological situation in Spain highlights that the WHO no longer considers COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern, reflecting the reduced severity of the disease due to high vaccination coverage and the characteristics of circulating variants.The regulatory framework states that the Health Institute Carlos III has defined a new epidemiological surveillance strategy aimed at restoring social and healthcare normality. A ministerial order issued by the Ministry of Health is mentioned, which lifts the mandatory use of facemasks in certain settings, in alignment with the strategy to return to normalcy.The proposal provides an in-depth analysis of the infectious risk to healthcare workers and patients in pulmonary function laboratories, concluding that current practices -along with the use of surgical masks and viral filters- minimize the generation and transmission of infectious aerosols.Detailed recommendations are provided for risk management, including architectural controls, administrative measures, hygiene practices, and personal protective protocols, with the goal of safeguarding both healthcare professionals and patients.The cited bibliography reinforces the scientific evidence base underlying the proposed recommendations and demonstrates a careful and deliberate approach to the safe and efficient reintroduction of spirometry and other pulmonary function tests into routine healthcare.",

        "title": "Pre-treatment loss to follow-up and associated factors among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients diagnosed in Wakiso district, central Uganda.",
        "abstract": "Tuberculosis ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. The Sub-Saharan African region faces increasing trends of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB), further complicating the existing efforts for prevention, control, and eradication. Pre-treatment loss to follow-up (LTFU) among diagnosed DR-TB patients also signifies a setback in the timely prevention of disease progression and transmission, especially in low-resource settings. This study assessed the magnitude of and factors associated with pre-treatment LTFU among DR-TB patients within Wakiso district, central Uganda. A sequential explanatory study design was adopted to analyze electronic case-based surveillance (eCBSS) data between 2017 to 2022 from the Ministry of Health, Uganda. Participants for qualitative data comprised of six (6) key informant interviews and 2 focus group discussions among health workers and DR-TB patients respectively. Out of the 972 records retrieved from the eCBSS system for patients treated at Mulago National Referral Hospital from 2017 to 2022; 253 were analyzed. The majority of the participants, 62% (157/253), were male. The median age of study participants was 34 years (range: 18- 85). The prevalence of pretreatment LTFU was 13.4% (34/253). The qualitative findings reinforced and provided context to the quantitative results, revealing how behavioral, social, and system-level factors contribute to pre-treatment loss to follow-up (LTFU) among DR-TB patients. Significant associations were observed in patients who lacked a recorded telephone contact in TB register (adjusted PR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.27-0.80) and those without documented home address (adjusted PR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.27-0.97); qualitatively, this was linked to patients' fear of stigma, lack of trust in the health system, and unstable living conditions, leading them to avoid being traced. The analysis also showed that tobacco use (adjusted PR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.00-3.87) and illicit drug use (adjusted PR = 4.00, 95% CI: 1.76-9.08) significantly increased the risk of LTFU, which was supported by narratives describing substance use as contributing to hopelessness and neglect of health. Furthermore, patients with a history of treatment failure had 2.4 times the risk of being lost to follow-up (adjusted PR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.08-5.36), consistent with qualitative reports of discouragement, denial, and lack of awareness about the severity of DR-TB. Relapse cases had 69% higher prevalence of loss to follow-up (adjusted PR = 1.69, 95% CI 0.78-3.70) compared to new cases. Although factors such as alcohol use and family support did not reach statistical significance in the quantitative model, they were prominent in the qualitative data, suggesting under-recognized barriers related to psychosocial distress and poverty. Together, these findings demonstrate a strong convergence between data strands while highlighting that some influential factors particularly social and psychological may be underrepresented in routine health data. The study found a 13.4% prevalence of pre-treatment LTFU among DR-TB patients in Wakiso District. Quantitative analysis identified significant predictors, including lack of contact information, prior treatment failure, tobacco use, and illicit drug use, while protective factors included having a recorded home address and telephone contact recorded in relevant TB registers/electronic systems. These findings were reinforced by qualitative insights, which revealed that fear of stigma, denial of illness, substance abuse, poor health system responsiveness, and lack of social support contributed to patient disengagement. The integration of both data strands highlights the need for a patient-centered approach that strengthens communication, addresses behavioral health needs, and improves follow-up systems to reduce pre-treatment LTFU and improve DR-TB outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The hybrid pathway is an alternative surgical route for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and patients with single-ventricle systemic obstructive physiology. Limited data exist on post-Fontan arrhythmias in these patients. This study aimed to assess the type and frequency of arrhythmias post-Fontan in hybrid pathway patients and compare them to the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial (SVRT). A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with single-ventricle anatomy who underwent the hybrid procedure and subsequently completed the Fontan surgery. Exclusion criteria included incomplete pre- or post-operative Fontan data or lack of post-Fontan hospital discharge. Baseline demographics, pre-Fontan ECG, 6-year ECG and Holter, and cardiac medications were recorded. Arrhythmias were defined as isolated atrial or ventricular ectopy, non-sustained or sustained tachyarrhythmias. A total of 116 patients met criteria (HLHS n = 79, single-ventricle variants n = 37). Fontan age was 2.7 ± 0.7 years, post-Fontan ECG age was 6.4 ± 0.9 years, and Holter age was 7.0 ± 1.8 years. Mortality occurred in 3 patients and transplantation in 2 patients. Atrial arrhythmias appeared in 69% (70/102) of the Holters, mostly isolated (70/70,100%) and rare (65/70, 93%). Ventricular arrhythmias appeared in 62% (63/102), also mainly isolated (63/63, 100%), and rare (62/63, 98%). Any degree of AV block occurred in 8.8% (9/102) and pacemaker placement occurred in 2.6% (3/116). PR interval, QRS duration, and QTc values were not associated with death or transplantation. Hybrid pathway had higher odds of atrial arrhythmias compared to SVRT Norwood-shunt (OR 4.11 (2.29, 7.53)) and Norwood-conduit (OR 4.38 (2.46, 7.92)). Odds ratios were not different for ventricular arrhythmias between the three groups. Hybrid pathway had a lower odds ratio for any degree of AV block compared to the Norwood-conduit group (0.35 (0.14, 0.76)). Incidence of pacemakers was similar between hybrid (2.9%), Norwood-shunt (4.2%), and Norwood-conduit (3.8%) groups. At 6 years post-Fontan, benign atrial and ventricular arrhythmias were common in patients on the hybrid pathway. Incidence of atrial arrhythmias was higher in the hybrid group compared to the SVRT data, mostly due to isolated, rare atrial ectopy. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmia types and pacemaker placement were similar to SVRT data. Ongoing surveillance in this high-risk population is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Artemisinin-based combination therapies are a cornerstone of Namibia's efforts to eliminate malaria. Namibia has experienced a greater than 90% reduction in malaria cases since the introduction of these therapies in 2005. However, their efficacy has not been routinely monitored, with malaria outbreaks regularly reported since 2016. The recent emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa has highlighted the role of malaria molecular surveillance in complementing efficacy studies. This cross-sectional genomic surveillance study was nested within Namibia's routine surveillance system and aimed to determine the prevalence of antimalarial drug resistance markers in northern Namibia. Dried blood spots (DBS) and epidemiological data were collected from patients with confirmed Plasmodium falciparum cases who presented at health facilities in the highest malaria-burden regions (Zambezi, Kavango East, Kavango West, Ohangwena, and Omusati) from April to September 2023. Twelve genes associated with resistance to seven antimalarial drugs were genotyped from 264 DBS using multiplexed targeted amplicon sequencing. Multiple kelch 13 mutations associated with artemisinin partial resistance were identified: the P441L candidate marker was the most abundant, at 33.2%, and the P574L and A675V validated markers were observed in 1.2% of samples. The chloroquine resistance transporter C72/V73/M74I/N75E/K76T haplotype was observed in 1% of samples, whereas the multidrug resistance protein 1 N86 genotype, which is associated with reduced susceptibility to lumefantrine, was found in all samples. Although sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is not used in Namibia, a high proportion of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance-associated mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase genes were observed. In this study, we underscore the need for routine genomic surveillance to monitor emerging drug resistance markers and call for further research to define their clinical implications.",

        "abstract": "Malaria elimination is a critical public health goal, particularly in Africa, where the disease disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Egypt's success in achieving World Health Organization (WHO) malaria-free certification on October 20, 2024, through an evidence-based malaria elimination program, offers a valuable model for replication. Our study is identified as an implementation study, evaluating the evidence-based interventions deployed, the implementation strategy tested, and its outcomes to provide insights for scaling similar programs across Africa. A RE-AIM-informed lens was applied to better articulate how contextual factors, intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance influenced observed outcomes. We adopted a retrospective implementation science approach to analyze Egypt's malaria elimination program. The implementation strategy focused on high-priority malaria-endemic regions, targeting vulnerable groups such as children under five and pregnant women. Interventions included vector control measures, such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), antimalarial treatment protocols, and public health education campaigns. Key implementation strategies included workforce training, multilevel stakeholder engagement, integrated data-driven decision-making, and community mobilization. Our study evaluated key implementation outcomes, including fidelity, feasibility, acceptability (measured using a custom-designed tool assessing stakeholder and community perceptions of the interventions), and adaptability alongside health outcomes such as incidence reduction, treatment coverage, and community awareness. Economic evaluations and process analyses provided additional insights into cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. The implementation strategy targeted malaria-endemic regions, achieving a 92% recruitment rate, focusing on vulnerable groups such as children under five (37%) and pregnant women (12%). 78% of the recipient population adhered to preventive measures like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). The program reduced malaria incidence by 96% over 15 years and achieved a 94% reduction in Anopheles mosquito density. Active surveillance led to the detection of 98% of cases within 48 hours of symptom onset, while treatment coverage reached 91%. Community awareness of malaria prevention increased to 84% by the program's conclusion. Economic evaluations revealed a cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted of $24, with an estimated $1.5 billion saved in healthcare costs and productivity losses over 15 years. Sub-group analyses highlighted higher adherence rates in urban areas (89%) compared to rural areas (73%) and significant reductions in malaria-related complications among pregnant women (78%). Implementation outcomes included high fidelity (93%) to planned strategies, high feasibility across urban and rural contexts, and successful adaptability to emerging challenges such as insecticide resistance and funding fluctuations. Routine monitoring systems, continuous feedback loops, and responsive adaptation mechanisms were central to achieving these outcomes. Acceptability scores averaged 87% across stakeholders, reflecting strong alignment with community values, trust in health authorities, and perceived relevance of interventions. Egypt's malaria elimination strategies exemplify the effective integration of implementation science into public health programs. Key success factors included community engagement, robust surveillance systems, and cost-effective resource allocation. The intentional use of implementation strategies and documented outcomes demonstrate alignment with the RE-AIM framework, reinforcing the program's relevance for broader application. Future efforts should emphasize tailored interventions, capacity building, transparent assessment of acceptability, and sustainable funding mechanisms to replicate Egypt's success.",

Furthermore, current clinical practice guidelines lack clarity regarding reintervention paradigms to achieve optimal AVF performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to document reintervention rates and their association with AVF maturation and functional patency among patients enrolled in the Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation (HFM) study. Retrospective review of a prospective observational cohort study. In total, 535 HFM study patients who underwent maturation adjudication across 7 academic centers. Pre- and postmaturation reinterventions (ie, revisional procedures) for single-stage, upper extremity AVFs. AVF reintervention-associated maturation success and functional patency. Descriptive statistical methods, including Kaplan-Meier methodology, characterized unadjusted reintervention outcomes. In total, 396 (74%) AVFs were successfully used for dialysis, and 37% (N=196 out of 535) underwent 274 reinterventions (181 endovascular, 93 open) to facilitate maturation. Factors associated with prematuration reintervention included female sex, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and elevated body mass index. Following maturation, 47% (N=188 out of 396) of the patients with a functional AVF underwent 477 reinterventions. The postmaturation reintervention clinical success rate was 70% (endovascular 72% [N=312 out of 435]; open 55% [N=23 out of 42]). Assisted maturation AVFs demonstrated inferior functional primary patency (<i>P</i> = 0.002) but equivalent cumulative functional patency (<i>P</i> > 0.9) compared with unassisted maturation fistulas. Postmaturation abandonment rate was 24% (N=95 out of 395). AVF management decisions were made by the individual surgeons, so this study cannot account for physician and center selection bias related to access use, remediation, or abandonment. Furthermore, AVFs were exclusively managed at academic institutions, so results may not be generalizable across all health care settings. Finally, prosthetic conduits were not evaluated. AVF reinterventions are common and are not associated with inferior maturation or functional patency rates. Timely remediation should be considered when clinically indicated, although AVFs remain at high-risk for subsequent reinterventions, with durable outcomes requiring meticulous surveillance.",

Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariate logistic regression were conducted. Associations with a <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Approximately 90.9% (95% CI: 89.9-90.2) of participants exhibited one or more behavioral risk factors. High dietary salt intake was the most common risk factor accounting for 90.0%. Statistically significant associations with the co-occurrence of behavioral risk factors were found among women in younger age groups, rural residents, Gofa zone residents, widowed/divorced or single individuals, merchants, housewives, individuals from households with a lower wealth index, those with lower educational attainment, and having a family history of NCDs. Conversely, being a government employee, mass media user, having good knowledge of NCD risk factors, having social support, and being a member of the functional Women Development Army (WDA) were identified as protective factors. The escalation of behavioral risk factors is concerning, highlighting the urgent need for targeted community-based interventions. It is recommended to prioritize younger age groups, rural residents, those with lower wealth status, and lower educational attainment. Implementing family-oriented changes and strengthening healthcare systems are crucial. Additionally, addressing policy and socio-political factors influencing the rise of NCD risk factors is essential.",

        "abstract": "Measles is a highly contagious vaccinepreventable disease endemic to Malaysia. This study aimed to determine the determinants of measles cases with complications in Selangor, Malaysia, from 2014 to 2023. This was a cross-sectional study of confirmed measles cases in Selangor using the secondary surveillance database, Sistem Maklumat Siasatan Measles (SM2). The data were reviewed from April 2024 to June 2024. All registered measles cases in Selangor from 2014 to 2023 were analyzed to determine the determinants of measles cases with complications, the type of measles complications, and the characteristics of those who developed measles complications. Of 3074 measles cases, 479 (15.6%) developed measles complications, of which diarrhea was the most common complication (87.6%), followed by pneumonia (11.6%), otitis media (0.6%), and subsclerosing panencephalitis (0.2%). The majority of those who developed measles complications were aged less than one year old (42.1%) and 1-6 years (31.4%). The significant determinants of measles cases with complications were non-Malaysian nationality (aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.44, 3.05), cases from urban areas (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.76), cases that fulfilled the measles clinical case definition (aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.59, 2.76), cases with a history of contact with other measles cases (aOR: 4.4, 95% CI: 3.43, 5.67), cases from the measles outbreak (aOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.19), and cases that were hospitalized (aOR: 5.6, 95% CI: 4.49, 7.07). Strengthening immunization coverage, particularly among high-risk groups, such as non- Malaysians and young children, is essential. Enhanced surveillance, targeted health education, and improved outbreak response strategies are crucial to reduce measles complications in the community. Further research is needed to explore additional factors contributing to measles complications and to assess the effectiveness of intervention measures.",

        "abstract": "Non‑operative management, particularly the watch and wait (WW) strategy, has emerged as an alternative to total mesorectal excision for selected patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) after neoadjuvant treatment. This narrative review examines oncologic outcomes, functional and quality‑of‑life benefits, diagnostic challenges, and surveillance requirements associated with WW compared to radical surgery. Evidence from randomized trials and international registries indicates that WW provides overall and disease-free survival rates comparable to those of surgery, provided that stringent selection criteria and intensive surveillance are maintained for 3 to 5 years. Local regrowth occurs in 15%-40% of patients-most commonly within 24 months-but salvage surgery is curative in over 90% of cases and restores oncologic equivalence. Nevertheless, distant metastasis is more frequent in patients who experience regrowth, underscoring the importance of early detection and the need for optimized systemic therapy. Accurate determination of cCR remains the primary limitation; digital rectal examination, high‑resolution magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopy, even when combined, cannot reliably exclude microscopic residual disease. Total neoadjuvant therapy increases cCR rates to 30%-60% and expands the pool of WW candidates, but also intensifies the need for standardized response definitions and surveillance algorithms. WW offers organ preservation and quality‑of‑life improvements without compromising survival in carefully selected patients, provided that multidisciplinary teams ensure rigorous response assessment and lifelong monitoring. Future advances in imaging, molecular biomarkers, and individualized risk stratification are expected to further enhance the safety of WW and expand eligibility to a broader patient population.",

        "abstract": "Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus that endangers public health and hinders socioeconomic development. Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region(Ningxia) is one of the primary locations where this disease is endemic. This study analyzed the prevalence and spatial distribution characteristics of human echinococcosis in Ningxia from 2011 to 2023, providing a reference for identifying key areas of human echinococcosis and developing targeted prevention and control strategies. Data on human echinococcosis in Ningxia from 2011 to 2023 were collected from \"China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention\". The population data were obtained from the official website of the Ningxia Statistical Bureau. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to characterize the incidence trend of human echinococcosis in Ningxia. County-level electronic maps of Ningxia were downloaded from the National Geographic Information Public Service Platform. The epidemiological characteristics of human echinococcosis were analyzed, and spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed using ArcGIS 10.4 software. Additionally, spatiotemporal scanning analysis was conducted using SaTScan V9.5 software. A total of 3,316 cases of human echinococcosis were reported from 2011 to 2023.The annual average incidence of the disease was 3.88 per 100,000 persons, with the highest rate of 6.38/100,000 in 2012 and the lowest rate of 1.33/100,000 in 2023. The incidence rate of human echinococcosis showed a declining trend, with average annual percent change (AAPC) of -11.27% (95% CI: -15.50% to -6.83%; t = -4.80, P < 0.001). Of the total cases, 1,566 were male and 1,750 were female. The male-to-female ratio is 0.89:1, with the incidence rate lower in males (3.48 per 100,000) than in females (4.06 per 100,000). The incidence rate was highest in the 70-year age group (17.00 per 100,000), followed by the 60-year age group (10.84 per 100,000), while the lowest incidence was observed in the 0-year age group (0.09 per 100,000). These data demonstrate a clear age-dependent increasing trend in human echinococcosis incidence rate(χ<sup>2</sup> = 4172.53; P < 0.001). The global spatial autocorrelation analysis results revealed that human echinococcosis incidence rate exhibited spatial clustering between 2015 and 2019 and 2021-2023. Local spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that the \"high-high\" clustered area was mainly located in southern Ningxia, specifically in Yuanzhou District, Haiyuan County, Hongsibao District and Pengyang County. Additionally, spatial scanning analysis identified four spatial clusters, including one most likely cluster(LLR = 335.53, RR = 4.13, P<0.01)and three secondary likely clusters. This study is based on Ningxia's echinococcosis surveillance data from 2011 to 2023. It was confirmed through spatial epidemiological analysis that the national central transfer payment prevention and control project can effectively reduce the rate of echinococcosis infection in the population. The spatial clustering characteristics found in the study (high-high clustering areas are concentrated in the southern mountainous areas, and low-low clustering areas are located in the northern and central areas) provide a scientific basis for differentiated prevention and control strategies. It is recommended to use \"patient tracking + key population monitoring\" instead of whole-region screening, focusing health resources on key areas and key populations, and maximizing prevention and control efficiency.",

        "abstract": "International guidelines recommend the administration of two doses of pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccination for people with chronic liver disease to prevent severe complications. We aimed to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage and mortality in adults with chronic liver disease in England. We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected medical record data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network. We included people aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with chronic liver disease between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2022. The primary outcome of interest was hepatitis A vaccination. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was calculated using the number of vaccinated people with chronic liver disease as the numerator and the chronic liver disease population in the RSC dataset as the denominator. We compared individual characteristics by vaccination status using descriptive statistics. We used a multistate survival model to estimate the transition probabilities between four states: (1) diagnosis of chronic liver disease; (2) first hepatitis A vaccination; (3) second hepatitis A vaccination; and (4) death. 664 571 individuals aged 18 years or older with chronic liver disease were identified from the RSC sentinel network population, of whom 625 079 individuals were included in our analysis. Of 625 079 individuals with chronic liver disease, 13 875 (2·2%) had received a first hepatitis A vaccination, 3007 (0·4%) had received a second dose, 732 (5·3%) of 13 875 vaccinated individuals died, and 101 065 (16·5%) of 611 204 individuals without vaccination died during the study period. Adjusting for death as a competing risk, vaccination was more likely among younger age quintiles (hazard ratio 5·46 [95% CI 5·13-5·81]), non-smokers (1·59 [1·54-1·65]), residents of urban areas (1·28 [1·21-1·35]), individuals with higher socioeconomic status (1·06 [1·03-1·10]), and individuals with a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; 1·71 [1·64-1·78]). Individuals with a history of harmful alcohol use (0·36 [0·32-0·39]), type 1 diabetes (0·46 [0·36-0·57]), chronic kidney disease (0·63 [0·57-0·70]), or mental disorders (0·66 [0·64-0·69]) were less likely to be vaccinated. The lowest risk of mortality was in people with chronic liver disease of infectious or autoimmune aetiology and in people with MASLD. Hepatitis A vaccine uptake among people with chronic liver disease in England is low, with disparities by age, location (urban vs rural), and socioeconomic status. Steps should be taken to reduce the inequalities in vaccine administration. GlaxoSmithKline's Investigator Sponsored Studies Program.",

        "abstract": "Achieving the World Health Organization's 2030 hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination goals necessitates robust and outcome-focussed surveillance. In Australia, HCV is a nationally notifiable condition, with state and territory health authorities leading surveillance and public health response. This study aimed to examine Queensland's HCV surveillance system and to identify barriers to, and solutions for, implementing notification-driven linkage to care. This study was conducted in two parts. System mapping and gap identification were conducted through consultation with key stakeholders operationally involved in HCV surveillance. Secondly, a proof-of-concept descriptive analysis of two months of notification data (January to February 2023), coinciding with a period of enhanced surveillance work, was conducted to scope the magnitude of follow-up and to provide insights into groups needing targeted support. Cases were grouped into indeterminate, active and cleared categories. System mapping and gap analysis identified significant constraints, including the absence of automated data processes and key data elements. These factors impeded the implementation of surveillance case definitions and hindered the identification of priority groups for linkage to care. Of 2,257 cases, 1,218 (54.0%) were individuals who had cleared HCV infection. There were 305 cases with incomplete diagnostic testing; 92/305 (30.2%) were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. Incomplete diagnostic testing was significantly more likely to occur for cases tested in the community compared to those tested in a correctional setting (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Of 734 active cases, 83.1% were male, 53.3% were tested in corrections, and 36.0% were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. To strengthen Queensland's HCV surveillance and enable effective linkage to care, several recommendations are proposed. These include amending public health regulations to require negative HCV RNA testing notification; establishing systematic real-time or close to real-time linkage of related datasets, including treatment data; automating the reporting of Point of Care Testing results; implementing a HCV clearance cascade; and adopting a centralised state-wide public health model. Addressing these barriers will be essential to achieving optimal HCV surveillance and care in Queensland.",

        "abstract": "Accurate population size estimates (PSE) of key populations-those disproportionately affected by HIV-are critical to forecast need and inform HIV prevention and treatment programs, though they can be difficult to ascertain due to low visibility of these groups. In Zambia, reliable estimates on the number of people who inject drugs are limited, inhibiting public health response. We sought to estimate the population size of people who inject drugs in 3 large cities in Zambia, assess how PSEs vary across different estimation methods, and explore the strengths and limitations of each approach. We applied 2-source capture-recapture (2S-CRC), 3-source capture-recapture (3S-CRC), and successive sampling population size estimation (SS-PSE) methods in Lusaka, Livingstone, and Ndola, Zambia. 3S-CRC methods included location-based 2S-CRC in combination with a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey. Data were collected from November 2021 to February 2022 and analyzed using a Bayesian nonparametric latent class model. SS-PSEs were produced using the RDS recruitment and network sizes. Kruskal tests and general linear models were used to examine sociodemographic and behavioral factors associated with being captured in 2S-CRC among RDS participants. Final city population estimates, incorporating 3S-CRC and SS-PSE with imputed visibility estimates, were generated using a Bayesian consensus estimator. Bayesian consensus PSEs ranged between 0.5% and 1.8% of the adult male population and were below 1% of the total adult population in each city. Consensus estimates were highest in Lusaka (3700, 95% credible interval [CRI] 1500-7500), followed by Ndola (2200, 95% CRI 1600-2900) and Livingstone (1200, 95% CRI 900-1,900). There was variability in estimates by method, with SS-PSE with imputed visibility generally providing the lowest estimates across cities, excluding Lusaka. Across methods, PSEs and uncertainty bounds (95% confidence interval [CI] or CRI depending on method) ranged from 1510 (95% CRI 1030-2070) to 4350 (95% CI 1410-18,890) in Lusaka, 360 (95% CI 290-530) to 2620 (95% CRI 1510-4680) in Livingstone, and 760 (95% CI 390-3060) to 4030 (95% CRI 960-5480) in Ndola. In all cities, fewer recaptures occurred in capture 3 (RDS) than with location sampling via 2S-CRC. Though results varied across cities, RDS participants captured through 2S-CRC differed from those captured solely through RDS in sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors, including housing, education, injection or needle sharing frequency, time since last injection, receipt of drug treatment, and experience with a peer educator in at least one city. This study used rigorous methods to produce PSEs in Zambia, and is the first to produce these for major geographies in the country. Through RDS, 3S-CRC reached people who inject drugs with distinct characteristics that were less accessible via location-based sampling (2S-CRC), yielding a PSE that may better reflect the population and informing the Bayesian consensus estimate. Findings from this study can guide program planning and future surveillance activities.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood development focuses on physical well-being, the development of motor skills and social interaction patterns, and the attainment of specific cognitive and communication skills. Developmental delay occurs when children are slow to achieve expected age-related norms for specific skills and may suggest underlying disease states. Developmental disabilities tend to be chronic conditions that affect social, physical, or cognitive development; these are reported in about 9% of children. Early intervention improves developmental outcomes with the potential for immediate and lasting effects. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends developmental surveillance at every well-child visit, using a validated developmental screening tool during the 9-, 18-, 24-, and 30-month well-child visits. The US Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal developmental screening for autism spectrum disorder or speech and language disorders at these ages. Family physicians should use their best judgment when deciding whether to implement universal developmental screening. Numerous screening tools are available with comparable sensitivity and specificity profiles at varying costs. For any child with developmental concerns, referral for diagnostic evaluation is warranted with access supported by federal law. Children younger than 3 years should be referred to early intervention services. Children 3 years and older are typically referred to school-based programs, although they may not be available to children in private schools without access to these resources. Chromosomal microarray testing or exome sequencing is recommended for children who have developmental disabilities without an explainable cause.

        "abstract": "Background When abdominal CT scans are performed for reasons other than problems with the urinary tract, renal cysts are frequently seen. The objective of this study was to determine how common renal cysts are during CT imaging for other medical reasons in adult patients. Methods This study was conducted as a prospective cross-sectional study with 120 adults who were having abdominal CT scans for conditions such as those of the intestines, liver, or blood vessels. People with a history of kidney disease were not included in the study. All cysts were measured based on their number, size, diameter, and classification using Bosniak standards. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v26.0 and OpenEpi v3.0.0 were used for performing statistical analyses via chi-square and t-tests with p-value < 0.05. Results Incidental renal cysts were present in 37 (30.8%) of the 120 (100%) patients. About three-quarters (28; 77.2%) of the cysts were simple (Bosniak I), with an average size of 22.4 ± 9.1 mm, and most (31; 82.6%) appeared on only one side. There were 6 (16.3%) minimally complex cysts (Bosniak II) that were a little larger than others, with an average size of 29.5 ± 10.4 mm. The most complex cysts (Bosniak IIF/III) represented 2 (6.5%) of the cases and had the largest average size of 33.2 ± 12.7 mm. In addition, patients with cysts were older on average, at 64.8 ± 11.2 years, compared to those without cysts, whose presence of renal cysts was strongly connected to being male (24; 65.2%) vs. 38 (45.7%), having hypertension (23; 63.0%) vs. 31 (37.5%) and having a history of smoking (17; 44.6%) vs. 26 (31.3%). All patients with Bosniak IIF/III cysts were told to have follow-up imaging, but those with Bosniak I cysts didn't need any follow-up. Conclusion Most of these cysts found in the kidney are benign and often occur in the elderly. When we apply the Bosniak classification, we reduce unnecessary checks and tests for the patient. Clinicians ought to weigh each case by risk to avoid carrying out numerous tests on normal cysts.",

Results of the study found that in the overall cohort of 43,335 individuals, 14,140 (33%) were identified as susceptible to hepatitis B, and 5,255 (37%) were subsequently vaccinated. Between 26% and 33% of individuals from priority populations were identified as susceptible to hepatitis B infection, and the proportion of these subsequently vaccinated within six months was between 28% and 42% across the groups. These findings suggest further efforts are needed to increase the identification and subsequent vaccination of susceptible individuals among priority populations recommended for hepatitis B vaccination, including among people who are already engaged in hepatitis B care.",

        "abstract": "<i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> B is one of the main causative pathogens of meningitis and other forms of severe meningococcal disease. In the past decade, meningococcal B vaccines have been developed to address this infection and its sequelae. This article aims to present an example of how the EU regulatory framework allowed the early authorisation of two life-saving vaccines initially based on immunogenicity surrogates of clinical evidence. This was subsequently followed by post-marketing surveillance providing real-world evidence to support their safety profile and impact on the paediatric population in the EU. We review the evidence supporting the initial regulatory approval of the vaccines, the confirmatory data demonstrating vaccine effectiveness post-authorisation, and the real-world impact of these vaccines on the paediatric population. Two vaccines were approved in the EU for active immunisation to prevent IMD caused by MenB (4CMenB in 2013 and MenB-fHBP in 2017). Both marketing authorisations were based on immunogenicity data (efficacy studies were not feasible due to the rarity of the disease) and safety data generated from pre-authorisation studies. Additional pharmacovigilance activities to further investigate the safety profile and effectiveness studies were requested to be conducted after approval. Both the effectiveness and safety profile of the vaccines were confirmed by these data. This paper illustrates that the EU medicines regulatory framework and safety monitoring system are robust. By supplementing the initial evidence with post-authorisation studies, further effectiveness and safety data enabled regulators to confirm the positive benefit-risk of the vaccines without delaying their access to the people who need them.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a notifiable disease in Poland, with the highest incidence in the northeastern region. Although vaccination is highly effective, breakthrough infections occasionally occur. This study aimed to describe the clinical features of vaccinated and unvaccinated TBE cases, assess long-term hospitalization trends, and estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a highly endemic region. <b>Methods</b>: We retrospectively analyzed 1518 laboratory-confirmed TBE cases hospitalized at the University Clinical Hospital in Białystok, Poland, from 1988 to 2020. Clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using the screening method, based on aggregated regional vaccine uptake data from 1999 to 2020. <b>Results</b>: Among all cases, 13 (0.9%) occurred in individuals who had received at least one dose of vaccine, including 4 who had completed the full primary vaccination schedule. Hospitalized vaccinated patients showed similar demographic and clinical characteristics compared to unvaccinated patients, though CSF findings suggested an earlier and more dynamic immune response. Seasonal analysis revealed a sustained increase in TBE hospitalizations and a possible extension of the transmission season into late summer and autumn. Estimated VE was 94.4% (95% CI 85.2-97.9%), though this should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of vaccinated cases and assumptions regarding population-level coverage. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study provides detailed clinical data on breakthrough TBE cases and long-term epidemiological insights from an endemic region in Poland. While vaccine effectiveness appears high, low uptake remains a public health concern. These findings underscore the need for improved vaccination coverage and ongoing surveillance to monitor evolving transmission patterns.",

        "abstract": "Young children are particularly vulnerable to measles infections. Investigating the gap between the waning of maternal antibodies and onset of vaccination-induced immunity via seroprevalence studies can be hampered by recruiting enough young-aged participants. We present measles IgG-antibody results from 2148 patients aged 0 to 2 years, who were hospitalized with acute aseptic meningitis or encephalitis in Lower Saxony or Bremen. Measles serology was performed for differential diagnostics clarification of neurotropic pathogens, during syndromic surveillance between 2006 and 2024. At birth, 79% of children presented with measles IgG-antibodies, but only 30% of three-month-old patients and 11% of five-month-olds. From 0 to 10 months, seropositivity declined monthly by 8%. Over 95% of children aged six to 11 months were unprotected. From 11 months onwards, measles seroprevalence increased, reaching 80-90% towards the end of the second year of life. Our results indicate an absence of maternal measles IgG antibodies after nine months of age and that vaccination starts around 11 months of age; however, not all children had received vaccination by their second birthday. These findings confirm the current recommendation to advance first measles vaccination to nine months in high-exposure settings and support efforts to increase vaccination rates in small children and young adults.",

        "abstract": "Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) are widespread and have a long co-evolutionary history with their hosts, namely sheep and goats. These viruses induce insidious pathologies, causing significant financial losses and animal welfare issues for the affected flocks. In Switzerland, in the 1980s, an eradication campaign was launched targeting these viruses, exclusively in goats, eliminating the virulent SRLV-B strains from the goat population, in which SRLV-B-induced arthritis was prevalent. Nevertheless, although they do not seem to induce clinical diseases, SRLV-A strains continue to circulate in Swiss goats. For this study, we contacted farmers who had animals testing positive for these strains during the census from 2011 to 2012 and visited six of these flocks, conducting serological, virological, and clinical analyses of the animals. We confirmed the absence of SRLV-B; however, we have detected SRLV-A in these flocks. Positive and negative animals lived in close contact for ten years and, except for a small flock of 13 animals, 7 of which tested positive, the transmission of these viruses proved inefficient. None of the positive animals showed any pathology attributable to SRLV infection. These encouraging results allowed us to formulate recommendations for the continued surveillance of these viruses in the Swiss goat population.",

Vaginal/rectal GBS colonization during pregnancy is the main risk factor for the development of early-onset infections (GBS-EOD) in newborn by vertical transmission at birth, in addition to prematurity and stillbirth. In Italy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent GBS-EOD is offered to pregnant women who tested as GBS-positive in late pregnancy. Passive surveillance in Italy showed that a non-negligible number of GBS-EOD cases (about 50%) occurred from GBS-negative pregnant women. This finding prompted the launch of a national online survey from 15 December 2022 to 12 February 2023 to investigate the microbiological procedures followed for GBS identification in Italian public and private microbiology laboratories, the prevalence of maternal GBS colonization, and the incidence of GBS-EOD cases.

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant public health concern in Pakistan due to its subtropical climate and diverse array of vectors, which contribute to periodic outbreaks and challenges in disease control. Recent outbreaks-particularly in 2022-along with the rising incidence of Plasmodium falciparum and growing resistance of Anopheles mosquito vector to existing control methods, highlight a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of current malaria vector control strategies. This article is a scoping review of published literature on malaria prevention methods with a focus on World Health Organization (WHO) outlined interventions in the endemic region of the lower middle-income country, Pakistan. Relevant articles published in all languages before September 2023 were reviewed. All the articles were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase and Google Scholar. Four independent reviewers performed the selection and characterization of articles based on defined inclusion criteria. The data collected were extracted and analyzed by province, vector, and vector control methods according to WHO recommendations. A total of 46 articles reporting surveillance findings on vector control methods in Pakistan were found. Based on WHO recommendations, the reported strategies included insecticide-treated nets (ITN) (29.79%), indoor residual spraying (IRS) (29.79%), spatial spraying (12.77%), spatial/airborne repellents (4.26%), larval source management (4.26%) and house modifications (4.26%). In contrast to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which employs ITN (55%) as the primary vector control method, Punjab was found to use IRS as the main method of vector control (50%). This review highlights the current strategies for controlling malaria vectors and the strategies used in the past for outbreaks in Pakistan. This review identifies a notable increase in the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) over time and highlights differences in the implementation of vector control strategies across provinces in Pakistan. Current practices and their contrast to WHO guidelines are illustrated. It helps us understand the need for improved research and development with precise reporting. These findings can serve as a reference for guiding policy decisions and improving malaria control efforts in endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare disorder affecting copper metabolism that is characterized by multiple organ system damage, including the liver, brain, and eyes. Patients with WD are at risk for decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Only a few studies have investigated the relationship between WD and BMD, and there are discrepancies in the data. Therefore, we investigated the BMD status of patients with WD and analyzed the risk factors affecting the bone mass change. This retrospective cohort study selected 426 patients with WD who were admitted to a neurological hospital in Hefei, China, from January 2018 to August 2024 as study subjects. The enrolled patients were divided into the osteoporosis group (13 patients), osteopenia group (99 patients), and normal bone mass group (314 patients). The rates of prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia were calculated, and the risk factors of osteoporosis and osteopenia were analyzed by multivariate ordered logistic regression. The prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in patients with WD was 3.1% and 23.2%, respectively. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, male sex, and the presence of skeletal symptoms during the course of the disease were independent risk factors for osteoporosis and osteopenia in patients with WD, with odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) values of 1.103 (1.074-1.134), 2.292 (1.216-4.320), and 2.675 (1.395-5.131), respectively. Patients with WD with older age, male sex, and skeletal symptoms during the course of the disease are prone to osteoporosis and osteopenia changes. BMD monitoring and early intervention of such patients should be strengthened clinically.",

By the end of 2024, Shanghai Municipality, Zhejiang Province, Fujian Province, Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region continued to consolidate schistosomiasis elimination achievements, and 7 provinces of Jiangsu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi maintained the criteria of schistosomiasis transmission interruption. A total of 450 counties (cites, districts) were found to be endemic for schistosomiasis in China in 2024, including 26 061 endemic villages covering 73 630 500 residents at risk of infections. Among the 450 counties (cities, districts) endemic for schistosomiasis, 388 (86.22%) achieved the criteria of schistosomiasis elimination and 62 (13.78%) achieved the criteria of transmission interruption. In 2024, a total of 4 102 624 individuals received immunological tests for schistosomiasis in China, with 44 823 sero-positives identified (1.09% seroprevalence), and a total of 169 722 individuals received parasitological examinations, with 1 egg-positives detected. A total of 27 321 cases with advanced schistosomiasis were documented in China by the end of 2024. In 2024, a total of 575 686 bovines were raised in schistosomiasis-endemic villages of China, and 113 842 bovines received immunological tests, with 235 sero-positives detected (0.21% seroprevalence), while no egg-positives were identified among the 167 475 bovines receiving parasitological examinations. In 2024, snail survey was performed covering an area of 680 498.27 hm<sup>2</sup> in China, and 190 778.66 hm<sup>2</sup> snail habitats were identified, including 59.09 hm<sup>2</sup> emerging snail habitats and 704.23 hm<sup>2</sup> reemerging snail habitats. In 2024, a total of 19 665 schistosomiasis patients receiving chemotherapy with praziquantel in China, and expanded chemotherapy was given to humans at 571 722 person-times and to bovines at 306 740 herd-times. In addition, snail control with chemical treatment covered 117 111.37 hm<sup>2</sup> snail habitats across China in 2024, and the actual area of chemical treatment was 66 562.95 hm<sup>2</sup>, while environmental improvements were performed in snail habitats covering an area of 1 374.26 hm<sup>2</sup>. The national schistosomiasis surveillance results showed that the mean prevalence rates of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i> infections were both 0 among humans and bovines in China in 2024, and no <i>S. japonicum</i> infection was detected in snails. These data demonstrated that the prevalence of schistosomiasis remained at a low level in China in 2024; however, the areas of snail habitats remained high and the number of fenced cattle showed a slight increase. To address these risks, it is imperative to maintain the integrated strategy with an emphasis on management of the source of <i>S. japonicum</i> infection and intensified snail control in high-risk areas, and to reinforce schistosomiasis surveillance and forecast and snail control in high-risk areas.",

Retrospective cross-sectional study. Canada. De-identified EMR data was used from 1574 primary care providers participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) from 1,692,987 patients who had 1 or more visits with a primary care provider. The reference set included 2488 patients, with 434 positive and 2054 negative for 1 or more mental health conditions of interest. A second reference set for schizophrenia represented 760 patients (30 positive and 730 negative). The agreement of 29 case definitions was assessed against a reference set by reporting sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. Prevalence was estimated and co-occurrence was assessed in the CPCSSN dataset (N=1,692,987). The strongest definition for mood disorders captured anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder with a sensitivity of 80.7%, specificity of 88.7%, PPV of 59.9%, and NPV of 95.7%; and an estimated prevalence of 21.8% (95% CI 21.7 to 21.9). The inclusion of psychosis did not improve agreement (sensitivity 95.2%, specificity 80.7%, PPV 51.0%, NPV 98.8%), but schizophrenia alone had high agreement (sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 99.9%). High co-occurrence of anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder was found. Algorithms validated to capture these conditions together produced stronger agreement compared with individual definitions. Schizophrenia was less likely to co-occur with other mental health conditions and produced higher agreement when validated separately. Application of validated algorithms to capture mental health conditions can inform disease surveillance and health system planning.",

This occurred 142 days after the infant received a single dose of nirsevimab as part of the regional immunisation campaign, administered on day three of life. The patient had no underlying conditions. PCR testing revealed RSV A and human rhinovirus co-infection. The infant improved with supportive care and was discharged in stable condition after 8 days. This case raises concerns about possible waning immunity near the end of the expected 150-day protection window of nirsevimab, particularly in infants immunised early in the RSV season. Additionally, co-infection with hRV may have contributed to disease severity. Although nirsevimab remains a highly effective preventive tool, this case highlights the potential for waning immunity near the end of the protection window and suggests that ongoing surveillance is essential to optimize immunization strategies, particularly in regions with prolonged RSV seasons.",

Limited data are available on the prevalence of UTI in children from Romania, with most being available for hospitalized children. For this reason, we conducted a retrospective observational study in consecutive non-hospitalized children to assess the number of positive UTI samples and the antibacterial resistance of causative pathogens. This study included 7222 consecutive urine cultures collected from children aged 1 to 18 years who are residents of Arad County, Western Romania. Urine samples were analyzed for leukocyturia and cultures for the presence of monomorphic bacteria. The overall number of positive UTI samples was 10.44%. A higher number of positive UTI samples was observed in females when compared to males and in children aged 6-12 and 12 to 18 years when compared to those aged 1-5 years. The antibiotic susceptibility testing of <i>E. coli</i> isolates revealed high sensitivity to most tested antibacterials. Near-complete susceptibility was observed for fosfomycin (99.71%) and nitrofurantoin (96.01%), while high susceptibility rates were also observed for ciprofloxacin (85.43%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (75.05%). In contrast, high resistance was found for ampicillin (62.28% resistant) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36.53% resistant). Given the clinical risks associated with UTI in children, our findings underscore the urgent need for the continued monitoring of multidrug-resistant strains. Our study provides important epidemiological and resistance data to guide empirical treatment and strengthen pediatric antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Future studies should focus on different regions and regularly update resistance patterns to keep treatment and prevention strategies aligned with local conditions.",

National AMR surveillance programs are pivotal for assessing AMR prevalence, trends, and intervention outcomes; however, integrating advanced surveillance tools can be difficult. This pilot study, conducted by FAO ECTAD Indonesia and DGLAHS, the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, evaluated the costs and benefits of integrating the Nanopore MinION, Illumina MiSeq, and Sensititre system into a culture-based slaughterhouse-river surveillance system. <b>Methods:</b> Water samples were collected from six chicken slaughterhouses and adjacent rivers (pre- and post-treatment effluent, upstream, and downstream). Culture-based ESBL and general <i>E. coli</i> concentrations were estimated via the WHO Tricycle Protocol, while isolates (<i>n</i> = 42) were sequenced (MinION, MiSeq) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing conducted (Sensititre). <b>Results:</b> The Tricycle Protocol results provided estimates of effluent and river concentrations of ESBL and general <i>E. coli</i> identifying ESBL-to-general <i>E. coli</i> ratios of 13.8% and 6.2%, respectively. Compared to hybrid sequencing assemblies, MinION had a higher concordance than MiSeq for ARG identification (98%), virulence genes (96%), and locations for both (predominately plasmids). Furthermore, MinION concordance with Sensititre AST was 91%. <b>Conclusions:</b> Cost-benefit comparisons suggest sequencing can complement culture-based methods but is dependent on the value placed on the additional information gained.",

        "abstract": "Genomic score testing is increasingly being integrated into the management of prostate cancer (PCa) to overcome the limitations of traditional clinical and pathological parameters. Genomic tools will represent essential components of precision medicine, supporting risk stratification, therapeutic decision-making, and personalized screening strategies. Genomic score tests can be broadly classified into two main categories: polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and tumor-derived genomic classifiers (GCs). While not yet standard in routine practice, several international guidelines recommend their selective use when results are likely to impact clinical management. PRSs estimate an individual's susceptibility to PCa based on the cumulative effect of multiple low-penetrance germline genetic variants. These scores show promise in enhancing early detection strategies and identifying men at higher genetic risk who may benefit from tailored screening protocols. Tumor-based GCs assays provide prognostic information that complements conventional clinical and pathological parameters, and are used to guide treatment decisions, including eligibility for active surveillance (AS) or adjuvant therapy after treatment of the primary tumor. This review summarizes and analyzes the current evidence on genomic testing in PCa, with a focus on the available assays, their clinical applications, and their predictive and prognostic value across the disease spectrum. When integrated with clinical and pathological parameters, these tools have the potential to significantly enhance personalized care and should be increasingly considered in routine clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 has been linked to prolonged immune dysfunction and long-term health complications. Herpes zoster (HZ), a marker of impaired cell-mediated immunity, may signal increased vulnerability to infections, cardiovascular disease, and potentially cancer. However, its association with colorectal cancer (CRC) after COVID-19 has not been fully explored. To investigate the long-term risks of cardiovascular events, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and CRC in COVID-19 survivors who developed HZ compared to those who did not. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network. Adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2022 were included. Among the full cohort (aged ≥18 years), 27,664 patients with post-COVID HZ were identified. Due to platform limitations, propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to a restricted subgroup of patients aged 55-60 years, yielding a 1:1 matched cohort for controlled comparisons. Outcomes were assessed over a three-year follow-up. In the matched age-restricted cohort, patients with post-COVID HZ had significantly higher risks of cardiovascular events, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and CRC compared to matched controls. Subgroup analyses identified age ≥ 50, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension as strong independent risk factors across outcomes. Despite the low absolute CRC incidence, cancer-free survival significantly favored the non-HZ group. Herpes zoster reactivation after COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Enhanced surveillance and early CRC screening may benefit this high-risk population.",

We investigated the outbreak to describe its transmission dynamics; quantify attack rates in school, household, and private-academy settings; and assess the impact of coordinated control measures. <b>Methods</b>: A case-series study included 89 teachers and students who had contact with suspected patients. Using case definitions, laboratory tests, questionnaires, and environmental assessments, we evaluated exposures and factors facilitating spread. <b>Results</b>: Varicella developed in 23 of 89 contacts (25.8%); laboratory confirmation was obtained in 2 (8.7% of cases). The mean incubation period was 13 days. Epidemic-curve and network analyses indicated that the outbreak began with a single index case and extended through household contacts and private educational facilities, ultimately involving multiple schools. <b>Conclusions</b>: Breakthrough transmission can occur even when single-dose coverage exceeds 95%, particularly as vaccine-induced immunity may wane over time. Poorly regulated extracurricular facilities, such as private academies, act as bridging hubs that amplify spread across grades and even between schools. For timely detection and control, these venues should be incorporated into routine varicella surveillance, and rapid, coordinated infection-control measures are required across all educational settings.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the PRIMARY score derived from [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT and key clinical and pathological parameters of prostate cancer aggressiveness, including the PSA level, ISUP Grade Group, and D'Amico risk classification, in patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer. A secondary aim was to evaluate the interobserver agreement of the PRIMARY score in routine clinical practice. <b>Methods</b>: This retrospective analysis included 51 patients with histopathologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging for staging. PRIMARY scores were determined based on the intraprostatic uptake pattern, intensity, and zonal localization. These scores were compared with PSA levels, ISUP GG, D'Amico risk classification, and histopathological features such as the cribriform pattern, intraductal carcinoma, perineural invasion, extraprostatic extension, and lymphovascular invasion. The PRIMARY scores were independently assigned by a total of three nuclear medicine physicians, and interobserver agreement was calculated using Fleiss' kappa analysis. <b>Results</b>: Significant associations were found between the PRIMARY scores and the PSA level, ISUP Grade Group, and D'Amico risk classification. The most prevalent score was PRIMARY 5 (54.9%), which was significantly associated with ISUP GG 5 and the high-risk category in D'Amico classification. Among patients with PRIMARY Score 2, a substantial proportion (64.7%) had ISUP GG ≥ 3, and 58.8% were in the high-risk group, highlighting the limitations of binary PRIMARY classification. No statistically significant correlations were found between the PRIMARY scores and specific histopathologic features. Interobserver agreement was excellent (κ = 0.833). <b>Conclusions</b>: The PRIMARY score demonstrates high reproducibility and clinical relevance in stratifying prostate cancer aggressiveness. However, the findings challenge the reliability of binary classifications, particularly for patients with Score 2, who may still harbor high-grade disease. Integrating imaging-based scores with clinical and histopathological data is essential, particularly for accurate staging and decision-making regarding active surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Golimumab (GLM), an anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) agent, is indicated for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). This post-authorisation safety study evaluated the risk of colectomy due to intractable disease and advanced colonic neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia and/or colorectal cancer) under real-world conditions of GLM use. This bidirectional cohort study using Spanish ENEIDA registry data (2013-2022) included adults with UC who initiated GLM, other anti-TNFα agents, or thiopurines (TPs). Crude risk analyses-and, when feasible, multivariable models-in cohort and nested case-control designs were performed. For colectomy, we evaluated exposure to GLM only, other anti-TNFα agents, and both (i.e., overlapping exposure). For ACN, we evaluated exposure to GLM, other anti-TNFα agents, and TPs. Sixty-four colectomy cases and 10 ACN cases were identified among patients exposed to GLM (N = 474), other anti-TNFα agents (N = 1737), or TPs (N = 1380). Incidence rates per 1000 person-years and 95% confidence intervals were reported for colectomy (GLM-only [4.4, 1.2-11.2] and other anti-TNFα agents only [12.4, 9.1-16.5]) and ACN (GLM [1.5, 0.2-5.4], other anti-TNFα agents [1.3, 0.5-2.8], and TPs [1.0, 0.3-2.6]). In comparisons excluding overlapping exposure, GLM was not associated with an increased risk of colectomy versus other anti-TNFα agents. GLM was also not associated with an increased risk of ACN versus either comparator. Observed events, especially for ACN, were limited for all exposures. Findings do not indicate an increased risk of colectomy due to intractable disease or ACN with GLM use versus other therapies for similar disease severity in routine UC care (EUPAS15752).",

This study provides updated insights into the epidemiology, morphology, phylogeny, and haplotype diversity of Biomphalaria and Physa snails in Guangdong Province, southern China. Field surveys were conducted across Guangdong Province from 2016 to 2023. Morphological observations included assessment of snail shape, shell height, and aperture width. Molecular analysis targeted several genes, including Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and 28S rRNA. Evolutionary trees were constructed with neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. Haplotype networks were generated from COI sequences collected from multiple geographic locations. Physa acuta was detected in 92% of surveyed sites, showing broad distribution and notable mitochondrial diversity (15 haplotypes). The dominant haplotype (Hap_3) was shared with sequences from Chile and the Netherlands. In contrast, Biomphalaria straminea was found at 62% of sites and displayed limited genetic variation (2 haplotypes), despite visible morphological dimorphism (red/black forms). Phylogenetic analysis exhibited minimal differences in 16S rRNA and COI gene sequences among turret snail strains, with B. straminea clustering closely to South American lineages. Morphometric analyses revealed significant size differences among strains, for example, Shuanglong B. straminea had a shell width of 8.74 ± 0.26 mm, whereas Zengcheng P. acuta exhibited 11.07 ± 0.90 mm. In contrast, analysis of 28S and 18S rRNA confirmed species boundaries but lacked at the intraspecific level. Our analysis of multiple target genes confirms that mitochondrial markers (COI and 16S rRNA) are effective for studying the evolutionary dynamics of freshwater invasive snails. Physa acuta exhibits a widespread distribution and notable genetic diversity across Guangdong, while B. straminea shows limited genetic variation, suggesting strong genetic conservation within the species.",

        "abstract": "Clonorchis sinensis, the liver fluke responsible for clonorchiosis, presents a persistent public health burden in Guangxi (Southern China) and Vietnam. Its transmission is influenced by a complex interplay of ecological, climatic, and socio-cultural factors. We compiled infection occurrence data from systematic literature reviews and national surveys conducted between 2000 and 2018. Environmental and climatic predictors were obtained from long-term raster datasets. Machine learning models, including logistic regression and tree-based ensemble methods, were used to assess associations between predictor variables and C. sinensis presence. Partial dependence plots were employed to refine predictor selection and explore marginal effects. Raw freshwater fish consumption was identified as the most influential predictor. In Guangxi, 54.9% of counties reported raw fish consumption, compared to 31.7% in Vietnam. Logistic regression achieved the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.941). Climatic comparisons showed that Vietnam had a higher annual mean temperature (Bio1: 23.37 °C vs. 20.86 °C), greater temperature seasonality (Bio4: 609.33 vs. 464.92), and higher annual precipitation (Bio12: 1731.64 mm vs. 1607.56 mm) than Guangxi, contributing to spatial differences in endemicity. High-risk zones were concentrated along the China-Vietnam border, suggesting the need for geographically targeted interventions. The findings underscore the combined influence of ecological and behavioral factors on C. sinensis transmission. The predictive modeling framework offers valuable insights for surveillance planning and cross-border disease control, reinforcing the role of ecological epidemiology in guiding parasitic disease prevention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Upon the pandemic transitioning into a new phase, research into the immune pathophysiology of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 has become increasingly crucial. Such studies are pivotal in shaping advanced treatment strategies and driving the development of innovative therapeutics, including more effective vaccines targeting the virus. High-risk comorbidities and pre-existing immunocompromised states have been identified as significant factors contributing to increased susceptibility to severe coronavirus disease 2019. Moreover, cases of severe infections, particularly those characterized by relapses or viral persistence, provide invaluable insights into the evolving behavior and dynamics of this pathogen. We report three cases involving mixed-race Colombian female patients aged 58, 35, and 63 years who experienced multiple episodes of coronavirus disease 2019 infection, with the most recent episode progressing to critical illness. These cases were characterized by relapses or persistent infections, and genomic analyses consistently identified the Omicron severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 lineage as the causative variant. Notably, individuals with underlying immunosuppressive conditions developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections that were more severe, leading to fatal outcomes that included acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, and death. In contrast, one vaccinated patient with significant comorbidities exhibited persistent critical coronavirus disease 2019 but responded positively to treatment with tocilizumab. The key takeaway is the critical need for continued investigation into coronavirus disease 2019 among individuals with high-risk comorbidities and those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. Recurrent episodes of infection, including cases marked by relapses or persistent viral presence in these populations, create conditions conducive to viral replication and adaptation. Such environments may potentially act as breeding grounds for the emergence of significant new viral mutations.",

        "abstract": "Non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL) is an atypical clinical form of leishmaniasis first described, in 1988, by Ponce and collaborators, in Honduras, Central America, characterized by isolated or disseminated closed skin lesions appearing as papules, nodules, or infiltrated plaques, primarily in adolescents and young adults. Leishmania (L.) chagasi was then identified as the causal agent of both NUCL and American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) in Honduras, though NUCL has been reported as more prevalent. However, due to the uncertain taxonomic classification of the NUCL-causing parasite, especially since L. (L.) chagasi has not been associated to this form of the disease in South America, this study conducted a comprehensive taxonomic review incorporating phenotypic (biological and clinical-immunopathological) and genotypic (genomic/molecular) analyses. Biologically, Honduran parasite-LPG does not have Gal (β1,4) Man (α1)-PO4 side chains common to all Leishmania LPGs. From a clinical-pathogenic perspective, NUCL is unique, it does not ulcerate like cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. (L.) chagasi or L. (L.) infantum. Molecular findings showed that the Honduran parasite is more ancestral than all known viscerotropic Leishmania species, exhibited an unprecedented structural variation on chromosome 17 with the highest frequency of genomic SNPs, formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage, and displayed a homozygous SNP profile typical of a parental (non-hybrid) parasite. Building on these findings, a new species, Leishmania (Leishmania) poncei n. sp. (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae), is proposed in honor of Professor Carlos Ponce, who first described NUCL in Honduras. This study formally classifies L.

This retrospective, single-center study included pediatric patients who underwent haploidentical HSCT at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2013 to 2018. A total of 94 HSCT recipients were included: 46 (48.94%) females and 48 (51.06%) males, with a median age of 5 years [interquartile range (IQR): 1.2-8.7]. As for donors, 57 (60.64%) were males and 37 (39.36%) were females, with a median age of 30.7 years (IQR: 23.0-35.3). CMV reactivation occurred in 52 (55.32%) of the HSCT patients. The overall mortality rate was 12.77% (12/94), and of those, 83.33% (10/12) were CMV positive. However, no patient developed CMV pneumonitis, gastritis, or colitis, and CMV was not identified as the direct cause of death. Regarding CMV risk factors, higher recipient age and the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease were significantly associated with CMV reactivation (P < 0.05). Preventing CMV infection significantly impacts the post-transplant course, especially in the setting of mismatched donors. This study showed that preventing CMV by preemptive therapy revealed an undetectable rate of 78.85%.

We assessed volume trajectories, disease progression, and associated risk factors using Cox-Hazards regression, survival analysis, and time-series forecasting with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). Patients were categorized based on volumetric changes into progression (≥25%), regression (≤-25%), or stability. Of 99 patients (970 scans; median follow-up: 7.0 years; median diagnosis age: 12.0 years), 55 (55.5%) had tumors that volumetrically progressed, 28 (28.3%) remained stable, and 16 (16.2%) regressed. 42 (42.4%) patients initiated treatment. Risk factors associated with progression included infancy/preschool age, cortical location, and female sex (p ≤ 0.05 for each). Most progressions occurred within five years of diagnosis (80.0%), most commonly in school-aged children (7-13 years old). Time-series forecasting predicted future tumor volume with a mean absolute error of 2.04 cm<sup>3</sup>. Deep learning enables systematic, longitudinal, pLGG growth tracking and characterization of patients on surveillance, yielding insights into untreated tumor trajectories and progression risk. This pipeline is useful at population-level to study growth trends and at patient-level to guide personalized management.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in providing strong immunity within a relatively short time frame, significantly reducing both the severity of the disease and associated mortality. However, post-vaccination complications, particularly neurological disorders, have been reported. Among the more frequently documented neurological complications are acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS), transverse myelitis (TM), optic neuritis (ON), Bell's palsy (BP), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The precise role of COVID-19 vaccines in triggering the onset or relapse of these conditions remains uncertain. Immunological processes involving cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, and immune cells are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of these neurological side effects. This review examines the immune responses triggered by COVID-19 vaccines and their potential role in the development of such complications. Despite reports of neurological side effects, these cases remain rare, and the overall benefits of vaccination in curbing the pandemic and preventing severe illness far exceed the risks. It is vital to sustain the progress of global vaccination efforts while continuously evaluating the risk-benefit ratio, particularly for individuals with underlying conditions. Ongoing research and surveillance are crucial for creating safer vaccines and identifying individuals who may be more susceptible to adverse reactions, ensuring broader protection against COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Buruli ulcer (BU), a Neglected Tropical Disease, is common in West Africa and imposes a significant burden on health systems. Examining epidemiologic data is important to guide health systems planning to facilitate BU control activities in endemic countries. We aimed to provide a comprehensive description of the clinical epidemiology of a large cohort of PCR-confirmed cases in districts in the middle belt of Ghana over an 18-year period. We conducted a retrospective analysis of demographic and clinical data on affected individuals. Data was collected using World Health Organisation (WHO) standard case-based forms and managed in Microsoft Excel. Descriptive analysis was performed using SPSS and Stata statistical software. Nine hundred and fifty six individuals with median (IQR) age of 18 (10-35) years were included. Forty percent (385/956) of BU patients were under 15 years old. Clinical lesions included ulcers (61.5%), nodules (15.6%), plaques (14%) and osteomyelitis (1.4%). Regarding lesion severity, 38.6% were category I, 32.3% category II and 22.6% category III. Most lesions (51.7%) were located on the lower limbs. There was notable variability in the number of recorded cases across the years, with 2014 witnessing the highest and 2010 the lowest. The Ahafo Ano North district reported the highest number of cases. Despite a general decline in case numbers, Ghana continues to be an endemic area for BU. Our findings support the need for policies emphasizing active surveillance for early case detection using integrated approaches. Further investigation into the changing epidemiology of BU is warranted.",

        "abstract": "The role of adjuvant chemotherapy (Adjuvant CT) in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear; this study aimed to fill this gap by examining the association between Adjuvant CT and survival outcomes in patients with early-stage OSCC who underwent surgery. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine patients diagnosed with early-stage OSCC who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2021. Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for evaluating the survival outcomes of individuals who received Adjuvant CT compared to those who did not. To assess the relationship between Adjuvant CT and survival outcomes, statistical methods, including Cox regression analysis, propensity score matching (PSM), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized. A total of 18,532 patients were included, with 2,098 (11.3%) receiving Adjuvant CT. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age, sex, tumor site, income level, pathological grade, pT status, neck dissection and radiation were associated with prognosis (P < 0.05). Notably, Adjuvant CT was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) compared to no chemotherapy (5-year OS: 63.1% vs. 72.9%; 10-year OS: 47.6% vs. 57.8%, P < 0.0001; 5-year DSS: 71.3% vs. 85.3%; 10-year DSS: 61.6% vs. 81.7%, P < 0.0001). Consistently, after PSM, Adjuvant CT did not improve outcomes in patients with early-stage OSCC (DSS: P = 0.0001; OS:P = 0.00066). Cox regression analysis indicated no overall survival benefit from Adjuvant CT in early-stage OSCC. However, subgroup analysis suggested potential benefits for patients with poorly differentiated tumors. Our study revealed that postoperative Adjuvant CT provides minimal survival benefits for early-stage OSCC patients, though subgroup signals observed. Although the result of the subgroup analysis show that Adjuvant CT may benefit those with poorly differentiated tumors, further research is needed to identify specific subgroups that may benefit.",

        "abstract": "The COVID 19 pandemic led to significant disruptions in health services, including immunisation programs, which contributed to a major post-pandemic diphtheria outbreak in Kano State, Nigeria. This region accounted for 85% of the nation's documented diphtheria cases. This study examined the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and mortality outcomes of cases diagnosed between February 2022 and April 2024. Data were collected through the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS), and case definitions followed WHO guidelines. Case fatality rate (CFR) was calculated, and a logistic regression model was used to assess mortality-related risk factors, reporting adjusted odds ratios (AOR). A total of 18,320 cases were analysed, with the outbreak showing a bimodal distribution. The primary peak occurred in August 2023, followed by a smaller secondary peak in early 2024. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 4.5%. Patients who were not vaccinated had more than double the likelihood of death compared to fully vaccinated individuals (AOR 2.45; 95% CI: 2.05, 2.94, p < 0.0001; logistic regression). Similarly, patients without vaccination documentation also had greater odds, with more than 87% increase likelihood of mortality compared to fully vaccinated individuals (AOR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.68, p < 0.0001; logistic regression). Our study reinforces previous reports of the weakening preventive health delivery systems in resource constrained settings, particularly after the disruptions caused by the COVID 19 pandemic leading to the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases, such as diphtheria. These highlight the need for improved vaccination coverage and surveillance systems. This research did not receive any external funding.",

        "abstract": "Patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are at high risk of developing post-treatment recurrences (50-78%) during follow-up. As more effective treatments are now available, especially for patients with oligometastatic disease, earlier detection of recurrences may prolong survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). With the use of 2'-deoxy-2'-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroglucose positron emission tomography/CT ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT) during follow-up, recurrences may be detected earlier. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to compare the 3-year overall survival of patients with stage III NSCLC during follow-up surveillance with [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT versus follow-up with conventional CT (usual care). Secondary objectives address the number, location and timing of recurrences, as well as HRQOL, cost-effectiveness and patient experiences of PET/CT scans. In this multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial, 690 patients with stage III NSCLC (8th edition International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) classification) who completed curative intended treatment and started follow-up care (which may include adjuvant therapy) will be randomised 1:1 to either the intervention ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG PET/CT) or the control group (CT).

        "abstract": "Human parainfluenza viruses (hPIVs) are common viral causes of acute respiratory infections, resulting in substantial global disease burden. Seasonal patterns of hPIV epidemics can vary by geographical region and viral type, although these patterns are not well understood at a global level. We aimed to characterise regional and type-specific variations in hPIV seasonality and assess the potential role of climatic factors in explaining these variations. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we collected monthly aggregated seasonal activity data for hPIV and its four types (hPIV-1, hPIV-2, hPIV-3, and hPIV-4) from various sources, including a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Ovid Global Health, for literature published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2024; unpublished data contributed by an established collaborative network; and public viral surveillance datasets from online platforms. We included studies that continuously tested hPIVs throughout their study period and reported seasonal activity in defined geographical locations on a monthly basis (or if monthly data could be derived from reports). We excluded published studies if they had fewer than 20 cases, focused on specific medical conditions, or contained duplicate data from published literature or publicly available datasets. A prespecified collection template was used to collect data from members in the collaborative network. We extracted site-specific monthly case counts of combined hPIVs and each viral type and used the annual average percentage approach to assess relative circulating strength, epidemic onset and peak month, and epidemic duration by virus type and latitude. We identified type-specific transmission zones of countries with similar circulating patterns with the k-means method. A local regression model (selected by leave-one-out cross-validation) was used to explore climatic factors associated with variations in hPIV monthly circulating activity. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023370261. We included 115 records in total: 103 studies identified from the published literature, five studies contributed by collaborators, and data from seven public surveillance datasets. We included 306 719 cases from 141 sites in 64 countries. We found that hPIV-3 exhibited distinctive seasonal patterns compared with the other three hPIV types. In temperate regions, hPIV-3 seasons typically occurred in spring, summer, and winter, with a median onset in April (IQR April-May) in the northern temperate region and July (July-July) in the southern temperate region. hPIV-1, hPIV-2, and hPIV-4 seasons typically occurred in autumn, winter, and summer, with median onsets between August and October in the northern temperate region and between April and May in the southern temperate region. Both epidemic onset and peak timing for hPIV-1, hPIV-2, and hPIV-4 were less consistent in tropical and subtropical regions than in temperate regions, whereas the seasonality of hPIV-3 remained generally consistent across regions. Northern temperate and subtropical countries typically clustered in shared transmission zones for hPIV-1, hPIV-2, and hPIV-3 with a few exceptions, as did countries in the southern hemisphere. Nevertheless, hPIV-1 and hPIV-4 peak timings were delayed as latitude increased in the northern hemisphere (Pearson's r=0·62 [p=0·0012] for hPIV-1 and r=0·53 [p=0·049] for hPIV-4). Type-specific climate models yielded better fits (with greater area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values) than models for combined hPIVs. In temperate regions, higher hPIV-1, hPIV-2, and hPIV-4 activity correlated with declining temperature and increasing relative humidity (all p values <0·0001), whereas higher hPIV-3 activity was correlated with rising temperature (r<sub>s</sub>=0·61; p<0·0001). In subtropical and tropical regions, the climate models showed suboptimal performance. Exploratory analyses showed differential timing shifts in hPIV epidemics across six included countries following the lifting of COVID-19 non-pharmacological interventions. Our results characterise both between-type and regional variations in hPIV seasonality and the differential effects of monthly temperature variability and relative humidity on the global seasonality of different hPIV types. These findings have important implications for development of global hPIV surveillance and epidemic prediction in diverse locations. Substantial gaps in hPIV type-specific seasonality data remain in many countries, highlighting the need to expand surveillance to improve characterisation and prediction of hPIV epidemics.

To improve the utilization of both tertiary and community hospitals in China, we prospectively designed a clinic pathway of ambulatory colectomy for selected colon cancer patients and evaluated its safety and feasibility. This was a prospective single-arm phase II study. A total of 144 selected patients with stage I-III colon cancer were included. All patients received laparoscopic radical colectomy and were discharged within 24 h and transferred to a community hospital. A propensity score-adjusted method was implemented to compare outcomes against historical controls of laparoscopic colectomy. Postoperative complications were the main outcomes of the study. After propensity score matching, 121 patients were available for comparison in the ambulatory colectomy and ERAS colectomy group. After a median follow-up of 26 months, 25 (20.6 %) patients in the ambulatory group and 28 (23.1 %) patients in the ERAS group underwent Postoperative complications within 90 days. There was no significant difference in minor or major postoperative complications among the two groups. The 2-year disease-free survival rate was 86.1 % and 89.8 % in the ambulatory group and ERAS group (P = 0.76). The mean perioperative cost of patients who underwent ambulatory surgery was significantly less than the cost of inpatients (32878.9 VS 43904.3 yuan, p < 0.01), and reduced by approximately 25 %.

However, in the Indian context, most University employees are not regularly screened for CVD risk factors. Against this background, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hypertension and CVD risk factors among Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University employees in India. This cross-sectional study included the university's teaching, administrative, and support staff (n=126). Data on physiological, anthropometric, worksite, and sociodemographic variables were collected using the WHO Stepwise approach to noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factor surveillance (STEPS) questionnaire. The chi-square/Fisher's exact test was used to test the association of employees' sociodemographics, work-related addictions, diet intake, exercise, and health-related characteristics with CVD risk.

Further we have not mapped the multi-generational health, social and economic impact of severe IPV on women subjected to it, and their children, nor the consequences of help-seeking, nor described what helps, STET recovery trajectories. This study aims to deepen understanding of risk factors for femicide and the health, social and economic impacts of severe IPV on women and their families, including understanding risk and resilience to intergenerational cycling of violence. It further aims to describe how statutory and community measures operate to enable recovery and safety. Following pilot research, we developed a prospective questionnaire-based cohort study with three components, and plan for nested qualitative research. The primary cohort will enrol 12,000 women experiencing severe IPV, recruited using non-probabilistic methods (mostly referral from services and community members, and chain-recruitment). Following a baseline interview, participants will complete annual on-line surveys to track key outcomes for five years. The main questionnaire will measure exposure to range of different forms of IPV in the past year, lifetime trauma exposure history, childhood background, health, social and economic circumstances and help-seeking practices. A sub-cohort of the women (a 20% sub-sample), will be followed more intensively over 3 years. Among these, the children aged 6 years and over, of consenting mothers, will also be followed for three years. Deaths in the cohorts will be tracked through the National Population Register through participants' national identity numbers.

We conducted a case-control study to assess risk factors for acute SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring hospitalization in vaccinated individuals. The study included 50 vaccinated patients who experienced breakthrough infections requiring hospitalization (inpatient cohort) and 250 control participants from the outpatient cohort of the \"Genomic Surveillance and Immune Response Monitoring for COVID-19 in the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley, Medellín-Colombia\". Demographic characteristics, vaccination status, and immune responses were compared between cases and controls using multivariate logistic regression. Advanced age (≥ 65 years), male sex, high-risk comorbidities, and immunosuppression were associated with an increased risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections despite prior vaccination. In contrast, receipt of a booster dose and the presence of neutralizing antibodies were linked to a reduced risk of such infections. This study identifies key risk and protective factors associated with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections. Derived from a high-middle-income setting, these real-world findings provide valuable insights to guide targeted vaccination strategies for vulnerable populations.",

We used 2011-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data to examine 6,638 adults aged ≥20 years who did not report a current pregnancy and had non-missing data for all modeled variables and valid accelerometer data. For each cardiometabolic health factor, we created two generalized linear models adjusting for: 1) age only and 2) covariates (sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, history of cardiovascular disease), to identify associations with standardized increments of MIMS units. When adjusting for age only, 1,000 higher average daily MIMS units was associated with 0.91% (95% CI: 0.72%, 1.10%) lower BMI, 0.26% (0.13%, 0.38%) lower A1c, and 0.27% (0.03%, 0.52%) lower non-HDL-C and was non-significantly associated with SBP and DBP; additional adjusting for covariates had little influence. Results confirmed that associations between MIMS units and cardiometabolic health factors are similar to patterns observed between traditional accelerometer-derived measures and cardiometabolic health factors, which could support the use of MIMS units as an indicator of health-related movement, further increasing their usefulness in public health surveillance and research. Using MIMS units in cardiovascular health research could deepen understanding of the broad benefits of physical activity on cardiovascular health through device-based measurement of total activity.",

        "abstract": "Alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, poses a substantial global health challenge due to its high mortality profile. This study reports the inaugural human infection of echinococcosis caused by the Mongolian genotype of E. multilocularis in China, also the first reported indigenous AE case in Inner Mongolia. A 58-year-old female pastoralist from Inner Mongolia, who had no endemic region exposure history but prolonged occupational contact with dogs, presented with severe AE. Clinical examinations revealed a massive hepatic lesion exceeding 10 cm in diameter, accompanied by elevated eosinophils (0.90 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and basophils (0.08 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Despite undergoing liver transplantation, the patient succumbed postoperatively. Histopathological confirmation and molecular phylogenetics identified the Mongolian genotype of E. multilocularis infection, distinct from the predominant Asian genotype in China. Potential evidence of zoonotic transmission was discovered through genotype-matched E. multilocularis detection in corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) feces from the grasslands along the shores of Hulun Lake (Hulun Buir City, northeastern Inner Mongolia, China). This report provides the primary evidence of a locally acquired human AE infection in China caused by the Mongolian genotype of Echinococcus multilocularis. The discovery of this case challenges historical classifications of echinococcosis endemic areas. The findings call for revised AE-endemic identification criteria, improved AE diagnostic protocols, and enhanced AE surveillance in the Inner Mongolia region to generate further epidemiological evidence and information on disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Data in Ethiopia on the epidemiology of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and subtypes among influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) cases is limited. Here, we assessed the epidemiology of RSV and its subtypes among the pediatric and adult ILI /SARI cases in Ethiopia. We conducted prospective, multicenter facility-based study from May 2023 to April 2024. Respiratory swab specimens, epidemiological and clinical data were collected from participants of all age groups, and both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals who met the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for ILI/SARI and provided informed consent. Laboratory investigation was performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were analyzed using SPSS V29. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize frequencies and ratios, and multivariable logistic regression model was employed to assess factors associated with RSV positivity. In total, 4170 participants were enrolled, the majority (57.9%) of whom were cases from children under five and SARI (76.5%). RSV was detected in 654 cases (15.7%; 95% CI: 14.6-16.8). RSV subtyping was carried out for 475 (72.6%) of 654 RSV positive samples. The finding revealed that both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes were co-circulating in Ethiopia, with predominance of RSV-B (68.8%). Age group, season and timing of sample collection were factors independently associated with RSV positivity. Accordingly, children aged < 2 years (AOR: 8.20, 95% CI: 3.57-18.81) and 2-4 years (AOR: 5.01, 95% CI: 2.15-11.67), autumn (AOR: 5.89, 95% CI: 3.79-9.17) and winter (AOR: 3.27, 95% CI: 2.07-5.16) seasons, and case whose samples were collected within three days of symptom onset (AOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.09-2.84) were significantly associated with RSV positivity. The study provides evidence of RSV circulation among ILI/SARI cases in Ethiopia. It also revealed that RSV-B was the predominant subtype circulating in the country. The age-specific and temporal patterns of RSV positivity identified in this study contribute to the understanding of RSV and its subtypes epidemiology in Ethiopia. The findings provide valuable evidence to inform implementation of RSV vaccine introduction programs, particularly targeting high-risk populations during periods of peak transmission. Future research focusing on RSV genomic analysis and disease burden is needed to better understand RSV viral evolution, transmission dynamics and public health impacts in Ethiopia.",

Nirsevimab is recommended for all infants younger than 8 months and children aged 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV entering their second RSV season. Additional data are necessary to identify children aged 8 to 19 months at increased risk for severe disease. The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a population-based surveillance system, captures laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations in 12 states. We compared demographics and clinical characteristics of children aged 0 to 23 months by age category, and of children aged 12 to 23 months by severity (not admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU], admitted to the ICU, or with prolonged [≥3 days] ICU admission) during the 2022-2023 season using χ2 tests and logistic regression. Among 3659 randomly sampled hospitalized children in 2022-2023, 31.2%, 40.0%, and 28.9% were aged 0 to 2, 3 to 11, and 12 to 23 months, respectively. Compared with children aged 0 to 2 months, children 3 to 11 and 12 to 23 months were more likely to have at least 1 underlying medical condition (UMC) (3.4%, 12.6%, 23.4%, respectively; P < .05). Children aged 12 to 23 months with prolonged ICU admission were more likely to have airway abnormalities, cardiovascular disease (CVD), Down syndrome (with or without concomitant CVD), and feeding tube dependence than those without ICU admission (P < .05 for all). UMCs were more frequently identified among hospitalized children aged 12 to 23 months compared with children 0 to 2 months; prolonged ICU admission was associated with airway abnormalities, CVD, Down syndrome, and feeding tube dependence.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer, the most common type of diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, is often associated with the development of lymphedema as a treatment-related effect. Patients undergoing surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy present a higher risk for this side effect. Historically, patients are often not referred to rehabilitation for lymphedema management until the swelling is visible and has progressed, which reduces the chance of reversing the disease progression. Surveillance is key to identifying the earliest signs of breast cancer-related lymphedema, initiating treatment, reversing the disease process, and reducing the impact on function. The primary goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of monitoring fluid levels in patients with cancer using a bioimpedance analysis home device and to detect any relevant changes that may correlate with an increased risk of developing lymphedema. Remote monitoring by a clinician has not previously been possible, and a comparable bioelectrical water analyzer device has never been available to patients within the comfort of their homes. The study included 8 adult patients diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer who underwent unilateral lumpectomy or mastectomy, bilateral mastectomy, or reconstruction and were followed for 12 months. Patients also underwent radiation or chemotherapy as part of their treatment before the study and, in some cases, during participation in the study. Clinic visits were required every 3 months, with standard care treatment administered by the clinician, as well as daily fluid monitoring, using the extracellular to total body water (ECW/TBW) ratio obtained with the home device. Preliminary findings from the 8 cases showed that daily monitoring with the home device is possible, and may aid in the detection of fluid changes due to interventions like radiation or chemotherapy; these changes typically subside after treatment, compared to a permanent fluid increase that may indicate lymphedema. While one participant developed lymphedema, there is insufficient data to generalize the feasibility of early detection using the home device. A significant difference between ECW/TBW ratio measurements taken in the morning and evening (P values<.016) was observed for 6 participants, with morning values being higher than evening ones. Additionally, 7 participants showed a higher ECW/TBW ratio in the affected arm compared to the unaffected arm. On average, the ratio between the two values was higher than 1, approximately 75% of the time. The daily monitoring empowered patients to take charge of their health, with more than half expressing a desire to continue using the home device beyond the end of the study period. This case report shows the feasibility of daily remote monitoring for patients at risk of developing BCRL using a home bioimpedance analysis device.",

        "abstract": "Unpasteurized (raw) milk has been linked to foodborne illness outbreaks caused by Escherichia coli bacteria and certain species of Brucella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella. In October 2023, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency notified the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of eight cases of salmonellosis in persons who reported consuming brand A raw milk, produced exclusively by dairy farm A. A total of 171 outbreak-associated Salmonella Typhimurium cases were identified through review of standardized salmonellosis case report forms and a search of PulseNet, CDC's national molecular subtyping network for enteric disease surveillance, followed by administration of a dairy-focused supplementary questionnaire. Most cases (98%) were identified in California; one case each was identified in four other states. Among the 171 cases, 120 (70%) cases and 18 (82%) of the cases requiring hospitalization were among children and adolescents aged <18 years. Among 159 patients confirmed to be infected with the outbreak strain, 55 (70%) of those with exposure data consumed brand A raw milk or heavy cream. Four of 40 samples collected from dairy farm A, retail stores, and patients' homes, including raw milk and raw milk cheese aged for 60 days, tested positive for the outbreak strain of S. Typhimurium by whole-genome sequencing. Dairy farm A voluntarily recalled raw milk and raw heavy cream 1 week after the initial outbreak identification. Commercially distributed raw dairy products have the potential to cause large and widespread infectious disease outbreaks. Public health authorities should continue to raise awareness of the risks associated with consuming raw dairy products, especially by persons at increased risk for severe disease from enteric pathogens, including children.",

        "abstract": "The One Health (OH) approach is essential for preventing and managing zoonotic diseases through the promotion of intersectoral collaboration. Integrated surveillance systems enhance resource efficiency, support targeted interventions, and provide a comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics. However, operationalizing OH in resource-limited contexts encounters various obstacles due to systemic limitations. This study explores intersectoral collaboration across sectors engaged in zoonotic disease surveillance and response (ZDSR) in Ghana at the district level, identifying key operational gaps. We performed 46 key informant interviews with actors in the human, animal and wildlife health sectors directly involved in ZDSR. We developed an interview guide informed by WHO's <i>Components of Surveillance and Response Systems for Monitoring and Evaluation</i> Framework and the <i>Evaluation of collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system</i> (<i>ECoSur)</i> tool. The responses were analyzed using a content analysis approach. The results showed that for district-level surveillance activities, relationships between the human and animal health sectors existed in 87.5 % of districts, albeit weak, while the wildlife sector was absent. Rabies/dog bites, Avian Influenza, Lassa fever and COVID-19 were the primary triggers of intersectoral collaboration. Anthrax, zoonotic tuberculosis and trypanosomiasis saw minimal intersectoral collaboration. Collaborative activities were mostly addressed through reactive and event-driven approaches focusing on case-specific data sharing, alerts in outbreak events, and committee participation. However, core surveillance functions like disease detection, data analysis, and data management practices were performed in siloes. These results highlight the need for adaptable, proactive, and systemic frameworks that enhance intersectoral collaboration for the surveillance of neglected zoonotic diseases in Ghana.",

        "abstract": "Advanced chronic liver disease is frequently complicated by hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; predictors of poor prognosis that significantly reduce survival. While orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) remains the definitive treatment, it is often inaccessible in resource-limited settings. We present the case of a 70-year-old retired hospital attendant with hypertension who developed decompensated liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C virus HCV infection. She presented with portal hypertension, grade 4 HE, hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. She remained in grade 3 to 4 HE for approximately three months and in grade 2-3 HE for an additional two months. Despite profound hepatic decompensation and a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) score of 48 (indicating a 71% three-month mortality) and a Child-Pugh score of 15 (Class C), she responded remarkably to intensive conservative management. After six months of inpatient care, which included direct-acting antiviral therapy, anti-failure therapy, and seizure management, she recovered from hepatic coma. She received a six-month course of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)daclatasvir and sofosbuvir and achieved sustained virologic response. Over six and a half years later, she remains in good health with preserved cognition and normal blood pressure and has been under annual surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma. This case underscores the transformative potential of DAAs in improving survival even among severely decompensated HCV-related cirrhotic patients. It highlights the need for expanded access and subsidization of DAAs in low-resource settings, where liver transplantation is not feasible, and emphasizes the role of aggressive, supportive management in bridging the treatment gap.",

Disease surveillance and notification are important for early detection of disease outbreaks, timely response, and reduction of morbidity and death. This study assessed the knowledge and practice of disease surveillance and notification (DSN) among health workers in public health facilities in Wamakko LGA of Sokoto State. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 167 healthcare workers of all cadres in six primary health facilities. Data was collected from participants selected via convenience sampling method, using an interview-based semi-structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Most of the participants were Community Health Extension Workers (CHEW) (34.1%). The majority were aware that some diseases required notification (98.8%), where or who to report/notify diseases (83.8%), and of the DSN system (68.9%). The practice of disease notification was also comparatively good. Educational qualification (p=0.004) and years of working experience (p=0.041) were found to be significantly associated with the level of knowledge on disease surveillance and notification. There was no significant association between the level of practice of DSN and the level of knowledge (p=0.515), work experience (p=0.303), supervision (p=0.372), and motivation/incentives to disease reporting (p=.293). The notable identified challenges to disease reporting were the non-availability of reporting forms and stationery. Even though disease notification and surveillance are common in Nigeria, the practice and specific use of the surveillance and notification tools still fall short of the standard required for effective monitoring of the trend of disease and forestalling outbreaks. Regular training and revision courses on DSN for healthcare workers at the LGA level, especially on the uses of each DSN form are recommended.",

We determined the fraction of AFI attributable to influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia, along with an understanding of their epidemiological characteristics. From February 2021 to June 2022, we enrolled patients meeting an AFI case definition (age >5 years with fever ≥38°C) who presented at one of four selected sentinel hospital sites in Jimma, Harari, Addis Ababa, and Gonder. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected, Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed using real-time PCR for respiratory viruses (influenza and SARS-CoV-2). A quasi-binomial regression model and multivariable regression were performed to compute fractions and establish associations with the agent detected. A total of 737 AFI cases were enrolled. The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B among AFI patients were 7.8, 1.9, and 0.5 per 100,000 population, respectively. Among the enrolled AFI cases tested for SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 was the most detected pathogen with a positivity rate of 13.7% (95% CI:11.3-16.4), followed by influenza A and influenza B, which have a positivity rate of 3.3% (95% CI: 2.2-5.1) and 0.8% (95% CI:0.3-1.8), respectively. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 peaked at 37.4% in September 2021. Per the multivariable analysis, cases ≥65 years of age were three [AOR = 3.3,95% CI:(1.9-5.7)] times more likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses were highly prevalent among AFI cases. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was higher among older adults.

The relative vaccine effectiveness for XBB.1.5 boosters during the preceding 90 days (v any booster > 365 days) was 74.7% (95% CI, 59.9-84.1%); for other booster types it was 51.6% (95% CI, 39.3-61.4%). Relative vaccine effectiveness declined with time: for any booster during the preceding 91-180 days (v any booster > 365 days) it was 31.2% (95% CI, 18.9-41.6%); for any booster during the preceding 181-365 days it was 13.1% (95% CI, 1.8-23.2%). Relative XBB.1.5 vaccine effectiveness was similar in analyses restricted to 1 December 2023 - 29 February 2024, when the dominant Omicron subvariant was JN.1. Recent booster vaccination with the XBB.1.5 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine was highly effective for preventing COVID-19 deaths among people aged 65 years or older, including during the period in which the JN.1 was the dominant SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant. Our findings provide support for the recommendation that people aged 65 years or older receive COVID-19 vaccine booster doses every six months.",

        "abstract": "Selective RET inhibitors such as pralsetinib have become the standard of care for patients with RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Serial analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has proven effective in monitoring disease control/progression and therapeutic response in NSCLC. In this prospective study, we analyzed longitudinal ctDNA profiles (at baseline, week 8, and at progression) in Chinese patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC treated with pralsetinib (NCT03037385), utilizing allele frequency-based, cfDNA quantity-normalized, and methylation-based metrics. Associations between ctDNA dynamics, tumor response, and genomic alterations were assessed. A total of 21 patients were enrolled. Baseline PIK3CA co-mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; 3.0 vs. 12.4 months, P < 0.001). Superior PFS was observed in patients with lower baseline ctDNA levels across all metrics: allele frequency-based (HR = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.80; P = 0.012), cfDNA quantity-normalized (HR = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.71; P = 0.006), and methylation-based (HR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.85; P = 0.010). Early ctDNA clearance at the first radiographic assessment was also associated with prolonged PFS (median PFS not reached vs. 4.8 months; P = 0.002) and enhanced disease control (71.4% vs. 0%). Moreover, three distinct ctDNA dynamic profiles-clearance-rebound, reduction-rebound, and sustained clearance-were associated with different progression patterns (systemic progression, new extrathoracic lesions, new intracranial/intrathoracic lesions). No evidence of histologic transformation was identified at the time of progression. KRAS G12R and other non-canonical alterations emerged in ctDNA-rebound samples. Molecular progression preceded radiographic progression by a mean interval of 2.2 months. These findings suggest that ctDNA-based surveillance using multiple metrics, enables early forecasting of tumor response and progression in RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Early ctDNA clearance and dynamic profiles provide non-invasive biomarkers for early intervention, warranting further validation with ctDNA-guided strategies.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue is a common sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with many COVID-19 patients subsequently developing chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Long-term associations between COVID-19, new-onset CFS/ME, and other independent predictors such as vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, re-infection, and blood biomarkers at time of infection remain unclear. This study investigated the incidence and independent predictors of developing new-onset CFS/ME up to 4 years post SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to COVID- controls. This retrospective analysis conducted within the Montefiore Health System from February 1, 2020, to January 12, 2024 included adults without a prior diagnosis of fatigue or CFS/ME who were hospitalized for COVID-19 (n = 10,667), not hospitalized for COVID-19 (n = 25,409), and non-COVID-19 controls (n = 111,301). The observation time was between 30 days and 4 years post index date. The outcome was new-onset CFS/ME. Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated, assessing risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 infection, re-infection, and vaccination. Whether abnormal levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and temperature during hospitalization were associated with future CFS/ME risk was examined. Compared to COVID- controls, the risk of developing new-onset CFS/ME was higher among both COVID-19 hospitalized (adjusted HR = 1.46 [1.07, 1.99]) and non-hospitalized patients (1.56 [1.25, 1.93]). Females (1.54 [1.27, 1.89]), patients with liver disease (1.61 [1.29, 2.00]), autoimmune disorders (1.57 [1.18, 2.08]), and anxiety disorders (1.35 [1.04, 1.74]) were more likely to develop CFS/ME (p < 0.05). Re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with increased risk of incident CFS/ME. COVID-19 vaccination status during the initial phase of the rollout (prior to 2022) was associated with an increased risk of new-onset CFS/ME (p < 0.05). None of the blood biomarkers during acute COVID-19 were associated with new-onset CFS/ME risk (p > 0.05). SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of new-onset CFS/ME, independent of hospitalization status. Females, and individuals with autoimmune and anxiety disorders were more susceptible. These findings highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and management of fatigue-related symptoms in COVID-19 survivors.",

        "title": "Shifts in Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Patterns in Korea After the COVID-19 Pandemic Resulting From Immunity Debt: Retrospective Observational Study.",
        "abstract": "Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask-wearing and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the transmission of common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). As NPIs were stopped, concerns emerged about \"immunity debt,\" which suggests that limited natural exposure to pathogens may have increased susceptibility and severity, particularly among young children. However, despite growing attention, the postpandemic impact of NPIs on epidemiologic patterns and shifts in age-specific disease burden remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate, using national surveillance data, the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology and clinical burden of influenza virus and RSV infections in Korea, with an emphasis on the influence of NPIs on the incidence and clinical severity of these infections, particularly among young children. We analyzed weekly virologic, outpatient, and inpatient surveillance data on influenza virus and RSV infections from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency from 2017 to 2024, covering the prepandemic, pandemic, and postpandemic periods. Time-series analyses were conducted to examine changes in seasonality and to estimate age-specific incidence and clinical severity of influenza virus and RSV infections before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In the postpandemic seasons, both RSV and influenza virus infections showed disrupted seasonality with delayed and prolonged epidemics. While the overall burden of both viruses was comparable to that for prepandemic periods, there was a notable shift in the age distribution of severe cases. Among influenza-associated hospital admissions, the proportion of school-aged children (7-18 years) doubled, rising from 14% (1,814/12,660) in 2019/20 to 28% (2,176/7,755) in 2022/23. Hospitalization rates in this age group also increased significantly, from 46.8 to 64.4 per 100,000 among children aged 7-12 years, and from 16.4 to 30.0 per 100,000 among those aged 13-18 years. For RSV infections, the burden shifted most prominently to young children aged 1-6 years, whose share of hospital admissions rose from 48% (5,789/11,969) to 61% (7,316/12,011) over the same period. This age group also experienced the largest rise in RSV-associated hospitalization rates, increasing from 230.8 to 357.5 per 100,000 between the 2019/20 and 2022/23 seasons. The patterns of influenza virus and RSV infections in Korea following the COVID-19 pandemic reveal distinct shifts in timing, severity, and the age groups that were most affected. Postpandemic influenza and RSV activity in Korea showed delayed and prolonged epidemics, with shifts in age-specific disease burden rather than an overall increase. Substantial increases in susceptibility and severity among young children for RSV infections and older children for influenza virus infections suggest lingering immunity gaps from reduced exposures during the pandemic. These effects may be further compounded by declining influenza vaccine uptake among children following the pandemic. Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and targeted public health measures to manage respiratory viruses in the postpandemic era.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Antibiotic resistance is a significant and escalating challenge that limits available therapeutic options. This issue is further exacerbated by the decreasing number of new antibiotics being developed. Our study aims to describe the epidemiology and pattern of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative infections isolated from a cohort of hospitalized patients and to analyze the distribution of infections within the hospital setting. <b>Methods</b>: A retrospective study was conducted on all patients admitted to Vito Fazzi Hospital in Lecce, Italy, who required an infectious disease consultation due to the isolation of Gram-negative bacteria from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022. <b>Results</b>: During the study period, 402 isolates obtained from 382 patients (240 men and 142 women) with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria were identified. Among these isolated, 226 exhibited multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent from three or more different classes. In 2018, the percentage of multidrug-resistant isolates peaked at 87.6%, before decreasing to the lowest level (66.2%) in 2021. Overall, of the 402 isolates, 154 (38.3%) displayed resistance to carbapenems, while 73 (18.1%) were resistant to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Among the resistant microorganisms, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> showed the highest resistance to carbapenems, accounting for 85.2% of all resistant strains. <i>Escherichia coli</i> exhibited the greatest resistance to ESBLs, with a rate of 86.7%. Among carbapenem-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> isolates, the following resistance rates were observed: KPC-1 at 98.2%, IMP-1 at 0.9%, VIM-1 at 0.9%, and NDM-1 at 0.9%. <b>Conclusions</b>: Patients with infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria have limited treatment options and are therefore at an increased risk of death, complications, and longer hospital stays. Rapid diagnostic techniques and antimicrobial stewardship programs-especially for ESBLs and carbapenemases-can significantly shorten the time needed to identify the infection and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy compared to traditional methods. Additionally, enhancing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance within populations is crucial to address this emerging public health challenge.",

Despite the availability of pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), genotype surveillance remains essential for optimizing national elimination strategies. This study thus aims to characterize the molecular distribution of HCV genotypes in northern Thailand. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective molecular epidemiological study on 1737 HCV-infected patients who attended the Clinical Microbiology Service Unit (CMSU) Laboratory, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University between April 2016 and June 2024. HCV genotyping was performed using Sanger sequencing and reverse hybridization line probe assay (LiPA). <b>Results:</b> Genotype 3 was the most prevalent (36.6%), followed by genotype 1 (35.8%) and genotype 6 (27.2%). Subtype 3a (27.2%) predominated, along with 1a (22.1%), 1b (12.6%), and genotype 6 subtypes including 6c to 6l (13.5%) and 6n (6.6%). Males had a higher prevalence of genotype 1, while genotype 3 was more common among females. Temporal analysis revealed a relative increase in genotype 6 prevalence since 2021. Genotype 6 also exhibited significantly higher median viral loads compared to genotypes 1 and 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides updated evidence on the shifting distribution of HCV genotypes in northern Thailand, particularly the increasing prevalence of genotype 6. These findings underscore the importance of continued molecular surveillance to guide genotype-specific treatment strategies and support Thailand's 2030 HCV elimination goals.",

This study assessed HCW severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence trends and indicators' effectiveness for infection monitoring in the Philippine healthcare setting during 2021 and 2022-2023. We obtained data on HCW demographics at 2 facilities, and COVID-19 symptoms recall and absenteeism at one facility. We collected and tested blood specimens with a SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein-based serological assay. We calculated crude prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors. A total of 253 HCWs were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was 34% from September to October 2021 and 92% from October 2022 to April 2023 during the Delta and the Omicron variant surges, respectively, at one facility. At the other facility, seroprevalence was 31% in September-October 2021. Of the 33 seropositive HCWs with questionnaire completed, 14 (42%) did not recall COVID-19-like symptoms in the past year. Serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was statistically more likely among HCWs who recalled COVID-19-like symptoms in the past year (PR, 2.69 [95% CI: 1.53-4.72]; P < .05). Of the seropositive HCWs, 7 (21%) had no hospital documentation of missed work. Of the 24 HCWs with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 12 (50%) tested because of symptoms, 4 (17%) tested after exposure, and 5 (21%) tested following employment screening. Self-reported symptoms may be used to track SARS-CoV-2 prior infections within resource-limited healthcare settings. Occupational health services should consider these findings when developing infection monitoring strategies among HCWs. Combining surveillance strategies may strengthen infection monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Transverse myelitis is an urgent medical problem all over the world. Acute transverse myelitis is more common in children than in adults. Postvaccinal transverse myelitis is a rare complication of vaccination. In vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, the virus mosaically infects the motor neurons of the anterior horns of the spinal cord, resulting in asymmetric paralysis of predominantly proximal muscles. The case of acute transverse myelitis in a 12-year-old child corresponds to the existing definition of a vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis case: a temporal relationship between the onset of flaccid paralysis and the administration of oral polio vaccine and the duration of paralysis. The child developed flaccid paralysis 18 days after (August, 2024) the administration of oral polio vaccine and persisted for more than 60 days from the onset of the disease. Vaccine virus type 3 was isolated from the feces. However, the child received 2 doses of inactivated oral polio vaccine and 1 dose of bivalent (types 1 and 3) oral polio vaccine before the disease. The child did not have an increase in the titer of antibodies in paired sera to polioviruses types 1 and 3. Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intramedullary focus with hyperintense MR signal on 2WI, 2FS at the level of the spinal cord cone (Th<sub>11</sub>-L<sub>2</sub>), which spread across the entire diameter and unevenly accumulated paramagnetic. These changes were characteristic of acute transverse myelitis. This article presents a clinical case of Acute transverse myelitis in a child after administration of live oral polio vaccine. We aimed to emphasize the importance of differential diagnosis of myelitis in a child who received OPV. This is important from the point of view of epidemiological surveillance of poliomyelitis and possible adverse reactions after vaccination.",

        "title": "Interplay between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever: insights from endemic countries and a controlled human infection model.",
        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited. To investigate the association between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n = 92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop the disease, n = 97) and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n = 69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition and function were compared. We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against the development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had a higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22). This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections. Video Abstract.",

A total of 2161 participants were selected from China Nutrition and Health Surveillance(2010-2012) and China Nutrition and Health Follow-up Study(2021), who were not diabetes patients and fasting serum glucose&lt;6.1 mmol/L at baseline. Information on socioeconomic status, lifestyle habits, physical examination, and laboratory examination was collected. TyG index was calculated by fasting serum triglyceride and glucose. Participants were categorized into quartiles based on their baseline TyG index(2010-2012). Multiple adjusted logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between TyG index and the risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes. Subgroup analysis was conducted among participants stratified by sex, age group, and body mass index(BMI). In 2161 participants, there were significant differences in age, BMI, household income, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting serum total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol across quartiles of the TyG index. After adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, BMI, living area, education level, marital status, household income, current smoking, excessive drinking, leisure physical activity level, family history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting serum total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with the lowest quartile(Q1), the highest(Q4) showed a 2.82-fold increase in type 2 diabetes risk(95%CI=1.65-4.84, P_(trend)=0.007). Considering TyG index as continuous variable, the risk for diabetes will be 2.22-fold higher with the per unit increase of TyG index(95%CI=1.61-3.06, P&lt;0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association remained robust among participants over 45 years old, in males and females alike, and in people with different BMI. And the result showed to be more pronounced among those were over 60 years old, female, and BMI&lt;24. No significant interactions between subgroups and TyG index were observed. Among Chinese adults with normal fasting serum glucose, the TyG index was positively associated with the risk of new onset type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the association between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension(DASH)diet and serum uric acid levels, the risk of hyperuricemia, and the mediation role of systematic inflammation, among Chinese adults from 5 provinces. China Nutrition and Health Follow-up Study(2021) was conducted based on a part of the participants in China Nutrition and Health Surveillance(2010-2012) and subsequently newly sampled participants. A total of 6963 Chinese adults were selected from and information on socioeconomic status, diet, body measurements, and laboratory examination were investigated. Using the DASH score to evaluate the adherence to the DASH diet, the participants were categorized into quintiles. Using multiple adjustment generalized linear regression and logistic regression analysis the association between DASH diet and serum uric acid level and the risk of hyperuricemia were explored. The mediation role of systematic inflammation on the above associations was evaluated among 2112 participants who were tested for serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein(hs-CRP). In 6963 participants, the average serum uric acid level was 317.4 μmol/L, and the prevalence of hyperuricemia was 21.18%. The result showed that participants who were 18-44 years, female, overweight or obese, urban residents, higher education level, married, higher household income, non-smokers, higher physical activity level, non-hyperuricemia had higher adherence to the DASH diet(P&lt;0.05). After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, gender, body mass index, living area, education level, marital status, household income, current smoking, excessive drinking, physical activity level, and condition of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, the adherence to DASH diet had a negative association with serum uric acid levels(Q5 vs. Q1, relative concentration =0.93, 95%CI 0.91-0.94, P_(trend)&lt;0.01) and with the risk of hyperuricemia(Q5 vs. Q1, OR =0.59, 95%CI 0.48-0.73, P_(trend)&lt;0.01).

        "title": "Characteristics of magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging findings in gastric cancer after Helicobacter pylori eradication.",
        "abstract": "Background Helicobacter pylori eradication reduces the risk of gastric cancer development and is effective in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis. Recently, an increase in gastric cancer incidence has been observed in daily clinical practice in patients who have undergone H. pylori eradication. Therefore, continuous surveillance endoscopy is important for detecting gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication. In addition, endoscopic findings may differ between noneradication and posteradication gastric cancer. Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) has been useful for the diagnosis of posteradication gastric cancer, regardless of the histological type. However, there have been no comprehensive reports in this regard. Here, we aimed to clarify the characteristics of ME-NBI findings in gastric cancer following H. pylori eradication. Summary In differentiated- and mixed-type cancers (a mixture of differentiated and undifferentiated), the cancer may be covered by noncancerous epithelium following H. pylori eradication; however, abnormalities can still be detected using ME-NBI. Therefore, ME-NBI is suitable for the diagnosis of posteradication gastric cancer. In undifferentiated-type cancer, ME-NBI is more useful in diagnosing posteradication gastric cancer than noneradicated gastric cancer because of the clear contrast between cancerous and noncancerous areas following eradication. In addition, when noneradicated gastric cancer is detected, rather than performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or gastrectomy without eradication, it is beneficial to start patients on eradication therapy immediately and diagnose the disease extent with ME-NBI without awaiting the results of the eradication assessment and performing ESD or gastrectomy. This approach is expected to prevent misdiagnosis of the tumor size and reduce the positivity of the horizontal margin in ESD or gastrectomy. Key messages The number of posteradication gastric cancer cases is expected to increase in comparison to noneradicated gastric cancer cases, as H. pylori eradication is being widely used in chronic atrophic gastritis cases. Therefore, the diagnosis of posteradication gastric cancer using ME-NBI is expected to gain importance in daily clinical practice.",

Antiperistaltic ICA (APICA) and isoperistaltic ICA (IPICA) alignments differ in ease of neo-terminal ileum (neo-TI) intubation, potentially impacting endoscopic follow-up. This study compares postsurgical neo-TI intubation feasibility between APICA and IPICA. We performed a retrospective analysis of CD patients (≥18 y) who underwent ileocolonic resection between 2010 and 2022 and completed ileocolonoscopy within 24 mo. Patients with non-APICA/IPICA anastomoses, ileostomy, and patients whose ileocolonoscopy report was unavailable were excluded. We included 148 patients, (76.4% APICA and 23.6% IPICA). Groups were comparable in demographics, surgical factors, and postsurgical outcomes. Anastomotic disease recurrence (Rutgeerts score Ri ≥ 2b) was similar: 37.6% APICA versus 37.1% IPICA (P = 0.563). Excluding patients with anastomotic strictures and poor preparation, neo-TI intubation was successful in 87.4% of APICA versus 100% of IPICA (P = 0.038). APICA and IPICA have similar safety and endoscopic recurrence rates. IPICA allows for easier neo-TI intubation with no intubation failure, improving endoscopic surveillance and management of CD.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused substantial disease and death worldwide since December 2019, but the burden was lower in Africa than in high-income countries. To address potential underreporting, we modeled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and disease burden in Burkina Faso and Madagascar. Prospectively enrolled patients who presented with fever at sentinel healthcare facilities were assessed for active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Household members of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were prospectively followed for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Archived serum specimens that spanned the pandemic onset in Madagascar to the start of prospective surveillance were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Data from these multiple sources contributed to an integrated analysis to calibrate an epidemiologic mass action model. COVID-19 accounted for a substantial fraction of healthcare-ascertained febrile illness in both Burkina Faso and Madagascar, with symptom profiles consistent with those previously reported. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage was very low in Burkina Faso and unavailable in Madagascar. The household secondary attack rate was 28% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 22%-35%] in Madagascar and 31% (95% CI: 9%-68%) in Burkina Faso, indicating substantial transmission of the disease within households in both locations. Model simulations estimated that the actual number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was at least nine times higher than the reported number of febrile COVID-19 cases. Africa has faced persistent challenges due to underinvestment in vaccination programs and disease surveillance programs. There was substantial underreporting of COVID-19 cases during the pandemic in both countries. Our findings call for improving systems and resources in disease surveillance during epidemic and interepidemic periods in these countries.",

        "abstract": "Amidst highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants that continue to circulate in the community, individuals with cancer exhibit variations in immunity and susceptibility for reasons that remain poorly understood. In a longitudinal cohort study with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 serological and outcomes surveillance, we examined adults receiving cancer treatment (cases, n = 229) or who were free of cancer and other major comorbidities (controls, n = 800), prior to the Omicron era onset and onwards (September 24, 2021-March 10, 2024). The main outcomes were longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike receptor binding domain IgG (IgG-SRBD) antibody response and Omicron and subvariant infection frequency and severity. Among the 229 participants with cancer (age 66 ± 12 years, 51% female), the most prevalent subtypes included nonmelanoma skin (23%), breast (20%), and hematologic (18%). In mixed-effects linear models, hematologic cancer and B-cell targeted agents were associated with reduced longitudinal IgG-SRBD response (p < 0.05). In multivariable regression analyses, hematologic cancer (p = 0.037) and B-cell targeted agents (p = 0.030) were associated with increased frequency of new infections. The frequency of new infections resulting in moderate illness was increased in patients with active/recent cancer treatment (44%) versus healthy controls (10%; p < 0.001); there were no severe or critical infections. Patients with hematologic, breast, prostate, or skin cancer (p < 0.01), treated with local therapy (odds ratio [OR] 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-3.15; p = 0.032), B-cell targeted therapy (OR 4.81; 95% CI 1.78-12.93; p = 0.002), or small molecule agents (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.05-5.23; p = 0.037) were associated with increased infection severity. Individuals with hematologic cancer or exposed to B-cell-targeted therapy had reduced humoral immunity and more frequent and severe infections. Active breast, prostate, or skin cancer, or treatment with local therapy or small molecule agents had elevated risk for more severe, but not more frequent, infections. Despite overall low rates of infection associated with lower respiratory disease, certain higher-risk cancer patients may benefit from further protective measures.",

This report presents a case of a patient with NF1 who had a huge plexiform neurofibroma of the right breast and developed invasive carcinoma in the left breast. A woman with a known history of NF1, enlarged right breast, and pectus carinatum presented with locally advanced breast cancer of the left breast. The patient underwent four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by a left modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathology showed a complete pathological response. Subsequently, the patient received four cycles of adjuvant paclitaxel followed by endocrine therapy with anastrozole which was replaced by tamoxifen due to bone and muscle pain. At one year follow-up, the patient remains free of disease. The patient was referred to a plastic surgeon for resection of the enlarged right breast. It is known that women with NF1 have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, as demonstrated in our case. These patients could benefit from an early start of breast cancer screening, which could lead to an early diagnosis of early-stage tumors and a better prognosis.

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises 10-15% of all breast cancers and is associated with high recurrence rates and limited treatment options. No guideline-recommended blood-based surveillance tests currently exist for early recurrence detection. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a promising biomarker for molecular residual disease (MRD) assessment and recurrence prediction, though its role in detecting local recurrence remains unclear. We present the case of a 53-year-old postmenopausal woman with early stage TNBC who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, bilateral mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection, and adjuvant treatment. One month after completion of therapy, ctDNA monitoring using the Signatera MRD assay detected was positive at 0.07 mean tumor molecules per milliliter (MTM/mL) despite no radiographic evidence of disease. Serial ctDNA testing at 2, 3, and 6 months remained positive, with increasing MTM/mL values. Seven months after initial ctDNA detection, a breast MRI was done due to palpation of a lesion at the surgical site near the nipple, identifying multifocal masses within the reconstructed right breast, and surgical resection confirmed TNBC recurrence. Following post-mastectomy radiation, serial ctDNA testing was negative, and the patient remained radiographically and molecularly disease-free at 20 months following the resection of the recurrent disease. This case highlights the potential of ctDNA testing for MRD detection in the adjuvant setting and identifying local recurrence. If systemic imaging fails to detect metastases, dedicated breast imaging remains crucial, even after bilateral mastectomy. Early ctDNA testing may refine surveillance and treatment decisions. Prospective trials are needed to validate its role in improving breast cancer outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is an important cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. Circulation patterns represent challenges for immunoprophylaxis, requiring tailored interventions to address RSV activity linked to climate. We assessed RSV seasonality across the Americas and its relation to environmental factors and influenza circulation. RSV seasonality was assessed using data reported in 2010-2019 to a multi-country respiratory surveillance network. Time-series analysis identified temporal patterns and trends. Negative binomial, Moving Epidemics Method, and WHO Moving Averages Models were compared to assess seasonality. Correlation and regression were used for associations of RSV with environmental and influenza predictors. During 2010-2019, 32 countries in the Americas reported 14,308,503 respiratory samples, with 446,648 RSV-positive (3.12%) samples. RSV seasonal epidemics progressed from south to north. In South America, RSV seasons began in early May, peaking in August. RSV seasonality was less distinct in Caribbean; RSV started in September and peaked in October-November. Central Americas' RSV season lagged behind influenza, whereas in the Andes, it peaked earlier. At higher latitudes, RSV epidemics occurred earlier with shorter durations. RSV circulation negatively correlated with lower temperatures (-0.43; p < 0.0001), and precipitation (-0.04; p = 0.0035); and was positively correlated with decreased longitude (0.12; p < 0.0001) and barometric pressure (0.15; p < 0.0001), and was associated with lower elevation (0.02; p = 0.10), and westerly locations (0.12; p < 0.0001). Subregional and interannual variations in RSV seasonality were influenced by environmental factors, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance. Collaborative efforts improve surveillance, shaping evidence-based strategies for preventive product introductions and effective RSV control.

There were nonignorable nonresponses to the social determinants and health equity module. Nonresponse referred to an interviewee who completed the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System core survey but chose not to answer any of the social determinants and health equity module questions. The study included 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System participants from 39 states; Washington, DC; and 2 territories. The sequential multiple imputation approach was used to impute the household income. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the propensity of not answering any questions in social determinants and health equity. A nonresponse adjustment factor was developed for each state using a propensity score estimated from the logistic regression model. Florida, California, and New Jersey had the highest nonresponse rates at 29.3%, 26.4%, and 25.6%, respectively. After excluding the outlier Puerto Rico, the median value of nonresponse adjustment factors for states ranged from 1.09 in Idaho to 1.67 in Florida.

        "abstract": "The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend active surveillance (AS) as an alternative for very low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) based on evidence from observational and cohort studies in Japan and Korea that demonstrated low rates of disease progression. Adopting AS presents unique challenges in India given the need for proper understanding, adequate sonographic expertise, meticulous follow-up and acceptance of the patients and clinicians for active surveillance of diagnosed PTC. We present our data on the feasibility of AS at our centre in the last 7 years. We started adopting AS for patients with PTC or suspected PTC under AS in July 2017. Most of the patients had FNAC category Bethesda V or VI and/or USG category ACR-TIRADS TR4 or TR5 nodules. In all patients, the PTC was discovered incidentally. A baseline CT scan of the neck and chest was performed if indicated and in select patients, serial serum thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) were done. Patients were followed up semi-annually with neck ultrasound performed by a single operator. We have been following 17 patients with PTC under the AS clinic. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 45.17 (14.7) years with 13 females and a median follow-up of 40 months (IQR 40-46; range 13-86), and none have undergone thyroid surgery. The PTC was discovered incidentally in 12 patients during a neck sonogram for evaluation of painful swallowing or salivary gland-related symptoms and evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism; 2 patients on CT chest for pulmonary symptoms and 3 were \"PETomas\" during evaluation of their primary cancer (colon cancer, breast cancer and multiple myeloma). Out of the 3 patients who underwent FDG-PET scan, the SUV max of the PTC was 4, 4.8 and 14.6. All except one were uni-focal PTC with size (largest dimension on USG) ranging from 4.8 to 21 mm and median volume 0.21 mL (IQR 0.21-0.37 mL). The baseline median Tg levels were 12.95 ng/mL (range is 0.07 to 51 ng/mL), and anti-Tg was elevated in 4 patients (132 IU/mL, 156 IU/mL, 696 IU/mL, 4000 IU/mL). Serial Tg and anti Tg levels were measured over time in 4 patients. The patient with the largest PTC (21 mm) who is currently under AS had Eisenmenger syndrome. The longest duration of follow-up in the AS cohort is 86 months. One patient conceived and had a healthy baby during active surveillance with no significant increase in the size of the tumour. On follow-up, the volume change in the nodules ranged from - 44 to 335% with 35% (6/17) showing decrement and 65% (11/17) showing increment. The change in the largest dimension ranged from - 28 to 154% with a decrement of 41% (7/17) and increment of 59% (10/17). However, a significant increase in the volume (> 50%) was noted only in 2 patients, and a significant increase in tumour dimension (> 3 mm) was documented in only 2 patients on follow-up. None of the patients has developed regional or distant metastasis, and none has undergone surgery. Our study provides insights into the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with incidentally diagnosed PTC undergoing active surveillance. Our findings support the feasibility and safety of this approach in select individuals, with emphasis on meticulous periodic neck sonography by a single operator, and a like-minded supportive thyroid cancer team.",

This is being done using the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan 2022-2024, which includes a set of indicators to track progress. All countries in the ESA sub-region have been informed about these key performance indicators, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is keeping a weekly eye on their implementation. We conducted a descriptive secondary analysis of field Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance data compiled from 19 countries of East and Southern Africa for the period of January 2022 to December 2023. During the period, Seychelles did not report any AFP case, and therefore the country is excluded from the final analysis. A total of 18,078 AFP cases were detected, reported, and verified from nineteen countries in ESA and we found 8,049 females (44.5%) and 10,029 males (55.5%). This shows a male child was more likely to get AFP compared to a female child (11% difference, p < 0.0001). We noticed a significant increase in prompt AFP cases detection of 4% and an increased number of cases investigated within 11 days from the date of onset of paralysis from 7,790 (89%) in 2022 to 8,246 (91%) in 2023 (2% change, p < 0.0001). The two AFP surveillance quality indicators in the study period rose from 4.4 in 2022 to 4.7 in 2023 (0.3 increase, p < 0.0001). Of the 8,964 AFP stool samples assessed in 2023, 53% were delivered to the national polio laboratories within 72 hours compared to 52% of 8,666 AFP stool samples in 2022 (1% difference, p-value of 0.1838). There is an overall improvement in the Global Polio Surveillance Action Plan (GPSAP) indicators in the ESA subregion for the period of 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023. We recommend utilizing innovative methods to improve case detections, providing tailored surveillance training to lower levels, and enhancing sample shipment and capacities to process samples timely.",

        "title": "Evaluation of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system in Kebbi State, Nigeria between 2013-2018.",
        "abstract": "since 1988, polio incidence has declined by over 99% globally, from more than 350,000 annual cases in over 125 endemic countries to transmission now limited to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Africa has not reported wild poliovirus since 2016. An effective Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance system is crucial for detecting and interrupting polio transmission. This evaluation assessed the Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance system in Kebbi State, Nigeria, to identify operational gaps. using updated Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and the World Health Organization (WHO) performance standards, the study reviewed AFP surveillance data from 2013-2018, conducted stakeholder interviews using adapted questionnaires and key informant interviews, and analyzed data using means, frequencies, and proportions. among the 49 respondents, 98% reported that case definitions and investigation forms were easy to use, while 97% found data tools adaptable to changes. All surveillance officers understood AFP case definitions and expressed willingness to sustain the system. Key performance indicators, including non-polio AFP rates (24.6-55.2), stool adequacy (95-99.7%), timeliness, and reporting completeness all consistently met WHO standards. the evaluation concluded that the AFP surveillance system in Kebbi State, Nigeria, is useful, simple, flexible, acceptable, sensitive, representative, timely, and stable, although donor dependency remains a concern. A significant gap was the lack of data on 60-day follow-ups and laboratory feedback. Addressing these issues is important to further strengthen the system.",

        "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder associated with an elevated risk of both benign and malignant tumors. In rare cases, it involves the lungs in a condition known as neurofibromatosis-associated diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD), marked by cystic and emphysematous changes even in nonsmokers. We report a case of a 53-year-old female with NF1 who presented with progressive chest pain and dyspnea. Imaging revealed a 6.0 × 3.1 cm left posterior chest wall mass with osseous erosion and emphysematous lung changes consistent with NF-DLD. Multidisciplinary management, including surgical resection of the chest wall mass, led to symptom relief and an uneventful recovery. This case underscores the importance of recognizing NF-DLD in NF1 patients with respiratory symptoms and the need for ongoing surveillance for malignancies to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate intervention.",

        "abstract": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a serotype of the enterovirus species D, has garnered significant attention due to outbreaks reported in 2014, 2016, and 2018. In this study, 36 Chinese EV-D68 strains were isolated, sequenced, and combined with all EV-D68 VP1 sequences from GenBank to form a data set of 1679 sequences. This data set served as the basis for phylogenetic, evolutionary dynamics, phylogeographic, and key amino acid site mutation analyses of EV-D68. Based on the VP1 region, EV-D68 is classified into four genotypes (A-D), and seven subgenotypes (B1-B3, D1-D4), with B3 and D3 being the predominant subgenotypes. Bayesian skyline plots indicated that genotypes B and D experienced multiple population expansions, aligning with reported EV-D68 outbreaks. Phylogeographic analyses of the B3 subgenotypes revealed sequences from Europe and North America clustering into a single evolutionary branch, suggesting significant transmission between these regions. Additionally, mutation analysis identified VP1-98 as a high-frequency mutation site, differing significantly between the previously prevalent A and C genotypes and the currently prevalent B and D genotypes. However, the functional implications of this mutation require further investigation. This study provides a solid theoretical basis for epidemiological research, disease surveillance, and prevention efforts related to EV-D68.",

        "abstract": "DNA repair disorders are a group of conditions characterized by progressive, multisystem phenotypes. Defining new clinical presentations of these disorders is essential for optimizing patient care. ERCC1-XPF is a multifunctional endonuclease involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. We sought to define a novel multisystem phenotype associated with biallelic ERCC1 variants and impaired DNA repair. Through international collaboration, we identified seven individuals from five families carrying biallelic ERCC1 variants, including p.Arg156Trp and p.Ala266Pro, who exhibited a distinct clinical phenotype. All individuals presented with growth restriction, photosensitivity, and kidney and liver dysfunction. Notably, three children required liver transplants. Hepatocellular carcinoma developed in four children, resulting in two deaths, including one following treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin. Older individuals exhibited additional features, including ataxia, basal cell carcinomas, pancreatic insufficiency, ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, and restrictive lung disease. Functional assays using patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated significant destabilization of the ERCC1-XPF complex and defects in NER and ICL repair. However, residual NER and ICL repair activity was observed, suggesting a hypomorphic effect of the missense variants, which were present either in the homozygous state or in trans with a predicted loss-of-function allele. We define ERCC1-hepatorenal syndrome as a severe, multisystem DNA repair disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality, including a significant risk of pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma. We propose management guidelines emphasizing cancer surveillance and caution with chemotherapy to minimize treatment-related toxicity.",

        "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma of the female reproductive system is rare, and as a result, management strategies are unclear. In this study, we categorized rhabdomyosarcoma based on location (cervical, uterine, vulvovaginal) and analyzed prognostic factors to guide individualized treatment. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2000-2021) were used to identify patients with cervical, uterine, and vulvovaginal rhabdomyosarcoma. Multivariate Cox regression identified prognostic factors, and Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed overall survival and disease-specific survival. For cervical rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 76), radical surgery improved disease-specific survival (91.9% vs 62.8%, p = .005), but conservative surgery was sufficient for patients aged <49 years, with a tumor diameter <4 cm, or with the embryonal subtype. In uterine rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 253), the embryonal subtype showed better overall survival (62.3% vs 23%, p < .0001) and disease-specific survival (65.9% vs 31%, p < .0001), especially for tumors ≤14 cm. For vulvovaginal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 60), no survival differences were observed between local and radical surgery in patients aged <16 years or with tumors <8 cm. Adjuvant chemotherapy in cervical rhabdomyosarcoma has been shown to enhance the overall survival rate of patients undergoing radical surgery; however, radiotherapy appears to diminish their overall survival outcomes. In the case of uterine rhabdomyosarcoma of the embryonic subtype, chemotherapy concurrently improves both overall and disease-specific survival rates, while radiotherapy does not demonstrate a significant impact. For vulvovaginal rhabdomyosarcoma, chemotherapy is effective in improving the overall survival rate among non-surgical patients, whereas radiotherapy shows no effect on the survival outcomes across all subgroups. Conservative treatment is suitable for young patients with cervical rhabdomyosarcoma who have small tumors or the embryonal subtype, while radical surgery benefits the overall population. Embryonal uterine rhabdomyosarcoma has better outcomes, and young patients with vulvovaginal rhabdomyosarcoma of the embryonal subtype can undergo local surgery. For these 3 sites, chemotherapy is indispensable, while radiotherapy should be administered with caution.",

        "abstract": "Expanded carrier screening (ECS) is used to assess the reproductive probability of having an offspring affected by an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive genetic disorder. Rarely, a presumably healthy individual may be identified to carry variants that could influence their health. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of potentially affected individuals, with the objective of improving counseling for ECS. A retrospective study of a cohort of 3001 individuals who sought ECS during early pregnancy or preconception was conducted. Potentially affected individuals carrying biallelic pathogenic variants for autosomal recessive diseases, as well as females carrying a heterozygous pathogenic variant for X-linked disease, were identified. A total of 13 potentially affected individuals (0.43%) were identified; 5 patients were homozygous or compound heterozygous for autosomal recessive diseases, and 8 were heterozygous for X-linked diseases. The majority of the potentially affected individuals were asymptomatic (85%, 11/13) at the time of assessment. Only two patients exhibited mild clinical manifestations. People who intend to undergo ECS should be informed that they themselves may be identified as potentially affected individuals for whom clinical evaluation and surveillance are recommended.",

The 2022 outbreak, previously limited to Central and West Africa, exhibited extraordinary global dissemination, prompting critical inquiries over the virus's transmission mechanisms and containment strategies. This paper analyzes monkeypox's pathophysiology, epidemiological trends, and public health ramifications, emphasizing diagnostic difficulties, underreporting, and the inequitable access to vaccines and therapies. The discussion encompasses the significance of genomic surveillance, One Health strategies, and the necessity for research on effective antivirals and vaccines. Substantial knowledge deficiencies, encompassing virus mutation hazards and a restricted comprehension of animal reservoirs, impede preventative initiatives. Mitigating future epidemics necessitates addressing these problems through improved diagnoses, equitable vaccination distribution, and enhanced surveillance. This paper examines the present status of Monkeypox research and delineates prospective directions to inform global public health policies.",
