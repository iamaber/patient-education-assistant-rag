        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrheal illness, and population-based data on the incidence of clinically significant ETEC diarrhea in developing countries are limited. We provide insight into ETEC epidemiology; we followed a population-based cohort in a vaccine trial. We analyzed data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of an oral cholera vaccine conducted in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study covers 90 geographical clusters with an average population of 2988 households/cluster (baseline population 268 896). Two cohort analyses were conducted, 1 as dynamic cohort that included all subjects at vaccination, in-migrants, and births over 4 years and a closed cohort, which included only individuals present at baseline. We evaluated individuals placed under treatment center-based diarrheal surveillance between 2011 and 2015. In the dynamic cohort, the ETEC incidence was 150/100 000 person-years (PY; 95% CI, 141-159), with seasonal peaks during warmer months, and in the closed cohort, the incidence was 153/100 000 PY (95% CI, 140, 166). The highest rate was seen in children aged <1 year (2007; 95% CI, 1664-2402), then in those aged 1-4 years (314; 95% CI, 252-386), and again the rate rose in those aged >45 years (219/100 000 PY; 95% CI, 177-267). The rate of severe ETEC was ≤35/100 000 PY for persons aged ≤45 years (95% CI, 27-44), but rose to 82 for adults aged >45 years (95% CI, 58-113). ETEC diarrhea is a major health problem in young children and older adults, prevention through vaccination and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene should target both age groups.",

        "title": "Molecular Identification, Genetic Diversity, and Antibiotic Resistance of Pathogenic Bacteria in Finfish Aquaculture Systems of Southwestern Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Bacterial disease outbreaks continue to threaten finfish aquaculture in southwestern Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses and heightened food security concerns. To address the absence of robust molecular diagnostics and genetic diversity assessment for bacterial pathogens, a comprehensive five-year study (2018-2023) was conducted to evaluate pathogen prevalence, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance, with the goal of informing region-specific management strategies. A total of 340 fish, representing 17 species from 10 districts, were systematically collected from farms, hatcheries, nurseries, and markets. Specimens underwent phenotypic and biochemical characterization, followed by DNA extraction and quantification under stringent quality control protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) utilizing species-specific primers, including the 16S rRNA housekeeping gene, enabled sensitive detection and quantification of bacterial loads. Statistical analyses included one-way ANOVA to compare mean log10 copy numbers and Ct values across districts, fish species, and tissue types, with post hoc t-tests identifying significant differences. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and cluster analyses were employed to assess genetic similarity and diversity among 75 representative isolates. Regression analysis identified nutrient concentration as a significant predictor of bacterial growth (p = 0.0461), with optimal culture conditions determined at 1-2% nutrients, pH 6.5-7, and temperature 25-37°C. High bacterial loads were detected in gill tissues, with Edwardsiella ictaluri (Ct 19.8 ± 2.1) and Aeromonas hydrophila (Ct 21.4 ± 1.9) being most prevalent, and the highest E. ictaluri load (8.5 ± 0.3 log10 copies) observed in Pangasius hypophthalmus from Bagerhat (p < 0.001). The lowest pathogen prevalence was recorded in Magura district. RAPD analysis demonstrated significant genetic similarity among isolates from Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to Tetracycline but susceptibility to Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. These findings highlight pronounced spatial variation in pathogen prevalence, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance, emphasizing the critical need for integrated molecular diagnostics, targeted surveillance, and sustainable management practices to protect aquaculture health and productivity in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the application of Google Search Trends (GST) data as a tool for COVID-19 surveillance in Bangladesh. Using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach, it investigates how GST search can predict new COVID-19 cases. The findings show that GST can offer timely insights into public health responses. The results also show that GST search items can predict the outbreak before 1–2 weeks. While VAR analysis confirms the causal relationship between the GST terms and the new COVID-19 cases, this study also acknowledges the limitations of inappropriate regional data at the outset of any new pandemic. It also acknowledges the misinformation from GST can underestimate real time surveillance. Policymakers can use GST for real-time risk communication and informed decision during pandemic. The results also suggest the importance of infodemiology to integrate it into the public health system for disease surveillance as the country’s’ resources are constrained. This study highlights the contribution of infodemiology towards the enhancement of traditional methods and systems of surveillance, which is relevant both nationally and globally. GST offers a great opportunity for advancing digital epidemiology and innovation in public health, nonetheless obstacles rest in the way.

        "abstract": "In February-March 2024, an outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice with multiple fatalities was reported in Goalpara District, Assam, India. This study aimed to identify the etiological agents responsible for the outbreak to guide public health interventions. Clinical samples from 30 individuals were collected and analyzed using serological and molecular techniques. Serological testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), and Leptospira was performed using IgM ELISA kits. Leptospira DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for further analysis. The results revealed HAV IgM antibodies in 23.33 % of cases (7/30), while 40 % (12/30) tested positive for Leptospira-specific IgM by ELISA. Additionally, PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Leptospira DNA in 53.33 % of the urine samples (8/15). Notably, 16.67 % (5/30) of cases exhibited coinfection with both HAV and Leptospira spp., challenging the clinical outcome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-positive samples identified Leptospira wolffii (L. wolffii) as the causative agent, marking the first report of L. wolffii in human clinical samples from Northeastern India. Recently, L. wolffii, a member of the P2 subclade of Leptospira, has garnered attention due to its pathogenic potential. The findings along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of L. wolffii and its likely introduction into the region, via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent. This study highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and research to monitor emerging Leptospira strains, particularly L. wolffii, in both human and animal populations, to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health implications.",

        "abstract": "Mental health conditions are emerging concerns that were worsened by Covid-19, especially in developing countries. The pandemic instigated an increase in household stress particularly among migrant women living in urban slums due to overcrowding, increased caregiving burden, and intimate partner violence, resulting in deteriorating mental health. This study assessed the prevalence of mental health conditions and intimate partner violence during Covid-19 and also explored the pathways between pandemic-related household stress and mental health outcomes with the mediating role of crowding and intimate partner violence in the Bangladeshi urban slums. The cross-sectional survey was conducted among internal migrant women from five slums of Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems operated by International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Face-to-face interviews were conducted from August to October 2022 using a semi-structured questionnaire that had three validated screening tools to measure depression, anxiety and intimate partner violence. A path analysis using structural equation modelling with maximum likelihood methods was performed to understand the objectives. Among the total 405 participants, the majority of women (68.40%) were housewives and their husbands (46.43%), were engaged as daily wagers. A large portion of the women (38.77%) had only primary education and one-third of the surveyed women (36.5%) reported increased household stress due to Covid-19. About 71% of women experienced an event of intimate partner violence with reports of emotional (57.3%), physical (49.4%), and sexual violence (39.0%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 73.8% and 65.2%, respectively. The structural equation modelling path analysis revealed that household stress increased the likelihood of anxiety and depression. Moreover, household stress has a direct effect on anxiety, while it has an indirect effect on both anxiety and depression with these effects mediated by intimate partner violence. These novel baseline findings may support the relevant stakeholders to design further research and programmes to strengthen emergency preparedness for the women living in informal settlements of Urban Bangladesh. A rights-based approach, as has been shown effective elsewhere, may offer a strategy to enhance the overall well-being.",

        "abstract": "Several members of the Legionellaceae family are increasingly recognized as a causative agent of sporadic community-acquired atypical cases of pneumonia. Alarmingly high mortality and no effective antimicrobials necessitate accurate detection of this fastidious organism, specifically from the environment considering Legionella mostly transmit through contaminated water or moist soils. In this study, we have utilized a combination of molecular and culture based protocols to detect and characterize virulence genes in Legionella pneumophila from various water sources in Bangladesh. Out of 198 water samples, 28.8 % were PCR positive for Legionella spp. Among these, 43.9 % were non-pneumophila and 56.1 % were L. pneumophila. In terms of season and source, 21.4 % of the late autumn and 38.5 % of the tap water samples were predominantly positive for L. pneumophila. Our culture method demonstrated an 84.4 % recovery rate for L. pneumophila, of which 27 representative isolates were chosen for virulence characterization using 21 genes categorized into 7 groups. Group 1-6 genes responsible for a broad spectrum of virulence traits were majorly found within the isolates, however, group 7 responsible for severe human infections were comparatively less prevalent. Virulence gene profiling showed two isolates containing 19/21 genes were isolated during summer/late autumn from hot water/tap water. Statistical stacked plots found a significant association between group 7 virulence factors with summer and warm water isolates. Our findings necessitate heightened surveillance for this organism through incorporating routine water monitoring plans in similar environmental settings worldwide.",

The objective of this scoping review was to describe the current evidence regarding the surveillance of <i>V. cholerae</i> in wastewater and wastewater-impacted environmental waters (including drinking water). We conducted a comprehensive electronic search, updated to January 2025. Following duplicate screening, we identified 114 eligible studies. The studies evaluated early WES warning systems, monitored trends in ongoing outbreaks, and described serogroups and virulent strains of toxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> circulating in communities. Most studies were conducted in South-East Asia (44%), particularly India and Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic. A large proportion of studies detected <i>V. cholerae</i> subgroup O1 or O139, and numerous virulent strains such as <i>ctxA/B</i>. Studies were generally poorly reported, for example, inconsistent reporting on sample management, data reliability, and sampling frequency were common. WES has not been widely integrated into existing surveillance systems for real-time cholera monitoring. Our findings underscore the need for further clearly reported research to clarify the role of WES for early warning systems for cholera outbreaks, and to identify strategies that may optimise WES implementation for public health benefit.",

New evidence has emerged and the ways in which the vaccines are used have changed. We aimed to provide an updated synthesis of evidence on protection conferred by kOCV. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search procedure as a previous systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported estimates of protection conferred by kOCVs against medically attended, confirmed cholera. Eligible studies in English, French, Spanish, or Chinese published up until March 8, 2024, including those identified in the previous review, were included. Data on efficacy and effectiveness were extracted, as were the number of doses, duration of follow-up, and age group. Efficacy and effectiveness estimates were summarised separately using random-effect models to estimate protection by time since vaccination; meta-regression models were used to estimate protection, by dose, as a function of time since vaccination. This updated study is registered along with the original review with PROSPERO (CRD42016048232). We identified 8205 records published online up until March 8, 2024, including 6224 articles from the previous review and 1981 articles from our new search (after Jan 1, 2016). Of these, 53 were eligible for full-text review. Five RCTs and ten observational studies from 23 publications were included. Average two-dose efficacy 12 months after vaccination was 55% (95% CI 46-62), declining to 44% (25-59) 48 months after vaccination. Average two-dose effectiveness was 69% (58-78) 12 months after vaccination, declining to 47% (9-70) 48 months after vaccination. Only one RCT assessed one-dose efficacy and found sustained protection for 24 months (57% [42-69]) among those 5 years and older with no significant protection in younger children. Average one-dose effectiveness 12 months after vaccination was 60% (51-68) and after 24 months was 47% (34-58). Using age group-specific meta-analysis, we found that average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years was half that of older individuals. Two doses of kOCV provide protection against medically attended cholera for at least 4 years after vaccination. One dose of kOCV provides protection for at least 2 years after vaccination, but wanes faster than that of two doses. Children younger than 5 years are less protected by kOCVs than those aged 5 years and older, regardless of the number of doses received. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Understanding the distribution and prevalence of different Norovirus genotypes is crucial for public health surveillance and intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review of Norovirus genotypes in Asia from 2000 to 2023. The review adhered to PRISMA Guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42024572647). We extracted data on the prevalence of 22 genotypes and their genetic variations over time. The review highlighted Norovirus GII.4 as highly prevalent across Asia, particularly in India, Taiwan, Vietnam, and China. GII.2 dominated Indonesia, GII.3 prevailed in Malaysia, Russia, and Bangladesh, GII.7 in Bangladesh, and GII.17 in China, Taiwan, and Nepal, with notable epidemiological shifts between 2012 and 2016 and GII.4 resurgence from 2017. The study highlights the dynamic nature of Norovirus genotypic distribution in Asia, with both persistent dominance of certain genotypes and notable regional variations. The cyclic patterns of genotype prevalence, particularly the shifts between GII.4 and GII.17, underline the need for ongoing genotypic surveillance to inform targeted public health responses.

        "abstract": "Endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are common causes of mild or asymptomatic respiratory infections in children but are considered rare causes of death. We evaluated pediatric deaths from January 2017 through December 2022. A panel of experts determined the cause of death (CoD) by reviewing available data, including pathological and molecular findings from minimally invasive tissue sampling (lung tissues, blood, CSF, and nasopharyngeal swabs), clinical records, and verbal autopsies. Endemic HCoV were detected in the respiratory samples of 3 % (n = 86/3357) of enrolled decedents: 1 % (n = 12/2043) of neonates, 5 % (n = 35/681) of infants and 6 % (n = 39/633) of children deaths. However, HCoVs were attributed as the CoD in only two cases - both involving young infants with underlying birth defects and severe wasting, who succumbed to polymicrobial hospital-acquired infections involving HCoV-OC43, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Amongst the remaining 84 decedents in whom an HCoV was detected, 82 % (n = 69/84; median Ct of 25.34; range: 15.28-36.17) were deaths attributed to other infections, including 54 % (n = 32/69; median Ct of 23.86; range: 15.28-35.2) with lower respiratory infections determined to be the CoD. The bulk of these deaths (96 %, n = 66/69) were attributed to other pathogens - Plasmodium falciparum (27 %, n = 19/69), K. pneumoniae (23 %, n = 16/69), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 %, n = 14/69), Escherichia coli (16 %, n = 11/69) and Cytomegalovirus (10 %, n = 7/69). Although endemic HCoV was identified in children who died of respiratory infections, it was rarely attributed to being in the CoD. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explore the potential role of HCoVs in LRTI pathogenesis and their impact on facilitating more pathogenic infections.",

We then performed a generalised linear regression model to understand country-level determinants of dengue-related mortality. In 2024, 14.1 million dengue cases were reported globally, surpassing the historic milestone of 7 million observed in 2023. This figure represents a twofold increase compared to 2023 and a 12-fold rise compared to 2014 (n=1,206,644). In 2024, 9,508 dengue-related deaths were recorded, resulting in a global case-fatality rate of 0.07%. In the regression analysis, countries in the Southern hemisphere (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 5.95, 95% CI: 4.19-8.46), aged population (IRR 1.04, CI: 1.01-1.07), and mean annual temperature (IRR 1.21, CI: 1.16-1.26) were significantly associated with higher dengue-related mortality per million population. The ongoing dengue outbreak underscores the urgent need for global investment in DENV research, vaccine development, vector control, and therapeutic strategies. We urge the inclusion of DENV in the WHO's Research and Development Priority Disease list to address this growing global health threat.",

        "title": "Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies for Newly Detected Mysterious Dinga Dinga Virus Infection in Africa: A Narrative Review.",
        "abstract": "The Dinga Dinga Virus (DDV) has emerged as a mysterious disease gripping women in Uganda, raising alarm due to its unusual and distressing \"dancing\" like symptoms. These symptoms, characterized by involuntary movements resembling dance, suggest possible neurological involvement, though the exact pathogen remains unidentified. The causative agent for DDV is still unknown. We hypothesized that the possible microorganism could be a virus, bacteria, or vector-borne origin. Therefore, comprehensive research is urgently needed to confirm its cause. We performed a comprehensive literature search in Scopus and Web of Science related to the different outbreaks of viruses. We collected relevant information from appropriate articles for this review. The unique representation of the disease is spreading rapidly in localized areas that have the potential to escalate into a broader public health crisis. Preventive measures focused on symptom monitoring, public awareness, and isolation of suspected cases to limit transmission. Authorities emphasize hygiene practices, using personal protective equipment (PPE), and early reporting to manage the outbreak effectively. Simultaneously, global health organizations are being called to collaborate on diagnostic development, therapeutic interventions, and vaccine research. The disproportionate impact on women has brought social and cultural dynamics into the spotlight, as stigma and misinformation exacerbate the outbreak's challenges. Immediate and long-term strategies must address these aspects by strengthening healthcare infrastructure and enhancing disease surveillance systems. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the DDV is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases. Proactive, science-driven efforts are critical to understanding and mitigating this enigmatic disease, ensuring it does not escalate into another global health crisis.",

Since then, incursions of this lineage have occurred in the Middle East, beyond its usual epidemiological distribution. Using sequence data derived from field cases, this paper reconstructs the evolutionary history of the O/ME-SA/SA-2018 lineage, presents vaccine matching data for six commercially available FMD vaccines, and describes a novel lineage-specific RT-PCR assay which can be used to help detect field cases due this emerging lineage.

        "abstract": "Most of the 2.3 million annual neonatal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis being the leading causes of neonatal mortality. Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines.",

Since 2018, the Electronic Data Tracking with Population-Based Cervical and Breast Cancer Screening Program (EPCBCSP) has been implemented nationwide across 601 health centers, utilizing Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) for CC screening. However, the system had not been evaluated until now. This study aims to assess the performance of EPCBCSP and identify its strengths and challenges. We evaluated EPCBCSP using the updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) in 2023. Data were collected from central level stakeholders and from stakeholders at one colposcopy and one VIA center in each of four selected divisions of Bangladesh. Interviews with 42 stakeholders assessed simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, stability and usefulness attributes. Data quality was assessed by surveillance data review. Percentage scores were calculated and ranked as follows: excellent (≥ 90%), Very good (≥ 80%- < 90%.), good (≥60%- < 80%), average (≥50%- < 60%) and poor (≤50%).The overall system performance was rated as good (score:77.20%). The system's simplicity (score: 91.61%) and usefulness (score:91.61%) were ranked as \"excellent\". The acceptability (score: 85.29%) was ranked as \"very good and flexibility (score:71.90%) was rated as \"good\". Stability (percentage score: 53.25%) was considered average. Furthermore, data quality was assessed as average based on missing values (13.11%.) Electronic data tracking system, instant test report availability and \"see and treat\" policies were identified as strengths by stakeholders, while dedicated staff shortages and motivating participants were main challenges. The evaluation EPCBCSP in Bangladesh indicates overall good performance, excelling in simplicity and usefulness. However, improvements are needed in stability and data quality. Strengthening surveillance efforts addressing shortages of dedicated staff and participant motivation will further enhance the effectiveness of the program, crucial for reducing CC burden.",

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health concern. Limited data have shown unusually high HCV seroprevalence among Rohingya refugees residing in camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HCV seropositivity and active infection and identify risk factors to inform the HCV response. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 10 and June 14, 2023, in adult (≥18 years) residents of seven camps in Cox's Bazar. Households were selected by simple random geosampling and one participant per household was selected at random. Participants were screened for HCV antibodies with a rapid finger prick blood test and, if seropositive, venous samples were tested for HCV viral load. A structured questionnaire collected information about demographics, HCV knowledge, and exposure risks. Survey-adjusted prevalence estimates of HCV seropositivity and active infection were generated by applying sampling weights. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity were identified using univariable and multivariable current status analysis and those associated with active infection via logistic regression. The survey included 641 participants, of whom 425 (66%) were women and for whom the median age was 34 years (IQR 28-46). 191 individuals tested positive for HCV antibodies. 187 of these individuals were tested for active infection and 124 had a detectable HCV viral load. The survey-adjusted prevalence estimate of HCV seropositivity was 30·4% (95% CI 26·5-34·5), and that of active infection 19·8% (95% CI 16·5-23·4). Current status analysis identified higher odds of HCV seropositivity among individuals reporting medical injection(s) (adjusted odds ratio 1·8 [95% CI 1·2-2·8]) or surgery (5·9 [1·9-18·4]), and among women (2·1 [1·3-3·2]). 328 (51%) of 641 participants had never heard of hepatitis C. Five (4%) of 124 participants with HCV viraemia reported previous HCV treatment. There is a substantial burden of active HCV infection among adult Rohingya camp residents, highlighting the urgent need to scale up testing and treatment capacities. The survey had constraints in identifying risk factors and could not provide data on HCV incidence. Reassessing infection prevalence after mass interventions and prospective surveillance are recommended to monitor ongoing transmission. A well-concerted multi-stakeholder action plan is needed to prevent future large-scale burden of severe liver disease and halt ongoing transmission. Médecins Sans Frontières.",

        "abstract": "Wars have devastating effects on all the components of the One Health approach: humans, animals, and ecosystems. Wars and the resulting migratory waves massively disrupt normal animal health services and surveillance. Among other consequences, they adversely impact the early detection, prevention, and control of animal diseases. Uncontrolled movement of animals or their undisposed carcasses, the destruction of wildlife habitats, and the increased interface between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals contribute to uncontrolled transmission and spread of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. In the last millennium, zoonotic diseases such as the \"Black Death\" were triggered by devastating wars and led to the deaths of a large fraction of the human population. However, also recent and ongoing wars carry the risk of an uncontrollable increase in zoonotic diseases. The most significant zoonotic diseases reported during the recent wars are African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, rabies, leptospirosis, and brucellosis, as well as foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases. Indeed, alarming rates of infections by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> go along with wars, as seen in the current Ukraine-Russia conflict. Considering human migration, foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases are key health threats for refugees due to the consumption of unsafe food, lack of safe water, and disruption of the water supply and sanitation system. This review summarizes the potential factors and some data associated with the increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence and transmission during recent and ongoing conflicts.",

Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and a registered protocol, online searches were conducted in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on August 6, 2023, to retrieve articles from the South Asian countries without restrictions on hosts or timeframe. Two authors independently reviewed, extracted data, and assessed quality based on predefined criteria, which were then evaluated and compiled into a single document and analyzed. The review identified 112 articles published between 1954 and 2023. Among humans, the estimated pooled seroprevalence (EPSP) was 9.2%, and the estimated pooled carrier prevalence (EPCP) was 6.2%. Ruminant herd-level EPSP and EPCP were 77.3% and 74.6%, and at the individual level, were 11.9% and 5.3%, respectively. Seroprevalence was significantly influenced by country, tick infestation, reproductive disorders, age, and body condition of ruminants. Nonruminant mammals, such as dogs (16.8%), horses (6.0%), pigs (3.9%), and rodents (14.8%), were also seropositive. Several avian and reptile species showed EPSP rates of 14.5% and 29.2%, respectively. Bacterial DNA was detected in ticks and soil samples, with EPCP of 1.0% and 3.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H9N2 has been enzootic in Bangladeshi poultry since 2006. H9N2 outbreaks can decrease egg production and growth and pose a risk to human health. The role of avian hosts in the persistence, evolution, and dispersion of H9N2 is poorly understood in Bangladesh. Hence, this study unveils the intricate role of major host species in virus maintenance and evolution and the temporal and seasonal patterns of H9N2 in Bangladesh from 2006 to 2023. Multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that the circulation of H9N2 in different species and interfaces is significantly influenced by the seasons. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of H9N2 sequences in Bangladesh revealed two distinct lineages: G1 and Eurasian. The G1 lineage split into two clusters, coexisting until 2019, at which point only one cluster persisted. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis of G1 lineage unveiled frequent bidirectional viral transitions among ducks, chickens, and quails. Chickens might be a pivotal source of H9N2 in Bangladesh, with a higher number of viral transitions from chickens to ducks and quails. Quails appear to acquire most of their viral transitions from chickens rather than ducks, suggesting that quail epizootics are primarily triggered by spillover events from chickens. Our results suggest viral circulation in commercial chickens despite vaccination. The vaccination approach should be revised, assess vaccine efficacy, and extension of vaccination to backyard chickens and quails.",

World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) has established different zones worldwide to control such contagious diseases as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Controlling FMD is difficult because of the complicated connection between FMD risk factors, and the deficits of surveillance activities in countries. We used an ecological niche model (ENM) that accounts for the under-reporting of outbreaks to determine FMD risk and risk factors in South Asian countries India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Centered on known outbreak information, we predicted high-risk areas using similar regional ecological features. Using a multi-algorithm machine-learning ensemble that includes random forest, support vector, and gradient boosting, 15 predictive variables (i.e., livestock densities, land cover, and climate), 660 FMD outbreaks from 13 years (2009-2022) in the region including the outbreaks from India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka we identified that Sri Lanka and Bangladesh appeared to have low to medium outbreak risk in the range of 0.04 to 0.55. India was used to fit the model. The machine learning models demonstrated high predictive performance (accuracy >0.87) through cross-validation. Production systems, isothermality, cattle density (per Km2), and mean diurnal range was identified as the most important predictors of FMD outbreaks. These models help to determine FMD low-risk areas to minimize FMD surveillance activities and high-risk areas to focus on performing additional confirmatory testing, and improve surveillance in a regional context.",

Risk factors such as diabetes contribute to a worse prognosis if not treated with appropriate antibiotics during the course of management. This case report describes a diabetic melioidosis case with a rare presentation of venous thrombosis of the lower limb and a successful course of treatment. The patient was a 48-year-old Bangladeshi male who was admitted with gradually increasing left knee pain and intermittent high-grade fever for 7 days. On examination, he had a palpable spleen, high body temperature (102 °F), and pitting edema in the left lower limb during admission. He was treated with empiric meropenem on admission considering his serious illness. Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb revealed superficial venous thrombosis and thrombophlebitis involving the long saphenous vein and superficial veins of saphenous territory below the knee. The patient was enrolled as an eligible case in a research study called the Acute Febrile Illness study. Blood culture confirmed the diagnosis as melioidosis. Doxycycline was added to his treatment regimen when the research study team informed the treating physician at the hospital about the diagnosis of melioidosis. He was discharged with cotrimoxazole, which was advised to be taken for 3 months. This case report shows us the lack of diagnostics to detect melioidosis in hospital settings in Bangladesh. The successful treatment outcome proved the importance of routine surveillance for rare or unusual diseases, in addition to endemic pathogens. In addition, training is essential to improve knowledge and raise awareness among clinicians about the clinical diagnosis and management of melioidosis.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in many resource-poor countries. Despite an available vaccine, data on HEV-associated mortality are scarce, hindering informed decisions. This study aims to estimate the population-based rate of HEV-specific mortality in Bangladesh. During December 2014 to September 2017, we conducted surveillance in 6 tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Patients aged ≥14 years with acute jaundice were recruited, tested for IgM anti-HEV, and followed up postdischarge. A mortality survey in the hospital catchment areas identified deaths associated with acute jaundice, including maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths delivered by a mother with acute jaundice during pregnancy, as confirmed by 2 independent physicians reviewing verbal autopsy data. Out of 1925 patients with acute jaundice enrolled in the surveillance hospitals, 302 died, with 28 (9%) testing positive for IgM anti-HEV. In the hospital catchment areas, the team identified 587 jaundice-associated deaths, including 25 maternal deaths. Combining hospital-based surveillance and mortality survey data, the study estimated 986 (95% CI, 599-1338) HEV-associated deaths annually among individuals aged ≥14 years in Bangladesh, including 163 (95% CI, 57-395) maternal deaths. Additionally, 279 (95% CI, 101-664) stillbirths and 780 (95% CI, 365-1297) neonatal deaths were attributed to HEV infection annually. Prior Global Burden of Disease studies presented wildly varying modeling estimates of HEV-associated annual deaths, ranging from 50 000 in 2013 to 1932 in 2019. This study is the first to directly measure population-based estimates of mortality in Bangladesh, which can be used to determine the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis E vaccination and other interventions.",

        "abstract": "There is paucity of information on the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection as a cause of stillbirths or childhood deaths in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated attribution of CMV-disease in the causal pathway to stillbirths and deaths in children <5 years of age in seven LMICs participating in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network. We analyzed stillbirths and decedents enrolled between December 2016 and July 2023. Deaths were investigated using post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling with histopathology and molecular diagnostic investigations of tissues and body fluids, along with review of clinical records. Multi-disciplinary expert panels reviewed findings and reported on the causal pathway to death. CMV was detected in 19.5%(1140/5841) of all evaluated deaths, including 5.0% (111/2204), 6.2% (139/2229), 41.2% (107/260), 68.1%(323/474) and 68.2%(460/674) of stillbirths, neonates (deaths 0-<28 days postnatal), young infants (28-<90 days), older infants (90-<365 days) and children (12-<60 months), respectively. CMV-disease was attributed in the causal pathway to death in 0.9%(20/2204) of stillbirths, 0.8%(17/2229) of neonates, 13.1% (34/260) of young infants, 9.7%(46/474) of older infants and 3.3%(22/674) of children. Decedents with CMV-disease compared with those without CMV-disease in the causal pathway, were more likely to have severe microcephaly (38.2% vs. 21.1%; aOR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.6) and HIV-infected (36.9% vs. 6.2%; aOR: 10.9, 95%CI: 6.5-18.5). CMV-disease is an important contributor to deaths during infancy and childhood and is often associated with severe microcephaly and HIV-infection. Improving management of CMV in HIV-infected children and a vaccine to prevent CMV are needed interventions.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "abstract": "Digitalisation of death documentation in Bangladesh's graveyards is crucial for accurate mortality data and public health planning. Additionally, studying the usability, technology acceptance, and implementation aspects of the digital death record-keeping system, an innovative intervention that has not been previously explored, ensures the effectiveness, user adoption, and long-term sustainability. We designed, implemented, and evaluated a digital mortality surveillance system in graveyards in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. The study was conducted in six graveyards of the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC). First, we conducted formative research to understand the documentation process of the graveyard record-keeping and inform architecture for a digital record-keeping system. We then developed a digital record-keeping system for graveyard. A cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative study was conducted among web and app users, and graveyard managers and death records keepers. A total of 200 app and web users and 14 record-keepers and managers participated. App and web users had high levels of system usability (88%) and found them easy to use (100%) and well-integrated (100%), with disagreement on complexity (100%), inconsistency (100%), and technical support needs (100%). These users had high technology acceptance and agreed the tools help accomplish tasks quickly (100%), improve performance (100%), and were easy to learn (100%). Digital death record-keepers reported using the system frequently (71%) but found it somewhat complex (14%) and not consistently easy to use (28%), with some reported that the systems were well integration (50%) and easy to learn (43%). While technology acceptance varied, death record keepers generally agreed that the system helps with quick task completion (50%) and performance improvement (57%), increase productivity (43%), enhance effectiveness (57%), and easy to use (50%). The digital death record-keeping system received mixed reactions, with younger, tech-savvy operators being optimistic, while older supervisors were sceptical and uncomfortable with technology. Additionally, the system was found to be feasible to an extent, particularly by data entry operators and graveyard managers. The digital death record-keeping system was generally well-received by app and web users for its usability and integration, though graveyard supervisor found it somewhat complex, with mixed reactions based on tech-savviness; overall, the system was deemed feasible and sustainable.",

        "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that can lead to severe pregnancy outcomes. This study reports the clinical and genomic characteristics of a Listeria-mediated stillbirth identified in January 2022 through the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) project in Bangladesh. The Lm-BD-CHAMPS-01 isolate was recovered from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a male stillborn. Maternal history, clinical, and demographic data were collected by the CHAMPS surveillance platform. An expert panel evaluated all reports to determine the role of L. monocytogenes infection in the causal chain of stillbirth. Genomic characterization included multilocus sequence typing (MLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST), serotyping, and the presence or absence of virulence genes. Genetic divergence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to determine the relationship with other reported isolates globally. The isolate Lm-BD-CHAMPS-01 was identified as a novel cgMLST CT11424. It belonged to ST 308, Serotype 4b, Clonal Complex 1, and Phylogenetic Lineage 1. Key L. monocytogenes virulence genes facilitating the crossing of the placental barrier, including full-length inlA, LIPI-1, and LIPI-3, were detected. The isolate was closely related to clinical L. monocytogenes isolates, as determined by GrapeTree based on cgMLST. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis found Lm-BD-CHAMPS-01 to be the most distant from other CC1 isolates in the database. Possible sources of infection included the consumption of contaminated raw vegetables or exposure to pigeons. This is the first genome sequence of clinical L. monocytogenes from Bangladesh, which also caused stillbirth. Rural healthcare professionals should be aware of L. monocytogenes infection risks during pregnancy. Pregnant women should be counseled on the dangers of exposure to animals or birds and consumption of potentially contaminated raw food to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes due to L. monocytogenes infection.",

The genetic diversity of IBV, driven by mutations, recombination and deletions, has led to the emergence of numerous serotypes and genotypes, complicating both diagnosis and control measures. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are essential for effective disease management and minimizing economic losses. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as PCR, virus isolation, and serological assays, are hindered by limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time. In contrast, innovative biosensor platforms employing advanced detection mechanisms-including electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric sensors-offer a transformative solution. These technologies provide portable, highly sensitive, and rapid diagnostic platforms for IBV detection. Beyond addressing the challenges of conventional methods, these biosensor-based approaches facilitate real-time monitoring and enhance disease surveillance.

        "abstract": "During the 2023-dengue outbreak in Bangladesh, a diagnostic evaluation study was conducted to investigate concurrent Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) transmission in Dhaka in 2023. The study explored to simultaneously detect the presence of ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV while considering relevant clinical and epidemiological risk factors, using a real-time multiplex RT-PCR system. Following this, it was planned to sequence the selected samples to identify genetic variations of the ZIKV infections within the population. This study was designed as a diagnostic evaluation, where participants meeting the inclusion criteria were prospectively recruited with written informed consent. A total of 399 febrile individuals were screened, with 185 meeting the inclusion criteria of having a fever onset within 2-5 days, along with one of the following clinical features, e.g. headache, myalgia, arthralgia or bone pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and 152 undergoing real-time RT-PCR testing. Five ZIKV-positive cases were identified, including one DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the ZIKV strains were part of the Asian lineage, closely related to Cambodian and Chinese strains from 2019. All ZIKV-positive cases were male, residing within a one-kilometer radius, with no prior travel history, suggesting community-level transmission. This study marks the first identification of ZIKV in Dhaka city and the first report of ZIKV-DENV co-infection in Bangladesh that highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by the symptomatic similarities between ZIKV and other arboviruses and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and public health interventions to mitigate the spread and impact of ZIKV in dengue-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Mpox, formerly referred to as monkeypox, is a viral disease endemic to central Africa, resulting from the monkeypox virus (MPXV). This study provides a current overview of the Mpox epidemic as of 2024, emphasizing significant developments and epidemiological trends. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially designated a clade Ⅱb outbreak as a global health emergency in May 2022, which was subsequently managed through vaccination and public health interventions by May 2023. In September 2023, a resurgence of cladeⅠ in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) resulted in a 160 % increase in cases by 2024. The WHO declared this increase a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in August 2024. The outbreak timeline indicates substantial rises in cases and fatalities, especially among children under 15 in the DRC. Regional analysis reveals that the European Region initially recorded the highest incidence of cases and fatalities. In contrast, regions including African Region (AFRO), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), South-East Asia Region (SEARO), and Western Pacific Region (WPRO) exhibited a rise in cases, indicating a potential spread or resurgence of the health event. Gender disparities in transmission pathways were apparent, with males exhibiting higher case numbers, particularly via person-to-person contact. The research highlights the necessity of ongoing surveillance, global collaboration, and focused public health measures. The discourse addresses obstacles in vaccine distribution and the necessity for emergency use authorizations, highlighting the imperativeness for adaptive strategies in public health management.

        "abstract": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) are vector-borne orbiviruses that pose an emerging threat to livestock, including cattle and sheep. This review summarizes the global distribution, genetic diversity, and key factors driving their spread along with the existing knowledge gaps and recommendations to mitigate their impact. Both viruses cause hemorrhagic disease in susceptible ruminants and are commonly reported in tropical and subtropical regions including North America, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and some parts of Europe. The geographical distribution of these viruses, encompassing 27 BTV and 7 EHDV serotypes, has shifted, particularly with the recent invasion of BTV-3, 4, and 8 and EHDV-8 serotypes in Europe. Several factors contribute to the recent spread of these viruses such as the distribution of virulent strains by the movement of temperature-dependent <i>Culicoides</i> vectors into new areas due to rapid climate change, the reassortment of viral strains during mixed infections, and unrestricted global trade. These diseases cause significant economic impacts including morbidity, mortality, reduced production, high management costs, and the disruption of international trade. Effective prevention and control strategies are paramount and rely on vaccination, vector control using insecticides, and the destruction of breeding sites, husbandry practices including the isolation and quarantine of infected hosts, restriction of animal movement, prompt diagnosis and identification of circulating strains, and effective surveillance and monitoring plans such as the pre-export and post-import screening of semen used for artificial insemination. However, challenges remain with intercontinental virus spread, live vaccines, and the failure of inactivated vaccines to produce protective immunity against dissimilar strains. Significant knowledge gaps highlight the need for a better scientific understanding and a strategic plan to ensure healthy livestock and global food security.",

        "abstract": "There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230). 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success. Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

        "abstract": "This population-based, nationally representative cross-sectional study assessed the daily salt consumption status and its associated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors using weighted data from the STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance conducted in 2018 in Bangladesh. It included a non-institutionalized adults' population of 6189 men and women aged 18-69 years. Their daily salt consumption was estimated using the spot urine sodium concentration following the Tanaka equation and reported according to the standard nomenclature proposed by the World Hypertension League and partner organizations involved in dietary salt reduction. Out of a total of 6189 participants, 2.4% consumed the recommended amount of salt (<5 g/day), 67.8% consumed a high amount of salt (≥5-10 g/day), 27.2% consumed a very high amount of salt (>10-15 g/day), and 2.6% consumed an extremely high amount of salt (>15 g/day). In univariate analysis, a higher than recommended level of salt intake (≥5 g/day) was significantly prevalent among rural residents (high = 78.4%, very-high = 81.6%, extremely-high = 84.9%, p = 0.01), literates (high = 51.6%, very-high = 57.9%, extremely-high = 59.1%, p = 0.02), newly diagnosed hypertension (high = 20.6%, very-high = 23.6%, extremely-high = 24.1%, p = 0.008), and overweight/obese (high = 25.9%, very-high = 33.3%, extremely-high = 29.8%, p = 0.000). Similarly, in ordinal logistic regression analysis, the categories of daily salt consumption showed a significant association with rural residence (OR: 1.300, CI: 1.109-1.524, p = 0.001), literates (OR: 0.777, CI: 0.671-0.900, p = 0.001), newly diagnosed hypertension (OR: 1.204, CI: 1.022-1.419, p = 0.026), and overweight/obesity (OR: 1.353, CI: 1.145-1.598, p = 0.000). The current national pattern of salt consumption in Bangladesh may help reconstruct the salt reduction strategy considering the associated risk factors.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge in mitigating waterborne diseases risk exacerbated by climate change. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of these diseases at the district level remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern and identifying the best tree-based ML models for determining the meteorological factors associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh. This study used district-level reported cases of waterborne diseases (cholera, amoebiasis, typhoid and hepatitis A) obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) sourced from NASA for the period spanning 2017 to 2020. Exploratory spatial analysis, spatial regression and tree-based machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 and 2020, Bangladesh reported 73, 606 cholera, 38, 472 typhoid, 2, 510 hepatitis A and 1, 643 amoebiasis disease cases. Among the waterborne diseases cholera showed higher incidence rates in Chapai-Nawabganj (456.23), Brahmanbaria (417.44), Faridpur (225.07), Nilphamari (188.62) and Pirojpur (171.62) districts. The spatial regression model identified mean temperature (β = 12.16, s.e: 3.91) as the significant risk factor of waterborne diseases. The optimal XGBoost model highlighted mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation as determinants associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2020. The findings from the study, incorporating the One Health perspective, provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat waterborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries. Precautionary measures and intensified surveillance need to be implemented in certain high-risk districts for waterborne diseases across the country.",

        "abstract": "Despite global initiatives to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies by 2030, the Arabian Peninsula faces challenges due to insufficient data. This review addresses the current rabies situation and knowledge gaps in the region and proposes One Health interventions. Employing a mixed-method approach combining scoping and systematic review, the study commenced with a Delphi discussion to identify knowledge gaps and set objectives. The literature search encompassed published articles and grey literature. The spatial and temporal distribution of rabies was analysed, alongside quantitative meta-analyses to assess prevalence. Rabies virus gene sequences from the NCBI database were examined for reservoir hosts and evolutionary patterns. The final Delphi discussion with experts focused on addressing knowledge gaps and formulating One Health interventions. The first reported human rabies case in this region occurred in Saudi Arabia in 1980. Yemen reported the highest number of cases (439), followed by Iraq (249), Saudi Arabia (91), Jordan (14), and Oman (9). Fox bites accounted for the most cases (47.4%), followed by dog (36.8%) and wild animal (15.8%) bites. The virus was detected in at least 21 animal species. Phylogenetic analysis detected a single strain with two clades, with foxes being the primary virus reservoir. However, the experts expressed scepticism about the accuracy of rabies reports in scientific literature. To achieve the 2030 goal of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies, a stepwise approach towards rabies elimination assessment is crucial in the region. Enhanced surveillance, awareness campaigns, and access to post exposure prophylaxis are essential to address the disease burden.",

        "abstract": "Rapid human movement plays a crucial role in the spatial dissemination of the dengue virus. Nevertheless, robust quantification of this relationship using both spatial and temporal models remains necessary. This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue transmission under various human movement contexts. We obtained district-wise aggregated dengue incidence data from the Management Information System, Directorate General of Health Services of Bangladesh. The stringency index (SI), along with eight individual policy measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker database) and six mobility indices (as measured by Google's Community Mobility Reports) were obtained as human movement indicators. A multi-step correlative modelling approach, including various spatial and temporal models, was utilized to explore the associations of dengue incidence with the SI, fourteen human movement indices and the Eid festival. The global Moran's I indicated significant spatial autocorrelation in dengue incidence during the pre-pandemic (Moran's I: 0.14, P < 0.05) and post-pandemic periods (Moran's I: 0.42, P < 0.01), while the pandemic period (2020-2022) showed weaker, non-significant spatial clustering (Moran's I: 0.07, P > 0.05). Following the pandemic, we identified the emergence of new dengue hotspots. We found a strong negative relationship between monthly dengue incidence and the SI (r<sub>spearman</sub>: - 0.62, P < 0.01). Through the selection of an optimal Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we observed that the closure of public transport (β = - 1.66, P < 0.10) and restrictions on internal movement (β = - 2.13, P < 0.10) were associated with the reduction of dengue incidence. Additionally, observed cases were substantially lower than predicted cases during the period from 2020 to 2022. By utilising additional time-series models, we were able to identify in 2023 a rise in dengue incidence associated with the Eid festival intervention, even after adjusting for important climate variables. Overall, rapid human movement was found to be associated with increased dengue transmission in Bangladesh. Consequently, the implemention of effective mosquito control interventions prior to large festival periods is necessary for preventing the spread of the disease nationwide. We emphasize the necessity for developing advanced surveillance and monitoring networks to track real-time human movement patterns and dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) that are ten-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) became available in 2010. We evaluated their global impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in all ages. Serotype-specific IPD cases and population denominators were obtained directly from surveillance sites using PCV10 or PCV13 in their national immunisation programmes and with a primary series uptake of at least 50%. Annual incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated comparing the incidence before any PCV with each year post-PCV10 or post-PCV13 introduction using Bayesian multi-level, mixed-effects Poisson regressions, by site and age group. All site-weighted average IRRs were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression, stratified by product and previous seven-valent PCV (PCV7) effect (none, moderate, or substantial). Analyses included 32 PCV13 sites (488 758 cases) and 15 PCV10 sites (46 386 cases) in 30 countries, primarily high income (39 sites), using booster dose schedules (41 sites). By 6 years after PCV10 or PCV13 introduction, IPD due to PCV10-type serotypes and PCV10-related serotype 6A declined substantially for both products (age <5 years: 83-99% decline; ≥65 years: 54-96% decline). PCV7-related serotype 19A increases before PCV10 or PCV13 introduction were reversed at PCV13 sites (age <5 years: 61-79% decline relative to before any PCV; age ≥65 years: 7-26% decline) but increased at PCV10 sites (age <5 years: 1·6-2·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 3·6-4·9-fold). Serotype 3 IRRs had no consistent trends for either product or age group. Non-PCV13-type IPD increased similarly for both products (age <5 years: 2·3-3·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 1·7-2·3-fold). Despite different serotype 19A trends, all-serotype IPD declined similarly between products among children younger than 5 years (58-74%); among adults aged 65 years or older, declines were greater at PCV13 (25-29%) than PCV10 (4-14%) sites, but other differences between sites precluded attribution to product. Long-term use of PCV10 or PCV13 reduced IPD substantially in young children and more moderately in older ages. Non-vaccine-type serotypes increased approximately two-fold to three-fold by 6 years after introduction of PCV10 or PCV13. Continuing serotype 19A increases at PCV10 sites and declines at PCV13 sites suggest that PCV13 use would further reduce IPD at PCV10 sites.

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the potential for a severe international epidemic and introduced the term \"Disease X\" to classify pathogens that not yet identified. The Nipah virus (NiV) is highly dangerous due to its zoonotic nature, high mortality rate, and ability to cause severe clinical symptoms in humans. In this review, we gather the latest information on the NiV and its potential to become a significant candidate for Disease X. We performed a thorough review of articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using appropriate MeSH terms and keywords. Studies reported NiV infection were considered for this review. The NiV exhibits different epidemiological patterns in different countries that calls for customized prevention and control strategies. Genetic analysis highlights NiV's ability to mutate that alters possible treatment options. Transmission typically involves bats as the primary reservoir, with humans becoming infected either through intermediate hosts or food. This shows NiV's complex nature, including its ability to reach the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve. Promising treatment options, such as monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and ongoing vaccine research, provide hope. However, the virus's adaptability, human-to-human transmission, and the lack of specific antiviral therapy raise concerns about its potential to cause a global pandemic. The interconnection between animals, humans, and the environment stresses the need for a One Health approach to tackle emerging infectious disease by NiV. Global collaboration, surveillance, and research investments are imperative for the preparation of future pandemics.

        "abstract": "The rising incidences of myocardial infarction (MI), often affecting individuals without traditional risk factors, highlight the urgent need for improved early detection using personal health data. However, health surveys and electronic health records (EHRs) frequently suffer from class imbalances, leading to prediction biases and differences between specificity and sensitivity, which hinder reliable model development despite the valuable insights contained in these datasets. To address this, we have introduced a novel approach to enhance MI risk prediction using self-reported attributes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset. Our approach incorporates three innovative techniques: the Dual-Path Artificial Neural Network (DP-ANN) to mitigate biased decision making across imbalanced datasets, the Triple Criteria Selection (TCS) for unbiased feature selection, and Minority Weighted Sampling (MWS) to tackle challenges of uncontrolled minority class sampling. These methods collectively enhance MI prediction and feature relevance. The DP-ANN model has achieved balanced performance, with an average specificity of 80%, sensitivity of 82%, and AUC-ROC of 89.5%, improving imbalance variance by approximately 14.96% compared to prior studies. By outperforming other models across four heavily imbalanced datasets, our approach demonstrates robustness and generalizability. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis has revealed key predictors and risk factors for MI, such as coronary heart disease and bronchitis in females, and stroke among individuals aged 35-54. In conclusion, our study provides a robust model for healthcare professionals to assess MI risk through targeted factors, promoting early detection and potentially improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Human astroviruses (HAstVs) were examined in 1625 stool samples collected from outpatient children with diarrhea who visited clinics in 4-6 prefectures in Japan. The study was conducted over a period of 4 years from July 2018 to June 2022, spanning the period before and after the emergence of COVID-19. The HAstV and other diarrheal viruses including group A rotavirus, norovirus and sapovirus were screened by RT-PCR. Of these, HAstV was detected in 140 out of 1625 (8.6%). When the stool samples were categorized by the year of collection, HAstV was detected in 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 with the prevalences of 3.1%, 6.6%, 3.0%, and 20.1%, respectively. Among 140 HAstV positive cases, HAstV1, MLB1, MLB2, HAstV3, MLB3, and VA2 were detected in 77, 46, 10, 3, 2, and 2 samples, respectively. High infection rate was found in children 1-3 years of age (95/140; 67.9%). Severity of the disease increased with the co-infection with norovirus. During the surveillance of 2021-2022, two outbreaks of HAstV were detected, one was an outbreak of HAstV1 and MLB2 in September, 2021 in Kyoto, the second was an outbreak of HAstV1 and MLB1 in December, 2021 in Kyoto and Shizuoka. It was interesting to observe that mixed-infection of astroviruses between HAstV1 and MLB1 was reported for the first time in this study. Characterization of the subgenotypes in HAstV1 and HAstV3 indicated that most HAstV1 circulating in Japan belonged to HAstV1a and only a single strain was HAstV1b, whereas all HAstV3 was identified as the HAstV3c subgenotype. In conclusion, several HAstV genotypes, including classic HAstV, novel MLB, and VA genotypes, were detected in this study. The incidence of astrovirus outbreaks was also reported after the pandemic of COVID-19 in 2021-2022.",

        "abstract": "Since 2020 wastewater-based surveillance has quickly been established as an effective and cost-efficient tool for monitoring public health. In this Making Waves article, we argue that these programs must be grounded in principles of justice to achieve global water and health equity. Ethics initiatives to date have focused primarily on privacy, legality, and institutionalised research reviews, often, if not exclusively, in North America and Western Europe. We draw from our interdisciplinary, multisectoral, and international expertise and experience to develop a justice-centred framework for wastewater-based surveillance. First, we identify common concerns across diverse surveillance programs including: defining community, transparency and accountability, and uneven geographies. Second, we draw on political theorist Nancy Fraser's framework of justice to evaluate site-specific practices identifying maldistribution, misrecognition, and exclusion. We suggest that Fraser's framework offers a common approach for evaluating just outcomes rather than specific regulations for governing wastewater surveillance across different and unequal contexts.",

        "title": "Etiologies and comorbidities of meningitis deaths in children under 5 years in high-mortality settings: Insights from the CHAMPS Network in the post-pneumococcal vaccine era.",
        "abstract": "The role of meningitis in causing deaths and in children under 5 is unclear, especially since widespread use of vaccines to prevent common causes of meningitis. Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) uses post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) and ante-mortem data to explore death causes. We aimed to assess meningitis's contribution to mortality and identify causative pathogens in children under 5 within CHAMPS Network sites. In this observational study, we analyzed deaths in live-born children <5 years of age that occurred between December 16, 2016, and December 31, 2023, in CHAMPS catchments in six sub-Saharan African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, South Africa) and Bangladesh. MITS was conducted within 24-72 h of death, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, multi-organism targeted nucleic acid amplification tests on blood, CSF and lung tissue, and histopathology of lung, liver and brain. Expert panels at each site reviewed data to attribute causes of death following ICD-10 standards. Meningitis was in the causal pathway for 7.0% (270/3857) of deaths; in 4.8% (13/270) meningitis was considered the underlying condition. Neonates accounted for 65.9% (178/270) and infants or children 34.1% (92/270). Among neonatal meningitis deaths, 55.6% (99/178) occurred ≥72 h post-hospital admission; and common pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (49.5%, 49/99; mainly from South Africa) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (40.4%, 40/99). Forty-four percent (79/178) of neonatal meningitis deaths were community-associated, primarily due to K. pneumoniae (35.4%, 28/79) and Escherichia coli (13.9%, 11/79). Among infant and child meningitis deaths, 43.5% (40/92) occurred ≥72 h post-admission; and common pathogens were K. pneumoniae (42.5%,17/40) and A. baumannii (17.5%, 7/40). Among community-associated meningitis deaths in infants and children (56.5%, 52/92), Streptococcus pneumoniae (34.6%, 18/52) and K. pneumoniae (19.2%, 10/52) were common pathogens. Pathogen prevalence varied by region. Our study highlights meningitis as a significant contributor to under-5 mortality in low-middle-income countries. The prominent role of K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii, particularly in healthcare settings and specific regions, highlights the need for better infection control, targeted interventions, and more effective treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Demographers have long suspected that health influences whether a person migrates-a \"healthy migrant effect\" -but this has rarely been tested for a longer period with high-quality, longitudinal data. This study aimed to assess which measures of health are associated with subsequent migrations among young adults from a rural community in Bangladesh, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, and how long these associations persist. The 1996 Matlab Health and Socioeconomic Survey (MHSS) characterized health (by self-reported chronic, and acute morbidity symptoms in the past 12 months and one month, respectively, and self-rated health status) of adults within the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) cohort. Analyses included 3756 (M = 1,496, F = 2260) adults aged 18-34 years (the age when migration peaks) to study the effect of health on migration. Cox Proportional Hazards models were estimated to describe associations between health status and subsequent out-migration in 1996-2017, controlling for age, sex, education, religious affiliation, and household asset quintiles. Discrete-time logistic models were estimated to assess the sustained effects of health status measures on out-migrations. Results reveal that self-reported chronic morbidity, neither acute morbidity nor self-rated health status, inhibited subsequent migration. More reported chronic morbidity symptoms were associated with a lower migration (hazard ratio, HR = 0.82, CI = 0.74-0.92 for one symptom and HR = 0.73, CI = 0.63-0.84 for ≥2 symptoms relative to no symptoms). The differences diminished but persisted over time. Socio-demographic variables inhibiting migration were female sex, older age, and lower-level education. In conclusion, healthy young rural adults were more likely to migrate than their counterparts with symptoms of chronic morbidity, and the effect of chronic morbidity on subsequent migrations waned but not eliminated over time.",

        "abstract": "The significant reduction in agricultural output and the decline in product quality are two of the most glaring negative impacts caused by plant pathogenic fungi (PPF). Furthermore, contaminated food or transit might introduce mycotoxins produced by PPF directly into the food chain. Eating food tainted with mycotoxin is extremely dangerous for both human and animal health. Using fungicides is the first choice to control PPF or their toxins in food. Fungicide resistance and its effects on the environment and public health are becoming more and more of a concern, despite the fact that chemical fungicides are used to limit PPF toxicity and control growth in crops. Fungicides induce target site alteration and efflux pump activation, and mutations in PPF result in resistance. As a result, global trends are shifting away from chemically manufactured pesticides and toward managing fungal plant diseases using various biocontrol techniques, tactics, and approaches. However, surveillance programs to monitor fungicide resistance and their environmental impact are much fewer compared to bacterial antibiotic resistance surveillance programs. In this review, we discuss the PPF that contributes to disease development in plants, the fungicides used against them, factors causing the spread of PPF and the emergence of new strains, the antifungal resistance mechanisms of PPF, health, the environmental impacts of fungicides, and the use of biocontrol agents (BCAs), antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and nanotechnologies to control PPF as a safe and eco-friendly alternative to fungicides.",

        "title": "Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

        "abstract": "The current literature suggests that the frequency and complexity of public health emergencies are rising and this trend will likely continue. From 2000 to 2023, seven events have been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Organisational models such as the Incident Management System, Incident Response System and Incident Command System or country-specific models are essential in managing PHEIC.The review aims to achieve four key objectives. First, identify and describe the organisational models used in the South-East Asia Region (SEAR) nations defined by WHO as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and DPR Korea for managing PHEICs. Second, explore the indicators used to gauge the effectiveness of these models. Third, assess how these indicators impact the overall success of organisational models. Finally, the review will delve into the implementation aspects gaining a deeper understanding of how the organisational models are put into practice to manage PHEICs in the SEAR region. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines, a qualitative evidence synthesis will be conducted. A defined search strategy will be employed to conduct a comprehensive literature search of the following academic databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, WHO Library Database, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and Web of Science; as well as non-academic databases including Google Scholar, Evidence Aid, Epistemonikos, Shodhganga and ResearchGate. This review will employ the SPIDER-D tool for searching qualitative studies. Two reviewers will check the quality of included studies and will be appraised using standard critical appraisal tools. In case of any difference between the two reviewers, a third reviewer will take the decision. No ethical approval is required. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated through a workshop for stakeholders and policymakers. CRD42023394418.",

        "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

For each detection or high level, CDC and state and local health departments evaluated data from other influenza surveillance systems and partnered with wastewater utilities and agriculture departments to investigate potential sources. Among the four states with high influenza A virus levels detected in wastewater, three states had corresponding evidence of human influenza activity from other influenza surveillance systems. Among the 24 sites with H5 detections, 15 identified animal sources within the sewershed or adjacent county, including eight milk-processing inputs.

The surveillance network has been ongoing for 6 years (2017-2023) in 17 health facilities. Diarrhea patients from Rohingya Myanmar nationals matched with case definition were enrolled and stool samples were tested by Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for early cholera detection Multiple Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of risk factors among cholera cases. A total of 17,252 stool samples were collected through surveillance. Among the tested samples, 588 (3.5 %) were detected positive by RDT, and 239 (1.4 %) <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> were isolated by microbiological culture.

In 2023, DENV outbreaks began in Eastern Nepal, near the border with India, and rapidly spread nationwide. The study aims to describe the outbreak's epidemiological pattern, laboratory characteristics, DENV serotypes, and genotypes. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in four hospitals in Jhapa, Eastern Nepal, in 2023. Acute serum samples were obtained from dengue suspected patients within 7 days of illness and subjected to virus isolation, conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and phylogenetic analysis. Out of 60 samples, 42 (70 %), 11 (18.3 %) and 7 (11.7 %) were primary, secondary and non-dengue infection, respectively. Among 53 dengue confirmed patients, 46 (86.7 %) were positive for NS1 and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for both NS1 and IgM. Out of 42 dengue isolates, a new clade of the cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2 was the most prevalent (28, 66.7 %), followed by genotype III of DENV-3 (11, 26.2 %) and genotype V of DENV-1 (3, 7.1 %). Genotype III of DENV-3 was first introduced in 2022-2023 in Nepal. Phylogenetic analysis of the E gene revealed the DENV-2 isolates from Nepal had 98 % homologous nucleotide similarity with the strains from India and Bangladesh. To our knowledge, this is the first report of circulating serotypes and genotypes of DENV in Jhapa. Integrating molecular findings into the dengue control plan can enhance surveillance efforts, monitor disease trends, and implement proactive measures to reduce the burden of dengue and prevent fatalities in future outbreaks.",

        "title": "Neurological Symptoms and Cause of Death Among Young Children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.",
        "abstract": "The emergence of acute neurological symptoms in children necessitates immediate intervention. Although low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden of neurological diseases, there is a scarcity of diagnostic and therapeutic resources. Therefore, current understanding of the etiology of neurological emergencies in LMICs relies mainly on clinical diagnoses and verbal autopsies. To characterize the association of premortem neurological symptoms and their management with postmortem-confirmed cause of death among children aged younger than 5 years in LMICs and to identify current gaps and improve strategies to enhance child survival. This cross-sectional study was conducted between December 3, 2016, and July 22, 2022, at the 7 participating sites in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa). Minimally invasive tissue sampling was performed at the CHAMPS sites with specimens from deceased children aged younger than 5 years. This study included deceased children who underwent a premortem neurological evaluation and had a postmortem-confirmed cause of death. Data analysis was performed between July 22, 2022, and January 15, 2023. Descriptive analysis was performed using neurological evaluations from premortem clinical records and from postmortem determination of cause of death (based on histopathology, microbiological testing, clinical records, and verbal autopsies). Of the 2127 deaths of children codified during the study period, 1330 (62.5%) had neurological evaluations recorded and were included in this analysis. The 1330 children had a median age of 11 (IQR, 2-324) days; 745 (56.0%) were male and 727 (54.7%) presented with neurological symptoms during illness before death. The most common postmortem-confirmed neurological diagnoses related to death were hypoxic events (308 [23.2%]), meningoencephalitis (135 [10.2%]), and cerebral malaria (68 [5.1%]). There were 12 neonates with overlapping hypoxic events and meningoencephalitis, but there were no patients with overlapping meningoencephalitis and cerebral malaria. Neurological symptoms were similar among diagnoses, and no combination of symptoms was accurate in differentiating them without complementary tools. However, only 25 children (18.5%) with meningitis had a lumbar puncture performed before death. Nearly 90% of deaths (442 of 511 [86.5%]) with neurological diagnoses in the chain of events leading to death were considered preventable. In this cross-sectional study of children aged younger than 5 years, neurological symptoms were frequent before death. However, clinical phenotypes were insufficient to differentiate the most common underlying neurological diagnoses. The low rate of lumbar punctures performed was especially worrying, suggesting a challenge in quality of care of children presenting with neurological symptoms. Improved diagnostic management of neurological emergencies is necessary to ultimately reduce mortality in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to elucidate the epidemiological characteristics, spatial distribution, and potential contributing factors associated with the 2022-2023 dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. We retrospectively analyzed dengue fever cases reported by national health surveillance systems, focusing on incidence, geographical spread, and fatalities. Statistical methods were used to explore correlations between population density, healthcare capacity, and disease prevalence. Our study revealed that in 2023, dengue cases and deaths surged five-fold (from 62,382 to 320,835) and nearly six-fold (from 281 to 1699) compared with 2022. Major cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong emerged as epicenters with significantly higher caseloads and mortality rates. The analysis identified a strong positive correlation between population density and disease prevalence, suggesting urbanization as a contributing factor. In addition, a shift in the peak dengue season from August to September was observed. Furthermore, disparities in health care infrastructure were identified, with densely populated areas experiencing critical shortages of hospital beds, potentially impacting fatality rates. This unprecedented dengue outbreak in Bangladesh highlights the need for a multifaceted approach. Prioritizing vector control, targeted public awareness in identified hotspots, addressing healthcare resource inequities, and further research on environmental and demographic determinants of transmission are crucial for mitigating future outbreaks in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Climate change is a significant risk multiplier and profoundly influences the transmission dynamics, geographical distribution, and resurgence of vector-borne diseases (VBDs). Bangladesh has a noticeable rise in VBDs attributed to climate change. Despite the severity of this issue, the interconnections between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh have yet to be thoroughly explored. To address this research gap, our review meticulously examined existing literature on the relationship between climate change and VBDs in Bangladesh. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach, we identified 3849 records from SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Ultimately, 22 research articles meeting specific criteria were included. We identified that the literature on the subject matter of this study is non-contemporaneous, with 68% of studies investing datasets before 2014, despite studies on climate change and dengue nexus having increased recently. We pinpointed Dhaka and Chittagong Hill Tracts as the dengue and malaria research hotspots, respectively. We highlighted that the 2023 dengue outbreak illustrates a possible shift in dengue-endemic areas in Bangladesh. Moreover, dengue cases surged by 317% in 2023 compared to 2019 records, with a corresponding 607% increase in mortality compared to 2022. A weak connection was observed between dengue incidents and climate drivers, including the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). However, no compelling evidence supported an association between malaria cases, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Bay of Bengal, along with the NINO3 phenomenon. We observed minimal microclimatic and non-climatic data inclusion in selected studies. Our review holds implications for policymakers, urging the prioritization of mitigation measures such as year-round surveillance and early warning systems. Ultimately, it calls for resource allocation to empower researchers in advancing the understanding of VBD dynamics amidst changing climates.",

        "abstract": "High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 first emerged in Bangladesh in 2007. Despite the use of vaccines in chickens since 2012 to control HPAI, HPAI H5Nx viruses have continued to infect poultry, and wild birds, resulting in notable mass mortalities in house crows (<i>Corvus splendens</i>). The first HPAI H5Nx viruses in Bangladesh belonged to clade 2.2.2, followed by clade 2.3.4.2 and 2.3.2.1 viruses in 2011. After the implementation of chicken vaccination in 2012, these viruses were mostly replaced by clade 2.3.2.1a viruses and more recently clade 2.3.4.4b and h viruses. In this study, we reconstruct the phylogenetic history of HPAI H5Nx viruses in Bangladesh to evaluate the role of major host species in the maintenance and evolution of HPAI H5Nx virus in Bangladesh and reveal the role of heavily impacted crows in virus epidemiology. Epizootic waves caused by HPAI H5N1 and H5N6 viruses amongst house crows occurred annually in winter. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis of clade 2.3.2.1a revealed frequent bidirectional viral transitions between domestic ducks, chickens, and house crows that was markedly skewed towards ducks; domestic ducks might be the source, or reservoir, of HPAI H5Nx in Bangladesh, as the number of viral transitions from ducks to chickens and house crows was by far more numerous than the other transitions. Our results suggest viral circulation in domestic birds despite vaccination, with crow epizootics acting as a sentinel. The vaccination strategy needs to be updated to use more effective vaccinations, assess vaccine efficacy, and extension of vaccination to domestic ducks, the key reservoir.",

Accurate NiV diagnostics and surveillance tools are crucial for the identification of acute and resolved infections and to improve our understanding of NiV transmission and circulation. Here, we have developed and validated a split NanoLuc luciferase NiV glycoprotein (G) biosensor for detecting antibodies in clinical and animal samples. This assay is performed by simply mixing reagents and measuring luminescence, which depends on the complementation of the split NanoLuc luciferase G biosensor following its binding to antibodies. This anti-NiV-G \"mix-and-read\" assay was validated using the WHO's first international standard for anti-NiV antibodies and more than 700 serum samples from the NiV-endemic country of Bangladesh. Anti-NiV antibodies from survivors persisted for at least 8 years according to both ⍺NiV-G mix-and-read and NiV neutralization assays. The ⍺NiV-G mix-and-read assay sensitivity (98.6%) and specificity (100%) were comparable to anti-NiV IgG ELISA performance but failed to detect anti-NiV antibodies in samples collected less than a week following the appearance of symptoms. Overall, the anti-NiV-G biosensor represents a simple, fast, and reliable tool that could support the expansion of NiV surveillance and retrospective outbreak investigations.",

        "title": "Estimating time-varying cholera transmission and oral cholera vaccine effectiveness in Haiti and Cameroon, 2021-2023.",
        "abstract": "In 2023, cholera affected approximately 1 million people and caused more than 5000 deaths globally, predominantly in low-income and conflict settings. In recent years, the number of new cholera outbreaks has grown rapidly. Further, ongoing cholera outbreaks have been exacerbated by conflict, climate change, and poor infrastructure, resulting in prolonged crises. As a result, the demand for treatment and intervention is quickly outpacing existing resource availability. Prior to improved water and sanitation systems, cholera, a disease primarily transmitted via contaminated water sources, also routinely ravaged high-income countries. Crumbling infrastructure and climate change are now putting new locations at risk - even in high-income countries. Thus, understanding the transmission and prevention of cholera is critical. Combating cholera requires multiple interventions, the two most common being behavioral education and water treatment. Two-dose oral cholera vaccination (OCV) is often used as a complement to these interventions. Due to limited supply, countries have recently switched to single-dose vaccines (OCV1). One challenge lies in understanding where to allocate OCV1 in a timely manner, especially in settings lacking well-resourced public health surveillance systems. As cholera occurs and propagates in such locations, timely, accurate, and openly accessible outbreak data are typically inaccessible for disease modeling and subsequent decision-making. In this study, we demonstrated the value of open-access data to rapidly estimate cholera transmission and vaccine effectiveness. Specifically, we obtained non-machine readable (NMR) epidemic curves for recent cholera outbreaks in two countries, Haiti and Cameroon, from figures published in situation and disease outbreak news reports. We used computational digitization techniques to derive weekly counts of cholera cases, resulting in nominal differences when compared against the reported cumulative case counts (i.e., a relative error rate of 5.67% in Haiti and 0.54% in Cameroon). Given these digitized time series, we leveraged EpiEstim-an open-source modeling platform-to derive rapid estimates of time-varying disease transmission via the effective reproduction number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> ). To compare OCV1 effectiveness in the two considered countries, we additionally used VaxEstim, a recent extension of EpiEstim that facilitates the estimation of vaccine effectiveness via the relation among three inputs: the basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mstyle><mn>0</mn></mstyle> </msub> </mrow> </math> ), <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> , and vaccine coverage. Here, with Haiti and Cameroon as case studies, we demonstrated the first implementation of VaxEstim in low-resource settings. Importantly, we are the first to use VaxEstim with digitized data rather than traditional epidemic surveillance data. In the initial phase of the outbreak, weekly rolling average estimates of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> were elevated in both countries: 2.60 in Haiti [95% credible interval: 2.42-2.79] and 1.90 in Cameroon [1.14-2.95]. These values are largely consistent with previous estimates of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mstyle><mn>0</mn></mstyle> </msub> </mrow> </math> in Haiti, where average values have ranged from 1.06 to 3.72, and in Cameroon, where average values have ranged from 1.10 to 3.50. In both Haiti and Cameroon, this initial period of high transmission preceded a longer period during which <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> oscillated around the critical threshold of 1. Our results derived from VaxEstim suggest that Haiti had higher OCV1 effectiveness than Cameroon (75.32% effective [54.00-86.39%] vs. 54.88% [18.94-84.90%]). These estimates of OCV1 effectiveness are generally aligned with those derived from field studies conducted in other countries. Thus, our case study reinforces the validity of VaxEstim as an alternative to costly, time-consuming field studies of OCV1 effectiveness. Indeed, prior work in South Sudan, Bangladesh, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported OCV1 effectiveness ranging from approximately 40% to 80%. This work underscores the value of combining NMR sources of outbreak case data with computational techniques and the utility of VaxEstim for rapid, inexpensive estimation of vaccine effectiveness in data-poor outbreak settings.",

We conducted this systematic review to understand the distribution of bovine and zoonotic tuberculosis in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Southeast Asia Region (SEAR) and Western Pacific Region (WPR) to inform our understanding of the risk posed by this disease. A two-pronged strategy was used by evaluating data from peer-reviewed literature and official reports. A systematic search was conducted using a structured query in four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, and PubMed) to identify any reports of the occurrence of zoonotic TB. No language and time constraints were used during the search, but non-English language articles were later excluded. The official data were sourced from the World Organization for Animal Health's (WOAH) World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) and WHO's global TB database. The retrieved records from SEAR and WPR (<i>n</i> = 113) were screened for eligibility, and data about disease occurrence were extracted and tabulated. In SEAR, all of the five studies that conducted <i>Mycobacterium</i> speciation (5/6) in humans were from India, and the reported <i>Mycobacterium</i> species included <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, <i>M. bovis</i>, <i>M. scrofulacium</i>, <i>M. kansasii</i>, <i>M. phlei</i>, <i>M. smegmatis</i> and <i>M. orygis</i>. In WPR, <i>Mycobacterium</i> speciation investigations in humans were conducted in Australia (8), China (2), Japan (2), NewZealand (2) and Malaysia (1), and the reported <i>Mycobacterium</i> species included <i>M. bovis</i>, <i>M. africanum</i> and <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Seven countries in WHO's SEAR have officially reported the occurrence of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in their animals: Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In WPR, the WAHIS information system includes reports of the identification of <i>M. bovis</i> from 11 countries - China, Fiji, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Tonga and Viet Nam. In contrast, human zoonotic TB cases in the WHO database were only listed from Australia, Brunei Darussalam and Palau countries. The available data suggests under-reporting of zoonotic TB in the regions. Efforts are required to strengthen zoonotic TB surveillance systems from both animal and human health sides to better understand the impact of zoonotic TB in order to take appropriate action to achieve the goal of ending the TB epidemic.",

        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging pathogen that causes encephalitis and a high mortality rate in infected subjects. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively analyze the global epidemiology and research advancements of NiV to identify the key knowledge gaps in the literature. Articles searched using literature databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct yielded 5,596 articles. After article screening, 97 articles were included in this systematic review, comprising 41 epidemiological studies and 56 research developments on NiV. The majority of the NiV epidemiological studies were conducted in Bangladesh, reflecting the country's significant burden of NiV outbreaks. The initial NiV outbreak was identified in Malaysia in 1998, with subsequent outbreaks reported in Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines. Transmission routes vary by country, primarily through pigs in Malaysia, consumption of date palm juice in Bangladesh, and human-to-human in India. However, the availability of NiV genome sequences remains limited, particularly from Malaysia and India. Mortality rates also vary according to the country, exceeding 70% in Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines, and less than 40% in Malaysia. Understanding these differences in mortality rate among countries is crucial for informing NiV epidemiology and enhancing outbreak prevention and management strategies. In terms of research developments, the majority of studies focused on vaccine development, followed by phylogenetic analysis and antiviral research. While many vaccines and antivirals have demonstrated complete protection in animal models, only two vaccines have progressed to clinical trials. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed distinct clades between NiV Malaysia, NiV Bangladesh, and NiV India, with proposals to classify NiV India as a separate strain from NiV Bangladesh. Taken together, comprehensive OneHealth approaches integrating disease surveillance and research are imperative for future NiV studies. Expanding the dataset of NiV genome sequences, particularly from Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India will be pivotal. These research efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of NiV pathogenicity and for developing robust diagnostic assays, vaccines and therapeutics necessary for effective preparedness and response to future NiV outbreaks.",

We investigated the association of maternal hypertension and perinatal mortality in rural Bangladesh. This nested, matched case-control study used data from a 2019 cross-sectional survey and demographic surveillance database in Baliakandi, Bangladesh. We randomly matched each pregnancy ending in perinatal death with five pregnancies in which the neonate survived beyond seven days based on maternal age, education, and wealth quintile. We estimated associations of antenatal care-seeking and self-reported hypertension with perinatal mortality using conditional logistic regression and used median and interquartile ranges to assess the mediation of antenatal care by timing or frequency. Among 191 cases and 934 matched controls, hypertension prevalence was 14.1% among cases and 7.7% among controls. Compared with no diagnosis, the probability of perinatal death was significantly higher among women with a pre-gestational hypertension diagnosis (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.29, 6.57), but not among women with diagnosis during pregnancy (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.98, 2.98). We found no association between the number of antenatal care contacts and perinatal death (p = 0.66). Among women with pre-gestational hypertension who experienced a perinatal death, 78% had their first antenatal contact in the sixth or seventh month of gestation. Hypertension was more common among rural women who experience a perinatal death. Greater effort to prevent hypertension prior to conception and provide early maternity care to women with hypertension could improve perinatal outcomes in rural Bangladesh.",

This study aimed to estimate post-discharge mortality rates among patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Bangladesh, identify associated factors, and document reported causes of death. From January 2012 to December 2019, we conducted follow-up calls to patients or their families 30 days after discharge to assess the status of patients with SARI. Proportions of deaths within 30 days of discharge were estimated, and a comparative analysis of demographics, clinical characteristics, and influenza illness between decedents and survivors was performed using multivariable Cox regression models. Among 23,360 patients with SARI (median age: 20 years, IQR: 1.5-48, 65% male), 351 (1.5%) died during hospitalisation. Of 23,009 patients alive at discharge, 20,044 (87%) were followed, with 633 (3.2%) deaths within 30 days of discharge. In children (<18 years), difficulty breathing (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.0), longer hospital stay (aHR 1.1; 95% CI 1.1-1.1), and heart diseases (aHR 8.5; 95% CI 3.2-23.1) were associated with higher post-discharge death risk. Among adults (≥18 years), difficulty breathing (aHR 2.3; 95% CI 1.7-3.0), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.2), and intensive care unit admission (aHR 5.2; 95% CI 1.9-14.0) were linked to elevated post-discharge death risk. Influenza virus was detected in 13% (46/351) of in-hospital SARI deaths and 10% (65/633) of post-discharge SARI deaths. Nearly one in twenty patients with SARI died during hospitalisation or within 1 month of discharge, with two-thirds of deaths occurring post-discharge. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended to mitigate influenza-associated mortality. To enhance post-discharge outcomes, hospitals should consider developing safe-discharge algorithms, reinforcing post-discharge care plans, and establishing outpatient monitoring for recently discharged patients.

        "abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the proportion of wheeze in young children attributable to respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections (RSV-LRTI) occurring early in life. This cohort study prospectively determined the population attributable risk (PAR) and risk percent (PAR%) of wheeze in 2-<6-year-old children previously surveilled in a primary study for RSV-LRTI from birth to their second birthday (RSV-LRTI<2Y). From 2013 to 2021, 2-year-old children from 8 countries were enrolled in this extension study (NCT01995175) and were followed through quarterly surveillance contacts until their sixth birthday for the occurrence of parent-reported wheeze, medically-attended wheeze or recurrent wheeze episodes (≥4 episodes/year). PAR% was calculated as PAR divided by the cumulative incidence of wheeze in all participants. Of 1395 children included in the analyses, 126 had documented RSV-LRTI<2Y. Cumulative incidences were higher for reported (38.1% vs. 13.6%), medically-attended (30.2% vs. 11.8%) and recurrent wheeze outcomes (4.0% vs. 0.6%) in participants with RSV-LRTI<2Y than those without RSV-LRTI<2Y. The PARs for all episodes of reported, medically-attended and recurrent wheeze were 22.2, 16.6 and 3.1 per 1000 children, corresponding to PAR% of 14.1%, 12.3% and 35.9%. In univariate analyses, all 3 wheeze outcomes were strongly associated with RSV-LRTI<2Y (all global P < 0.01). Multivariable modeling for medically-attended wheeze showed a strong association with RSV-LRTI after adjustment for covariates (global P < 0.0001). A substantial amount of wheeze from the second to sixth birthday is potentially attributable to RSV-LRTI<2Y. Prevention of RSV-LRTI<2Y could potentially reduce wheezing episodes in 2-<6-year-old children.",

        "abstract": "Nipah virus is a zoonotic paramyxovirus responsible for disease outbreaks with high fatality rates in south and southeast Asia. However, knowledge of the potential geographical extent and risk patterns of the virus is poor. We aimed to establish an integrated spatiotemporal and phylogenetic database of Nipah virus infections in humans and animals across south and southeast Asia. In this geospatial modelling analysis, we developed an integrated database containing information on the distribution of Nipah virus infections in humans and animals from 1998 to 2021. We conducted phylodynamic analysis to examine the evolution and migration pathways of the virus and meta-analyses to estimate the adjusted case-fatality rate. We used two boosted regression tree models to identify the potential ecological drivers of Nipah virus occurrences in spillover events and endemic areas, and mapped potential risk areas for Nipah virus endemicity. 749 people and eight bat species across nine countries were documented as being infected with Nipah virus. On the basis of 66 complete genomes of the virus, we identified two clades-the Bangladesh clade and the Malaysia clade-with the time of the most recent common ancestor estimated to be 1863. Adjusted case-fatality rates varied widely between countries and were higher for the Bangladesh clade than for the Malaysia clade. Multivariable meta-regression analysis revealed significant relationships between case-fatality rate estimates and viral clade (p=0·0021), source country (p=0·016), proportion of male patients (p=0·036), and travel time to health-care facilities (p=0·036). Temperature-related bioclimate variables and the probability of occurrence of Pteropus medius were important contributors to both the spillover and the endemic infection models. The suitable niches for Nipah virus are more extensive than previously reported. Future surveillance efforts should focus on high-risk areas informed by updated projections. Specifically, intensifying zoonotic surveillance efforts, enhancing laboratory testing capacity, and implementing public health education in projected high-risk areas where no human cases have been reported to date will be crucial. Additionally, strengthening wildlife surveillance and investigating potential modes of transmission in regions with documented human cases is needed.

        "abstract": "The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) helped develop the standard acute flaccid paralysis surveillance (AFP) system worldwide, including, knowledge, expertise, technical assistance, and trained personnel. AFP surveillance can complement any disease surveillance system. This study outlines AFP surveillance evolution in Bangladesh, its success and challenging factors, and its potential to facilitate other health goals. This mixed-method study includes a grey literature review, survey, and key informant interviews (KIIs). We collected grey literature from online websites and paper documentation from GPEI stakeholders. Online and in-person surveys were conducted in six divisions of Bangladesh, including Dhaka, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Chittagong, Sylhet, and Khulna, to map tacit knowledge ideas, approaches, and experiences. We also conducted KIIs, and Data were then combined on focused emerging themes, including the history, challenges, and successes of AFP surveillance programme. According to the grey literature review, survey, and KII, AFP surveillance successfully contributed to decreasing polio in Bangladesh. The major facilitating factors were multi-sectoral collaboration, Surveillance Immunization Medical Officer (SIMO) network activities, social environment, community-based surveillance, and promising political commitment. On the other hand, high population growth, hard-to-reach areas, people residing in risky zones, and polio transition planning were significant challenges. Bangladesh is also utilizing these polio surveillance assets for other vaccine-preventable diseases. As the world is so close to eradicating polio, the knowledge, and other assets of the AFP surveillance, could be used for other health programmes. In addition, its strengths can be leveraged for combating new and emerging diseases.",

        "abstract": "The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) and Vaccine Preventable Disease (VPD) Surveillance (VPDS) programs generate multiple data sources (e.g., routine administrative data, VPD case data, and coverage surveys). However, there are challenges with the use of these siloed data for programmatic decision-making, including poor data accessibility and lack of timely analysis, contributing to missed vaccinations, immunity gaps, and, consequently, VPD outbreaks in populations with limited access to immunization and basic healthcare services. Data triangulation, or the integration of multiple data sources, can be used to improve the availability of key indicators for identifying immunization coverage gaps, under-immunized (UI) and un-immunized (zero-dose (ZD)) children, and for assessing program performance at all levels of the healthcare system. Here, we describe the data triangulation processes, prioritization of indicators, and capacity building efforts in Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Rwanda. We also describe the analyses used to generate meaningful data, key indicators used to identify immunization coverage inequities and performance gaps, and key lessons learned. Triangulation processes and lessons learned may be leveraged by other countries, potentially leading to programmatic changes that promote improved access and utilization of vaccination services through the identification of UI and ZD children.",

        "abstract": "<i>Candida auris</i>, initially identified in 2009, has rapidly become a critical concern due to its antifungal resistance and significant mortality rates in healthcare-associated outbreaks. To date, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has identified five unique clades of <i>C. auris</i>, with some strains displaying resistance to all primary antifungal drug classes. In this study, we presented the first WGS analysis of <i>C. auris</i> from Bangladesh, describing its origins, transmission dynamics, and antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) profile. Ten <i>C. auris</i> isolates collected from hospital settings in Bangladesh were initially identified by CHROMagar Candida Plus, followed by VITEK2 system, and later sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 550 system. Reference-based phylogenetic analysis and variant calling pipelines were used to classify the isolates in different clades. All isolates aligned ~90% with the Clade I <i>C. auris</i> B11205 reference genome. Of the 10 isolates, 8 were clustered with Clade I isolates, highlighting a South Asian lineage prevalent in Bangladesh. Remarkably, the remaining two isolates formed a distinct cluster, exhibiting >42,447 single-nucleotide polymorphism differences compared to their closest Clade IV counterparts. This significant variation corroborates the emergence of a sixth clade (Clade VI) of <i>C. auris</i> in Bangladesh, with potential for international transmission. AFST results showed that 80% of the <i>C. auris</i> isolates were resistant to fluconazole and voriconazole, whereas Clade VI isolates were susceptible to azoles, echinocandins, and pyrimidine analogue. Genomic sequencing revealed <i>ERG11</i>_Y132F mutation conferring azole resistance while <i>FCY1</i>_S70R mutation found inconsequential in describing 5-flucytosine resistance. Our study underscores the pressing need for comprehensive genomic surveillance in Bangladesh to better understand the emergence, transmission dynamics, and resistance profiles of <i>C. auris</i> infections. Unveiling the discovery of a sixth clade (Clade VI) accentuates the indispensable role of advanced sequencing methodologies.IMPORTANCE<i>Candida auris</i> is a nosocomial fungal pathogen that is commonly misidentified as other <i>Candida</i> species. Since its emergence in 2009, this multidrug-resistant fungus has become one of the five urgent antimicrobial threats by 2019. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has proven to be the most accurate identification technique of <i>C. auris</i> which also played a crucial role in the initial discovery of this pathogen. WGS analysis of <i>C. auris</i> has revealed five distinct clades where isolates of each clade differ among themselves based on pathogenicity, colonization, infection mechanism, as well as other phenotypic characteristics. In Bangladesh, <i>C. auris</i> was first reported in 2019 from clinical samples of a large hospital in Dhaka city. To understand the origin, transmission dynamics, and antifungal-resistance profile of <i>C. auris</i> isolates circulating in Bangladesh, we conducted a WGS-based surveillance study on two of the largest hospital settings in Dhaka, Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "<i>Culex (Cx.) tritaeniorhynchus</i> is an invasive mosquito species with an extensive and expanding inter-continental distribution, currently reported across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and now Australia. It is an important vector of medical and veterinary pathogens which cause significant morbidity and mortality in human and animal populations. Across regions endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> is considered the major vector and has also been shown to contribute to the transmission of several other zoonotic arboviruses including Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and West Nile virus (WNV). In this study, we used laboratory vector competence experiments to determine if <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> from a Southern European population were competent JEV vectors. We also obtained samples from multiple geographically dispersed <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> populations from countries within Europe, Africa, Eurasia and Asia to perform phylogenetic analysis to measure the level of mitochondrial divergence using the <i>cytochrome oxidase subunit 1</i> ( <i>CO1</i>) gene. We also undertook bacterial <i>16S rRNA</i> gene amplicon sequencing to determine microbial diversity and used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to determine any evidence for the presence of strains of the naturally occurring endosymbiotic bacterium <i>Wolbachia</i>. <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> from a Greek population were shown be be competent vectors of JEV with high levels of virus present in saliva. We found a signficant level of mitochondrial genetic diversity using the mosquito <i>CO1</i> gene between geographically dispersed populations. Furthermore, we report diverse microbiomes identified by <i>16S rRNA</i> gene amplicon sequencing within and between geographical populations. Evidence for the detection of the endosymbiotic bacteria <i>Wolbachia</i> was confirmed using <i>Wolbachia</i>-specific PCR and MLST. This study enhances our understanding of the diversity of <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> and the associated microbiome across its inter-continental range and highlights the need for greater surveillance of this invasive vector species in Europe.",

However, knowledge of the benefits achievable by specific approaches is needed to inform policy making, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with substantial AMR burden and low health-care system capacity. In a modelling analysis, we estimated that improving infection prevention and control programmes in LMIC health-care settings could prevent at least 337 000 (95% CI 250 200-465 200) AMR-associated deaths annually. Ensuring universal access to high-quality water, sanitation, and hygiene services would prevent 247 800 (160 000-337 800) AMR-associated deaths and paediatric vaccines 181 500 (153 400-206 800) AMR-associated deaths, from both direct prevention of resistant infections and reductions in antibiotic consumption. These estimates translate to prevention of 7·8% (5·6-11·0) of all AMR-associated mortality in LMICs by infection prevention and control, 5·7% (3·7-8·0) by water, sanitation, and hygiene, and 4·2% (3·4-5·1) by vaccination interventions. Despite the continuing need for research and innovation to overcome limitations of existing approaches, our findings indicate that reducing global AMR burden by 10% by the year 2030 is achievable with existing interventions. Our results should guide investments in public health interventions with the greatest potential to reduce AMR burden.",

Neonatal mortality was compared by maternal and newborn characteristics and mode of delivery using z-test. Logistic regression model performed for neonatal mortality by mode of delivery controlling selected covariates and reported adjusted odd ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Out of 6,989 live births registered, 27.7% were caesarean and the rest were vaginal delivery; of these births, 265 neonatal deaths occurred during the follow-up. The neonatal mortality rate was 2.7 times higher (46 vs. 17 per 1,000 births) for vaginal than caesarean delivered. Until 3rd day of life, the mortality rate was very high for both vaginal and caesarean delivered newborn; however, the rate was 24.8 for vaginal and 6.3 per 1,000 live births for caesarean delivered on the 1st day of life. After adjusting the covariates, the odds of neonatal mortality were higher for vaginal than caesarean delivered (aOR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.82, 3.85).

Difficulty in obtaining viral genomes from bats means we have a poor understanding of NiV diversity. We develop phylogenetic approaches applied to the most comprehensive collection of genomes to date (N = 257, 175 from bats, 73 from humans) from 6 countries over 22 years (1999-2020). We divide the 4 major NiV sublineages into 15 genetic clusters. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation fit to a spatial signature of viral diversity, we estimate the presence and the average size of genetic clusters per area. We find that, within any bat roost, there are an average of 2.4 co-circulating genetic clusters, rising to 5.5 clusters at areas of 1500-2000 km2. We estimate that each genetic cluster occupies an average area of 1.3 million km2 (95% confidence interval [CI], .6-2.3 million km2), with 14 clusters in an area of 100 000 km2 (95% CI, 6-24 km2). In the few sites in Bangladesh and Cambodia where genomic surveillance has been concentrated, we estimate that most clusters have been identified, but only approximately 15% of overall NiV diversity has been uncovered.

Five separate introductions of H5N1 viruses into India were observed, via Indonesia or Korea (2002), Bangladesh (2009), Bhutan (2010), and China (2013, 2018) (clades 2.2, 2.2.2, 2.2.2.1, 2.3.2.1a, 2.3.2.1c, and 2.3.4.4b). Phylogenetic analysis revealed eight reassortant genotypes. The H5N1 virus isolated from the human case showed a unique reassortant genotype. Amino acid markers associated with adaptation to mammals were also present. This is the first report of the spatio-temporal origins and gene pool analysis of H5N1 viruses from India, highlighting the need for increased molecular surveillance.",

Disease surveillance of captive-bred and wild dormice is performed to identify novel and existing disease threats which could impact populations. In this study, we firstly investigated cause of death in seven hazel dormice found dead in England, through next-generation sequencing identifying a virus closely related to a wood mouse encephalomyocarditis virus-2 (EMCV-2). Subsequently, lung tissue samples from 35 out of 44 hazel dormice tested positive for EMCV-2 RNA using a reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Sanger sequencing methods developed in this study. Formalin-fixed tissues available for nine hazel dormice which tested positive for EMCV-2 RNA were examined microscopically. Three cases showed moderate interstitial pneumonia with minimal to mild lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis, but no evidence of encephalitis. However, the presence of possible alternative causes of death in these cases means that the lesions cannot be definitively attributed to EMCV-2. Here, we report the first detection of EMCV-2 in hazel dormice and conclude that EMCV-2 is likely to be endemic in the hazel dormouse population in England and may be associated with clinical disease.",

Due to the potential threat in okra cultivation, the development of an accurate detection method for F. buharicum is needed for the surveillance and management of the disease. In this study, we designed a primer set and developed conventional and nested PCR assays for the specific detection of F. buharicum in infected okra plants and contaminated soil, respectively. We compared the diversity of the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) gene of F. buharicum with 103 other fungal species/isolates to design a species-specific primer. This primer pair successfully amplified approximately 400 bp of PCR product that was only detected in the F. buharicum isolate, not in the other fungal isolates. The developed nested PCR method was highly sensitive and could detect the fungus from a 0.01 fg DNA sample. The primer successfully detected the pathogen in artificially infected plants and soil by conventional and nested PCR, respectively. This is the first report of the development of the F. buharicum-specific primer set and detection assays, which can be used for the specific and sensitive detection of F. buharicum in field samples and for taking early control measures.",

        "abstract": "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a highly infectious and economically devastating viral disease of cattle. It is caused by Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV) belonging to the genus Capripoxvirus and family Poxviridae. The origin of lumpy skin disease has been traced to Zambia, (an African nation) in Southern part during the year 1929. The first reported case of LSD besides Africa was from Israel, a Middle Eastern nation, thus proving inter-continental spread. Subsequently, the disease entered Middle East, Eastern Europe and Asia with numerous outbreaks in the recent years. LSD has emerged as a significant concern in the Indian sub-continent, due to outbreaks reported in countries such as Bangladesh, India, China in 2019. In the following years, other South and East Asian countries like Taipei, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bhutan, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Singapore also faced severe outbreaks. At present, LSD is considered to be an emerging disease in the Indian sub-continent due to the recent status of disease. Considering the global scenario, LSDV is changing its transmission dynamics as evidenced by a shift in its epidemiology. As a result of high morbidity and mortality rate among cattle, the current outbreaks have been a major cause of socio-economic catastrophe. This contagious viral disease has eminent repercussions as the estimated monetary damage incurred is quite high. Despite having networked surveillance and comprehensive databases, the recurring outbreaks have raised major concern among researchers. Therefore, this review offers brief insights into the emergence of LSDV by amalgamating the newest literature related to its biology, transmission, clinico-pathology, epidemiology, prevention strategies, and economic consequences. Additionally, we have also provided the epidemiological insights of the recent outbreaks with detailed state wise studies.",

        "title": "Global burden of 288 causes of death and life expectancy decomposition in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Regular, detailed reporting on population health by underlying cause of death is fundamental for public health decision making. Cause-specific estimates of mortality and the subsequent effects on life expectancy worldwide are valuable metrics to gauge progress in reducing mortality rates. These estimates are particularly important following large-scale mortality spikes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When systematically analysed, mortality rates and life expectancy allow comparisons of the consequences of causes of death globally and over time, providing a nuanced understanding of the effect of these causes on global populations. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 cause-of-death analysis estimated mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) from 288 causes of death by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2021. The analysis used 56 604 data sources, including data from vital registration and verbal autopsy as well as surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. As with previous GBD rounds, cause-specific death rates for most causes were estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model-a modelling tool developed for GBD to assess the out-of-sample predictive validity of different statistical models and covariate permutations and combine those results to produce cause-specific mortality estimates-with alternative strategies adapted to model causes with insufficient data, substantial changes in reporting over the study period, or unusual epidemiology. YLLs were computed as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles from a 1000-draw distribution for each metric. We decomposed life expectancy by cause of death, location, and year to show cause-specific effects on life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. We also used the coefficient of variation and the fraction of population affected by 90% of deaths to highlight concentrations of mortality. Findings are reported in counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2021 include the expansion of under-5-years age group to include four new age groups, enhanced methods to account for stochastic variation of sparse data, and the inclusion of COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality-which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and pertussis. For this analysis, 199 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 5 country-years of surveillance data, 21 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 94 country-years of other data types were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The leading causes of age-standardised deaths globally were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990; in descending order, these were, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second-leading age-standardised cause of death, with 94·0 deaths (95% UI 89·2-100·0) per 100 000 population. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the rankings of the leading five causes, lowering stroke to the third-leading and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the fourth-leading position. In 2021, the highest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1-290·7] per 100 000 population) and Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1-211·4] per 100 000 population). The lowest age-standardised death rates from COVID-19 were in the high-income super-region (48·1 deaths [47·4-48·8] per 100 000 population) and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3-37·2] per 100 000 population). Globally, life expectancy steadily improved between 1990 and 2019 for 18 of the 22 investigated causes. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the positive effect that reductions in deaths from enteric infections, lower respiratory infections, stroke, and neonatal deaths, among others have contributed to improved survival over the study period. However, a net reduction of 1·6 years occurred in global life expectancy between 2019 and 2021, primarily due to increased death rates from COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality. Life expectancy was highly variable between super-regions over the study period, with southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania gaining 8·3 years (6·7-9·9) overall, while having the smallest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 (0·4 years). The largest reduction in life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean (3·6 years). Additionally, 53 of the 288 causes of death were highly concentrated in locations with less than 50% of the global population as of 2021, and these causes of death became progressively more concentrated since 1990, when only 44 causes showed this pattern. The concentration phenomenon is discussed heuristically with respect to enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, tuberculosis, and measles. Long-standing gains in life expectancy and reductions in many of the leading causes of death have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects of which were spread unevenly among populations. Despite the pandemic, there has been continued progress in combatting several notable causes of death, leading to improved global life expectancy over the study period. Each of the seven GBD super-regions showed an overall improvement from 1990 and 2021, obscuring the negative effect in the years of the pandemic. Additionally, our findings regarding regional variation in causes of death driving increases in life expectancy hold clear policy utility. Analyses of shifting mortality trends reveal that several causes, once widespread globally, are now increasingly concentrated geographically. These changes in mortality concentration, alongside further investigation of changing risks, interventions, and relevant policy, present an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of mortality-reduction strategies. Examining patterns in mortality concentration might reveal areas where successful public health interventions have been implemented. Translating these successes to locations where certain causes of death remain entrenched can inform policies that work to improve life expectancy for people everywhere.

We reviewed prior literature in this area and describe our proposed methods to evaluate 4 biomarkers in the Enterics for Global Health (EFGH) <i>Shigella</i> surveillance study. We systematically reviewed studies since 1970 from PubMed and Embase that assessed the diagnostic characteristics of inflammatory biomarkers to identify bacterial diarrhea episodes. We extracted sensitivity and specificity and summarized the evidence by biomarker and diarrhea etiology. In EFGH, we propose using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to test for myeloperoxidase, calprotectin, lipocalin-2, and hemoglobin in stored whole stool samples collected within 24 hours of enrollment from participants in the Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, Pakistan, Peru, and The Gambia sites. We will develop clinical prediction scores that incorporate the inflammatory biomarkers and evaluate their ability to identify <i>Shigella</i> and other bacterial etiologies of diarrhea as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Forty-nine studies that assessed fecal leukocytes (n = 39), red blood cells (n = 26), lactoferrin (n = 13), calprotectin (n = 8), and myeloperoxidase (n = 1) were included in the systematic review. Sensitivities were high for identifying <i>Shigella</i>, moderate for identifying any bacteria, and comparable across biomarkers. Specificities varied depending on the outcomes assessed. Prior studies were generally small, identified red and white blood cells by microscopy, and used insensitive gold standard diagnostics, such as conventional bacteriological culture for pathogen detection. Our evaluation of inflammatory biomarkers to distinguish diarrhea etiologies as determined by qPCR will provide an important addition to the prior literature, which was likely biased by the limited sensitivity of the gold standard diagnostics used. We will determine whether point-of-care biomarker tests could be a viable strategy to inform treatment decision making and increase appropriate targeting of antibiotic treatment to bacterial diarrhea episodes.",

        "abstract": "Estimates of demographic metrics are crucial to assess levels and trends of population health outcomes. The profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations worldwide has underscored the need for timely estimates to understand this unprecedented event within the context of long-term population health trends. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides new demographic estimates for 204 countries and territories and 811 additional subnational locations from 1950 to 2021, with a particular emphasis on changes in mortality and life expectancy that occurred during the 2020-21 COVID-19 pandemic period. 22 223 data sources from vital registration, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources were used to estimate mortality, with a subset of these sources used exclusively to estimate excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2026 data sources were used for population estimation. Additional sources were used to estimate migration; the effects of the HIV epidemic; and demographic discontinuities due to conflicts, famines, natural disasters, and pandemics, which are used as inputs for estimating mortality and population. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) was used to generate under-5 mortality rates, which synthesised 30 763 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 1365 surveys and censuses, and 80 other sources. ST-GPR was also used to estimate adult mortality (between ages 15 and 59 years) based on information from 31 642 location-years of vital registration and sample registration data, 355 surveys and censuses, and 24 other sources. Estimates of child and adult mortality rates were then used to generate life tables with a relational model life table system. For countries with large HIV epidemics, life tables were adjusted using independent estimates of HIV-specific mortality generated via an epidemiological analysis of HIV prevalence surveys, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, and other data sources. Excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 was determined by subtracting observed all-cause mortality (adjusted for late registration and mortality anomalies) from the mortality expected in the absence of the pandemic. Expected mortality was calculated based on historical trends using an ensemble of models. In location-years where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, we estimated excess mortality rates using a regression model with covariates pertaining to the pandemic. Population size was computed using a Bayesian hierarchical cohort component model. Life expectancy was calculated using age-specific mortality rates and standard demographic methods. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated for every metric using the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. Global all-cause mortality followed two distinct patterns over the study period: age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1950 and 2019 (a 62·8% [95% UI 60·5-65·1] decline), and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-21; 5·1% [0·9-9·6] increase). In contrast with the overall reverse in mortality trends during the pandemic period, child mortality continued to decline, with 4·66 million (3·98-5·50) global deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2021 compared with 5·21 million (4·50-6·01) in 2019. An estimated 131 million (126-137) people died globally from all causes in 2020 and 2021 combined, of which 15·9 million (14·7-17·2) were due to the COVID-19 pandemic (measured by excess mortality, which includes deaths directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and those indirectly due to other social, economic, or behavioural changes associated with the pandemic). Excess mortality rates exceeded 150 deaths per 100 000 population during at least one year of the pandemic in 80 countries and territories, whereas 20 nations had a negative excess mortality rate in 2020 or 2021, indicating that all-cause mortality in these countries was lower during the pandemic than expected based on historical trends. Between 1950 and 2021, global life expectancy at birth increased by 22·7 years (20·8-24·8), from 49·0 years (46·7-51·3) to 71·7 years (70·9-72·5). Global life expectancy at birth declined by 1·6 years (1·0-2·2) between 2019 and 2021, reversing historical trends. An increase in life expectancy was only observed in 32 (15·7%) of 204 countries and territories between 2019 and 2021. The global population reached 7·89 billion (7·67-8·13) people in 2021, by which time 56 of 204 countries and territories had peaked and subsequently populations have declined. The largest proportion of population growth between 2020 and 2021 was in sub-Saharan Africa (39·5% [28·4-52·7]) and south Asia (26·3% [9·0-44·7]). From 2000 to 2021, the ratio of the population aged 65 years and older to the population aged younger than 15 years increased in 188 (92·2%) of 204 nations. Global adult mortality rates markedly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, reversing past decreasing trends, while child mortality rates continued to decline, albeit more slowly than in earlier years. Although COVID-19 had a substantial impact on many demographic indicators during the first 2 years of the pandemic, overall global health progress over the 72 years evaluated has been profound, with considerable improvements in mortality and life expectancy. Additionally, we observed a deceleration of global population growth since 2017, despite steady or increasing growth in lower-income countries, combined with a continued global shift of population age structures towards older ages. These demographic changes will likely present future challenges to health systems, economies, and societies. The comprehensive demographic estimates reported here will enable researchers, policy makers, health practitioners, and other key stakeholders to better understand and address the profound changes that have occurred in the global health landscape following the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, and longer-term trends beyond the pandemic.

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) and non-communicable diseases (NCD) share predisposing risk factors. TB-associated NCD might cluster within households affected with TB requiring shared prevention and care strategies. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis of national TB prevalence surveys to determine whether NCD cluster in members of households with TB. We identified eligible surveys that reported at least one NCD or NCD risk factor through the archive maintained by the World Health Organization and searching in Medline and Embase from 1 January 2000 to 10 August 2021, which was updated on 23 March 2023. We compared the prevalence of NCD and their risk factors between people who do not have TB living in households with at least one person with TB (members of households with TB), and members of households without TB. We included 16 surveys (n = 740,815) from Asia and Africa. In a multivariable model adjusted for age and gender, the odds of smoking was higher among members of households with TB (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.23; 95% CI: 1.11-1.38), compared with members of households without TB. The analysis did not find a significant difference in the prevalence of alcohol drinking, diabetes, hypertension, or BMI between members of households with and without TB. Studies evaluating household-wide interventions for smoking to reduce its dual impact on TB and NCD may be warranted. Systematically screening for NCD using objective diagnostic methods is needed to understand the actual burden of NCD and inform comprehensive interventions.",

        "title": "Evaluating the relationship between ciprofloxacin prescription and non-susceptibility in Salmonella Typhi in Blantyre, Malawi: an observational study.",
        "abstract": "Ciprofloxacin is the first-line drug for treating typhoid fever in many countries in Africa with a high disease burden, but the emergence of non-susceptibility poses a challenge to public health programmes. Through enhanced surveillance as part of vaccine evaluation, we investigated the occurrence and potential determinants of ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility in Blantyre, Malawi. We conducted systematic surveillance of typhoid fever cases and antibiotic prescription in two health centres in Blantyre, Malawi, between Oct 1, 2016, and Oct 31, 2019, as part of the STRATAA and TyVAC studies. In addition, blood cultures were taken from eligible patients presenting at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, as part of routine diagnosis. Inclusion criteria were measured or reported fever, or clinical suspicion of sepsis. Microbiologically, we identified Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) isolates with a ciprofloxacin non-susceptible phenotype from blood cultures, and used whole-genome sequencing to identify drug-resistance mutations and phylogenetic relationships. We constructed generalised linear regression models to investigate associations between the number of ciprofloxacin prescriptions given per month to study participants and the proportion of S Typhi isolates with quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations in the following month. From 46 989 blood cultures from Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, 502 S Typhi isolates were obtained, 30 (6%) of which had either decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility, or ciprofloxacin resistance. From 11 295 blood cultures from STRATAA and TyVAC studies, 241 microbiologically confirmed cases of typhoid fever were identified, and 198 isolates from 195 participants sequenced (mean age 12·8 years [SD 10·2], 53% female, 47% male). Between Oct 1, 2016, and Aug 31, 2019, of 177 typhoid fever cases confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, four (2%) were caused by S Typhi with QRDR mutations, compared with six (33%) of 18 cases between Sept 1 and Oct 31, 2019. This increase was associated with a preceding spike in ciprofloxacin prescriptions. Every additional prescription of ciprofloxacin given to study participants in the preceding month was associated with a 4·2% increase (95% CI 1·8-7·0) in the relative risk of isolating S Typhi with a QRDR mutation (p=0·0008). Phylogenetic analysis showed that S Typhi isolates with QRDR mutations from September and October, 2019, belonged to two distinct subclades encoding two different QRDR mutations, and were closely related (4-10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) to susceptible S Typhi endemic to Blantyre. We postulate a causal relationship between increased ciprofloxacin prescriptions and an increase in fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility in S Typhi. Decreasing ciprofloxacin use by improving typhoid diagnostics, and reducing typhoid fever cases through the use of an efficacious vaccine, could help to limit the emergence of resistance.

        "abstract": "In this priority-setting exercise, we sought to identify leading research priorities needed for strengthening future pandemic preparedness and response across countries. The International Society of Global Health (ISoGH) used the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method to identify research priorities for future pandemic preparedness. Eighty experts in global health, translational and clinical research identified 163 research ideas, of which 42 experts then scored based on five pre-defined criteria. We calculated intermediate criterion-specific scores and overall research priority scores from the mean of individual scores for each research idea. We used a bootstrap (n = 1000) to compute the 95% confidence intervals. Key priorities included strengthening health systems, rapid vaccine and treatment production, improving international cooperation, and enhancing surveillance efficiency. Other priorities included learning from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, managing supply chains, identifying planning gaps, and promoting equitable interventions. We compared this CHNRI-based outcome with the 14 research priorities generated and ranked by ChatGPT, encountering both striking similarities and clear differences. Priority setting processes based on human crowdsourcing - such as the CHNRI method - and the output provided by ChatGPT are both valuable, as they complement and strengthen each other. The priorities identified by ChatGPT were more grounded in theory, while those identified by CHNRI were guided by recent practical experiences. Addressing these priorities, along with improvements in health planning, equitable community-based interventions, and the capacity of primary health care, is vital for better pandemic preparedness and response in many settings.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of cholera transmission and burden largely relies on clinic-based surveillance, which can obscure trends, bias burden estimates and limit the impact of targeted cholera-prevention measures. Serological surveillance provides a complementary approach to monitoring infections, although the link between serologically derived infections and medically attended disease incidence-shaped by immunological, behavioral and clinical factors-remains poorly understood. We unravel this cascade in a cholera-endemic Bangladeshi community by integrating clinic-based surveillance, healthcare-seeking and longitudinal serological data through statistical modeling. Combining the serological trajectories with a reconstructed incidence timeline of symptomatic cholera, we estimated an annual Vibrio cholerae O1 infection incidence rate of 535 per 1,000 population (95% credible interval 514-556), with incidence increasing by age group. Clinic-based surveillance alone underestimated the number of infections and reported cases were not consistently correlated with infection timing. Of the infections, 4 in 3,280 resulted in symptoms, only 1 of which was reported through the surveillance system. These results impart insights into cholera transmission dynamics and burden in the epicenter of the seventh cholera pandemic, where >50% of our study population had an annual V. cholerae O1 infection, and emphasize the potential for a biased view of disease burden and infection risk when depending solely on clinical surveillance data.",

        "title": "Genomic insights into virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and adaptation acumen of <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolated from an urban environment.",
        "abstract": "Populations of common commensal bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> undergo genetic changes by the acquisition of certain virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) encoding genetic elements leading to the emergence of pathogenic strains capable of surviving in the previously uninhabited or protected niches. These bacteria are also reported to be prevalent in the environment where they survive by adopting various recombination strategies to counter microflora of the soil and water, under constant selection pressure(s). In this study, we performed molecular characterization, phenotypic AMR analysis, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of <i>E. coli</i> (<i>n</i> = 37) isolated from soil and surface water representing the urban and peri-urban areas. The primary aim of this study was to understand the genetic architecture and pathogenic acumen exhibited by environmental <i>E. coli</i>. WGS-based analysis entailing resistome and virulome profiling indicated the presence of various virulence (adherence, iron uptake, and toxins) and AMR encoding genes, including <i>bla</i><sub>NDM-5</sub> in the environmental isolates. A majority of our isolates belonged to phylogroup B1 (73%). A few isolates in our collection were of sequence type(s) (ST) 58 and 224 that could have emerged recently as clonal lineages and might pose risk of infection/transmission. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids (predominantly) of the IncF family, prophages, pipolins, and insertion elements such as IS1 and IS5 were also observed to exist, which may presumably aid in the propagation of genes encoding resistance against antimicrobial drugs. The observed high prevalence of MGEs associated with multidrug resistance in pathogenic <i>E. coli</i> isolates belonging to the phylogroup B1 underscores the need for extended surveillance to keep track of and prevent the transmission of the bacterium to certain vulnerable human and animal populations. Evolutionary patterns of <i>E. coli</i> bacteria convey that they evolve into highly pathogenic forms by acquiring fitness advantages, such as AMR, and various virulence factors through the horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-mediated acquisition of MGEs. However, limited research on the genetic profiles of environmental <i>E. coli</i>, particularly from India, hinders our understanding of their transition to pathogenic forms and impedes the adoption of a comprehensive approach to address the connection between environmentally dwelling <i>E. coli</i> populations and human and veterinary public health. This study focuses on high-resolution genomic analysis of the environmental <i>E. coli</i> isolates aiming to understand the genetic similarities and differences among isolates from different environmental niches and uncover the survival strategies employed by these bacteria to thrive in their surroundings. Our approach involved molecular characterization of environmental samples using PCR-based DNA fingerprinting and subsequent WGS analysis. This multidisciplinary approach is likely to provide valuable insights into the understanding of any potential spill-over to human and animal populations and locales. Investigating these environmental isolates has significant potential for developing epidemiological strategies against transmission and understanding niche-specific evolutionary patterns.",

        "abstract": "Quantifying contributions of environmental faecal contamination to child diarrhoea and growth faltering can illuminate causal mechanisms behind modest health benefits in recent water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) trials. We aimed to assess associations between environmental detection of enteropathogens and human or animal microbial source tracking markers (MSTM) and subsequent child health outcomes. In this individual participant data meta-analysis we searched we searched PubMed, Embase, CAB Direct Global Health, Agricultural and Environmental Science Database, Web of Science, and Scopus for WASH intervention studies with a prospective design and concurrent control that measured enteropathogens or MSTM in environmental samples, or both, and subsequently measured enteric infections, diarrhoea, or height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) in children younger than 5 years. We excluded studies that only measured faecal indicator bacteria. The initial search was done on Jan 19, 2021, and updated on March 22, 2023. One reviewer (AM) screened abstracts, and two independent reviewers (AM and RT) examined the full texts of short-listed articles. All included studies include at least one author that also contributed as an author to the present Article. Our primary outcomes were the 7-day prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrhoea and HAZ in children. For specific enteropathogens in the environment, primary outcomes also included subsequent child infection with the same pathogen ascertained by stool testing. We estimated associations using covariate-adjusted regressions and pooled estimates across studies. Data from nine published reports from five interventions studies, which included 8603 children (4302 girls and 4301 boys), were included in the meta-analysis. Environmental pathogen detection was associated with increased infection prevalence with the same pathogen and lower HAZ (ΔHAZ -0·09 [95% CI -0·17 to -0·01]) but not diarrhoea (prevalence ratio 1·22 [95% CI 0·95 to 1·58]), except during wet seasons. Detection of MSTM was not associated with diarrhoea (no pooled estimate) or HAZ (ΔHAZ -0·01 [-0·13 to 0·11] for human markers and ΔHAZ -0·02 [-0·24 to 0·21] for animal markers). Soil, children's hands, and stored drinking water were major transmission pathways. Our findings support a causal chain from pathogens in the environment to infection to growth faltering, indicating that the lack of WASH intervention effects on child growth might stem from insufficient reductions in environmental pathogen prevalence. Studies measuring enteropathogens in the environment should subsequently measure the same pathogens in stool to further examine theories of change between WASH, faecal contamination, and health. Given that environmental pathogen detection was predictive of infection, programmes targeting specific pathogens (eg, vaccinations and elimination efforts) can environmentally monitor the pathogens of interest for population-level surveillance instead of collecting individual biospecimens.

Our objective was to determine the frequency of delays in the \"Three Delays-in-Healthcare\", and factors associated with delays, among deceased infants and children in seven countries with high childhood mortality. We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study using data from verbal autopsies and medical records for infants and children aged 1-59 months who died between December 2016 and February 2022 in six sites in sub-Saharan Africa and one in South Asia (Bangladesh) and were enrolled in Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS).

        "title": "Burden of child mortality from malaria in high endemic areas: Results from the CHAMPS network using minimally invasive tissue sampling.",
        "abstract": "Malaria is a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. However, accurate estimates of malaria prevalence and causality among patients who die at the country level are lacking due to the limited specificity of diagnostic tools used to attribute etiologies. Accurate estimates are crucial for prioritizing interventions and resources aimed at reducing malaria-related mortality. Seven Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network sites collected comprehensive data on stillbirths and children <5 years, using minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS). A DeCoDe (Determination of Cause of Death) panel employed standardized protocols for assigning underlying, intermediate, and immediate causes of death, integrating sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory (including extensive microbiology, histopathology, and malaria testing), and verbal autopsy data. Analyses were conducted to ascertain the strength of evidence for cause of death (CoD), describe factors associated with malaria-related deaths, estimate malaria-specific mortality, and assess the proportion of preventable deaths. Between December 3, 2016, and December 31, 2022, 2673 deaths underwent MITS and had a CoD attributed from four CHAMPS sites with at least 1 malaria-attributed death. No malaria-attributable deaths were documented among 891 stillbirths or 924 neonatal deaths, therefore this analysis concentrates on the remaining 858 deaths among children aged 1-59 months. Malaria was in the causal chain for 42.9% (126/294) of deaths from Sierra Leone, 31.4% (96/306) in Kenya, 18.2% (36/198) in Mozambique, 6.7% (4/60) in Mali, and 0.3% (1/292) in South Africa. Compared to non-malaria related deaths, malaria-related deaths skewed towards older infants and children (p < 0.001), with 71.0% among ages 12-59 months. Malaria was the sole infecting pathogen in 184 (70.2%) of malaria-attributed deaths, whereas bacterial and viral co-infections were identified in the causal pathway in 24·0% and 12.2% of cases, respectively. Malnutrition was found at a similar level in the causal pathway of both malaria (26.7%) and non-malaria (30.7%, p = 0.256) deaths. Less than two-thirds (164/262; 62.6%) of malaria deaths had received antimalarials prior to death. Nearly all (98·9%) malaria-related deaths were deemed preventable. Malaria remains a significant cause of childhood mortality in the CHAMPS malaria-endemic sites. The high bacterial co-infection prevalence among malaria deaths underscores the potential benefits of antibiotics for severe malaria patients. Compared to non-malaria deaths, many of malaria-attributed deaths are preventable through accessible malaria control measures.",

        "abstract": "The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) Network programme undertakes post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), together with collection of ante-mortem clinical information, to investigate causes of childhood deaths across multiple countries. We aimed to evaluate the overall contribution of pneumonia in the causal pathway to death and the causative pathogens of fatal pneumonia in children aged 1-59 months enrolled in the CHAMPS Network. In this observational study we analysed deaths occurring between Dec 16, 2016, and Dec 31, 2022, in the CHAMPS Network across six countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and one in South Asia (Bangladesh). A standardised approach of MITS was undertaken on decedents within 24-72 h of death. Diagnostic tests included blood culture, multi-organism targeted nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAATs) of blood and lung tissue, and histopathology examination of various organ tissue samples. An interdisciplinary expert panel at each site reviewed case data to attribute the cause of death and pathogenesis thereof on the basis of WHO-recommended reporting standards. Pneumonia was attributed in the causal pathway of death in 455 (40·6%) of 1120 decedents, with a median age at death of 9 (IQR 4-19) months. Causative pathogens were identified in 377 (82·9%) of 455 pneumonia deaths, and multiple pathogens were implicated in 218 (57·8%) of 377 deaths. 306 (67·3%) of 455 deaths occurred in the community or within 72 h of hospital admission (presumed to be community-acquired pneumonia), with the leading bacterial pathogens being Streptococcus pneumoniae (108 [35·3%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (78 [25·5%]), and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (37 [12·1%]). 149 (32·7%) deaths occurred 72 h or more after hospital admission (presumed to be hospital-acquired pneumonia), with the most common pathogens being K pneumoniae (64 [43·0%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (19 [12·8%]), S pneumoniae (15 [10·1%]), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 [10·1%]). Overall, viruses were implicated in 145 (31·9%) of 455 pneumonia-related deaths, including 54 (11·9%) of 455 attributed to cytomegalovirus and 29 (6·4%) of 455 attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Pneumonia contributed to 40·6% of all childhood deaths in this analysis. The use of post-mortem MITS enabled biological ascertainment of the cause of death in the majority (82·9%) of childhood deaths attributed to pneumonia, with more than one pathogen being commonly implicated in the same case. The prominent role of K pneumoniae, non-typable H influenzae, and S pneumoniae highlight the need to review empirical management guidelines for management of very severe pneumonia in low-income and middle-income settings, and the need for research into new or improved vaccines against these pathogens.

        "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important cause of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis in children, and antibiotic-resistant K pneumoniae is a growing public health threat. We aimed to characterise child mortality associated with this pathogen in seven high-mortality settings. We analysed Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) data on the causes of deaths in children younger than 5 years and stillbirths in sites located in seven countries across sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and south Asia (Bangladesh) from Dec 9, 2016, to Dec 31, 2021. CHAMPS sites conduct active surveillance for deaths in catchment populations and following reporting of an eligible death or stillbirth seek consent for minimally invasive tissue sampling followed by extensive aetiological testing (microbiological, molecular, and pathological); cases are reviewed by expert panels to assign immediate, intermediate, and underlying causes of death. We reported on susceptibility to antibiotics for which at least 30 isolates had been tested, and excluded data on antibiotics for which susceptibility testing is not recommended for Klebsiella spp due to lack of clinical activity (eg, penicillin and ampicillin). Among 2352 child deaths with cause of death assigned, 497 (21%, 95% CI 20-23) had K pneumoniae in the causal chain of death; 100 (20%, 17-24) had K pneumoniae as the underlying cause. The frequency of K pneumoniae in the causal chain was highest in children aged 1-11 months (30%, 95% CI 26-34; 144 of 485 deaths) and 12-23 months (28%, 22-34; 63 of 225 deaths); frequency by site ranged from 6% (95% CI 3-11; 11 of 184 deaths) in Bangladesh to 52% (44-61; 71 of 136 deaths) in Ethiopia. K pneumoniae was in the causal chain for 450 (22%, 95% CI 20-24) of 2023 deaths that occurred in health facilities and 47 (14%, 11-19) of 329 deaths in the community. The most common clinical syndromes among deaths with K pneumoniae in the causal chain were sepsis (44%, 95% CI 40-49; 221 of 2352 deaths), sepsis in conjunction with pneumonia (19%, 16-23; 94 of 2352 deaths), and pneumonia (16%, 13-20; 80 of 2352 deaths). Among K pneumoniae isolates tested, 121 (84%) of 144 were resistant to ceftriaxone and 80 (75%) of 106 to gentamicin. K pneumoniae substantially contributed to deaths in the first 2 years of life across multiple high-mortality settings, and resistance to antibiotics used for sepsis treatment was common. Improved strategies are needed to rapidly identify and appropriately treat children who might be infected with this pathogen. These data suggest a potential impact of developing and using effective K pneumoniae vaccines in reducing neonatal, infant, and child deaths globally. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "The objectives of this study were: (1) to describe burden of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and trends from 1990 to 2019 using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) data, (2) to describe age and sex differences in RA and (3) to compare Canada's RA burden to that of other countries. Disease burden indicators included prevalence, mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). GBD estimated fatal and non-fatal outcomes using published literature, survey data and health insurance claims. Data were analysed by Bayesian meta-regression, cause of death ensemble model and other statistical methods. DALYs for Canada were compared with DALYs of countries with similarly high Socio-Demographic Index values. In Canada, the RA prevalence rate increased by 27% between 1990 and 2019, mortality rate decreased by 27%, YLL rate decreased by 30%, YLD increased by 27% and DALY rate increased by 13%, all age standardised. The decline in RA mortality and YLL rates was especially pronounced after 2002. The disease burden was higher in females for all indicators, and DALY rates were higher among older age groups, peaking at age 75-79 years. Prevalence and DALYs were higher in Canada compared with global rates. Trends in RA burden indicators over time and differences by age and sex have important implications for Canadian policy-makers, researchers and care providers. Early identification and management of RA in women may help reduce the overall burden of RA in Canada.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, the zoonotic transmission of anthrax from animals to humans poses substantial challenges for prevention and control programs, especially in resource-constrained settings. A comprehensive literature review was conducted focusing on anthrax infections in animals, humans, and the environment to enable better design of prevention and control strategies. We followed PRISMA guidelines to collect data on anthrax infection in animals and humans from reports between 1980 and January 2023. We used a standardized data extraction template to collect data on study location, year, hosts, deaths and risk factors responsible for anthrax occurrences at the animal, human and environmental sectors. Subsequently, we conducted a thorough analysis of the data gathered to identify the factors responsible for anthrax occurrences and to propose updated strategies for anthrax prevention and control. Of the 27 articles analyzed, 20 focused on animal or human anthrax, while seven addressed environmental contaminations. A total of 6354 cases of anthrax infection in animals were recorded, with 998 fatalities and an overall case fatality of 15.7 %. In humans, inadequate knowledge about anthrax and its transmission was a significant factor. Risk factors for human cutaneous anthrax included activities such as slaughtering diseased animals and contact with contaminated raw meat or blood. Risky practices such as disposal of animal carcasses in floodwaters or water bodies were observed in some areas, contributing to the persistence of the anthrax pathogen in the environment. Our study highlights the necessity of a multisectoral One Health approach to effectively control and prevent anthrax outbreaks in both animals and humans. This approach should include comprehensive vaccination programs, social and behavioral change activities, environmental management, and the establishment of surveillance systems. Implementing these recommendations will be crucial in addressing the complex challenges posed by anthrax in low-resource settings.",

        "abstract": "The Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) Framework, launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2023, emphasises assessing, strengthening, and scaling up services for the early detection and management of breast cancer. This study aims to determine the feasibility of monitoring the status of breast cancer control in the 21 Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance (ANCCA) countries based on the three GBCI Framework key performance indicators (KPIs): stage at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, and treatment completion. We reviewed published literature on breast cancer control among 21 ANCCA countries from May to July 2023 to establish data availability and compiled the latest descriptive statistics and sources of the indicators using a standardised data collection form. We performed bivariate Pearson's correlation analysis to measure the strength of correlation between stage at diagnosis, mortality and survival rates, and universal health coverage. Only 12 (57%) ANCCA member countries published national cancer registry reports on breast cancer age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR). Indonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal had provincial data and others relied on WHO's Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) estimates. GLOBOCAN data differed from the reported national statistics by 5-10% in Bhutan, Indonesia, Iran, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand and >10% in China, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka. The proportion of patients diagnosed in stages I and II strongly correlated with the five-year survival rate and with the universal health coverage (UHC) index. Three countries (14%) reported national data with >60% of invasive breast cancer patients diagnosed at stages I and II, and a five-year survival rate of >80%. Over 60% of the ANCCA countries had no published national data on breast cancer staging, the time interval from presentation to diagnosis, and diagnosis to treatment. Five (24%) countries reported data on treatment completion. The definition of delayed diagnosis and treatment completion varied across countries. GBCI's Pillar 1 KPI correlates strongly with five-year survival rate and with the UHC index. Most ANCCA countries lacked national data on cancer staging, timely diagnosis, and treatment completion KPIs. While institutional-level data were available in some countries, they may not represent the nationwide status. Strengthening cancer surveillance is crucial for effective breast cancer control. The GBCI Framework indicators warrant more detailed definitions for standardised data collection. Surrogate indicators which are measurable and manageable in country-specific settings, could be considered for monitoring GBCI indicators. Ensuring UHC and addressing health inequalities are essential to early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

        "abstract": "The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) conducts active, case-based national antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance in Bangladesh. The Capturing Data on Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns and Trends in Use in Regions of Asia (CAPTURA) project accessed aggregated retrospective data from non-IEDCR study sites and 9 IEDCR sites to understand the pattern and extent of AMR and to use analyzed data to guide ongoing and future national AMR surveillance in both public and private laboratories. Record-keeping practices, data completeness, quality control, and antimicrobial susceptibility test practices were investigated in all laboratories participating in case-based IEDCR surveillance and laboratory-based CAPTURA sites. All 9 IEDCR laboratories recorded detailed case-based data (n = 16 816) in electronic format for a priority subset of processed laboratory samples. In contrast, most CAPTURA sites (n = 18/33 [54.5%]) used handwritten registers to store data. The CAPTURA sites were characterized by fewer recorded variables (such as patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory findings) with 1 020 197 individual data, less integration of patient records with the laboratory information system, and nonuniform practice of data recording; however, data were collected from all available clinical samples. The analyses conducted on AMR data collected by IEDCR and CAPTURA in Bangladesh provide current data collection status and highlight opportunities to improve ongoing data collection to strengthen current AMR surveillance system initiatives. We recommend a tailored approach to conduct AMR surveillance in high-burden, resource-limited settings.",
