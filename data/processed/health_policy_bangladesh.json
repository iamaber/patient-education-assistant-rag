        "title": "Association of women's empowerment with childhood immunisation coverage in South and Southeast Asia: meta-analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys data from 11 countries.",
        "abstract": "Child health and gender inequalities are significant global public health issues that demand immediate action, particularly in South and Southeast Asian (SSEA) countries where both challenges are prevalent. This study examines the association between women's empowerment and child vaccination coverage in 11 SSEA low- and middle-income countries. Using population-level cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys across 11 SSEA countries, we developed an Individual-Level Women's Empowerment Index (ILWEI) based on three dimensions of women's empowerment: decision-making autonomy, attitude towards intimate partner violence and social independence. A three-stage mixed-effect individual participant data meta-analysis was employed to assess the association between ILWEI and childhood immunisation coverage. In India, 81.28% of women reported participation in three to four decision-making areas, followed by 62.07% in Bangladesh. Full immunisation coverage ranged from 32.43% in Afghanistan to 63.30% in Bangladesh. The association between women's empowerment and vaccination coverage varied across South and Southeast Asia, with the strongest positive associations observed in Pakistan. However, mixed or negative associations were found in countries such as India and Timor-Leste. Our findings indicate that in several SSEA countries, including Pakistan, Cambodia, the Philippines and Afghanistan, higher levels of individual women's empowerment are positively associated with an increased likelihood of childhood immunisation coverage. However, in countries such as India, Myanmar and Timor-Leste, higher women's empowerment was associated with lower odds of childhood immunisation, highlighting potential contextual or systemic barriers that may hinder vaccination uptake. This underscores the critical role of women's empowerment in enhancing childhood vaccination intake while also emphasising the need for targeted interventions to address country-specific challenges. Coordinated, multifaceted strategies are essential to empower women and thereby support the immunisation of children across regions.",

        "title": "Global inequities in the survival of extremely preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Despite the associated major morbidities, advances in neonatal care units have improved the survival rates of extremely preterm infants. However, the varying survival rates make it challenging to set policy decisions around the standardization of care. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the global survival rate of extremely preterm infants and to compare it across different income levels and over time during the last two decades. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google, to identify relevant articles. All peer-reviewed studies reported the survival rate of extremely preterm infants (born before 29 weeks' gestation) between January 1<sup>st,</sup> 2000, and June 25th, 2024, were included. Outcomes were compared between Epoch 1 (2000-2015, Millennium Developmental Goals period) and Epoch 2 (2016-2024, Sustainable Developmental Goals period). DerSimonian‒Laird random effects model was fitted to estimate the pooled weighted outcomes. A total of 217 studies involving 917,176 infants were included. Based on published data, 61.4% (95% CI: 58.13-64.81) of extremely preterm infants survived to discharge, and 51.7% (95% CI: 44.25-59.22) of survivors were discharged without major morbidity. Survival rate was significantly lower in low- and middle-income countries (44.3%) compared to high-income countries (69.3%). Among low- and middle-income countries, survival improved from 38% during the epoch 1 to 44.8% during the epoch 2. While in high-income countries it was 69.9% during epoch 1 and 64.2% during epoch 2. These findings are based on reported literature; may not fully reflect outcomes in low-resource settings where data are limited and underreported. Variability in the inclusion and care of borderline viable infants also contributes to the heterogeneity and uncertainty of the estimates. Survival of extremely preterm infants varies widely across settings, with fewer than half surviving in low- and middle-income countries. While some improvement was observed in these regions during the Sustainable Developmental Goals period, comparisons across epochs and regions should be interpreted cautiously due to differences in data availability and population characteristics. These variations underscore the need for context-specific strategies that balance available resources, cultural values, and ethical considerations. Further population-level data, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, are essential to inform equitable global neonatal care policies. PROSPERO (CDR42023447612 (PROSPERO (york.ac.uk)).

        "abstract": "Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan. UPF consumption varied across South Asia by sociodemographic factors including age, gender, and education. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial when designing interventions aimed at reducing UPF consumption. Our findings of regional variations in the types of UPFs consumed provide valuable insights for targeted interventions. The South Asia Biobank is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",

        "title": "The Cultural Tapestry of Tobacco Use in India: A Narrative Review.",
        "abstract": "In India, both smoking and nonsmoking forms of tobacco are deeply ingrained in cultural and regional customs. Being the largest producer and consumer of tobacco, India witnesses a wide variety of cigarettes, bidis, hookah, chilam, ghutka, pan masala, khaini, and betel quid with tobacco. The consumption of these products is based on sociocultural notions with variations across education, gender, and geography. Historically, smoking is linked with masculinity and authority, especially in rural areas. At the same time, female tobacco use is prevalent in neighboring countries like Bangladesh despite being stigmatized in Indian society. There, women cite oral health benefits and enhanced concentration as justification for consumption. The multifactorial behavior of tobacco consumption is influenced by social and cultural norms and practices. Hookah, cigars, and shisha often symbolize status in social gatherings. In the face of growing knowledge and awareness of its health hazards, strong association with oral precancerous lesions such as oral submucous fibrosis, erythroplakia, and leukoplakia, tobacco remains dangerously addictive and tough to quit. Significant geographic clustering was observed in different states and union territories of India, showing regional influences. Public health initiatives in India should be culturally tailored and area-specific, owing to the strong tobacco habits and cultural underpinnings. Targeted policy modifications that are cognizant of local customs and habits may boost the impact and efficacy of tobacco control programs and substantially lower the nationwide tobacco-related health burdens.",

The 2017 WHO resolution on cancer prevention and control highlighted the importance of developing and implementing National Cancer Control Plans (NCCPs). We reviewed the current landscape of NCCPs in 21 countries of the Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance. We found marked variation in plan status across Asia, with frameworks ranging from comprehensive NCCPs to non-communicable disease plans that include cancer to no plans. Over 90% of plans included components for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention or cancer treatment. Air pollution, a critical and growing cancer risk factor in the region, was addressed in only 43% of plans, with most concentrated in middle-income countries. Treatment protocols were included in 91% of plans, but end-of-life care appeared in only 48%. Stakeholder involvement appeared in 86% of plans, but legal and evaluation mechanisms were less common (57% each). Locally adapted, comprehensive strategies addressing the continuum of care, from prevention to survivorship, supported by strong legal and financial governance structures and enhanced regional collaboration are essential for equitable cancer control.",

        "abstract": "Acute malnutrition (AM) in children under five is a significant global health concern. Community-based management of AM (CMAM) with provision of specially formulated foods (SFFs) is recommended for treating moderate (MAM) and uncomplicated severe (SAM) cases in outpatient settings. Integrating nutrition counseling and cooking demonstrations (NC&CD) into CMAM programs can improve caregiver knowledge and practices. In our parent trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of enhanced NC&CD without SFFs on MAM management. This study examines perceptions and understanding of CMAM among parents, healthcare providers (HCPs), and policymakers in both CMAM and no-CMAM areas. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants who were reflective and willing to share their experiences with the research team. Data collection involved 30 focus group discussions (FGDs), 34 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with parents, 28 key informant interviews (KIIs) with HCPs in Cox's Bazar, and 16 KIIs with policymakers in Dhaka. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo, guided by the concepts of the theoretical framework. Parents and HCPs generally valued CMAM for its SFFs, while parents in the MAM trial's intervention arm preferred NC&CD with incentives. Policymakers largely supported combining SFFs with NC&CD, though some advocated for NC&CD alone as a feasible approach. Challenges identified included workforce shortages, policy gaps, and insufficient prioritization. One-third of HCPs in CMAM areas and most HCPs and parents in no-CMAM areas favored NC&CD. The study highlights the need to continue NC&CD-based CMAM programs with incentives and recommends integrating NC&CD into CMAM guidelines to enhance caregiver awareness. Additionally, increased manpower, policy advocacy, strong government leadership, and preventive nutrition initiatives are warranted to ensure the sustainable effect of CMAM in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Backyard poultry-rearing contributes to income and food security for rural households in low- and middle-income countries. However, poultry are often kept inside the household dwelling at night, posing health risks to the people raising them. Housing poultry separately from the dwelling overnight is a potential intervention to limit exposure to poultry. The aim of this study was to describe practices and determinants of overnight poultry housing in rural Bangladesh as formative research for an intervention to separate young children from poultry and poultry feces. We conducted 19 transect walks in villages across Bangladesh to document overnight housing practices among backyard poultry raisers. We then conducted 27 semi-structured interviews to explore poultry-raising practices, including housing types and materials identified during transect walks. We found overnight poultry housing both inside and separate from the dwelling and found that most poultry raisers who kept their birds separate from the dwelling overnight did so in courtyard sheds. There was a preference and willingness to house birds outside, provided a shed was available, although overnight housing practices fluctuated. Having a shed was a function of household resources, including availability and access to materials and skilled labor, available physical space, area- and village-wide trends, and the preferences and concerns of poultry raisers. We recommend that future studies measuring human exposure to poultry and poultry feces assess exposure prospectively and at regular intervals to capture variations in housing practice, and include assessments of poultry housing hygiene practices. The promotion of sheds for overnight poultry housing may be an acceptable intervention approach in this setting, though programs will need to make recommendations for housing that address the risk of zoonotic disease transmission and accommodate the preferences and constraints of poultry raisers over a one-size-fits-all approach.",

        "abstract": "The internet is one of the essential tools today, and its impact is particularly felt among university students. Internet addiction (IA) has become a serious public health issue worldwide. This multi-class classification study aimed to identify the potential predictors of IA by four severity levels among university students in Bangladesh. We used cross-sectional survey data from 424 university students from different universities in Bangladesh. Data was collected using a self-reported questionnaire, along with an IA test to assess addiction levels. We identified the important features related to IA using the Boruta algorithm. Predictions were made using different machine learning (ML) (decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVMs), and logistic regression (LR)) models. Their performance was assessed using confusion matrix parameters, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and k-fold cross-validation techniques for multi-class classification problems. The prevalence of severe IA was 3.77% among the participating university students in Bangladesh from July 15 to July 22, 2024. University students' backgrounds, depression, anxiety, stress, participation in physical activity, misbehaving with family members, memory loss symptoms, and being COVID-19-positive were selected as significant features for predicting IA. Overall, the RF (accuracy = 0.531, sensitivity = 0.200, specificity = 0.986, precision = 1.00, k-fold accuracy = 0.4858, micro-average area under curve (AUC) = 0.7798) more accurately predicted IA compared to other ML techniques. The ML framework for multi-class classification study can reveal significant risk factors and predict this behavioral addiction more precisely. It can help policymakers, stakeholders, and families better understand the situation and prevent this severe crisis by improving policy-making strategies, promoting mental health, and establishing effective university counseling services. Therefore, raising awareness among the younger generation and their parents about the predictors of IA is important.",

Public healthcare strategies for fracture risk reduction in diabetes include educating healthcare providers, empowering patients, and integrating fracture liaison services for secondary prevention. Community-based awareness programs, digital health solutions, and screening tools such as FRAX® (with diabetes-specific adjustments) facilitate early identification and management. Policies supporting insurance coverage and cost-effective management strategies are likewise crucial. Diabetes-related bone fragility, characterized by altered bone quality and increased fracture risk despite relatively preserved bone density, creates a significant yet underrecognized health burden. Fracture prevention in diabetes is both a clinical necessity and an economic imperative.

It aims to summarize key findings, identify research gaps and provide policy recommendations based on the associations between specific toxicants and disease outcomes. Systematic review. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (core collection), and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) to identify studies on bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogenic activity. This search yielded 11,468 studies, of which 55 met inclusion criteria after screening following the standard methods. A consistent association is found between particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) exposure and increased respiratory infection risk, with PM2.5 particularly linked to increased incidence and mortality in diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Heavy metals, including lead, cadmium, and mercury worsen chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis by increasing body burden and inflammation. The review highlights air pollutants' substantial impact on infectious disease spread and severity while noting a research gap on other pollutants including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Bias assessment indicates around half the studies show low risk of bias; however, potential biases were noted in confounding variables and blinding of outcome assessment. The systematic review emphasizes the need for research on biological mechanisms underlying these associations and the impacts of other pollutants.

In Bangladesh, anaemia affects 38.6% of pregnant women. Although much is known about the prevention of anaemia in pregnancy, it is unknown how women are tested and treated. This study therefore aimed to describe how pregnant women in Bangladesh are tested for anaemia, including variations by social and equity dimensions. We also aimed to explore how women are treated for anaemia and use of intravenous iron in pregnancy. An interviewer-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted in Narayanganj district, Bangladesh, with analysis limited to women who had previously been pregnant (n=1000). Outcomes of interest were anaemia testing, anaemia treatment, and intravenous iron use. We undertook descriptive analyses and derived estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the percentage of pregnant women tested for anaemia stratified by education, wealth, and person making decisions around women's healthcare. Approximately half of women were tested for anaemia in their previous pregnancy (505/963, 52.4%), with lower testing in women with no education (15.8%, 95% CI: 6.0 to 31.3), whose husband had no education (25.6%, 95% CI: 18.2 to 34.2), or in the poorest wealth quintile (34.0%, 95% CI: 27.4 to 41.2). Pregnant women were most commonly tested for anaemia at a private health facility (393/505, 77.8%), by a medical technologist (350/505, 69.3%), using venous full blood count (484/505, 95.8%). Most women diagnosed with anaemia in their previous pregnancy received treatment (135/142, 95.1%). In any prior pregnancies, a small number of women received intravenous iron (33/985, 3.4%). Our study reveals the need for substantial investments to ensure all women in Bangladesh are tested for anaemia in pregnancy. This could be achieved through increasing point-of-care testing in antenatal care. However, health facilities and health workers may need to be prepared for an increase in women diagnosed with anaemia.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been pivotal in the global battle against the pandemic. However, vaccine acceptance remains a critical determinant of their effectiveness. While numerous studies have explored factors influencing vaccine acceptance, there is a notable dearth of research regarding preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) among individuals with chronic diseases (ChD) who are at heightened risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. This study addresses this gap by investigating COVID-19 vaccine preferences and WTP among individuals with and without chronic diseases. Employing a discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach, we interviewed 843 participants to assess their preference for COVID-19 vaccine attributes such as origin, efficacy level, protection duration, and provider. We used a mixed logit model to analyze DCE data and estimated WTP by taking the negative ratio of preference and price parameters. Furthermore, we performed a stratified analysis according to the household head's ChD status. As expected, vaccines with higher efficacy and longer protection are most preferred. Interestingly, our research shows a preference for European and American vaccines over Chinese vaccines. Additionally, this study reveals a preference for private facilities over government facilities for vaccinations among vaccine seekers. Patients with ChD exhibit higher WTP than those without such conditions, demonstrating the group's urgency in becoming vaccinated. Vaccine procurement and administration decisions by health authorities should be evidence-based and reflect public preferences regarding acceptance and WTP. Health authorities should prioritize both high efficacy and long-lasting protection in vaccine procurement, ensuring that neither is compromised. This approach addresses the top concerns of both groups-vaccine effectiveness for the ChD group and extended immunity for the NChD group. This study also informs policy decisions regarding vaccine origin and suggests incorporating private facilities as vaccine administration points to reduce pressure on government facilities.",

APEC-related virulence genes were detected via PCR, while antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using the disc diffusion method and PCR. The overall prevalence of E. coli was 82 %, with similar detection rates in live (83.3 %) and dead birds (81.1 %). In PCR, APEC-associated gene fimC was detected in 95.9 % of the isolates, papC in 36.9 %, and iucD in 15.1 %, with no significant difference between those from live and dead birds. All isolates were multidrug-resistant, where all E. coli isolates from both live and dead birds were resistant to ampicillin (100 %), with high resistance to cefotaxime (live: 100 % vs. dead: 93 %), tetracycline (80 % vs. 88.4 %), nalidixic acid (100 % vs. 62.8 %), streptomycin (66 % vs. 39.5 %), norfloxacin (40 % vs. 20.9 %), and chloramphenicol (20 % vs. 25.6 %). Moreover, genes conferring resistance to tetracyclines [tetA (live: 10/10 vs. dead: 10/10) and tetB (1/10 vs. 10/10)] and beta-lactams [bla<sub>TEM</sub> (10/10 vs. 10/10), bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> (1/10 vs. 4/10), and bla<sub>SHV</sub> (2/10 vs. 0/10)] were detected in isolated E. coli. The results recommend periodic surveillance and policy interventions to mitigate health risks and economic losses.",

        "title": "Determinants of inequalities in health care seeking behavior for childhood illness in Bangladesh: a trend analysis.",
        "abstract": "Worldwide, pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading public health problems; they kill more children under five years of age than any other infectious disease. Approximately two-thirds of all deaths occur in 15 developing countries, including Bangladesh. To achieve the targets of childhood mortality, it is essential to reduce the current rate of under-5 mortality. In Bangladesh, healthcare utilization for childhood illnesses has increased in recent years, but not to a desirable level, and disparities among different groups remain a matter of concern. This study explores the determinants contributing to unequal access to healthcare-seeking behavior for childhood illnesses, namely diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), over the last decade and a half. This study extracted data from the latest three Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2006, 2012-13, and 2019). Children younger than five years with diarrhea and/or ARI 2 weeks prior to the survey were included in the study. The prevalence and association of care-seeking were investigated through a chi-square test and multivariate logistic model applied to identify the determinants of unequal access to healthcare services. Care seeking for diarrhea and symptoms of acute respiratory infections showed a downward trend from 2006 to 2012-13 (30% vs. 18.5%) and an upward trend from 2012 to 13 to 2019 (18.5% vs. 74.6%). Several socioeconomic and demographic factors such as gender, administrative division, children's age, mother's education, household head's education, wealth, and ethnicity were found to have significant associations with care-seeking behavior for children under 5. Gender, division, and age were significant predictors across the three study periods. This study identified some possible determinants of care-seeking behaviors in childhood illnesses. Based on the findings of this research, policymakers should revise the existing policy to increase the utilization rate and reduce inequality in health care seeking for children under the age of 5. Specifically, counseling slum residents provide a provision for subsidizing or providing free health care benefits to the poorest households and enhancing parents' counseling to remove gender bias.",

        "abstract": "Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Bangladesh, are experiencing a nutritional transition characterized by rising unhealthy food consumption (UFC), which increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies and chronic diseases in children. Despite this concern, research on UFC among Bangladeshi children aged 6-23 months is limited. Therefore, this study aims to estimate the prevalence and identify the factors contributing to UFC in this age group. This study analyzed the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 dataset, including 2,499 children aged 6-23 months. UFC was defined as the consumption of sweetened beverages or sentinel unhealthy foods within the past 24 hours. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with UFC. The prevalence of UFC among children was 61.8%, with 49.2% consuming sentinel unhealthy foods and 31.4% consuming sweetened beverages. The strongest predictor of UFC was older child aged 18-23 months (AOR: 3.31, 95% CI: 2.55-4.32), and consuming minimum diversified diet (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.98-3.15). Other significant factors included recent morbidity (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.01-1.53), maternal employment (AOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.04-1.77), media exposure (AOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59), and lower paternal education [primary (AOR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.21-2.44); secondary (AOR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.14-2.18)]. However, maternal decision-making power (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.96) and intended pregnancies (AOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97) were associated with lower odds of UFC. Regional disparities were observed, with higher UFC prevalence in Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, and Rangpur. The study highlights Bangladeshi children's high prevalence of UFC, which demands public health interventions together with integrating behavior change communication into health, community and family-level services.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh first reported Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in 1977 and has seen regular cases since, however, no JEV vaccination program currently exists. A barrier to the use of JEV vaccines has been a limited understanding of the underlying burden. We conducted a nationally representative serological community study in 70 communities in individuals of all ages (N=2,938, October 2015-January 2016). Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies against JEV. We developed spatially explicit serocatalytic models to estimate the underlying force of infection across the country. We then used mathematical models to estimate the annual JE disease burden currently and under different vaccination strategies. The overall JEV seroprevalence in Bangladesh was 3.4% (95%CI: 2.8-4.1, range 0-28% across communities). The annual probability of infection was 0.005 (95%CI: 0.003-0.009), with risk greatest near border regions. We estimated that annually there are 157 clinical cases (95%CI: 89-253) and 31 deaths (95%CI: 18-52). A vaccination strategy in the 10 most affected districts in 60% of 1-15 year olds would require 5 million doses and avert 1 case per 100,000 doses over five years compared to 35 million doses and 0.5 cases averted for a nationwide campaign. No vaccination scenario was cost-effective under a willingness-to-pay of three-times gross domestic product. A spatially targeted vaccine campaign would be most effective in reducing JEV burden, however, would still not meet standard cost effectiveness targets. CDC.",

        "abstract": "The Commonwealth Health Ministers' meetings (2021-2023) identified medicines shortages, pricing, and price transparency as critical issues. This led to the establishment of the Voluntary Information and Price Sharing Database (VIPSD) in 2021, aimed at enhancing procurement transparency, reducing costs, and sharing information on health products amongst member states. However, adoption has been limited due to competing initiatives like pooled procurement systems introduced during the pandemic. This scoping review focused on eight Commonwealth countries: Bangladesh, Dominica, Kenya, Malaysia, Malta, Solomon Islands, South Africa, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Nations were selected to represent diverse health systems, population sizes, and procurement practices. External researchers conducted literature reviews and standardised data collection to ensure consistency. The review revealed varied pricing policies and procurement frameworks. Nations like Malta, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and South Africa had pharmaceutical policies ensuring affordability, while others lacked comprehensive pricing policies. Seven countries implemented pooled procurement programmes, enhancing value and reducing costs; three nations operated national health insurance schemes affecting medicine pricing. Five countries used pharmaceutical management information systems to streamline procurement. Despite these efforts, disparities persist due to fragmented frameworks, stock-outs, budget constraints, and delayed procurement processes. The VIPSD was identified as a potentially transformative tool to enhance transparency, promote fair pricing, improve collaboration, and ensure equitable access to innovative health products. To maximise its impact, the database requires clear scope definition, comprehensive data collection, funding, and robust maintenance. Expanding its adoption could help mitigate price disparities and strengthen medicine accessibility across Commonwealth member states.",

This study aimed to estimate the current prevalence of betel nut chewing, identify the sociodemographic correlates in urban and rural settings, and identify any vulnerable group for future policy-making to address this problem. This is a retrospective study of secondary data analysis based on the data of the Bangladesh Health and Injury Survey 2016. The outcome variable of interest was the self-reported practice of chewing betel nuts. Only ≥ 18 years old participants were considered. In the logistic regression model, the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to determine the correlates of each independent variable. The multivariable model's explanatory variables were all tested to ensure no multi-collinearity in the final model. The prevalence of betel nut chewing was 31.4% among the study population. Multivariate analysis showed that participants aged 65 years and above were 10 times more likely to be betel nut users (AOR 10.17; 95% CI 9.58-10.79), while rural populations were 1.24 times more likely to use betel nut (AOR 1.24; 95% CI 1.21-1.27). Given the significant public health burden, targeted interventions are warranted to mitigate its impact. The findings indicate that betel nut chewing is highly prevalent, particularly among older, illiterate, and rural populations, demonstrating stark social and geographic inequalities. However, as the data were collected in 2016, the current socio-political and economic changes in Bangladesh may have influenced this trend, limiting the direct applicability of the findings to the present context.",

        "abstract": "Excessive screen time is associated with adverse physical and mental well-being for children. Interventions to reduce screen time in different settings have been studied extensively, with mixed findings. We systematically reviewed evidence that evaluated the effects of screen time reduction interventions conducted in school settings on screen usage, physical, and mental health of school children. PubMed, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC) (from inception till 12 September 2024) were searched for relevant randomised and cluster-randomised trials. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool, performed Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis, and rated certainty of evidence using GRADE. Thirty-nine studies (95,033 participants), published between 1999 and 2024, were included. High risk of bias and great heterogeneity contributed to low-certainty evidence for most outcomes. School-based interventions modestly reduced screen time (SMD: -0.10, 95% CrI: -0.14, -0.06, 27 studies, n = 19,751, I<sup>2</sup>: 85%) and increased physical activity (SMD: 0.10, 95% CrI: 0.02, 0.19, 21 studies, n = 14,944, I<sup>2</sup>: 88%). No clear difference was observed in BMI (MD: -0.15, 95% CrI: -0.39, 0.03, 13 studies, n = 4683, I<sup>2</sup>: 51%), although the subgroup of studies evaluating comprehensive lifestyle interventions appeared to show a slight BMI reduction, while studies evaluating screen-time focused interventions showed no difference. School-based interventions modestly reduce screen time and increase physical activity, but their effects on BMI are inconclusive. Variations in local school systems and cultural practices might have contributed to heterogeneity in study findings and should be considered in policy decisions. Future studies should strengthen the cluster-randomization process and include academic performance as an outcome.",

        "abstract": "Globally, about 74% of deaths are attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Tobacco use is one of the key risk factors of NCDs. Tobacco taxes can discourage the use of tobacco. However, how increasing tobacco taxation may reduce the burden of NCDs is not well studied. This study examines whether higher cigarette taxes are associated with reduced premature deaths-death before the age of 70-from NCDs using multicountry panel data. The study analysed country-level panel data of 152 countries from 2008 to 2020 collected from various sources. The annual burden of NCDs was measured by the proportion of deaths due to NCDs before age 70 in each country. The tax rate on cigarettes-both specific and total-was used as a key explanatory variable. Other covariates include MPOWER score net of taxes, tobacco prevalence and other country-level characteristics. Panel data regressions with various combinations of country and year fixed effects were used to estimate the association between tobacco taxation and the burden of NCDs. Cigarette tax was significantly (p<0.05) associated with the burden of NCDs, with an increase in tobacco tax as a per cent of retail price from the current average 47%-75% being associated with a 2-percentage point decrease in the proportion of deaths due to NCDs before age 70 years. A Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations confirmed the robustness of this effect, estimating an average reduction of 1.09 percentage points (95% uncertainty interval: -1.76 to -0.42, i.e. reduction by 0.42 to 1.76 percentage points) in premature NCD mortality. Access to healthcare, obesity, and clean fuel and cooking technology were also found to be associated with the burden of NCDs. The results are robust to various model specifications. The study provides important evidence that increasing tobacco taxation could be an effective tool in reducing the burden of NCDs. Countries aiming to curb the burden of NCDs could consider raising tobacco taxes.",

Combining large-scale natural and social science data from 68 countries (<i>N</i> = 71,922), we develop a measure of exposed population to extreme weather events and investigate whether exposure to extreme weather and subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change predict climate policy support. We find that most people support climate policies and link extreme weather events to climate change. Subjective attribution of extreme weather was positively associated with policy support for five widely discussed climate policies. However, exposure to most types of extreme weather event did not predict policy support. Overall, these results suggest that subjective attribution could facilitate climate policy support.",

By analyzing the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data and accounting for design clustering using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), this study's methodology demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional logistic regression, as supported by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio test (LRT). The study found that basic handwashing facility was significantly linked to the household head's age, partner's education, media exposure, women's empowerment, wealth index, and maternal factors such as - age and education of mothers of under 5 children. Basic sanitation was associated with regional factors, the household head's sex and age, household size, partner's education, working status, wealth index, and maternal factors. Access to basic drinking water was largely driven by the wealth index, while combined WASH facilities were influenced by household head's sex and age, household size, partner's education, working status, media exposure, wealth index, and maternal characteristics. The findings indicate that addressing WASH challenges in Bangladesh requires an integrated, multi-dimensional policy approach that considers key socio-demographic and economic factors-a strategy essential for achieving 6th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG).",

        "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, about 16 % of the global population has a disability, with many residing in developing countries. The Washington Group (WG) on Disability Statistics recommends the WG Short Set on Functioning to foster consistent, internationally comparable measures. However, this data is subject to biases due to societal misunderstandings and misreporting, including false positives and, more commonly, false negatives, particularly in developing countries. This paper examines discrepancies between reported and actual numbers of persons with disabilities and aims to advance methodological approaches and highlight the challenges faced by persons with disabilities in Bangladesh. We employ a classification error modeling framework with a binary response variable and a Bayesian approach to estimate the true percentage of persons with disabilities and investigate associations with social variables. The 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey from Bangladesh serves as our case study. Bayesian analysis suggests a prevalence of 7.71 %-4.8 times higher than the raw estimates-with a notable false negative rate of 0.79 under the WG's initially recommended guidelines, which define persons with \"at least a lot of difficulty\" as disabled. The rate drops to 0.33 when \"some difficulty\" is also included. The findings underscore the detrimental effects of disability on educational attainment, earning capacity, and marital experiences, highlighting the need for targeted support, especially for male persons with disabilities up to the junior secondary level. This study emphasizes the importance of a deeper understanding of the complexities of disability data and the societal structures that influence its reporting to inform effective policy and support mechanisms.",

These biofilm-microplastic complexes protect embedded bacteria from disinfection efforts and facilitate the dissemination of pathogens and antibiotic-resistance genes, posing substantial risks to human health. This review investigates the mechanisms of biofilm formation on various plastic materials and elucidates how these interactions contribute to antimicrobial resistance and contamination in food systems. It also evaluates preventive and remedial strategies, including the development of alternative packaging materials, advanced cleaning protocols, and detection techniques for monitoring biofilm-microplastic complexes. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate contamination risks and enhance food safety and security.

The study also explored how the interventions were evaluated. The methodology of this scoping review followed the extended guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews. Five academic bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar), grey literature websites (Google Scholar, ProQuest, Policy Commons, etc.) and relevant organisational archives were systematically searched for eligible documents. Both peer-reviewed and grey literature studies on mental health interventions for humanitarian volunteers in the context of any type of disaster were eligible for inclusion. Research papers that evaluated any such intervention were also included. Documents that targeted professional humanitarian workers or explored physical health conditions or diseases in disaster contexts, letters to the editor, comments, correspondence and research protocols were excluded. There were no restrictions in terms of the date and language of the documents. A systematic search of the targeted databases was conducted from 12 May 2025 to 20 May 2025. Deduplication, screening and full-text evaluation for the selection of documents were done using the online version of Rayyan. Data were collected and recorded into a structured Microsoft Excel sheet. Two researchers individually conducted the selection of the articles and the extraction of data. A third researcher helped to resolve any discrepancies if required. A total of 2627 documents were retrieved by searching the targeted databases and websites. After matching them with the eligibility criteria, 20 documents were included in the final list. 14 of them were research papers; the rest was organisational literature. All the papers were from 2006 and later, except one that was from 1998. No documents were found from the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan regions. 10 broad categories of interventions were identified, which were either implemented in the field or suggested in the form of guidelines. Most of the interventions were postexposure and preventive in nature. Psychological first aid was the most widely used intervention in this context, being used by the national societies of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Nine of the documents were research papers evaluating the effectiveness of the interventions using different scales and customised questionnaires. Four of them did not observe any notable effect on the mental health of the participants. Over the past two decades, the evidence on mental health interventions for humanitarian volunteers has grown. The reviewed literature documented various interventions and guidelines that need further study and testing to both prove and improve their effectiveness. Organisational policies could incorporate and further evaluate these to ensure the psychosocial well-being of volunteers. A review of research papers on intervention effectiveness found heterogeneity in settings, designs, interventions and methods, precluding a systematic review. More research is needed on individual interventions, volunteer perceptions and comparing interventions to identify the most effective ones. Additionally, comparing pre-exposure and postexposure interventions with multimodal systems that support volunteers throughout deployment is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Food packaging labels play a crucial role in ensuring consumer safety and aiding informed decision-making. However, in Bangladesh, limited research exists on students' understanding and use of food packaging labels. This cross-sectional study assessed the knowledge, practices, and consumer preferences of food labeling among 397 students from various public and private universities across Bangladesh. A self-administered questionnaire, developed based on food safety regulations, was used for data collection. The study employed convenience sampling, and data analysis was conducted using SPSS 27.0, including descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, and Spearman's rho correlation to evaluate relationships between knowledge and practices. The study found that 74.8% of students had adequate knowledge of food labeling, with high awareness of \"Expiry Date\" and \"Nutritional Information,\" but limited understanding of \"Batch Number\" and \"Packaging Symbols\". Only 44.3% demonstrated good labeling practices, with gaps in checking \"Best Before\" dates, allergen content, and barcodes. Gender and residential background significantly influenced knowledge and practices (<i>p</i> < 0.001), with females and urban students performing better. A significant positive correlation (<i>r</i> <sub><i>s</i></sub>  = 0.524, <i>p</i> < 0.01) indicated that higher knowledge led to better practices. Consumer preferences emphasized food protection, quality, and sustainability, with Kraft/Carton as the preferred packaging material. Although students possess sufficient knowledge, their labeling practices remain lacking, highlighting the need for targeted educational initiatives and policy measures to address this gap and encourage more informed food choices.",

        "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is a leading global cause of disability, with the most significant burden now observed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the growing availability of physiotherapy, cultural perceptions and systemic factors may hinder its utilisation in Bangladesh. This study explores how patients with chronic LBP in Bangladesh perceive their condition and the role of physiotherapy. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 Bangladeshi adults (mean age 41.9 years) with chronic LBP (median duration 30 months). Participants were purposively sampled to capture diverse sociodemographic perspectives. Transcripts were thematically analysed to explore lived experiences with LBP and its management. Four interrelated themes emerged: (1) there was limited understanding of the causes of LBP; (2) physician authority strongly influenced perceptions of physiotherapy, reinforcing passive treatment approaches; (3) friends and family, social media, and the internet shaped expectations; and (4) cultural and spiritual beliefs promoted traditional remedies over evidence-based care. As a result of these perceptions, physiotherapy was often viewed as a last resort and was typically limited to passive modalities. Improving LBP care in Bangladesh may require culturally sensitive multilevel strategies, such as public education, upskilling of physiotherapists in active evidence-based interventions, and health policy reforms, to promote the availability of direct physiotherapy access. These strategies could help align patient expectations with contemporary care models and reduce LBP-related disability in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Stateless Rohingya children in Bangladesh's refugee camps, lacking citizenship or legal safeguards, face heightened risks of human rights abuses like child labor and early marriage. This qualitative study explored these challenges, comparing Rohingya and host community children, specifically regarding child labor and well-being. Conducted from February 23 to March 18, 2022, the research employed 20 in-depth interviews with children (aged 11-17) and 20 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders and leaders. Due to restrictions, child interviews relied on note-taking, while KIIs were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. A combination of convenience and purposive sampling methods was used to select participants. Findings revealed that child labor significantly harms well-being in both communities. Children's vulnerability makes them easy targets for exploitation through low wages and intimidation. Economic necessity frequently compels families to send children to work, severely impacting their education and development. Older boys (15-17 years) were more commonly engaged in paid work than girls. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation, increasing child labor in sectors like shop/restaurant assistance and driving three-wheelers. The KIIs identify specific types of labor, such as carrying goods, farming, and construction work, that were prevalent among children. Key drivers included illness of primary earners, lack of access to education, and children needing income for personal expenses. Hazardous tasks like handling gas cylinders or carrying heavy loads pose serious health risks, causing physical pain, injuries, and mental strain. KIIs further highlighted rampant camp issues like child marriage, trafficking, and other violence, disproportionately affecting girls. Urgent, comprehensive interventions are critical. Breaking this cycle requires collaborative stakeholder efforts to establish robust support systems encompassing education, healthcare, and legal protections. Without immediate action, these children's futures remain perilously at risk, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exploitation.",

        "abstract": "Early Childhood Development (ECD) inequality among different socioeconomic groups is a rising concern in developing countries. This paper aimed to identify and decompose the ECD inequality among poor and non-poor groups in Bangladesh. For measuring inequality in ECD, concentration curves and their corresponding indices were used in this study utilizing the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019 data. Furthermore, a standard decomposition approach has been used to decompose the inequality. Findings reveal that children from poor families consistently exhibit lower scores across all ECD domains. Notably, a significant disparity exists in the literacy-numeracy domain, with a concentration index of 0.1825. A lower proportion of poor children (34.17%) meet developmental milestones compared to their well-off counterparts (65.83%). Key determinants influencing ECD outcomes among the poor group include attendance at early childhood education (ECE) programs, sex of the child, multiple childcare involvement of mother, and supervision quality. Additionally, wealth-based disparities in ECD outcomes can be attributed to factors such as maternal education, access to books, nutrition, and the quality of childcare provided. The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy reforms aimed at addressing the specific needs of disadvantaged children, especially for literacy and numeracy skills. By prioritizing poverty reduction initiatives, access to quality Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs, provision of books, improving maternal education, and enhancing supervision quality, efforts can be made to narrow the wealth-based gap in ECD.",

For patients with cancers in Bangladesh, this study aimed to (1) estimate the annual OOP cost of cancers from households' perspective, (2) assess the coping strategies and financial distress, and (3) examine factors associated with OOP cost. We used data from a cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted in three randomly selected hospitals in Bangladesh. A bottom-up micro-costing approach was used to estimate the OOP cost components. We used the logistic regression model and the generalized linear model to examine the determinants of distress financing and OOP cost, respectively. The average annual OOP cost per cancer patient was US$ 6,504 (range, US$ 959 - 29,681), which was greater than 2 times the average annual household income. About 90% of households faced distress financing due to cancer. Having at least one comorbid condition, cancer stage 2 or higher, households having no elderly people, or having treatment abroad was significantly associated with a higher OOP cost compared to those without the condition. OOP cost of cancer treatment and the proportions of patients with distress financing and financial catastrophe are alarmingly high in Bangladesh. Earlier cancer diagnosis and implementation of Government financial health protection schemes are crucial and urgent to alleviate the enormous economic burden and ensure equitable access to care for the patients.",

We aimed to evaluate colonization in communities and hospitals across six LMICs for two clinically-important pathogens: extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). Participants in hospitals and communities provided rectal swabs or stool samples for ESCrE and CRE identification. Isolates recovered from selective agars underwent confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) using Vitek<sup>®</sup> 2, MALDI-TOF, and/or disc diffusion testing. ESCrE and CRE were defined based on established breakpoints of phenotypic resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively, to calculate prevalence of colonization. Community prevalence estimates were weighted to account for sampling design differences. A total of 10,139 participants across the 6 countries provided samples; 63% were females with a median age of 35 years (range: 0-99). Colonization with ESCrE in hospitals was high in all sites (range 34-84%). In communities, ESCrE colonization ranged from 22 to 77%. Prevalence of CRE colonization in hospitals ranged from 7 to 36% and in communities ranged from < 1 to 14%. These findings reveal a high burden of AR colonization in LMICs in both communities and hospitals. Cost-effective strategies to reduce AR colonization burden are needed in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between economic growth and nutrition is not yet fully understood in the context of the new nutrition reality where most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face an increasing double burden of malnutrition. We aimed to investigate the association between early life exposure to economic shocks and multiple forms of childhood malnutrition in LMICs. We pooled cross-sectional data on children younger than 5 years from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 1990 to 2022 and longitudinal income data from the World Inequality Database. An economic shock was defined as any negative income growth and was tested at intensity levels of less than -1%, -5%, and -10%. Malnutrition outcomes variables comprised stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, concurrent wasting and stunting (WaSt), and double burden of malnutrition (child is both stunted and overweight). Adjusted associations of economic shocks, at different critical windows (year of the interview, birth, first 1000 days of life), with malnutrition outcomes were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression models with robust errors. The associations were interpreted using prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs. A total of 1 643 898 children across 230 surveys in 68 LMICs were included in this study. Negative income shocks in the year of interview were associated with a 5·4% (PR 1·054 [95% CI 1·029-1·080]) increase in the prevalence of wasting and a 12·7% (1·127 [1·079-1·176]) increase in severe wasting. A dose-response association according to the intensity levels of income shock in the year of birth was found for stunting (-1%: PR 1·019 [95% CI 1·011-1·027]; -5%: 1·033 [1·025-1·042]; and -10%: 1·061 [1·051-1·072]) and severe stunting (-1%: 1·041 [1·026-1·055]; -5%: 1·059 [1·044-1·074]; and -10%: 1·099 [1·081-1·118]). In children aged 2-4 years, income shocks during the first 1000 days of life strongly increased the prevalence of double burden of malnutrition by 30·3% (PR 1·303 [95% CI 1·221-1·391]), obesity by 14·3% (1·143 [1·046-1·249]), and overweight by 13·8% (1·138 [1·090-1·188]). We also found a strong dose-response association between the intensity of income shock during the first 1000 days and double burden of malnutrition (-1%: PR 1·216 [95% CI 1·141-1·295]; -5%: 1·299 [1·192-1·416]; -10%: 1·350 [1·185-1·537]). Exposure to negative income shocks can significantly increase the risk of various forms of malnutrition during childhood, with critical windows of vulnerability that vary based on the timing of economic instability and the specific type of malnutrition. Policymakers and public health practitioners must recognise these critical periods and develop targeted interventions to safeguard maternal and child nutrition, particularly during times of economic crises.

        "abstract": "Forced displacement has reached unprecedented levels globally, with women and girls comprising over half of the refugee population. In South and Southeast Asia, transit refugee women face unique health challenges, yet their health experiences and needs remain underexplored and underserved. This review explores the existing evidence on the health experiences and healthcare access of transit refugee women in these regions. A search was conducted using PubMed [MEDLINE], Scopus, Google Scholar, alongside UNHCR, WHO, and IOM databases between October 2023 and January 2024. Peer-reviewed and grey literature published from 2013 to 2024 that analysed health outcomes and experiences of transit refugee women in South and Southeast Asia were included. A narrative synthesis was used to identify the major themes related to the health outcomes and healthcare access of transit refugee women. Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria, of which a majority of the studies were from Bangladesh, Thailand-Myanmar border, and Malaysia, mainly drawing insights from Rohingya, Karen, and Chin communities. Key health issues included sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, contraceptive use, HIV transmission, sexual and gender-based violence, and mental health. Distance and availability of health services, spousal consent for health-seeking, out-of-pocket health expenditure, cultural and religious beliefs, and stigmatization were barriers to accessing healthcare. These barriers may contribute to foregoing contraceptive usage, poor family planning, poor HIV-related health knowledge transmission, high psychological distress, and poor mental health outcomes. However, targeted interventions such as having the UNHCR card, the availability of health clinics within camps, recruiting female health workers, provision of counselling and health education programs, can positively influence health outcomes, healthcare seeking and utilization behaviours, and health knowledge transmission. Transit refugee women in South and Southeast Asia face significant challenges due to unmet health needs and limited healthcare access. These insights highlight the need for future health research, programs and policy action to better integrate targeted, gender-responsive interventions that can enhance health access of this vulnerable subgroup regionally.",

The Health care workers (HCWs) are playing vital role to reduce death and sufferings. HCWs are at a high risk of getting the infection and the source of transmission in the community. Addressing the pitfalls in safety practice against Covid-19 pandemic and attempt to solve the issues will definitely improve the strength of fighters and overcome the situation. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess the status of practice of safety tools toward Corona virus disease-2019 (Covid-19) among healthcare professionals. Findings of this study might be utilized for promulgation of policy and program for upcoming days. This cross-sectional survey was conducted among the adult Bangladeshi healthcare professionals of purposively selected three type of healthcare facilities- a Tertiary level hospital: Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University as well as District hospital and Upazila health Complex from highly infected district Narayangonj and low infected district- Brahmanbaria. A number of 241 HCWs were interviewed using semi structured self-administered questionnaire electronically via-email, Facebook Messenger or other social media communication. This study found that a good number (about 14.0%) of the HCWs do not practice frequent hand washing, as defined by at least 3 times during each duty period. Most of the doctors (46.8%) used soap water to disinfectant from Covid-19 which is followed by hexisol (27.9%) and sanitizer (26.5%), whereas more than 55.3% allied health professional used sanitizer for the same purpose which is followed by soap water (29.8%) and hexisol (14.9%). Doctors are more frequent in using all form of disinfectants.more than 90.0% are careful in using their protective equipment and dress. But a significant amount (about 25.0%) of them don't participate in health safety training after the outbreak till the study time. A significant number (30.0%) cannot maintain appropriate quarantine with their family.A significant number of respondents (46.0%) have no home isolation facility. More than 51.0% have no separate donning and doffing room at their workplace. The health care workers serving the Covid-19 diseased patients might be super spreader of this highly contagious disease. Awareness and appropriate safety practice is the burning issue.

IAP has complex mechanisms related to outdoor air pollution (OAP) and various other factors, and their relationship needs to be clarified to examine effective policies. We conducted an indoor and outdoor air monitoring survey in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas in Bangladesh, one of the countries with the most severe air pollution. The results show that IAP is more severe in urban households than in rural households, with a five-fold difference in daily indoor PM2.5 concentration between 117 μg/m3 and 22 μg/m3, respectively. Regression analysis reveals that IAP is strongly associated with OAP and is hardly affected by solid fuels used in well-ventilated outside kitchens. Our findings support the view that the mitigation of IAP in developing countries can be achieved not only through a transition to clean fuels, which often entails substantial costs, but also through more practical and accessible alternatives, such as the use of outdoor kitchens, electric fans, and careful management of behaviors such as indoor smoking and mosquito coil use.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and related health awareness among professional drivers in northeastern Bangladesh using opportunistic random blood glucose (RBG) testing to address knowledge gaps and inform health policy. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,454 participants enrolled between February 5, 2024 and July 27, 2024, using a consent-based questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and RBG testing with a glucometer. Diabetes awareness was assessed using pre-tested questionnaires, while the prevalence of diabetes and associated factors were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U tests, Welch ANOVA, and Spearman correlation analysis. A total of 2.20% of the driver population were found to have undiagnosed diabetes. RBG levels differed significantly across regions. Middle age (7.63%) and overweight (3.77%) groups exhibited the highest prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Confounding variables such as BMI (r = 0.22, p < 0.0001), age (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001), and sleep duration (r = -0.05, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with glucose levels, indicating potential risk factors for diabetes. The obese group (AOR: 3.04, 95% CI: 0.81-11.46) and overweight group (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 0.83-3.99) were 3.04 and 1.81 times more likely, respectively, to develop diabetes compared to the healthy weight group. Participants with less than 7 hours of sleep (AOR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.46-2.75) were also at greater risk. Co-morbidities and a family history of diabetes were also significantly associated with elevated RBG levels. Overall, this study highlights the regional and behavioral disparities influencing the development of diabetes risk among professional drivers, a population often neglected in health policy. It underscores the need for health education and large-scale RBG testing to improve awareness and alert policymakers in formulating effective health guidelines.",

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies were those that reported on menopause-related knowledge, symptom prevalence or management in LMICs. Data were extracted and synthesised descriptively and thematically. From 10,758 records, 252 studies from 41 LMICs were included. Most were cross-sectional (85%) and relied on non-probability sampling (62%), with only 4% being nationally representative. Menopause classification methods were often inconsistent, with only 17.5% of studies using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) +10 or World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. National-level data on age at menopause are lacking across all LMICs. The prevalences of vasomotor symptoms, joint pain and sexual concerns were comparable with high-income countries. However, data on the severity and burden of symptoms were scarce. Knowledge about menopause and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was poor, especially in low-income and rural settings. Cultural stigma, misconceptions and healthcare provider knowledge gaps contributed to low uptake of evidence-based menopause care. MHT use was consistently low, with women predominantly using traditional remedies. Provider hesitancy, lack of training and structural health system barriers were key limitations in service delivery. Despite a growing population of postmenopausal women, menopause remains a neglected health issue across LMICs. There is an urgent need to integrate menopause into reproductive and non-communicable disease policies, invest in provider education and ensure equitable access to evidence-based menopause care, including MHT, for women in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "In 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar to refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh. Peace Winds Japan and Dhaka Community Hospital Trust have jointly operated a primary health center (PHC) at Camp 14 in this region since 2018. Our objective was to determine the effect of Ramadan on clinical visits at this PHC during 2020. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient data, including diagnoses and use of medications, by review of medical records from January to December 2020. We compared the percentage of visits for five health events (acute respiratory infection [ARI], non-communicable disease [NCD], gastritis, female related issues, and injury) for three consecutive 31-day periods: before Ramadan period (BR-period), Ramadan period, and after Ramadan period (AR-period). There were 11,286 PHC visits during 2020. The rate of new patient visits was significantly lower during Ramadan than during the BR-period (aOR: 0.447; 95%CI: 0.356, 0.561; P < 0.001). The three periods had no significant differences in mean patient age, patient sex, or surgical procedures. The most noteworthy differences were fewer visits for NCD during Ramadan than during the BR-period (OR: 0.461; 95%CI: 0.307, 0.693; P < 0.0004); more visits for gastritis during Ramadan than during the BR-period (OR: 1.246; 95%CI: 1.106,1.404; P = 0.0019); and more visits for ARI during Ramadan than during the AR-period (aOR: 1.842; 95%CI: 1.567, 2.164, P < 0.0001). The overall decrease in PHC visits during Ramadan relative to the BR-period may be because these refugees devoted more time to prayer and associated religious practices during Ramadan, and therefore had less time available for visiting the PHC. The sharp decline in PHC visits for NCD and several other health events during Ramadan relative to the BR-period highlights the need to provide improved care for refugees during this period.",

Despite the increasing emphasis on PHC investment, securing sustainable public financing remains a significant challenge in the countries of the South-East Asia (SEA) Region. This study provides an overview of PHC financing arrangements in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Maldives, and Nepal, highlighting key challenges in these four countries. Data sources included the document review (87 documents included across the four countries) and key informant interviews (21 in total). Findings highlight the diverse approaches to PHC financing across the four countries, bringing out common and country-specific challenges. Our findings suggest that while PHC has been receiving more attention in policy agendas, underlying PHC financing functions still face many challenges.

        "abstract": "Sustainable solid waste management is crucial for development, contributing to public health, environmental protection, and economic stability. Effective practices reduce pollution, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve resources through recycling and waste-to-energy innovations. In Bangladesh, medical waste management (MWM) is equally critical for healthcare delivery, playing a key role in safeguarding health, protecting the environment, and supporting economic growth. Despite its importance, MWM services in Bangladesh are underutilised, posing significant challenges. While literature highlights the importance of effective MWM in low-income countries and its impact on public health and the environment, it often lacks a socio-economic or institutional perspective on policy issues. This study explores Bangladesh's MWM capacity through a qualitative approach, analysing policy documents, interviewing Key Informants (KIs) from various organisations, and observing healthcare establishments (HCEs). Using Walt and Gilson's Policy Triangle Framework (1994), it identifies the strengths and weaknesses of current policies and practices and comes up with recommendations for sustainable practice interventions. Document analysis reveals that Bangladesh introduced a MWM policy in 2008, several decades after its independence. While the policy outlined the characteristics of medical waste, introduced the use of colour-coded bins for segregation, and defined the roles and responsibilities of government and non-government authorities, it failed to address the associated health and environmental risks comprehensively. Moreover, the policy has not been reviewed or updated in alignment with the WHO's 2018 guidelines. KIs reported poor collaboration and coordination among policy actors and unclear operation of MW committees at different government levels. Field observations indicated inadequate training, motivation, and ethics for waste handlers, a lack of public awareness, and no record-keeping of MW production and management. Urgent policy revisions, stakeholder collaboration, enhanced training, awareness programmes, and citizen empowerment and engagement are crucial for achieving sustainable MWM practices in wider community.",

        "abstract": "Community-based longitudinal data on factors linked to bacterial vaginosis (BV) during and after pregnancy in Bangladesh are limited. Using data from a rural randomized trial of vitamin A and β-carotene supplementation, we examined factors associated with Nugent-score-assessed BV. Self-collected vaginal swabs from 1,812 participants were obtained in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and 3 months postpartum for Nugent scoring. We analyzed associations between participant factors and Nugent-BV (scores 7-10 vs. 0-6; 4-10 vs. 0-3) at each time point. Bivariate associations were tested using chi-square and t-tests, and multivariable log-binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals. In early pregnancy, consistent soap use during bathing (vs. never/sometimes) was associated with a decreased risk of Nugent-BV 7-10 (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.96). In late pregnancy, Hindu religion (vs. Muslim) (aPR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.72) and higher gestational age (aPR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.35) were associated with increased risk of Nugent-BV 7-10 and 4-10. Furthermore, maternal underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m² vs. ≥ 18.5) (aPR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.87) and having ≥1 antenatal care visit (vs. none) (aPR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.91) were associated with reduced risk of Nugent-BV 4-10. Among multiparous individuals, a longer pregnancy interval of ≥18 months (vs. < 18 months) was protective against Nugent-BV 7-10 (aPR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.81). At 3-months postpartum, vitamin A supplementation (vs. placebo) was associated with a decreased risk of Nugent-BV 7-10, consistent with prior trial findings. Our findings indicate that Nugent-BV during pregnancy and postpartum is linked to modifiable factors, including hygiene, nutrition, birth spacing, and healthcare access. Rigorous randomized trials are needed to evaluate their ability to reduce BV, promote long-term vaginal health, and lower the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The Workload Indicators of Staffing Needs (WISN) is a tool used to estimate health workforce requirements for national or sub-national regions and health facilities. We determined the implementation of WISN for six countries in the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region (WHO-SEAR). This research ascertained whether WISN's recommendations were adopted and operationalised after the initial assessment. This will then help policymakers identify implementation barriers and enablers for the successful implementation of WISN for the improvement of access to health workforce. We used a multi-method approach comprising qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, literature reviews and document reviews. First, we conducted a desktop review to understand the context of WISN implementation in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Second, we interviewed a key policymaker responsible for the implementation of WISN in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and India. Interviews were undertaken virtually, in English using Microsoft Teams virtual software and auto transcribed and recorded using Microsoft Teams. Literature reviews were conducted using electronic databases, documents and reports were sourced from the WHO-SEAR office and/or country of interest's focal persons. Findings from the different methods were synthesized, triangulated and presented using four themes, namely, initial implementation, key findings, primary lessons and directions forward. This study found a high utility of WISN on informing policymakers of the health workforce needs or surplus once the service activity standards were determined. However, all the countries did not have pre-defined service standards and they did not always have the required service data or health information. For WISN to be of utility, countries need to first strengthen their health workforce information systems and digitize workload standards. Furthermore, the government treasury and the employing ministry must be involved at early stages of the planning process to ensure easy phasing in and adaptation of recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

We performed equity analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials in nine countries (N=37,707 children) to assess SQ-LNS effects on child growth, development, and anemia across levels of an international wealth index. Benefits of SQ-LNS were consistent across the wealth spectrum, leading to similar improvements in child growth, development, and anemia regardless of wealth.

However, this collaboration has not been translated into actionable control policies, which coupled with low vaccination coverage, impose a substantial health and economic burden in Bangladesh. Critical gaps remain in understanding the influenza burden among high-risk populations and the barriers influencing their vaccine uptake. These gaps hinder the development of evidence-based strategies for prevention and control, consequently leaving the country vulnerable to a potentially catastrophic influenza epidemic. These challenges require a multifaceted approach, including continuous local data collection on disease burden and vaccine barriers, vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses, and the design of context-specific interventions. Leveraging existing infrastructures offers opportunities to develop tailored strategies for high-risk populations.

        "abstract": "Palliative care aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses through effective pain management with opioids. Despite its global importance, opioid use in palliative care faces significant challenges, particularly in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, opioid use is notably low, with disparities between urban and rural areas. Cultural stigmas, strict regulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training further obstruct effective pain management. This study aims to explore the challenges healthcare providers face regarding opioid use in both hospital and home-based palliative care settings. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using face-to-face semistructured interviews with 135 licensed healthcare providers from August to September 2022. The respondents, predominantly young (57% aged 20-39) and female (68.9%), primarily manage late-stage cancer patients (98.5%), with pain (100%) being the primary symptom treated. Morphine syrup is commonly used (68.1%), whereas oxycodone and buprenorphine are unavailable. Side effects such as deep sedation (43.7%) and addiction (34.1%) highlight the need for careful monitoring. Limited awareness (10.4%) of national opioid policies results in inconsistent practices (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Prescribing restrictions (60.7%) and dispensing rights issues contribute to operational challenges, affecting patient access to pain management. Misconceptions about palliative care (32.6%) and inter-departmental non-cooperation (38.5%) hinder patient referrals (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and continuity of care. Inconsistent awareness of opioid policies causes varied practices and attitudes. Addressing referral challenges and prescribing restrictions requires interdisciplinary solutions, enhanced education, better policy dissemination, and standardized guidelines for effective palliative care opioid management.",

Most of the Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh have no access to dental care. The objective of this study was to report on the OH behaviours and utilisation of an emergency dental service in the camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. This study utilised the data from clinical records of Rohingya refugees attending an emergency dental clinic in camp four in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh from February 2019 to March 2020. Data included education levels, OH practices, tobacco consumption, diagnosis and treatment provided. Descriptive analysis of the data was undertaken. A total of 4111 patients were included, of which 50.1% were female. Education levels were very low, with 75.8% reporting no formal education. Although daily toothbrushing was reported by 64.4%, there was significant variation in the materials used for a dentifrice, with 78.1% using abrasive substances. Tobacco use was high, with 65.7% reporting its use, and of those, 95.4% chewed paan. Pain was the commonly reported symptom (87.1%) and nearly half, 46.9%, reported poor OH. Functional difficulties and problems sleeping were highly prevalent, at 85.3% and 51.6% respectively. A high prevalence of caries was reported, at 79.8%, and a mean number of 2.8 teeth affected.

        "abstract": "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading global cause of maternal deaths, with over 70,000 annual deaths. Low- and middle-income countries disproportionately bear this burden, often due to compromised cold chains for oxytocin and insufficient staff training. This review synthesized thirty publications on heat stable carbetocin (HSC) published from January 2018-March 2025. Eligible studies include randomized trials, systematic and narrative reviews, cost or economic evaluations, and implementation studies. Study findings were categorized into clinical efficacy and safety of HSC, cost-effectiveness, and adoption barriers and facilitators from field implementation, and sustainability strategies. Several large-scale trials, especially the CHAMPION trial, demonstrated that HSC is clinically non-inferior to oxytocin. In a pilot study from Nigeria (n = 18,364 deliveries), 56% of women received HSC for PPH prevention and PPH incidence dropped to 0.8%. Cost models from India estimated that HSC could prevent about 5,500 additional PPH cases and save five maternal lives per 100,000 births when priced comparably to oxytocin. Programs in Kenya and conflict-affected South Sudan achieved >90% coverage of HSC by implementing WHO policy updates, pooled procurement, simulation drills for frontline health workers, and appointing \"PPH champions\". Awareness of uterotonics and PPH danger signs among postpartum women increased from 48% to 81% after community-based intervention in Kenya. The thermostability of HSC (up to three years without refrigeration at a temperature of ≤30°C) addresses gaps in cold chain associated with oxytocin and reduces wastage from degradation. Integrating HSC with tranexamic acid and other postpartum haemorrhage bundle elements further improved maternal outcomes. Heat-stable carbetocin offers a viable, cost-effective uterotonic strategy in LMIC settings. Consistent training, supportive supervision, regulatory oversight, and domestic funding, including private sector investment, are critical to achieving widespread adoption of HSC in LMIC. Expanding HSC across resource-limited settings could substantially reduce PPH-related deaths and accelerate maternal survival goals.",

There are several established approaches to measure environmental and health impacts from HCWM. Amidst, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is one of the most popular tools to evaluate such impacts. This research was conducted to compare environmental impacts, and Microplastics (MPs) and Heavy Metals (HMs) emissions through LCA from HCWM between public and private Healthcare Facilities (HCFs) in Chattogram, Bangladesh. Five case studies were conducted based on the size of HCFs including one ideal scenario (developed with minimum impacts). The LCA was evaluated by SimaPro version 9.5.0.0 software and the ReCiPe 2016 method. Results revealed that private HCFs highly contributed to the eighteen studied impact categories. The main impact categories were human toxicity, global warming, ecotoxicity, eutrophication, acidification and resource scarcity. The existing common Healthcare Waste (HCW) disposal options were waste transport, open burning, recycling and dumping. The ranges of major impacts from HCWM were global warming (0.588-1.122 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq), followed by human non-carcinogenic toxicity (0.002-0.003 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.) and ecotoxicity (0.000-0.001 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq.). It demonstrated that dumping of HCW, landfill leachate, open burning/ incineration ash and recycling processes along with wastewater of recycling plants are the potential sources of HMs (up to 14480 mg/kg waste) and MPs (1906-7223 items/kg waste) pollution. This study demonstrates the potential levels of environmental impacts along with HMs and MPs emissions from the HCWM system, which will facilitate the relevant authorities and policy makers to adopt the required strategies.",

By identifying mortality risk factors, we aim to inform policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve preparedness for future pandemics. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Data were gathered from the hospital's electronic medical records between July 2021 and September 2021. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 218 patients with complete medical records were selected for the analysis. The independent variables examined included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. To assess in-hospital mortality, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis employing the Delta method. The study included 218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, primarily male (51.4%) with an average age of 56.4 years (standard deviation of 15 years). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 18.3%. Older age (≥60) (RR:3.10, 95% CI: 1.16-8.29), long-standing hypertension (≥5 years) (RR:2.78, 95% CI:1.54-5.02), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR:4.43, 95% CI:2.93-6.70) were significant risk factors for mortality. Patients with diabetes (≥3 years) had a moderately increased risk (RR:1.68, 95% CI: 1.01-2.83). Notably, shorter hospital stays (≤7 days) were associated with higher mortality, potentially due to delayed treatment initiation. Moreover, Vaccinated patients have a significantly lower risk of death (RR: 0.07) compared to unvaccinated patients, highlighting the protective effect of vaccination. Greater lung involvement (especially in lower lobes) and higher Total Severity Scores (TSS ≥ 14) strongly predict COVID-19 mortality, with non-survivors exhibiting significantly worse radiographic damage. Age, particularly when combined with chronic conditions like hypertension or chronic kidney disease, is a key predictor of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. While gender is not an independent risk factor, males tend to have higher mortality rates. Delayed treatment, reflected by shorter hospital stays, also increases risk. Vaccination markedly lowers mortality. In resource-limited settings, lower lobe involvement >50% and TSS ≥ 14 can serve as early triage markers to guide ICU admission or intensified care. These indicators should inform risk assessment tools, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to reduce pandemic-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to government-imposed mobility restrictions, social distancing, and lockdowns, altering the caregiving environment worldwide. In South Asia, it is unknown what aspects of these changes posed significant emotional costs to informal carers, or how such costs can be mitigated in future pandemics. To identify environmental change aspects (dimensions) that posed distinct emotional costs for South Asian carers. To quantify the costs and classify them as persistent, transient, hidden, or insignificant. To propose ways of mitigating carer distress during future pandemics. The data came from the Coping with Loneliness, Isolation, and COVID-19 Caregiver survey. Carers (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>454</mn></math>) in Bangladesh (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>123</mn></math>), India (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>116</mn></math>), and Pakistan (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>215</mn></math>) self-reported their experiences before/during the pandemic. The dimensions were extracted from 11 change indicators. A dimension's emotional costs were its effects on (1) the change in burden frequency relative to pre-pandemic conditions and (2) the during-pandemic burden frequency. Five factors emerged: social confinement, reduced/missing information on the recipient, loss of connection, restricted visitation rights, and protective clothing. Social confinement (loss of connection) increased both changes in burden frequency and during-pandemic burden frequency, indicating a persistent emotional cost to carers. Restricted visitation rights affected only pandemic burden frequency, indicating a hidden emotional impact. Social confinement (loss of connection, restricted visitation rights) was emotionally costly because it forced an increase (decrease) in care intensity relative to pre-pandemic levels. Through enhanced counseling and emotional support services, South Asian public health systems can alleviate carers' private suffering during normal times and future crises.",

        "abstract": "Early and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is central to ensuring the proper treatment and curbing the transmission of the disease. Despite the significant burden, the diagnosis of peripheral lymph node(LN)TB, the most prevalent form of extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), has been challenging in low resource settings. To meet the existing needs, the Mobile-TB-Lab study set out to evaluate two innovative approaches, including thermal imaging and recombinase-aided amplification assay (RAA) in Minoo for point-of-need diagnosis of LNTB. The synergy of these index tests is expected to pave the way for rapid detection of EPTB in resource-constrained settings. Mobile-TB-Lab is a multicountry diagnostic evaluation study to be performed in Bangladesh and Uganda. Under this protocol, a total of 200 suspected EPTB patients with cervical lymphadenitis will be enrolled from tertiary healthcare facilities in Bangladesh and Uganda. Each participant will be subjected to laboratory investigations including microscopy, real-time PCR, cytology, culture and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra with the tissue sample following fine-needle aspiration (FNA). As the index tests, thermal imaging will be performed before performing the FNA, and the leftover aspirate will be used to perform RAA in the Minoo device. The diagnostic efficiency of the index tests will be determined against a composite reference standard based on the laboratory methods. Besides, latent class analysis will be performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests. Finally, health economic evaluation will be performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the investigative methods. The study protocol (PR-23031) has been approved by the research review committee (RRC) and the ethical review committee (ERC) under the institutional review board (IRB) of icddr,b in Bangladesh. In Uganda, the study protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University under reference number IDI-REC-2023-62 and approval from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST) under reference number HS3494ES. All the study materials and procedures to be used for the enrolment of the participants have been approved by the ethical review committee. The study will be performed according to the declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice to ensure the participants' rights, safety and well-being. The findings from this study will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international meetings.",

        "abstract": "To develop the Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) for children aged 24-59 months and evaluate its performance in predicting outcomes related to nutrient adequacy and diet-related noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk. The GDQS is a food-based metric developed and validated for capturing diets' contributions to nutrient adequacy and NCD risk among adult men and nonpregnant and nonlactating women aged ≥15 years globally. Despite the importance of ensuring healthy diets in preschool children and the need for systematic monitoring, no food-based metrics exist that holistically measure diet quality among children aged 24-59 months in diverse populations. We developed candidate versions of the GDQS for children aged 24-59 months by adapting the gram cutoff values used for adults to account for children's lower energy requirements. Using dietary data sets from Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, China, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we evaluated candidate versions' performance in predicting energy-adjusted nutrient intakes and adequacy, nutritional biomarkers, and overweight using Spearman's correlation and multivariable-adjusted regression models, and we statistically compared performance of the strongest candidate with that of the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W) indicator and Global Dietary Recommendations (GDR) score. The GDQS exhibited significant (P < .05) positive correlations with energy-adjusted intakes of protein, fiber, and most micronutrients in most data sets; significant negative correlations with added sugar and saturated fat in 2 data sets; and inconsistent correlations with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. In multivariable-adjusted models, the GDQS, MDD-W, and GDR were positively associated with serum folate in Ethiopia (and the GDQS was in the United Kingdom), and the GDR was positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in China (P < .05). The GDQS was more strongly associated with the mean probability of adequacy of 8 nutrients than the GDR in 2 data sets, whereas the MDD-W outperformed the GDQS in 3 data sets (P < .05). The GDQS is a useful metric for measuring diet quality among children aged 24-59 months in diverse populations.",

        "abstract": "The built environment around schools that are regularly accessed by young people is determined by governments, national and regional policies in each country or region. Zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol sales are expected to restrict availability and access by young people. This study aimed to examine (non) compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations around schools in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a representative sample of geographic locations in Bangladesh, India North (Delhi) and India South (Chennai), Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the built environment was mapped by systematically walking all streets within the site boundary to collect data on different types of tobacco and alcohol retailers and schools. Data was collected on KoboToolBox, and the maps indicating zoning compliance were created using ArcGIS. Descriptive analysis of outlet compliance to the zoning laws was conducted at the national and school levels, with heterogeneity analyses done by school type, income level and outlet type for tobacco and alcohol. The zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol differed among the settings ranging from 50 to 100 m for tobacco and absolute bans to 500 m for on-premise alcohol. Among the five different settings within the four countries, 441 areas were studied, including 3615 schools. Non-compliance with the zoning laws is evident in all jurisdictions for both tobacco and alcohol. Within restricted zones around schools (location non-compliant with zoning laws), 12-38% of outlets selling tobacco and 16% to 100% of outlets selling alcohol were identified. For supply non-compliance, 3-70% of shops within the school buffer zones were selling tobacco, while only 0.2-1% of shops were selling alcohol. Non-compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations has been observed around schools in Bangladesh, India (North and South), Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Within each country, there was a higher percentage of alcohol outlets that were location non-compliant than for tobacco, except for South India. In India and Sri Lanka, there was a higher percentage of supply non-compliance for tobacco than alcohol. This study calls for governments to strictly enforce existing zoning regulations that are expected to restrict access to tobacco and alcohol for young people.",

        "abstract": "Achieving adequate nutrition for vulnerable populations is central to the second Sustainable Development Goal. Nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs combined with social and behavior change communication (SBCC) interventions can support this goal, particularly in developing countries. However, systematic evidence on the impact of integrating SBCC strategies into these programs is limited, especially concerning anthropometric outcomes, dietary diversity, food consumption, and food security. This systematic review aimed to assess the importance of integrating SBCC interventions into nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs for optimal nutritional outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched for original research articles before December 2024. A total of 15 publications, involving data from multiple households, mothers, and children, were identified. All extracted data were compiled, compared, and critically analyzed. The review included 7 randomized controlled trials, 5 cluster-randomized trials, and 3 descriptive studies. Most studies demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and child dietary diversity, household food consumption, and minimum meal frequencies. Knowledge and practices around exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding also improved substantially. Among children, stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence decreased significantly, with effect sizes indicating meaningful public health impacts. However, the sustainability of these outcomes depended on the follow-up duration. Notably, none of the included studies exhibited a high risk of bias, reinforcing the reliability of the findings. Integrating SBCC into nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs is effective in achieving clinically significant nutritional outcomes for vulnerable populations. While the findings suggest sustained benefits, further research is needed to determine optimal entry points, effective messaging, advocacy strategies, and communication channels. This is particularly critical for lower-and middle-income countries, where malnutrition remains a critical challenge. PROSPERO registration no. CRD42023452510.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Stunting remains a significant global health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Globally, around 22% of children under five are affected, with high rates persisting in South and Southeast Asia. This review examines government-led programs in high-performing LMICs (Nepal, Bangladesh, and Vietnam) to identify key strategies and opportunities for effective intervention. <b>Methods</b>: A literature search was conducted on PubMed using keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms, including \"stunting\", \"child undernutrition\", \"malnutrition\" and the names of the three specified countries. Articles were evaluated for relevance based on their focus on stunting prevalence, risk factors, and interventions in these countries, without restrictions on publication date or language. <b>Results</b>: Stunting prevalence among children under five has significantly declined in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Vietnam over the past two decades, reflecting the impact of sustained nutrition and health interventions. Nepal reduced stunting from 55.8% in 2000 to 26.7% in 2022, Bangladesh from 54.7% to 26.4%, and Vietnam from 41.5% to 19.3%. Successful strategies included multisectoral approaches integrating nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions, enhanced policy frameworks, and strong governance. Despite progress, challenges remain, such as high wasting prevalence in Nepal and disparities among marginalized communities in Vietnam, emphasizing the need for targeted, context-specific interventions. <b>Conclusions</b>: Effective stunting reduction requires multisectoral strategies addressing underlying, intermediate, and immediate determinants. Insights from Nepal, Bangladesh, and Vietnam highlight the importance of sustained government commitment, robust policies, and coordinated interventions. Adapting these successful strategies to local contexts can support stunting prevention and management, promoting healthier and more resilient communities.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh faces one of the highest global burdens of maternal and newborn deaths, primarily caused by hemorrhage and eclampsia/preeclampsia. Despite reducing maternal mortality by 40%, comprehensive medical interventions remain insufficient in health facilities. This study assessed the readiness of sub-district hospitals in Bangladesh to provide Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) and analyzed the association between facility readiness and delivery rates. Using Health Facility Assessment Survey data from 140 hospitals in 2014 and 141 in 2017, facility readiness was measured based on nine signal functions: administering antibiotics, oxytocin, and anticonvulsants; providing blood transfusions; performing cesarean and assisted vaginal deliveries; managing retained placentas and products of conception; and neonatal resuscitation. Donabedian's model guided the analysis. Multiple linear regression examined associations between facility readiness and delivery rates using 2017 data. Between 2014 and 2017, the availability of signal functions such as oxytocin (85% to 95%), anticonvulsants (58% to 63%), and blood transfusions (22% to 38%) improved. In 2014, 77% of facilities had at least 5 signal functions, 49% had 7, and 6% had all 9. By 2017, these increased to 83%, 56%, and 8%, respectively. Despite these improvements, the mean readiness index remained nearly unchanged (0.67 in 2014 vs. 0.69 in 2017). Only 8% of facilities performed fewer than 52 deliveries annually in 2017, while 26% conducted over 500. Regression analysis revealed a significant association between readiness scores and delivery rates (p =  0.009). While certain indicators improved, overall readiness stagnated due to shortages of anesthetists, gynecologists, and essential supplies. With 64% of surveyed sub-district hospitals classified as comprehensive care facilities, resource and staffing investments are crucial to enhance readiness and reduce maternal and newborn mortality.",

        "abstract": "Conservation strategies often overlook genetic diversity, which is essential for biodiversity preservation and species adaptability. Efforts are minimal for low-income countries like Bangladesh. The current study assessed the population variances of <i>Labeo rohita</i>, a commercially important freshwater fish of Bangladesh, to find the impact of historical policy efforts in conserving diversity. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial <i>cytochrome b</i> gene (<i>cytb</i>) of 137 samples, originating from three major rivers (Padma, Jamuna, and Halda) and from randomly sampled cultured individuals, were analyzed. Significant differentiation was detected among the groups, with most genetic variation (90.35%) within groups. Eleven haplotypes were identified, including the most frequent haplotype (Hap1BD, 107/137). The geographically isolated Halda subpopulation, with earlier stronger conservation policy, displayed the highest haplotype (0.494) and nucleotide diversities (0.00133) compared to those of the Padma and Jamuna. The culture group also showed distinct diversity and haplotype patterns, which indicate an admixture of <i>L. rohita</i> fishes from different sources, including the Halda subpopulation. Pair-wise FST analysis indicated minimal genetic divergence between the Padma and Jamuna samples (FST = 0.00376), reflecting their geographical connections and moderate conservation strategies. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses revealed two distinct genetic clusters, with Jamuna and Padma clustering separately from the Halda subpopulation. Relatively lower effective population size estimation in both Padma and Jamuna could be a reflection of the loose conservation policy on these two rivers. This connection between conservation rules and genetic diversity in the Halda and other rivers indicates that conservation policy efforts, besides many other factors, might impact genetic variability, offering hope for future biodiversity conservation.",

        "abstract": "Poor diets are associated with all forms of malnutrition and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Data on dietary patterns are scarce in South Asia. We sought to describe overall diet quality and intake of foods and food groups at different eating occasions among adults in rural South Asia. We collected cross-sectional data from 5 districts across Bangladesh (n = 2802 individuals), India (n = 1672), and Nepal (n = 1451). The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) application was used to measure food intake on the previous day, with each food tagged to an eating occasion. Diet quality and risk of dietary inadequacy and diet-related NCDs were assessed using GDQS total (0-49 points), GDQS positive (0-32), and GDQS negative (0-17) metrics for overall, healthy, and unhealthy food group intake, respectively. Diet quality was low, with similar scores across countries for GDQS total (17-19), GDQS positive (7-8), and GDQS negative (10-12). Over 90% of adults had levels of GDQS scores associated with moderate/high risk of nutrient inadequacy and diet-related NCDs, with the proportion at high risk in Bangladesh being 2-3× higher than that in other countries. One-third of adults skipped breakfast in Nepal, and snacking was twice as common in males (63%) vs females (33%) in Bangladesh. Lower GDQS total scores (worse diets) were associated with female gender and lower household wealth but not with household production of crops or livestock. These findings may help inform interventions to improve diets in South Asia, focusing on increasing intake of healthy fresh foods, while limiting intake of processed foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat.",

A lack of data on the burden of RSV infections and the impact on health systems in resource-limited settings hinders evidence-based policy decisions. Here, we aimed to assess RSV's burden on the health system in Bangladesh. From January to December, 2019, we conducted a prospective study at Bangladesh's largest paediatric hospital among children aged 0-59 months admitted with a possible respiratory infection, as guided by the WHO RSV hospital-based surveillance case definition. Outcomes for RSV-positive children younger than 5 years were analysed. We also followed up outcomes of children denied hospitalisation due to bed shortages. Adjusted hazard ratios for children denied admission versus admitted were estimated using survival analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with a queueing model were used to estimate the effects of RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab on admission denials and mortality. Of 40 664 children admitted, 31 692 were younger than 5 years; 19 940 were in study wards. Among 7191 admitted with possible respiratory infections, 6149 (85·5%) had nasopharyngeal swabs taken, with 1261 (20·5%) testing RSV-positive. The median age of children who tested positive for RSV was 3·0 months (IQR 1·0-8·0), with a median hospital stay of 5 days (IQR 4-8); 24 (1·9%) of 1261 died in hospital. 8274 (5·5%) of 151 110 bed days were for children who were positive for RSV. Additionally, of 9169 children denied admission, outcomes were tracked for 3928 and compared with 2845 admitted. The hazard ratio for death was 1·56 (95% CI 1·34 to 1·81) for children denied versus admitted, being highest for neonates at 2·27 (1·87 to 2·75). RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab could have reduced denials by 677 (95% prediction interval 63 to 1347) and 1289 (684 to 1865), respectively, potentially preventing 130 (-60 to 322) and 258 (32 to 469) deaths.

        "abstract": "Proper menstrual management is crucial for well-being and reproductive health. Despite global efforts to improve menstrual health, more than 2.3 billion girls and women still lack access to adequate menstrual hygiene facilities. This issue is exacerbated in physically demanding sports, where menstrual health can impact performance. This study examines the menstrual experiences and challenges adolescent female athletes face in Bangladesh. It seeks to identify their current menstruation management practices, assess physical, psychological, and sociocultural challenges during menstruation, and evaluate the facility improvements and support systems needed to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance. A qualitative research design was employed, focusing on a phenomenological approach to understand the lived experiences of adolescent athletes. The study was conducted at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports Education (BKSP), which serves approximately 1,500 female athletes. A purposive sampling strategy selected 32 adolescent athletes for in-depth interviews (IDIs) and two focus group discussions (FGDs), which were segmented by age. Additionally, six key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with coaches and administrative staff. The data were collected through audio-recorded interviews, and thematic analysis was performed. This study revealed that sociocultural taboos and misconceptions significantly affect menstrual management practices among athletes. Physical challenges include discomfort, irregular cycles, and limited access to menstrual hygiene products, contributing to increased absenteeism from training. Psychological impacts, such as concerns about reproductive health and inadequate guidance on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), further complicate the situation. Both athletes and coaches expressed a need for better education and resources. Addressing menstrual management challenges for adolescent female athletes requires a comprehensive approach. Enhanced knowledge and awareness, improved access to menstrual hygiene products, and targeted education for athletes and coaches are essential to enhance menstrual management and athletic performance.",

        "abstract": "Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents the third most common stroke type with unique etiologies, risk factors, diagnostics, and treatments. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

Yet, information about the severity of cholera risk is limited as risk varies over time and changing weather patterns make historical cholera risk predictions less reliable. In this paper, we examine how households use geographically and temporally personalized cholera risk predictions to inform their beliefs and behaviors related to cholera and its aversion. We estimate how access to a smartphone application containing monthly cholera risk predictions unique to a user's home location affects households' beliefs about their cholera risk and their water use and hygiene behaviors. We find that households with access to this application feel more equipped to respond to environmental and health risks and reduce their reliance on surface water for bathing and washing-a common cholera transmission pathway. We do not find that households invest additional resources into drinking water treatment, nor do we find reductions in self-reported cholera incidence. Further, households with a static, non-personalized app containing public health information about cholera exhibit similar patterns of beliefs updating. Taken together, our results suggest that access to dynamic risk information can help households make safer water choices, yet improving design and credibility remain important dimensions for increasing application usability.",

The study investigated the antibiotic-seeking behaviour of Bangladeshi university students and the views of medical and public health experts on the harmful effects of antibiotic overuse on students. Forty in-depth students' interviews and 10 key informant interviews with medical and public health professionals were used to collect data using a qualitative study design and descriptive phenomenology research approach. Thematic analysis technique was conducted to analyse the collected data. The study found university students frequently seek, ask for and consume antibiotics from pharmacies to recover quickly and reduce the time-cost-visit of treatment. In certain instances, medical practitioners recommend antibiotics as a general treatment approach to enhance their popularity among patients and expedite their recovery from illness. However, they are being led into protracted illness due to poor knowledge and excessive usage of antibiotics. Students risk serious health issues by taking unnecessary antibiotics to recuperate quickly, which increases the nation's health burden. The study stresses the need for stricter restrictions and limiting antibiotic availability and intervention in educational, community and policy settings.",

We found that, on average, exposure to TCs in utero or in the first year of life led to 4.4 additional infant deaths per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 8.4; 11% increase compared to the sample average infant mortality rate). This average effect was mainly driven by excess mortality in Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, with small and statistically insignificant effects in all other study countries.

        "abstract": "Early childhood development (ECD) in low to middle-income nations has been a pressing concern for the last two to three decades. It is estimated that approximately 250 million children under the age of five are not reaching their full developmental potential due to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and insufficient home stimulation. It is estimated that in Bangladesh, 44% of the children under 5 years live in poverty and 31% are stunted, and both factors are risks for poor childhood development. We aim to develop a sustainable, scaled ECD programme using an evidence-based curriculum of psychosocial stimulation for disadvantaged Bangladeshi children. Approximately 10,000 malnourished children aged 6-24 months will be identified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 13.5 cm, assessed by government health staff in over 500 community clinics (CCs) in 21 sub-districts of Hobiganj, Brahmanbaria, Laxmipur and Narsingdi districts. The children and their mothers will participate in the psychosocial stimulation programme that will be delivered fortnightly for one year to small groups at the CCs by health workers. We will train approximately 1,500 health staff in rural CCs to deliver the ECD sessions. We will follow a cascade training model to train personnel at all levels of the primary health care system. A subsample will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 48 CCs (24 intervention and 24 control). From each CC, 10 children aged 6-24 months will be tested before and after the programme. The primary outcome is children's cognitive development and we will also measure language composite scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Secondary outcomes are children's growth, maternal knowledge and depressive symptoms, and stimulation in the home. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention effects. There are no existing ECD services for the children under three years delivered by the health care system in Bangladesh. This study will help policy makers to consider incorporating ECD activities into the treatment of malnourished children in rural CCs, under the government's primary health care system, thereby developing a sustainable structure for improving disadvantaged children's development. The findings will also provide information to facilitate scaling ECD in the primary health care systems in other low and middle-income countries.

        "abstract": "The 'Developing and evaluating an adapted behavioural activation intervention for depression and diabetes in South Asia (DiaDeM)' trial investigates a psychological intervention, behavioural activation (BA), on people with both diabetes and depression in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study aimed to aid the intervention and trial design. This was a modelling study using microsimulation to assess the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Diabetes was modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study model based on Pakistani patients and depression was modelled using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) trajectories allowing for multiple depressive episodes. It was assumed that diabetes-related adverse events increased depression recurrence, while depression impacted haemoglobin A1c, increasing diabetes-related events. The model estimated (1) maximum cost of BA which would be cost-effective (headroom analysis) to inform intervention design, and (2) value of reducing uncertainty around different measures (value of information analysis) to prioritise data collection in the DiaDeM study. Analysis was conducted from a Pakistani healthcare perspective over a lifetime with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. BA plus usual care was compared against usual care. BA involved six sessions by a trained (non-mental health) facilitator. The usual care comparator was the prevailing mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used in Pakistan. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Secondary outcomes included life years, healthcare costs and the rate of depression and diabetes-related events. Over their lifetime, individuals receiving BA plus usual care avoid 3.2 (95% credible interval: 2.7 to 3.8) years of mild depression and experience fewer diabetes-related events. BA plus usual care resulted in an additional 0.27 (0.03 to 0.52) life years, 0.98 (0.45 to 1.86) DALYs averted and had incremental healthcare costs of -US$97 (-US$517 to US$142), excluding BA costs. The maximum cost per BA course at which was cost-effective is US$83 (US$9 to US$214). Value of information analysis found the most important measures to include in the trial are the impact of depression on diabetes and PHQ-9 over time. This is the first model to jointly model depression and diabetes for South Asia and uses novel methods to reflect the diseases and inform intervention and trial design. This evidence has helped to inform the design of the DiaDeM intervention and the trial to evaluate it.

This position paper summarizes the current state-of-the-art with regards to milk fat research and industry as well as stakeholder initiatives, and then highlights new developments based on information gathered from North America (United States and Mexico), Europe (United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and Finland), Africa (Egypt), Asia (China and Bangladesh) and Oceania (New Zealand). South America is an important contributor to the dairy industry but will not be considered here and thus this paper must be considered cross-continental rather than global.

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is indispensable for supervising and enhancing the health of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. It helps to reduce the risks of complications and ensures better pregnancy outcomes. This study investigates the aspects that influence antenatal care (ANC) visits in Bangladesh, focusing on sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. The study used nationally representative data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted for bivariate analysis. The Boruta algorithm was utilized for variable selection. After employing various regression models, including Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-inflated Poisson Regression, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB), we evaluated their performance and selected Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) for parameter estimation and interpretation. Our results reveal that less than 50% of women meet the WHO-recommended minimum of four ANC visits. Rural women were 12% less likely than urban women to receive antenatal care (ANC) visits, indicating an urban-rural discrepancy. Women with secondary and higher education levels were significantly more likely to have frequent visits, with incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.51), respectively. Similarly, women from households with rich wealth status (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) and those exposed to media coverage (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14-1.25) were more likely to attend frequent ANC visits. Conversely, women with higher birth order (IRR: 0.95 & 0.84, 95% CI: 0.90-1.00 & 0.76-0.92), unintentional pregnancy (IRR: 0.91 & 0.83, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96 & 0.77-0.91) were less likely to have ANC visits. This study underscores a critical gap in ANC access, particularly among rural women, which poses challenges to achieving national and global maternal health targets. Addressing these disparities and making relevant policy implications such as expanding community-based ANC programs, integrating services into primary healthcare, and increasing awareness through mass media are required to enhance ANC accessibility and utilization in underserved populations.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains critical in Bangladesh, driven by delays in accessing timely care at health care facilities. Globally, a woman dies every two minutes from pregnancy or childbirth, often due to systemic inefficiencies in health care. In Bangladesh, high maternal mortality rates are worsened by overcrowded facilities, limited resources, and complex procedures. The 'three delays' model identifies barriers to care, with the third delay - receiving timely treatment - being a major contributor to maternal deaths. This study aims to generate evidence on how the 'Welcome Person' can improve maternity care at the facility level in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study from April to December 2022 among pregnant women at three selected health care facilities in Gaibandha District, Bangladesh. We deployed 20 'Welcome Persons' to navigate and assist pregnant women, enhancing maternal health care. The Welcome Persons provided round-the-clock support, guiding mothers from the moment they entered the hospital through their admission, treatment, and any necessary referrals. The Welcome Persons maintained detailed time-stamped records, tracking patient movements and service timelines. In this study of 5260 mothers, 47% presented with complications, with 52% arriving after office hours. The median time from entry to treatment was 15 minutes, with those without complications taking 14 minutes and those with complications 15 minutes. Entry-to-admission took a median of nine minutes, varying by age, with younger patients completing faster. Admission-to-treatment had a median time of six minutes, with severely complicated patients experiencing shorter times. Only 1% completed within five minutes, while 63% finished within 15 minutes. Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) showed better performance in completing procedures within median times compared to the District Hospital (DH). Future study plans should include measuring maternal and neonatal outcomes as well. This study demonstrates that timely maternal care is achievable by deploying a support person. Using the 'Welcome Person' model to address admission bottlenecks, health care facilities can enhance patient experiences and outcomes. Despite a few limitations, evidence generated from this study can be utilised for scaling up decisions and can contribute to the health policy.",

        "title": "Depression, anxiety, and stress among mothers of children with thalassemia in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Despite Bangladesh being one of the major hotspots of thalassemia in the world, this preventable inherited blood disorder is neglected in research and policy level. Mothers are the primary caregivers of children in South Asian countries with limited resources. Caring for a child with thalassemia can be an emotionally challenging experience for mothers in low and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. This study aimed to explore the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress of the mothers of thalassemic patients in Bangladesh and to correlate with sociodemographic and thalassemia-related factors. This cross-sectional study, conducted with 156 mothers of children with thalassemia, was a continuation of a previous investigation conducted at Bangladesh Thalassaemia Samity Hospital (BTSH) regarding the parental perspective of thalassemia in Bangladesh. A validated Bengali version of the DASS-21 questionnaire was employed to assess the depression, anxiety, and stress levels of mothers with thalassemic children. Descriptive statistics were used to examine sociodemographic characteristics, thalassemia concerns in the family, effects on social and professional life, and DASS-21 scores. The depression, anxiety, and stress levels were predicted using a multiple-regression model. We found that most mothers of thalassemia children experienced stress (~ 62%), anxiety (~ 58%), or depression (~ 63%) to some extent. Mental health concerns were significantly associated with education level (p < 0.01 for depression and stress and p < 0.05 for anxiety), spouse's education level (p < 0.01 for depression, anxiety and stress), monthly family income (p < 0.01 for depression and stress and p < 0.05 for anxiety), mortality from thalassemia in the extended family (p < 0.01 for depression and p < 0.05 for anxiety and stress), years of suffering (p < 0.10 for depression and anxiety), frequency of transfusions (p < 0.10 for depression and p < 0.05 for anxiety), social life (p < 0.01 for depression, anxiety and stress), and worry about the child's future (p < 0.05 for depression and p < 0.01 for stress). Depression and anxiety were significantly influenced by the frequency of transfusions as well as monthly cost of treatment. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the likelihood of lower level of depression among mothers was associated with higher family income (95% CI [-0.48, -4.67]) and children who had more than a 30-day gap between two transfusions. On the other hand, the likelihood of a higher level of depression was associated with a higher monthly treatment cost (95% CI [-0.48, -4.67], p = 0.037). Mothers of thalassemic patients in Bangladesh experience complex mental health challenges, including stress, anxiety, and depression. The chronic nature of the condition, combined with associated financial, social, and physical burdens, can lead to heightened levels of these mental health issues. This study provides insights for social organizations and policymakers to adopt a holistic approach in improving the overall mental well-being of mothers with thalassemic children in Bangladesh.",

        "title": "Advancing Nutritional Status Classification With Hybrid Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Methodological Approach.",
        "abstract": "Malnutrition remains a critical public health issue in low-income countries, significantly hindering economic development and contributing to over 50% of infant deaths. Under nutrition weakens immune systems, increasing susceptibility to common illnesses and prolonging recovery periods. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel artificial intelligence-based classification method for nutritional status assessment using hybrid machine learning strategies, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of malnutrition detection. This study utilizes the fire hawk optimizer-based k-means (FHO-K-Means) clustering method to identify key physiological indicators associated with under nutrition in children. The analysis is conducted using the UNICEF dataset, encompassing data from Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, and Zimbabwe. Following data normalization, the dataset is clustered via FHO-K-Means to establish optimal groupings. The clustered data is then partitioned into training and testing sets for classification using the extreme gradient boosting fuzzy (EGBF). The EGBF model is employed to classify nutritional states, including stunting, wasting, severe wasting, overweight, and underweight, providing a robust framework for predictive analysis. The proposed FHO-K-Means and EGBF model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 99.84% accuracy, 99.5% precision, 99.8% specificity, and 100% sensitivity, with an F1 measure of 98.6% and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.01%, outperforming existing classification techniques. These results indicate that the model offers a highly effective and scalable tool for identifying at-risk populations, informing targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence of childhood malnutrition, and lowering morbidity in poor countries. This study developed an innovative FHO-K mean clustering and EGBF classification method for assessing childhood nutritional status in underdeveloped countries. The exceptional accuracy and predictive capability of the model make it a valuable tool for early malnutrition detection, enabling data-driven decision-making in public health and policy formulation. By improving malnutrition diagnosis and intervention strategies, this approach has the potential to reduce morbidity and enhance child health outcomes in resource-constrained settings.",

        "abstract": "The evidence on associations between sedentary behaviour (SB) and motor skills in 3- to 4-year-olds is unclear and mostly from high-income countries. The objective of this study is to examine associations between (1) screen time (h/day) and total daily SB (h/day), and gross and fine motor skills, and (2) meeting the restraint, screen time and overall SB (restraint and screen time) guidelines and fine and gross motor skills. Cross-sectional study of 1394 3- to 4-year-olds from the pilot phase of the SUNRISE International study. Time spent in SB was measured using the activPAL accelerometer, whereas screen time and restraint were measured using a parent questionnaire. Fine and gross motor skills were measured using parent-reported Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3). Associations between SB and motor skills were determined using linear and logistic regression, adjusting for sex and socioeconomic status. Every additional 1 h of screen time was associated with 0.50-point reduction in gross motor skills scores (p = 0.008). More screen time was associated with decreased odds of being on track for fine and gross motor skill development (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). Meeting the screen time (p = 0.009) and overall SB guidelines (p = 0.006) were favourably associated with fine motor skills scores. Meeting the screen time, restraint and overall SB guidelines were favourably associated with gross motor skills scores (p = 0.007, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), higher odds of being on track for fine (p = 0.033, p = 0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively) and gross motor skills (p = 0.006, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) development. The present study adds to the evidence on the importance of sedentary behaviour for the motor development of 3- to 4-year-olds. It is important that policy makers and health educators develop strategies that will encourage and promote adherence to sedentary behaviour guidelines among 3- and 4-year-olds.",

        "abstract": "We present results from a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that introduced operational practices to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions in 276 \"zigzag\" brick kilns. Of all intervention kilns, 65% adopted the improved practices. Treatment assignment reduced energy use by 10.5% (<i>P</i>-value <0.001) and decreased CO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> emissions by 171 and 0.45 metric tons, respectively, per kiln per year. Valuing the CO<sub>2</sub> reductions using a social cost of carbon of 185 USD per metric ton, we find that the social benefits outweigh costs by a factor of 65 to 1. The intervention, which required no new capital investment, also decreased fuel costs and increased brick quality. Our results demonstrate the potential for privately profitable, as well as publicly beneficial, improvements to address environmental problems in informal industries.",

        "abstract": "Childhood severe pneumonia is the leading cause of under-five deaths in Bangladesh. A new day-care management approach (DCA) was implemented in primary-level healthcare facilities in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. Reliable cost estimates are important to determine the economic viability of the new management approach. The objective of this study were to estimate the mean societal cost per patient for a new Day-care approach (DCA) in managing childhood severe pneumonia, to assess cost variation in urban and rural healthcare settings, and to determine important cost predictors. This study was conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh Children diagnosed with severe pneumonia were enrolled between November 2015 and March 2019. Employing a bottom-up micro-costing approach from a societal perspective, detailed household and provider cost data were collected from sixteen intervention facilities (n = 16). Data collection involved structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with facility staff, interviews with parents/caregivers, and patient record reviews. Analysis measured mean cost and cost variation across socio-economic groups, facility location, clinical variables, and determined cost-sensitive parameters. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant level. 1,745 children were enrolled, 63% were male, and 57% were less than a year old. The mean societal cost per patient was US$94.2 (95% CI: US$92.2, US$96.3) with a mean length-of-stay (LoS) of 4.1 days (SD ± 3.0). Costs of medical personnel (US$32.6), caregiver's productivity loss (US$26) and medicines (US$22) were the major cost contributors. Mean cost was significantly higher for urban-located facilities compared to rural (difference US$17, 95% CI: US$12.6, US$20.8). No cost variation was found by age, sex, and clinical variables. Findings suggest that this novel DCA management approach is a low-cost management option, and particularly beneficial for rural residences and therefore has the potential to reduce the overall cost burden for childhood severe pneumonia management. These findings have implications for policy-making decisions in resource-poor settings for childhood pneumonia management.",

This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

This study sought to explore people with disabilities' experiences of inclusion in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand how such responses can be more inclusive in the future. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 372 people with disabilities and their caregivers in Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Peru, Thailand, Türkiye (with Syrian refugees), Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe between 1 December 2020 and 28 February 2023, and analysed using thematic analysis. The study found that people with disabilities demonstrated high levels of knowledge about COVID-19 and were willing to adhere to prevention measures. However, participants noted that countries' COVID-19 responses were largely not inclusive of people with disabilities; that pandemic information was seldom available in accessible formats; and that adhering to social distancing and other mandates was challenging and incurred personal and economic costs. Consequently, the pandemic compounded existing barriers and inaccessibility experienced by people with disabilities and contributed to inequality.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mental health and other underlying factors might affect a child's nutritional status. This study assesses child undernutrition and its associated characteristics, including maternal mental health, in low-income settings in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 397 lactating mothers with children aged 6-23 months from low-income settings in Dhaka. Anthropometric measurements were taken following standard protocols, and Z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and BMI-for-age were calculated. Maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, respectively. The child feeding index was developed based on breastfeeding, dietary diversity, and meal frequency. Multivariate logistic regression models explored the relationship between child undernutrition and maternal mental health and other risk factors. In low-income regions of Dhaka, the prevalence was 31.9% for stunting, 14.0% for wasting, and 24.1% for underweight children. Approximately half of the mothers experienced depression (55%) and anxiety (50%). High maternal depression levels were associated with increased odds of stunted (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.10-2.94, p < 0.05) and wasted (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.38-5.28, p < 0.05) children. Similarly, anxiety was linked to a higher risk of underweight children (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.04-3.11, p < 0.05). Female children had approximately twice the risk of stunting than boys (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.32-3.44, p < 0.01). Younger maternal age also doubled the risk of stunting (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.20-3.22, p < 0.01). Low adherence to a feeding index increased the odds of stunting (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.99-5.16, p < 0.001) and underweight (AOR = 4.20, 95% CI = 2.50-7.07, p < 0.01). Children born to underweight mothers were almost twice as likely to become underweight (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.01-4.03, p < 0.05) compared to those born to normal/overweight mothers. Maternal depression and anxiety adversely affect the nutrition of their children. Sociodemographic factors such as the child's sex, maternal age, maternal health, and child feeding practices significantly contribute to child undernutrition. Policy initiatives should prioritize maternal mental health and address child undernutrition in these settings.",

A cross-sectional study was carried out among 2147 individuals, using a stratified random sampling method, aged 13-19, from various selected schools and colleges spread across Bangladesh using a Google form questionnaire consisting of sections on socio-demographic factors, body mass index (BMI), eating attitude test scale, and internet addiction test scale. Descriptive analysis, Pearson Chi-square test, logistic regression model, and a bivariate correlation analysis were fit to determine the relationship and factors. We found that 24.1% of students had IA, 23.2% were at risk of EDs, 6.6% were underweight, 1.9% were overweight, 24% were obese and the remainder were normal. The relationship between IA, BMI, and risk of EDs was significant and positively co-related. Moreover, we found gender, the purpose of internet use, daily internet usage, physical exercise, literature reading habits, and victims of bullying were significantly associated with IA. The findings highlight the need for further research and strategies to diagnose and treat EDs and IA, among adolescents. Promoting physical activity, healthy habits, and awareness at the institutional and parental levels is crucial for mitigating these risks and addressing sociodemographic, internet usage, and emotional health factors.",

        "abstract": "By 2030, it is anticipated that poor mental health will cost the global economy approximately $6 trillion per year, primarily due to productivity loss. It is crucial to understand how psychological distress contributes to productivity loss in the workplace. We aim to investigate the relationship between psychological distress and productivity loss in the Australian working population. We utilized eight waves of longitudinal data drawn from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey (waves 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, and 21). We compiled an unbalanced panel data set comprising 70,973 person-year observations from 18,729 unique working adults. We used Fixed-effects Poisson regression and Fixed-effects logistic regression models to investigate the within-person differences in the relationship between psychological distress and productivity loss (measured through sickness absence, presenteeism, and underemployment). We found that moderate and high psychological distress is associated with a higher rate of sickness absence, presenteeism, and underemployment when a working adult shifted from low psychological distress after controlling socio-demographic, health, and employment-related characteristics. Our study demonstrated that moderate to high psychological distress adversely affected employees' job productivity through increased sickness absence, a higher likelihood of presenteeism, and greater levels of underemployment. Our findings also revealed that employees with moderate and high psychological distress incurred additional annual sickness absence costs of AUD 60.66 and AUD 99.26, respectively, compared to peers with low psychological distress. Additionally, our study found that employees with moderate and high levels of psychological distress experienced significantly higher levels of presenteeism, which resulted in additional annual costs of AUD 1,166.30 and AUD 3,656.05, respectively, compared to their counterparts with low psychological distress. Psychological distress imposed significant costs on Australian workplaces. Implementing workplace health promotion programs should be prioritized as a policy to address psychological distress among employees, enhance their well-being, and improve overall productivity.",

However, very little research exists that has explored the mental health problems experienced by persons with disabilities in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of common mental health problems in persons with disabilities in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey using the Bangla Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (BDASS-21) with sociodemographic was conducted among 950 participants with varying types of disabilities in Dhaka, Narayanganj, and Gazipur. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used to measure the effects. The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress among participants was 67.6%, 72.6%, and 49.5%, respectively. Urban participants exhibited significantly higher levels of depression (76.6% in Dhaka), anxiety (86.1% in Dhaka), and stress (32.1% in Dhaka) compared to their rural counterparts (depression: 86.16%, anxiety: 91.07%, stress: 97.77% in Gazipur). Gender differences were observed in anxiety, with females reporting higher anxiety levels than males (p<0.05). Age and geographical location were significantly associated with stress (p<0.042 and p<0.001, respectively), with those reporting higher anxiety also experiencing greater stress (p<0.001). Specific disabilities, such as visual disabilities, were linked to higher stress levels, while depression and anxiety did not show significant associations with demographic factors or disability type. Results highlight the prevalence of common mental health problems among persons with disabilities in Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "Climate and socio-economic changes are expected to significantly impact waterborne pathogens and associated health risks, yet the full extent of these effects remains unclear. Accurate quantification of these risks is crucial for informing effective interventions and policy decisions. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) serves as a valuable tool for estimating the risk of infection caused by microorganisms in drinking water. This study reviews existing QMRA studies and tools in the context of surface water and drinking water provision. Most studies have implemented various steps of the QMRA framework but often without the application of specific QMRA tools. Although several QMRA tools address climatic factors, there are currently no tools that integrate socio-economic factors into their risk assessments. This study proposes an approach for incorporating both climatic and socio-economic factors into QMRA tools. Specifically, we suggest enhancements to the Swedish QMRA tool - an open-source tool that currently does not incorporate climate and socio-economic changes. Our proposed advancements aim to systematically account for future climatic and socio-economic impacts on health risks, providing a more comprehensive microbial risk assessment tool. These recommendations are also applicable to other QMRA tools, offering a pathway for their development and improving the overall assessment of microbial health risks.",

        "abstract": "Despite national priorities, legal reforms, and increased investment in interventions, child marriage (CM) remains a significant public health risk, leading to violence, intergenerational nutritional depletion, and poor health outcomes in Bangladesh. Using the social-ecological model (SEM), this iterative qualitative study aimed to understand the drivers of CM at the individual, familial, social/community, and institutional levels to inform policy and programs. A total of 29 focus group discussions (with community members, married and unmarried adolescent girls, and their parents and grandmothers), 44 in-depth interviews (with married and unmarried adolescent girls, and their parents), and 10 key informants' interviews (influential community leaders) were conducted. Findings were drawn through thematic analysis employing both inductive and deductive coding. Identified CM drivers are aligned with the SEM framework. Girls' agency, collective efficacy, self-initiated marriage, and educational performance were individual-level drivers. Family-associated drivers were household poverty, parents' lack of awareness, and intra-household gendered preferences. Social/community drivers include norms about the \"ideal\" bride, girls' readiness for marriage, control over girls' sexuality and mobility, fear of violence, family honor, and religious norms. Weak enforcement to prevent CM, limited opportunities for girls, ecological conditions, and long school closures during COVID-19 were key institutional drivers. Findings suggest CM drivers are interconnected across levels of the SEM, implying the need for multi-level interventions. Coordinated efforts to reduce CM may include addressing the harmful CM norms and systemic factors leading to CM, raising community awareness about the adverse outcomes of CM, and offering poverty alleviation and economic opportunities for girls.",

        "abstract": "Indigenous people worldwide are at increased risk of mental health problems compared with non-Indigenous people. Longstanding impacts of colonisation, systematic exclusion from rights and subsequent discrimination, and lack of access to quality education and healthcare, including mental healthcare, have been identified as contributory factors to these disproportionate mental health problems. With limited access, Indigenous people are less likely to seek healthcare, owing to the insufficient number of healthcare professionals representing Indigenous communities. In the face of growing numbers of mental health problems in Indigenous people in Bangladesh, this paper sheds light on the inadequate number of mental health professionals, particularly from Indigenous communities, and the potential impacts of this on the well-being of Indigenous people, and considers ways to increase representation of Indigenous mental health professionals. The aim is to ensure that the mental health system in Bangladesh is inclusive and embraces the country's diversity.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between knowledge of healthy lifestyles and the age of hypertension diagnosis among hypertensive individuals within Bangladeshi rural population. This cross-section study was conducted among hypertensive adults (18-80 years) in a rural population. We obtained data from 3600 adults with hypertension from 40 randomly selected community pharmacies. We gathered data on demographics, health knowledge, and measured vital signs, including hypertension diagnosis year. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify the lifestyle and knowledge factors about hypertension with the age of diagnosis of hypertension. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis was 45.84 years. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis of male participants was higher than female (48.1 vs 44.4 years). Our study found that males and individuals with primary education are more likely to receive a later hypertension diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-3.10 and odds ratio = 5.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.09-11.48 respectively) for those aged ≥65. The poorest and those lacking physical exercise faced higher odds of later diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.15 and odds ratio = 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.78-3.17 respectively). Conversely, a family history of hypertension reduces the odds (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.55). Increased knowledge of healthy lifestyle factors and engagement with health-related media correlate with later diagnosis, highlighting the influence of education and awareness on hypertension detection age. Our study reveals that knowledge of a healthy lifestyle is associated with the age of hypertension diagnosis. Targeting specific age groups based on health education programs may reduce hypertension-related complications.",

        "abstract": "Identifying cues to contagious disease is critical for effectively tracking and defending against interpersonal infection threats. People hold lay beliefs about the types of sensory information most relevant for identifying whether others are sick with transmissible illnesses. Are these beliefs universal, or do they vary along cultural and ecological dimensions? Participants in 58 countries (N = 19,217) judged how effective, and how likely they were to use, cues involving each of the five major sensory modalities in an imagined social interaction during a flu outbreak. Belief patterns were strongly consistent across countries (sight > audition > touch > smell > taste), suggesting a largely universal conceptualization of the role of sensory information for interpersonal respiratory disease detection. Results also support a safe senses hypothesis, with perceivers reporting that they would use senses that function at a distance-and thus reduce pathogen transmission risk-more than would be expected given participants' beliefs as to the efficacy of these senses for disease detection. Where societal variation did emerge, it was captured by a cohesive set of socio-ecological factors, including human development, latitude, pathogen prevalence, and population density. Together, these findings reveal a shared lens through which contagious respiratory disease is assessed, one that prioritizes minimizing risk to perceivers, and may offer leverage for designing interventions to improve public health.",

This narrative review discusses self-harm and suicidal behavior among the eight South Asian countries based on available studies and reports. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Google to identify the available evidence. We reviewed the articles and summarized the findings narratively. Among the eight countries, only India publishes national data on prison suicide with a rate of 23·6 (2015-19) per 100,000 population, no report was found for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and the Maldives. Studies conducted among prisoners in Nepal predominantly targeted psychiatric disorders like depression revealing the prevalence of suicidal thoughts at 2.3-13% and attempts at 0.9-7.2% respectively. Reports on self-harm among adult prisoners, suicidal ideation, and attempts among juvenile delinquents are available in Pakistan. However, studies revealing the rates of suicidal behavior among adult prisoners are yet to come out. The rates of suicide, suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts among prisoners are not known in the country. Self-harm behaviors among juvenile offenders have been studied in Sri Lanka. Self-harm and suicidal behavior have been poorly studied in South Asia. Policy-level attention is warranted to measure the burden and prevent self-harm, and suicidal behavior among prisoners in South Asia.",

        "title": "Incremental financial costs of strengthening large-scale child nutrition programs in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam: retrospective expenditure analysis.",
        "abstract": "Inattention to young child growth and development in a transitioning global environment can undermine the foundation of human capital and future progress. Diets that provide adequate energy and nutrients are critical for children's physical and cognitive development from 6 to 23.9 months of age and beyond. Still, over 70% of young children do not receive foods with sufficient nutrition particularly in low-and-middle income countries. Program evaluations have documented the effectiveness of large-scale behavior change interventions to improve children's diets, but the budgetary implications of programs are not known. This paper provides the incremental financial costs of strengthening three large-scale programs based on expenditure records from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. The programs reached between one and 2.5 million mothers and children annually per country at unit costs of between $0.9 to $1.6 per mother and child reached. An additional 0.7 to 1.6 million people who were influential in supporting mothers and achieving scale were also engaged. The largest cost component was counselling of mothers. Rigorous external impact evaluations showed that over 434,500 children benefited annually from consuming a minimum acceptable diet in all countries combined, at an annual cost per country of $6.3 to $34.7 per child benefited. Large scale programs to improve young children's nutrition can be affordable for low- and middle-income countries. The study provides the incremental costs of selectively strengthening key program components in diverse settings with lessons for future budgeting. The costs of treating a malnourished child are several-fold higher than prevention through improved improving young children's dietary practices. Differences across countries in program models, coverage, costs, and outcomes suggest that countries need a minimum investment of resources for strengthening high-reach service delivery and communication channels and engaging relevant behavioral levers and community support for mothers to achieve impact at scale.",

        "abstract": "Women and adolescent girls in flood-prone regions of Bangladesh face significant challenges in managing menstrual hygiene, which severely impacts their health, dignity, and well-being. This study investigates the socio-cultural, infrastructural, and policy barriers to menstrual hygiene management (MHM) during floods in the districts of Noakhali, Feni, Barisal, Khulna, and Satkhira. Conducted from June to October 2024, the research employed a purposive sampling approach, with 30 in-depth interviews (IDIs) conducted with women and adolescent girls directly affected by the floods. Additionally, 12 key informant interviews (KIIs) were carried out with healthcare workers, NGO representatives, and policymakers, alongside field observations in temporary shelters and relief centers. The findings highlight critical barriers, including the lack of accessible and private sanitation facilities in shelters, compounded by inadequate supplies of menstrual hygiene products. In temporary shelters, the absence of specialized toilets and waste disposal systems for menstruation forces women to resort to unhygienic alternatives such as cloth, leaves, or newspapers, leading to increased health risks. Socio-cultural taboos surrounding menstruation further restrict access to proper hygiene materials and support, intensifying the challenges. Moreover, disaster management systems fail to incorporate menstrual hygiene needs, leaving women and girls particularly vulnerable during floods. The study recommends integrating gender-responsive disaster management policies and comprehensive menstrual health education into disaster relief efforts. The Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) should be utilized to provide urgent reproductive health services. These findings are crucial for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers, and underscore the importance of reducing stigma and promoting dignity for women and girls. By addressing these gaps, Bangladesh can enhance the resilience and health of women and adolescent girls in the aftermath of floods.",

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021, we estimated age-standardized incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs for four major NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases from 2010 to 2021. Gender and age-specific estimations were conducted across all NCDs, with 95% uncertainty intervals and a decomposition analysis was employed to estimate change in death and DALYs attributable to NCDs. The burden of NCDs in South Asia increased by 3.00% in incidence from 2010 to 2021, while overall prevalence decreased by 1.00%, yet the age-standardized prevalence rate remains above the global rate (91,570 per 100,000 population). Incidences of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases declined by 3.00% and 13.00%, respectively, whereas diabetes and cancer rose by 21.00% and 13.00% in South Asia. Nepal faced the highest environmental impact (23.4% of DALYs), Bangladesh the greatest metabolic impact (25.62%), and India the highest from behavioural factors (23.95%). Population growth and aging were primary drivers of changes in deaths and DALYs across the region. This finding emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions addressing environmental, metabolic, and behavioral risks for NCDs in South Asia, alongside strategies to support healthy aging and effective disease management across diverse demographic groups.",

        "abstract": "Air pollution is a serious health concern in rapidly developing countries like Bangladesh. This study investigates the correlation between self-reported health issues related to air pollution and perceived air pollution among adult Bangladeshis. A face-to-face questionnaire was conducted with 398 adult residents who had lived in their current location for at least 3 years. The survey assessed self-reported health using 13 specific air pollution-related health problems. A linear regression model was then used to analyze factors affecting air pollution-related health status. Our findings reveal correlations between perceived air pollution and health issues. 90% of respondents reported air-polluted environments in their area, with the majority citing multiple sources (42%) of air pollution. Construction activities emerged as a predominant concern, identified by 31% of participants as a primary source of air pollution. Demographic factors play a crucial role in contributing to air pollution-related health problems. Notably, older age groups reported significantly higher health issues compared to their younger counterparts. Residents of Mirpur's residential neighborhood experienced fewer health problems related to air pollution, indicating the influence of urban planning on public health. This interdisciplinary approach offers a comprehensive view of Bangladesh's air pollution crisis, combining environmental science and public health perspectives. The findings emphasize the need for targeted policy interventions, including stricter regulations on construction activities to mitigate their impact on air quality, tailored public health interventions for vulnerable populations (especially older adults), and urban planning strategies that reduce exposure to air pollution in residential areas. Future research should investigate the long-term health impacts of chronic air pollution exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. Addressing these issues can help create healthier, more resilient urban environments.",

        "abstract": "Agrifood systems in South Asia are highly productive, but substantial challenges including poverty, climate change, and environmental degradation complicate progress toward achieving sustainable healthy diets for all. The dynamics of food systems and the consequence of their rapid transformation for food choice behaviors that contribute to healthy and unhealthy diets are not well understood. Food choice is defined as a decision-making process through which individuals and households consider, acquire, prepare, distribute, and consume foods and beverages. Understanding drivers of food choice (DFC) is important for achieving sustainable healthy diets, but evidence is lacking. This article outlines collectively derived priorities for future research on DFC in South Asia. A collaborative workshop was convened in March 2023 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with experts from the region. The workshop emphasized the application of a science of food choice framework to guide identification of priorities for research on DFC in South Asia. Priorities were derived through an interdisciplinary collaborative process to clarify what is known and not known about DFC in the context of Food Systems Transformation in the region with emphasis on a continuum of food choice behaviors (production, acquisition, preparation, distribution, and consumption). Workshop participants identified the following 3 main priorities for future research on DFC that address knowledge gaps that emerged from discussions: <i>1</i>) intrahousehold dynamics and behaviors, <i>2</i>) adolescent food choice, and <i>3</i>) market and food acquisition linkages. Specific research needs to emphasize the importance of multigenerational data, food allocation, perceptions on food safety, adolescent food choice behaviors, and the need for longitudinal data on linkages between market availability and food choice behaviors. Building a body of evidence on DFC and tools for monitoring and assessing food choice behaviors is essential for designing effective policies and programs that allow all individuals to have healthy and sustainable diets in South Asia.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality is a critical public health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Maternal healthcare services (MHS), including antenatal care (ANC) visits, skilled birth attendants (SBA), institutional delivery (ID), and postnatal care (PNC), are crucial policy priorities to address maternal mortality and improve pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of MHS utilization among women in LMICs. We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and SocINDEX to gather relevant studies on the utilization of MHS in LMICs conducted between January 2015 and December 2024. These were then synthesized both quantitatively and qualitatively and random-effect models were employed to obtain pooled estimates. A total of 145 studies included in this review. Coverage of at least one ANC visit (ANC1), at least four ANC visits (ANC4), SBA, ID and PNC were reported in 66, 108, 42, 63, and 37 studies respectively and for these studies pooled prevalences of ANC1, ANC4, SBA, ID, and PNC were found 85.0% (95% CI 81.2-88.1%), 50.8% (95% CI 46.4-55.2%), 65.6% (95% CI 58.7-71.9%), 66.9% (95% CI 60.3-72.9%), and 48.9% (95% CI 41.7-56.2%), respectively, with high heterogeneity among the studies (I<sup>2</sup> > 99.0%). Results obtained from the sub-group analysis revealed that the prevalence of MHS indicators was higher in the South and Southeast Asia (SSEA) region compared to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), except for ID, e.g., SBA prevalence in SSEA was 70.1% (95% CI 60.4-78.3%) whereas for SSA it was 64.0% (95% CI 53.3-73.6%). The prevalence of all MHS indicators was higher for studies with primary data than those with secondary data, except for ANC4 and PNC. Overall, associations were reported between MHS utilization and women's age, education level, household socioeconomic status, place of residence, decision-making power, and exposure to mass media. High heterogeneity among studies infer possible disparities in MHS utilization at both global and national levels. Hence, it is crucial for policies to prioritize enhancing effective coverage, narrowing disparities, and improving care quality in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.

        "title": "Comparative study on the factors influencing pre-eclampsia symptoms at different pregnancy stages in Bangladeshi women: urban vs. rural perspectives.",
        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, pre-eclampsia poses a significant concern, evident in the low attendance (37%) for antenatal care (ANC). Despite efforts to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, the latest Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey (BMMS-2016) indicates limited progress. Access to essential maternal and newborn health services, including ANC, remains constrained, highlighting the challenge of translating service coverage into improved outcomes. A research gap on pre-eclampsia symptoms such as severe headache, blurred vision, high blood pressure, and oedema emphasizes the need for targeted interventions for these symptoms early so that we can reduce the prevalence of pre-eclampsia and therefore maternal mortality in Bangladesh. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the risk factors for three stages of pre-eclampsia among Bangladeshi women living in urban and rural areas. The study utilized BMMS-2016 data, employing statistical analyses, including binary logistic regression, to identify associations. It assessed four pre-eclampsia symptoms prevalence across pregnancy stages, considering factors like maternal age, stillborn births, residency, ANC, healthcare facility delivery, education, and children. Logistic regression highlights key associations with pre-eclampsia symptoms. Urban mothers aged 36 + face the highest risk during delivery (AOR = 2) and the lowest in rural areas after delivery (AOR = 1.43). Two or more stillborn births increase the risk in urban delivery by 97%. Complete ANC raises odds, notably in urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.5) and rural post-delivery (AOR = 1.16). Skilled ANC providers elevate risks during all stages, with the highest in urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.54) and lowest after rural delivery (AOR = 1.28). Unskilled ANC associates with symptoms only during pregnancy. Healthcare facility delivery increases odds at all stages, particularly in rural delivery (AOR = 1.74) and urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.26). Multifetal gestation raises urban delivery risk (AOR = 2.11). Rural areas show higher chances during both pregnancy and delivery. Higher education in rural pregnancy and 2 to 3 birth order in urban delivery reduce odds of pre-eclampsia symptoms. Addressing pre-eclampsia symptoms in Bangladesh, especially among urban women, is urgent. Identified risk factors necessitate targeted interventions to enhance ANC and overall maternal health. Advocating findings to policymakers is crucial for effective policies, reducing pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, contributing to lower maternal mortality.",

        "title": "Interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation.",
        "abstract": "While combustible tobacco has been the subject of a very large amount of research, smokeless tobacco products receive less attention. Most smokeless tobacco products are very harmful and cause global health inequality. It is therefore important to identify evidence-based cessation aids. To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacological interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation. We searched the following databases from inception to 16 February 2024: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; ClinicalTrials.gov (through CENTRAL); World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (through CENTRAL). We also searched references of eligible studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting people of any age using smokeless tobacco, regardless of tobacco smoking status. Eligible studies could test any intervention designed to support people to quit smokeless tobacco use, and had to measure abstinence from either all tobacco use or smokeless tobacco use at six months or longer. The outcome of interest was abstinence from all tobacco use or from smokeless tobacco use at six months or longer. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in included studies. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We grouped studies by comparisons of eligible interventions and comparators, reporting individual study and pooled effects as appropriate. We used a random-effects Mantel-Haenszel model for analyses of behavioural interventions and a fixed effect Mantel-Haenszel model for analyses of pharmacotherapies to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We included 43 trials of 20,346 people. Thirty-three trials were conducted in North America, five in India, two in Scandinavia, one in Pakistan and one in Turkey. One study was conducted across multiple sites in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Studies tested behavioural interventions (e.g. cessation counselling and brief advice) and pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion). We judged five studies to be at low risk of bias overall, 22 at high risk of bias, and the remaining 16 at unclear risk of bias. We found moderate-certainty evidence of increased quit rates from counselling compared with minimal support (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.16; I<sup>2</sup> = 69%; 21 studies, n = 7417; downgraded because of heterogeneity), brief advice compared with no support (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 49%; 7 studies, n = 6271; downgraded because of imprecision), and varenicline compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.68; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, n = 508; downgraded because of imprecision). We found low-certainty evidence (downgraded because of imprecision and risk of bias) of increased quit rates from NRT compared with placebo or no medication (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 39%; 11 studies, n = 2826). Low-certainty evidence (downgraded because of imprecision) did not show benefit from bupropion compared with placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, n = 293). We planned subgroup analyses to explore whether smokeless tobacco type affects intervention efficacy, but found insufficient data. Cessation counselling, brief advice, and varenicline each probably help more people to quit smokeless tobacco use than minimal or no support, or placebo. NRT may help more people to quit smokeless tobacco use than placebo or no medication. Low-certainty evidence does not currently support bupropion as a smokeless tobacco cessation intervention. Despite the majority of smokeless tobacco users living in South and Southeast Asia, only a minority of trials are conducted in those regions. Future trials should address this imbalance.
