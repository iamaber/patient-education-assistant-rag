        "title": "Prevalence and Associated Factors of Prediabetes and Diabetes in Rural and Peri-Urban Bangladesh: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Background and objectives The global burden of prediabetes and diabetes is rising rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, where lifestyle and nutritional transitions are accelerating. Economically disadvantaged rural populations often lack awareness and access to care, making them highly vulnerable. Measuring the prevalence and identifying associated factors is essential for guiding public health strategies and resource allocation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi community to inform targeted prevention and control strategies. Methodology We recruited 891 adults for this cross-sectional study in January-June 2020 through random sampling from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System in Bangladesh, ensuring at least five years of residency. Trained Community Health Workers collected sociodemographic data using a semi-structured questionnaire and performed physical examination and anthropometric measurements. We used fasting blood sugar to screen patients for prediabetes and diabetes, and measured serum creatinine and urine albumin to creatinine ratio to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also collected blood samples to measure serum albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood and urine samples were tested in an accredited laboratory. Results Prevalence of prediabetes was 38% (n=343), and diabetes was 17% (n=151). Age-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 5%, 12% and 22%, and of diabetes were 1%, 3% and 13%, for the age groups of 18-30, 31-45, and ≥46 years, respectively. Sex-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 22% and 17%, and diabetes were 9% and 8%, for female and male participants, respectively. In multiple multinomial logistic regression, for prediabetes, significant risk factor was age ≥31 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.84, 95%CI 1.64-4.92), and protective factors were smokeless tobacco use (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.94) and hypoalbuminemia (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.24-0.99), and for diabetes, significant risk factors were age ≥31 years (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 1.37-11.95), abdominal obesity (aOR 2.80, 95%CI 1.49-5.30), CKD (aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.70-4.62), hypercholesterolemia (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.17-3.30) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.44-3.79), and protective factors were being female (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.066-0.68), and smokeless tobacco user (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.63). Conclusion This study reveals a high burden of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi population. The findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen community-based screening and targeted prevention strategies to address the growing diabetes burden in underserved areas.",

        "title": "Sero-Prevalence and Molecular Detection of Mycobacterium bovis in Cattle at Sylhet Division of Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), is a contagious, notifiable, chronic bacterial disease that causes economic losses. bTB remains a significant zoonotic threat, particularly in resource-limited settings where reliable prevalence data are still lacking. This study aimed to determine the serological prevalence and molecular detection of bTB from different commercial and individual dairy farms of Sylhet and Sunamganj districts in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 250 blood and 250 milk samples, which were collected across selected dairy farms. Serological testing was performed using indirect ELISA, and molecular detection of M. bovis was carried out through PCR. Associations between infection status and potential risk factors were evaluated using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. The overall prevalence of M. bovis was 10.6%. Molecular detection through PCR revealed a higher prevalence in milk (14.8%) compared to blood (6.4%) samples. Serological testing showed that the prevalence in Sylhet district was lower (5.3%) than in Sunamganj district (12.0%). The highest prevalence was observed in diarrhoeic animals (19.49%), followed by female cattle (13.58%) and Holstein Friesian cows (14.0%). Cattle aged 1-3 years showed a notable prevalence of 17.51%. The presence of M. bovis in dairy cattle herds was confirmed by both molecular and serological methods, highlighting the endemic nature of bTB in the study area. These findings underscore the importance of routine surveillance, combining diagnostic approaches and implementing effective control measures to reduce the burden of bTB in dairy production systems.",

        "title": "Interplay between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever: insights from endemic countries and a controlled human infection model.",
        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited. To investigate the association between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n = 92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop the disease, n = 97) and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n = 69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition and function were compared. We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against the development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had a higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22). This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections. Video Abstract.",

        "title": "Genomic insights into Klebsiella pneumoniae: Virulence, resistance, and transmission in South and Southeast Asia.",
        "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae has long posed a significant challenge in clinical settings worldwide, particularly due to its carbapenemase production and multidrug-resistant (MDR) characteristics. While extensive genomic studies of K. pneumoniae have been conducted globally, research in Asia, particularly South Asia, remains limited. This study aims to address and compare the genomic characteristics of K. pneumoniae isolates from South Asia and Southeast Asia, including virulence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), plasmids, and mobile genetic elements (MGE) profiles, as well as potential transmission dynamics. A total of 463 K. pneumoniae genomes were included from collected samples and public databases. All genomes underwent comprehensive analysis, including pan-genome profiling, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), annotation of virulence factors, AMR genes, plasmids, and MGEs, as well as SNP distance-based analysis to infer transmission dynamics, using established bioinformatic tools. K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited diverse virulence determinants. Hypervirulent isolates were primarily associated with ST23 and ST86, and commonly harbour aerobactin, salmochelin, and rmpA. The majority of isolates were predicted to be MDR, with those from Southeast Asia showing a higher relative abundance of AMR genes associated with the antibiotic classes examined in this study. Among all isolates, the predominant carbapenemase-associated gene was bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>. Col440I_1 was the most prevalent plasmid replicon, although it did not co-occur with any AMR genes. Association between the IncFII_1_pKP9 plasmid replicon and resistance genes sul-5, bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, and bla<sub>TEM</sub> was found. ISSen9 was the dominant MGE, frequently co-occurring with the plasmid replicons IncFIB(K)_1_Kpn3 and IncFII_1_pKP91. Transmission analysis indicated that the highest isolate similarity occurred within MLST and country. However, clustering based on plasmid replicon profiles revealed that some clusters comprised isolates from multiple countries. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the genomic characteristics and transmission patterns of K. pneumoniae in South and Southeast Asia, contributing to our understanding of its virulence and resistance mechanisms. These findings further suggest that plasmid replicons may play a critical role in shaping transmission dynamics and provide valuable insights to inform future AMR surveillance and control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrheal illness, and population-based data on the incidence of clinically significant ETEC diarrhea in developing countries are limited. We provide insight into ETEC epidemiology; we followed a population-based cohort in a vaccine trial. We analyzed data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of an oral cholera vaccine conducted in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study covers 90 geographical clusters with an average population of 2988 households/cluster (baseline population 268 896). Two cohort analyses were conducted, 1 as dynamic cohort that included all subjects at vaccination, in-migrants, and births over 4 years and a closed cohort, which included only individuals present at baseline. We evaluated individuals placed under treatment center-based diarrheal surveillance between 2011 and 2015. In the dynamic cohort, the ETEC incidence was 150/100 000 person-years (PY; 95% CI, 141-159), with seasonal peaks during warmer months, and in the closed cohort, the incidence was 153/100 000 PY (95% CI, 140, 166). The highest rate was seen in children aged <1 year (2007; 95% CI, 1664-2402), then in those aged 1-4 years (314; 95% CI, 252-386), and again the rate rose in those aged >45 years (219/100 000 PY; 95% CI, 177-267). The rate of severe ETEC was ≤35/100 000 PY for persons aged ≤45 years (95% CI, 27-44), but rose to 82 for adults aged >45 years (95% CI, 58-113). ETEC diarrhea is a major health problem in young children and older adults, prevention through vaccination and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene should target both age groups.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial disease outbreaks continue to threaten finfish aquaculture in southwestern Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses and heightened food security concerns. To address the absence of robust molecular diagnostics and genetic diversity assessment for bacterial pathogens, a comprehensive five-year study (2018-2023) was conducted to evaluate pathogen prevalence, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance, with the goal of informing region-specific management strategies. A total of 340 fish, representing 17 species from 10 districts, were systematically collected from farms, hatcheries, nurseries, and markets. Specimens underwent phenotypic and biochemical characterization, followed by DNA extraction and quantification under stringent quality control protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) utilizing species-specific primers, including the 16S rRNA housekeeping gene, enabled sensitive detection and quantification of bacterial loads. Statistical analyses included one-way ANOVA to compare mean log10 copy numbers and Ct values across districts, fish species, and tissue types, with post hoc t-tests identifying significant differences. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and cluster analyses were employed to assess genetic similarity and diversity among 75 representative isolates. Regression analysis identified nutrient concentration as a significant predictor of bacterial growth (p = 0.0461), with optimal culture conditions determined at 1-2% nutrients, pH 6.5-7, and temperature 25-37°C. High bacterial loads were detected in gill tissues, with Edwardsiella ictaluri (Ct 19.8 ± 2.1) and Aeromonas hydrophila (Ct 21.4 ± 1.9) being most prevalent, and the highest E. ictaluri load (8.5 ± 0.3 log10 copies) observed in Pangasius hypophthalmus from Bagerhat (p < 0.001). The lowest pathogen prevalence was recorded in Magura district. RAPD analysis demonstrated significant genetic similarity among isolates from Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to Tetracycline but susceptibility to Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. These findings highlight pronounced spatial variation in pathogen prevalence, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance, emphasizing the critical need for integrated molecular diagnostics, targeted surveillance, and sustainable management practices to protect aquaculture health and productivity in Bangladesh.",

Using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach, it investigates how GST search can predict new COVID-19 cases. The findings show that GST can offer timely insights into public health responses. The results also show that GST search items can predict the outbreak before 1–2 weeks. While VAR analysis confirms the causal relationship between the GST terms and the new COVID-19 cases, this study also acknowledges the limitations of inappropriate regional data at the outset of any new pandemic. It also acknowledges the misinformation from GST can underestimate real time surveillance. Policymakers can use GST for real-time risk communication and informed decision during pandemic. The results also suggest the importance of infodemiology to integrate it into the public health system for disease surveillance as the country’s’ resources are constrained. This study highlights the contribution of infodemiology towards the enhancement of traditional methods and systems of surveillance, which is relevant both nationally and globally. GST offers a great opportunity for advancing digital epidemiology and innovation in public health, nonetheless obstacles rest in the way.

        "abstract": "In February-March 2024, an outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice with multiple fatalities was reported in Goalpara District, Assam, India. This study aimed to identify the etiological agents responsible for the outbreak to guide public health interventions. Clinical samples from 30 individuals were collected and analyzed using serological and molecular techniques. Serological testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), and Leptospira was performed using IgM ELISA kits. Leptospira DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for further analysis. The results revealed HAV IgM antibodies in 23.33 % of cases (7/30), while 40 % (12/30) tested positive for Leptospira-specific IgM by ELISA. Additionally, PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Leptospira DNA in 53.33 % of the urine samples (8/15). Notably, 16.67 % (5/30) of cases exhibited coinfection with both HAV and Leptospira spp., challenging the clinical outcome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-positive samples identified Leptospira wolffii (L. wolffii) as the causative agent, marking the first report of L. wolffii in human clinical samples from Northeastern India. Recently, L. wolffii, a member of the P2 subclade of Leptospira, has garnered attention due to its pathogenic potential. The findings along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of L. wolffii and its likely introduction into the region, via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent. This study highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and research to monitor emerging Leptospira strains, particularly L. wolffii, in both human and animal populations, to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health implications.",

        "abstract": "Slide agglutination for serogroup and/or serotype identification is a crucial step for confirming cholera by culture. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are typically used directly on stool but are not considered sufficient for cholera confirmation. However, they may provide a practical alternative to the slide agglutination step of culture<i>,</i> as they are easy to use, store, and require minimal training. This study evaluates the concordance of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1/O139 detection from presumptive colonies by slide agglutination with RDTs. Patients (≥1 year) with acute watery diarrhea at the icddr,b Dhaka hospital were enrolled. Stool samples were cultured on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose medium, and presumptive colonies were subcultured on Gelatin Agar medium. Isolates were then tested by slide agglutination and four commercial cholera RDTs. From 4 February 2024 through 24 May 2025, 1,638 patients with acute watery diarrhea were enrolled, 1,140 (70%) had presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies, and 482 (29%) were culture-confirmed as <i>V. cholerae</i> O1. We tested suspected <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies using Cholkit (n=1,140), SD Bioline (n=693), Crystal VC O1/O139 (n=693), and Crystal VC O1 (n=655) RDT kits. RDTs showed near-perfect concordance with slide agglutination. Using slide agglutination as the reference, the sensitivity of the RDT kits ranged from 99.3% to 99.6% and the specificity from 99.3% to 99.7%. RDTs offer a practical and potentially easier alternative to slide agglutination of presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies within typical cholera culture protocols. This may help to provide a pathway to quick confirmation of outbreaks in settings where lab facilities and reagents may be limited.IMPORTANCEThis study demonstrated that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can effectively replace traditional slide agglutination methods to confirm suspected <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonies belonging to the O1 serogroup, which are responsible for the current seventh cholera pandemic. Comparing four RDTs to slide agglutination, we found almost perfect agreement, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 99%. Since RDTs are cheaper, easier to use and store, and require less technical training, adopting them could significantly speed up cholera outbreak confirmation, especially in areas with limited laboratory resources. This practical shift could lead to faster responses to cholera outbreaks, ultimately improving public health surveillance and disease control globally.",

        "abstract": "Mental health conditions are emerging concerns that were worsened by Covid-19, especially in developing countries. The pandemic instigated an increase in household stress particularly among migrant women living in urban slums due to overcrowding, increased caregiving burden, and intimate partner violence, resulting in deteriorating mental health. This study assessed the prevalence of mental health conditions and intimate partner violence during Covid-19 and also explored the pathways between pandemic-related household stress and mental health outcomes with the mediating role of crowding and intimate partner violence in the Bangladeshi urban slums. The cross-sectional survey was conducted among internal migrant women from five slums of Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems operated by International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Face-to-face interviews were conducted from August to October 2022 using a semi-structured questionnaire that had three validated screening tools to measure depression, anxiety and intimate partner violence. A path analysis using structural equation modelling with maximum likelihood methods was performed to understand the objectives. Among the total 405 participants, the majority of women (68.40%) were housewives and their husbands (46.43%), were engaged as daily wagers. A large portion of the women (38.77%) had only primary education and one-third of the surveyed women (36.5%) reported increased household stress due to Covid-19. About 71% of women experienced an event of intimate partner violence with reports of emotional (57.3%), physical (49.4%), and sexual violence (39.0%). The prevalence of anxiety and depression were 73.8% and 65.2%, respectively. The structural equation modelling path analysis revealed that household stress increased the likelihood of anxiety and depression. Moreover, household stress has a direct effect on anxiety, while it has an indirect effect on both anxiety and depression with these effects mediated by intimate partner violence. These novel baseline findings may support the relevant stakeholders to design further research and programmes to strengthen emergency preparedness for the women living in informal settlements of Urban Bangladesh. A rights-based approach, as has been shown effective elsewhere, may offer a strategy to enhance the overall well-being.",

        "abstract": "Several members of the Legionellaceae family are increasingly recognized as a causative agent of sporadic community-acquired atypical cases of pneumonia. Alarmingly high mortality and no effective antimicrobials necessitate accurate detection of this fastidious organism, specifically from the environment considering Legionella mostly transmit through contaminated water or moist soils. In this study, we have utilized a combination of molecular and culture based protocols to detect and characterize virulence genes in Legionella pneumophila from various water sources in Bangladesh. Out of 198 water samples, 28.8 % were PCR positive for Legionella spp. Among these, 43.9 % were non-pneumophila and 56.1 % were L. pneumophila. In terms of season and source, 21.4 % of the late autumn and 38.5 % of the tap water samples were predominantly positive for L. pneumophila. Our culture method demonstrated an 84.4 % recovery rate for L. pneumophila, of which 27 representative isolates were chosen for virulence characterization using 21 genes categorized into 7 groups. Group 1-6 genes responsible for a broad spectrum of virulence traits were majorly found within the isolates, however, group 7 responsible for severe human infections were comparatively less prevalent. Virulence gene profiling showed two isolates containing 19/21 genes were isolated during summer/late autumn from hot water/tap water. Statistical stacked plots found a significant association between group 7 virulence factors with summer and warm water isolates. Our findings necessitate heightened surveillance for this organism through incorporating routine water monitoring plans in similar environmental settings worldwide.",

        "abstract": "The recognized burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) is greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but limitations in surveillance preclude accurate estimates of AR. We aimed to evaluate colonization in communities and hospitals across six LMICs for two clinically-important pathogens: extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). Participants in hospitals and communities provided rectal swabs or stool samples for ESCrE and CRE identification. Isolates recovered from selective agars underwent confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) using Vitek<sup>®</sup> 2, MALDI-TOF, and/or disc diffusion testing. ESCrE and CRE were defined based on established breakpoints of phenotypic resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively, to calculate prevalence of colonization. Community prevalence estimates were weighted to account for sampling design differences. A total of 10,139 participants across the 6 countries provided samples; 63% were females with a median age of 35 years (range: 0-99). Colonization with ESCrE in hospitals was high in all sites (range 34-84%). In communities, ESCrE colonization ranged from 22 to 77%. Prevalence of CRE colonization in hospitals ranged from 7 to 36% and in communities ranged from < 1 to 14%. These findings reveal a high burden of AR colonization in LMICs in both communities and hospitals. Cost-effective strategies to reduce AR colonization burden are needed in LMICs.",

The objective of this scoping review was to describe the current evidence regarding the surveillance of <i>V. cholerae</i> in wastewater and wastewater-impacted environmental waters (including drinking water). We conducted a comprehensive electronic search, updated to January 2025. Following duplicate screening, we identified 114 eligible studies. The studies evaluated early WES warning systems, monitored trends in ongoing outbreaks, and described serogroups and virulent strains of toxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> circulating in communities. Most studies were conducted in South-East Asia (44%), particularly India and Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic. A large proportion of studies detected <i>V. cholerae</i> subgroup O1 or O139, and numerous virulent strains such as <i>ctxA/B</i>. Studies were generally poorly reported, for example, inconsistent reporting on sample management, data reliability, and sampling frequency were common. WES has not been widely integrated into existing surveillance systems for real-time cholera monitoring. Our findings underscore the need for further clearly reported research to clarify the role of WES for early warning systems for cholera outbreaks, and to identify strategies that may optimise WES implementation for public health benefit.",

Plasma concentrations of anti-HlyE and LPS IgA were measured in blood culture-confirmed enteric fever cases and in febrile controls with laboratory-confirmed alternative etiology. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that combining anti-LPS and HlyE IgA distinguished enteric fever cases from other febrile illnesses with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. Anti-LPS IgA alone performed nearly as well (AUC 0.92). In children under 5, the combination outperformed individual biomarkers (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94 (HlyE), 0.93 (LPS)) and was most accurate in Bangladesh and Pakistan compared to Nepal.

New evidence has emerged and the ways in which the vaccines are used have changed. We aimed to provide an updated synthesis of evidence on protection conferred by kOCV. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search procedure as a previous systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported estimates of protection conferred by kOCVs against medically attended, confirmed cholera. Eligible studies in English, French, Spanish, or Chinese published up until March 8, 2024, including those identified in the previous review, were included. Data on efficacy and effectiveness were extracted, as were the number of doses, duration of follow-up, and age group. Efficacy and effectiveness estimates were summarised separately using random-effect models to estimate protection by time since vaccination; meta-regression models were used to estimate protection, by dose, as a function of time since vaccination. This updated study is registered along with the original review with PROSPERO (CRD42016048232). We identified 8205 records published online up until March 8, 2024, including 6224 articles from the previous review and 1981 articles from our new search (after Jan 1, 2016). Of these, 53 were eligible for full-text review. Five RCTs and ten observational studies from 23 publications were included. Average two-dose efficacy 12 months after vaccination was 55% (95% CI 46-62), declining to 44% (25-59) 48 months after vaccination. Average two-dose effectiveness was 69% (58-78) 12 months after vaccination, declining to 47% (9-70) 48 months after vaccination. Only one RCT assessed one-dose efficacy and found sustained protection for 24 months (57% [42-69]) among those 5 years and older with no significant protection in younger children. Average one-dose effectiveness 12 months after vaccination was 60% (51-68) and after 24 months was 47% (34-58). Using age group-specific meta-analysis, we found that average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years was half that of older individuals. Two doses of kOCV provide protection against medically attended cholera for at least 4 years after vaccination. One dose of kOCV provides protection for at least 2 years after vaccination, but wanes faster than that of two doses. Children younger than 5 years are less protected by kOCVs than those aged 5 years and older, regardless of the number of doses received. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "Rodents represent the most diverse order of mammals, comprising over 2200 species and nearly 42% of global mammalian biodiversity. They are major reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, and are particularly effective at transmitting diseases, especially synanthropic species that live in close proximity to humans. As of April 2025, approximately 15,205 rodent-associated viruses have been identified across 32 viral families. Among these, key zoonotic agents belong to the <i>Arenaviridae</i>, <i>Hantaviridae</i>, <i>Picornaviridae</i>, <i>Coronaviridae</i>, and <i>Poxviridae</i> families. Due to their adaptability to both urban and rural environments, rodents serve as efficient vectors across diverse ecological landscapes. Environmental and anthropogenic factors, such as climate change, urbanization, deforestation, and emerging pathogens, are increasingly linked to rising outbreaks of rodent-borne diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on rodent-borne viral zoonoses, focusing on their taxonomy, biology, host associations, transmission dynamics, clinical impact, and public health significance. It underscores the critical need for early detection, effective surveillance, and integrated control strategies. A multidisciplinary approach, including enhanced vector control, improved environmental sanitation, and targeted public education, is essential for mitigating the growing threat of rodent-borne zoonoses to global health.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this study is to describe the genome of <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> that was found in clinical mastitis in cattle in Bangladesh. This work will show how strong the bacteria are and how important they are for public health. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform, followed by comprehensive analysis with various bioinformatic tools to identify key genomic features. WGS revealed that the isolates are closely related, belonging to sequence type ST4, a rare type previously identified in both human and animal hosts. The isolates possess 44 virulence-related genes linked to adherence, capsule biogenesis, enzyme production, immunoreactive antigens, protease, and cytolysin production. They also carry two pilus islands (PIs), PI-1 and PI-2b, which are often associated with invasive diseases. PI-2b proteins are key targets for vaccine development against Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The isolates belong to serotype Ia and carry the gbs2018-2 variant, indicating their adaptability to a wide range of hosts, including humans and animals. These virulence factors are critical for understanding <i>S. agalactiae'</i>s pathogenicity and developing vaccines against its infections. Additionally, the isolates harbor antimicrobial resistance genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides (<i>vanT</i>, <i>vanY</i>), macrolides (<i>mreA</i>), peptides (<i>mprF</i>), penicillins and <i>β</i>-lactams (<i>pbp</i>), and aminoglycosides. Source tracking via the BacWGSTdb website identified these isolates as closely related to human pathogens, indicating their zoonotic potential. These results suggest that <i>S. agalactiae</i> could be a zoonotic pathogen. This highlights the need for ongoing genomic surveillance to fully understand how it causes disease and come up with effective ways to control it.",

Accurate etiological diagnosis is essential. This study used postmortem diagnostics to investigate the contribution of diarrhea to under-5 mortality and examine co-morbidities and co-infections in Africa and South Asia. Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) generates data on child deaths through minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical record review, and verbal autopsies. Multidisciplinary panels assign cause(s) of death using WHO International Classification of Diseases. This analysis included deaths among children aged 1-59 months enrolled from 18 December 2016-31 December 2023 across six African sites (Ethiopia, Mali, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Africa) and Bangladesh. Of 1517 deaths assessed, diarrhea was in the causal pathway in 240 (15.8%). The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%). No pathogen was identified in 49.6% (119/240) of diarrhea-related deaths; among these, diarrhea was underlying cause in 42.9%. Among the 121 pathogen-attributed deaths, the most frequent were EAEC (34.7%), typical EPEC (15.7%), Shigella/EIEC (14.0%), ST-ETEC (12.4%), rotavirus (26.4%), and adenovirus (non-40/41: 19.0%; 40/41: 5.0%).

The study, conducted through the Infectious Diseases-International Research Initiative (ID-IRI) platform, involved 34 referral centers. Patients with <i>C. auris</i> candidemia were prospectively enrolled between 15 April 2024 and 15 October 2024. Data on demographics, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment details, and 30-day mortality outcomes were collected.

Of the 130 paired specimens, DENV RNA was detected in 115 blood samples and 104 NPSs. Compared with blood, NPS exhibited a sensitivity of 90.43%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 91.54%. An analysis of demographic and clinical factors revealed no significant differences between NPS-positive and -negative cases. This study underscores the potential of NPSs as a viable alternative diagnostic specimen for DENV detection, particularly, in settings where blood collection is difficult.

The rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens complicates disease management, resulting reduced milk yield, increased veterinary expenses, compromised animal welfare and potential risk to public health. This study investigated the prevalence and resistance profiles of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species in raw buffalo milk from SCM cases in Bangladesh. A total of 1,540 quarter milk samples from 385 buffaloes were analyzed, revealing SCM prevalence rates of 67.9% (1046/1540; 95% CI: 65.6-70.3) at the quarter level and 80.8% (311/385; 95% CI: 76.5-84.6) at the animal level. Notable regional variations were observed, with Gowainghat showing the highest prevalence (88.1%; 141/160). This study did not identify any biologically plausible risk factors for the occurrence of SCM in buffalo. The Modified Whiteside Test and California Mastitis Test confirmed SCM, with culture and biochemical tests identifying 789 (51.2%) Staphylococcus spp. and 424 (27.5%) Streptococcus spp. isolates. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis indicated that 72.7% (456/627) of Staphylococcus isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, while the predominant Streptococcus species included Streptococcus uberis (32.3%) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (14.9%). Resistance gene detection revealed a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs), particularly aac-3(iv) and tetA, across different buffalo quarters and habitats. Antibiogram profiling demonstrated high susceptibility to tetracycline (80.9; 83.1) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (87.4; 81.9), while significant resistance was noted against ampicillin (88.8; 87.1) and nalidixic acid (68.1; 62.1). MDR was observed in 76.4% (479/627) of Staphylococcus spp. and 67.3% (167/248) of Streptococcus spp. isolates, with 10.37% (65/627) and 10.48% (26/248) classified as possible XDR, respectively. These findings explored high antimicrobial resistance level among Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species in subclinical mastitis, highlighting the need for improved management practices and surveillance to mitigate public health risks posed by contaminated milk.",

        "abstract": "Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among under-five children in South Asia. In rural Bangladesh, deep tubewells that tap into low-arsenic deep aquifers have been installed to provide microbially safe and arsenic-free drinking-water at source. However, unlike more widely used shallow tubewells, deep tubwells are sparsely distributed, and households often travel farther for drinking-water consumption from such wells. Hence, benefits from deep tubewells may be abated by higher levels of microbial contamination during water handling and storage that could increase the risk of diarrheal diseases. We examined the association between deep tubewell use and diarrheal disease risk in under-five children and investigated the role of social and environmental factors on modifying the association. We implemented community diarrheal disease surveillance across households with under-five children using deep and shallow tubewells in Matlab, Bangladesh from March 2018 to October 2019. We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to measure the association between deep tubewell use compared to shallow tubewell use on diarrheal disease prevalence. Children in households using deep tubewells had diarrheal disease prevalence 0.83 times that of children in households using shallow tubewells (95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.96). Protective effects of deep tubewell use on diarrhea risk were observed among children in households that drank from wells within their household compound (Risk ratio (RR) =0.70, 95% CI: 0.54-0.91), were in flood-prone areas (RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.75-0.92), and used unimproved latrines (RR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.89). Deep tubewell use was more protective against diarrhea than shallow tubewell use during the dry season (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.97). Despite concerns, using deep tubewells may not translate to higher diarrhea risk among under-five children, and may reduce diarrhea further especially in social and environmental contexts associated with higher groundwater microbial contamination. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15725.",

To understand current strengths, areas for improvement, and opportunities to enhance preparedness for NiV and AIV in Bangladesh, as part of the USAID STOP Spillover program, 47 relevant stakeholders were surveyed, and two country leads of the primary surveillance systems were interviewed. Data was collected focusing on four different areas: research projects, surveillance systems, laboratories, and outbreak risk management systems. Despite progress in recent years, our study reveals significant gaps in preparedness, detection, and response capacities across sectors and highlights the importance of prioritizing extended and targeted surveillance, biosafety solutions for laboratories, and early event detection for resilient defenses against these viruses using a One Health framework.",

        "abstract": "Since the establishment of the National Influenza Surveillance Program in 2007, Bangladesh has significantly progressed in monitoring influenza through national and international collaboration. However, this collaboration has not been translated into actionable control policies, which coupled with low vaccination coverage, impose a substantial health and economic burden in Bangladesh. Critical gaps remain in understanding the influenza burden among high-risk populations and the barriers influencing their vaccine uptake. These gaps hinder the development of evidence-based strategies for prevention and control, consequently leaving the country vulnerable to a potentially catastrophic influenza epidemic. These challenges require a multifaceted approach, including continuous local data collection on disease burden and vaccine barriers, vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses, and the design of context-specific interventions. Leveraging existing infrastructures offers opportunities to develop tailored strategies for high-risk populations. A robust national influenza policy is imperative to mitigate the burden and reduce future pandemic threats.",

        "abstract": "Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis globally, with genotypic variation influencing epidemiology and disease outcomes. Understanding the distribution and prevalence of different Norovirus genotypes is crucial for public health surveillance and intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review of Norovirus genotypes in Asia from 2000 to 2023. The review adhered to PRISMA Guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42024572647). We extracted data on the prevalence of 22 genotypes and their genetic variations over time. The review highlighted Norovirus GII.4 as highly prevalent across Asia, particularly in India, Taiwan, Vietnam, and China. GII.2 dominated Indonesia, GII.3 prevailed in Malaysia, Russia, and Bangladesh, GII.7 in Bangladesh, and GII.17 in China, Taiwan, and Nepal, with notable epidemiological shifts between 2012 and 2016 and GII.4 resurgence from 2017. The study highlights the dynamic nature of Norovirus genotypic distribution in Asia, with both persistent dominance of certain genotypes and notable regional variations. The cyclic patterns of genotype prevalence, particularly the shifts between GII.4 and GII.17, underline the need for ongoing genotypic surveillance to inform targeted public health responses. The data underscores the complexity of Norovirus epidemiology and the importance of maintaining vigilance in monitoring emerging and re-emerging strains.",

        "abstract": "Endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are common causes of mild or asymptomatic respiratory infections in children but are considered rare causes of death. We evaluated pediatric deaths from January 2017 through December 2022. A panel of experts determined the cause of death (CoD) by reviewing available data, including pathological and molecular findings from minimally invasive tissue sampling (lung tissues, blood, CSF, and nasopharyngeal swabs), clinical records, and verbal autopsies. Endemic HCoV were detected in the respiratory samples of 3 % (n = 86/3357) of enrolled decedents: 1 % (n = 12/2043) of neonates, 5 % (n = 35/681) of infants and 6 % (n = 39/633) of children deaths. However, HCoVs were attributed as the CoD in only two cases - both involving young infants with underlying birth defects and severe wasting, who succumbed to polymicrobial hospital-acquired infections involving HCoV-OC43, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Amongst the remaining 84 decedents in whom an HCoV was detected, 82 % (n = 69/84; median Ct of 25.34; range: 15.28-36.17) were deaths attributed to other infections, including 54 % (n = 32/69; median Ct of 23.86; range: 15.28-35.2) with lower respiratory infections determined to be the CoD. The bulk of these deaths (96 %, n = 66/69) were attributed to other pathogens - Plasmodium falciparum (27 %, n = 19/69), K. pneumoniae (23 %, n = 16/69), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 %, n = 14/69), Escherichia coli (16 %, n = 11/69) and Cytomegalovirus (10 %, n = 7/69). Although endemic HCoV was identified in children who died of respiratory infections, it was rarely attributed to being in the CoD. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explore the potential role of HCoVs in LRTI pathogenesis and their impact on facilitating more pathogenic infections.",

We utilised monthly data on dengue cases and deaths reported through the World Health Organisation's (WHO) global surveillance system for the period of 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2024. We then performed a generalised linear regression model to understand country-level determinants of dengue-related mortality.

Among them, the concept of \"disease X\" has emerged owing to the uncertainty about the identity of the pathogen that may cause the next pandemic. Disease X has gained significant attention due to its potential to cause a public health emergency in the future. This study aimed to investigate disease X, identify the key risk factors leading to its emergence and spread, and propose strategies to prevent future global pandemics. We performed a comprehensive literature review and identified relevant information for this study. Pandemic, public health emergency, and infectious disease were used as keywords for the literature search. Our study indicates that disease X could be a life-threatening or global pandemic. Among the various risk factors, climate change, increased animal-human contact, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance are some risk factors that may lead to a pandemic because they help in the transmission of zoonotic infections. Here, we have discussed some potential pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that are capable of causing disease X. Finally, we have indicated some necessary measures required for the prevention and management of any future global pandemic. Disease X has already posed a substantial threat to the global health system, warranting urgent attention and action. Comprehensive preparedness measures, including robust surveillance systems, early detection, and vaccine development, are essential for mitigating the risk posed by disease X.

        "abstract": "The Dinga Dinga Virus (DDV) has emerged as a mysterious disease gripping women in Uganda, raising alarm due to its unusual and distressing \"dancing\" like symptoms. These symptoms, characterized by involuntary movements resembling dance, suggest possible neurological involvement, though the exact pathogen remains unidentified. The causative agent for DDV is still unknown. We hypothesized that the possible microorganism could be a virus, bacteria, or vector-borne origin. Therefore, comprehensive research is urgently needed to confirm its cause. We performed a comprehensive literature search in Scopus and Web of Science related to the different outbreaks of viruses. We collected relevant information from appropriate articles for this review. The unique representation of the disease is spreading rapidly in localized areas that have the potential to escalate into a broader public health crisis. Preventive measures focused on symptom monitoring, public awareness, and isolation of suspected cases to limit transmission. Authorities emphasize hygiene practices, using personal protective equipment (PPE), and early reporting to manage the outbreak effectively. Simultaneously, global health organizations are being called to collaborate on diagnostic development, therapeutic interventions, and vaccine research. The disproportionate impact on women has brought social and cultural dynamics into the spotlight, as stigma and misinformation exacerbate the outbreak's challenges. Immediate and long-term strategies must address these aspects by strengthening healthcare infrastructure and enhancing disease surveillance systems. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the DDV is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases. Proactive, science-driven efforts are critical to understanding and mitigating this enigmatic disease, ensuring it does not escalate into another global health crisis.",

Wastewater surveillance helps understanding pathogen transmission dynamics, particularly in urban areas of climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. We analysed 54 weeks of wastewater surveillance, clinical surveillance, and meteorological data from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Samples from 11 sites were tested for Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae), SARS-CoV-2, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), and Group A rotavirus. Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance data were sourced from icddr,b, and meteorological data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Regression models adjusted for site and time variations were used for statistical analysis. Proportion of confirmed cholera cases among the diarrhoeal disease surveillance recruits were highest during post-monsoon (coef: 2.53; 95 % CI: 0.41 to 4.67; p = 0.029). V. cholerae log10 concentrations in wastewater were positively associated with pre-monsoon (coef: 0.93; 95 % CI: 0.26 to 1.58; p = 0.010), while SARS-CoV-2 peaked during monsoon (coef: 1.85; 95 % CI: 0.96 to 2.73; p < 0.001).

        "abstract": "<i>Candida auris</i> (<i>C. auris</i>), an emerging fungus, is primarily recognized for causing healthcare-associated infections. While carriage among hospitalized patients is well documented, community spread remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the burden of community-acquired <i>C. auris</i> skin colonization among newly hospitalized participants without any recent healthcare exposure. This cross-sectional study was conducted at two tertiary-level government hospitals and their surrounding catchment areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from June 2023 to May 2024. We enrolled 800 participants (400 from each hospital) shortly after admission, meeting the following criteria: no healthcare exposure within the past three months, no invasive procedures performed since the current hospital admission, and residence within the hospital's catchment area for the past three months. Skin swabs from the axillae and groins were cultured on CHROMagar Candida Plus to determine fungal colonization. Presumptive positive isolates were identified using VITEK 2, and <i>C. auris</i> was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. No <i>C. auris</i> colonization was detected in the axillary or groin in any enrolled participant. However, 128 (16%) patients were found to be colonized with other fungal species. The absence of community-acquired <i>C. auris</i> colonization in this study suggests that transmission primarily occurs within hospital settings. However, our strict inclusion criteria, which excluded patients with recent healthcare exposure, may have influenced this finding. Further research using alternative study designs is needed to fully understand the potential for <i>C. auris</i> spread within the community.IMPORTANCE<i>Candida auris</i>, a rapidly emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen with high mortality, poses a critical global health threat, particularly in healthcare settings. While extensive research has focused on its colonization among hospitalized patients, its potential presence and community transmission remain largely unexplored. An earlier study among critically ill patients in Bangladesh detected four colonized cases of <i>C. auris</i> without hospitalization history within the past year and admitted directly from home (F. Chowdhury et al., unpublished data). Notably, three participants resided in the same district and one in an adjacent district, raising serious concerns about possible community spread. This study is crucial in addressing this knowledge gap by assessing the burden of community-acquired <i>C. auris</i> colonization among newly hospitalized patients in Dhaka. Understanding its potential transmission outside the hospital is vital for shaping public health responses, guiding infection control strategies, and strengthening global surveillance efforts to mitigate the spread of this highly resistant pathogen.",

Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines.",

        "abstract": "A life-threatening vector-borne disease, dengue fever (DF), poses significant global public health and economic threats, including Bangladesh. Determining dengue risk factors is crucial for early warning systems to forecast disease epidemics and develop efficient control strategies. To address this, we propose an interpretable tree-based machine learning (ML) model for dengue early warning systems and outbreak prediction in Bangladesh based on climatic, sociodemographic, and landscape factors. A framework for forecasting DF risk was developed by using high-performance ML algorithms, namely Random Forests, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), based on sociodemographic, climate, landscape, and dengue surveillance epidemiological data (January 2000 to December 2021). The optimal tree-based ML model with strong interpretability was created by comparing various ML models using the hyperparameter optimization technique. The feature importance ranking and the most significant dengue driver were found using the SHapley Additive explanation (SHAP) value. Our study findings detected a nonlinear effect of climatic parameters on dengue at different thresholds such as mean (27°C), minimum (22°C), maximum temperatures (32°C), and relative humidity (82%). The optimal minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed for dengue risk are 25-28°C, 32-34°C, 75%-85%, 10 mm, and 12 m/s, respectively. The LightGBM model accurately forecasts DF and agricultural land, population density, and minimum temperature significantly affecting the dengue outbreak in Bangladesh. Our proposed ML model functions as an early warning system, improving comprehension of the factors that precipitate dengue outbreaks and providing a framework for sophisticated analytical techniques in public health.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most prevalent cancer among women in Bangladesh, with 9,640 new cases and 5,826 deaths annually. Since 2018, the Electronic Data Tracking with Population-Based Cervical and Breast Cancer Screening Program (EPCBCSP) has been implemented nationwide across 601 health centers, utilizing Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) for CC screening. However, the system had not been evaluated until now. This study aims to assess the performance of EPCBCSP and identify its strengths and challenges. We evaluated EPCBCSP using the updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) in 2023. Data were collected from central level stakeholders and from stakeholders at one colposcopy and one VIA center in each of four selected divisions of Bangladesh. Interviews with 42 stakeholders assessed simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, stability and usefulness attributes. Data quality was assessed by surveillance data review. Percentage scores were calculated and ranked as follows: excellent (≥ 90%), Very good (≥ 80%- < 90%.), good (≥60%- < 80%), average (≥50%- < 60%) and poor (≤50%).The overall system performance was rated as good (score:77.20%). The system's simplicity (score: 91.61%) and usefulness (score:91.61%) were ranked as \"excellent\". The acceptability (score: 85.29%) was ranked as \"very good and flexibility (score:71.90%) was rated as \"good\". Stability (percentage score: 53.25%) was considered average. Furthermore, data quality was assessed as average based on missing values (13.11%.) Electronic data tracking system, instant test report availability and \"see and treat\" policies were identified as strengths by stakeholders, while dedicated staff shortages and motivating participants were main challenges. The evaluation EPCBCSP in Bangladesh indicates overall good performance, excelling in simplicity and usefulness. However, improvements are needed in stability and data quality. Strengthening surveillance efforts addressing shortages of dedicated staff and participant motivation will further enhance the effectiveness of the program, crucial for reducing CC burden.",

APCA is an autoantibody that damages gastric parietal cells; autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic gastric inflammatory disease related to APCA and severe predominant corpus atrophy. Although a positive APCA result is a key clinical diagnostic tool for AIG, its rates vary widely among ethnic groups, and its exact relationship with AIG and predominant corpus atrophy remains unclear. Associations between histopathology-assessed and endoscopy-assessed atrophy, APCA positivity rates, Helicobacter pylori status, and pepsinogen levels were investigated in 1982 symptomatic patients from Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Overall, 38.5% of participants were negative for Helicobacter pylori infection, while 57.6% had a current infection. A positive APCA result, defined as a titer >10, was present in 44.0% of participants (95% confidence interval: 41.8%-46.3%, 873/1982). Pathologic atrophy, corpus atrophy, and predominant corpus atrophy were found in 8.7% (169/1982), 5.1% (101/1982), and 4.1% (81/1982) of participants, respectively. Positive APCA rates significantly differed among countries (10.6% to 63.8%, P<0.001). No significant correlation was found between APCA results and the presence or severity of atrophy. Although APCA positivity was high among symptomatic patients from South and Southeast Asian countries, few had severe predominant corpus atrophy or positive pepsinogen tests, which suggests a low rate of AIG in this population. Long-term surveillance of APCA-positive individuals is necessary to determine the clinical significance of a positive APCA result without AIG.",

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

We conducted an active prospective case ascertainment of children with cerebral palsy (CP) attending the National Children's Hospital in Hanoi between June to November 2017, following the model proposed by the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance system in Australia. All children were assessed by trained paediatricians at the hospital and their immunization history was recorded. Data were collected from 765 children with CP (median age = 1.7 years, IQR = 2.7 years). Of these children, 82.7% were fully immunized for their age (compared to 96.4% of the general child population) according to the Vietnamese Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule. A BCG vaccination scar was present in 94.0% of children with CP, and 95.9% of eligible children had received the measles-rubella vaccine as part of the national campaign (compared with 96.0% and 98.2% of the general population respectively). Incomplete vaccination according to the EPI was associated with younger age, living in an earth/sand house, homebirth, low-level maternal education, being diagnosed with CP before the age of three, having bilateral CP, having associated impairments (i.e., epilepsy, intellectual, visual, speech), being at level IV-V on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, and being undernutrition. This is the first study to document the immunization status of children with CP in Vietnam. A large proportion had not received the measles-rubella vaccine and 17.3% were not fully immunized. To increase vaccination coverage, interventions and strategies are required to ensure that all children with CP have equitable access to early diagnosis, immunization, health education programs, outreach programs, and frequent follow-up. Early diagnosis and focused intervention in early life could further improve vaccination coverage in children with CP.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health concern. Limited data have shown unusually high HCV seroprevalence among Rohingya refugees residing in camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HCV seropositivity and active infection and identify risk factors to inform the HCV response. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 10 and June 14, 2023, in adult (≥18 years) residents of seven camps in Cox's Bazar. Households were selected by simple random geosampling and one participant per household was selected at random. Participants were screened for HCV antibodies with a rapid finger prick blood test and, if seropositive, venous samples were tested for HCV viral load. A structured questionnaire collected information about demographics, HCV knowledge, and exposure risks. Survey-adjusted prevalence estimates of HCV seropositivity and active infection were generated by applying sampling weights. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity were identified using univariable and multivariable current status analysis and those associated with active infection via logistic regression. The survey included 641 participants, of whom 425 (66%) were women and for whom the median age was 34 years (IQR 28-46). 191 individuals tested positive for HCV antibodies. 187 of these individuals were tested for active infection and 124 had a detectable HCV viral load. The survey-adjusted prevalence estimate of HCV seropositivity was 30·4% (95% CI 26·5-34·5), and that of active infection 19·8% (95% CI 16·5-23·4). Current status analysis identified higher odds of HCV seropositivity among individuals reporting medical injection(s) (adjusted odds ratio 1·8 [95% CI 1·2-2·8]) or surgery (5·9 [1·9-18·4]), and among women (2·1 [1·3-3·2]). 328 (51%) of 641 participants had never heard of hepatitis C. Five (4%) of 124 participants with HCV viraemia reported previous HCV treatment. There is a substantial burden of active HCV infection among adult Rohingya camp residents, highlighting the urgent need to scale up testing and treatment capacities. The survey had constraints in identifying risk factors and could not provide data on HCV incidence. Reassessing infection prevalence after mass interventions and prospective surveillance are recommended to monitor ongoing transmission. A well-concerted multi-stakeholder action plan is needed to prevent future large-scale burden of severe liver disease and halt ongoing transmission. Médecins Sans Frontières.",

        "abstract": "Wars have devastating effects on all the components of the One Health approach: humans, animals, and ecosystems. Wars and the resulting migratory waves massively disrupt normal animal health services and surveillance. Among other consequences, they adversely impact the early detection, prevention, and control of animal diseases. Uncontrolled movement of animals or their undisposed carcasses, the destruction of wildlife habitats, and the increased interface between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals contribute to uncontrolled transmission and spread of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. In the last millennium, zoonotic diseases such as the \"Black Death\" were triggered by devastating wars and led to the deaths of a large fraction of the human population. However, also recent and ongoing wars carry the risk of an uncontrollable increase in zoonotic diseases. The most significant zoonotic diseases reported during the recent wars are African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, rabies, leptospirosis, and brucellosis, as well as foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases. Indeed, alarming rates of infections by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> go along with wars, as seen in the current Ukraine-Russia conflict. Considering human migration, foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases are key health threats for refugees due to the consumption of unsafe food, lack of safe water, and disruption of the water supply and sanitation system. This review summarizes the potential factors and some data associated with the increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence and transmission during recent and ongoing conflicts.",

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of Coxiellosis in South Asia, focusing on distribution, host diversity, prevalence, and associated risk factors at the human-animal-environment interface. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and a registered protocol, online searches were conducted in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on August 6, 2023, to retrieve articles from the South Asian countries without restrictions on hosts or timeframe. Two authors independently reviewed, extracted data, and assessed quality based on predefined criteria, which were then evaluated and compiled into a single document and analyzed. The review identified 112 articles published between 1954 and 2023. Among humans, the estimated pooled seroprevalence (EPSP) was 9.2%, and the estimated pooled carrier prevalence (EPCP) was 6.2%. Ruminant herd-level EPSP and EPCP were 77.3% and 74.6%, and at the individual level, were 11.9% and 5.3%, respectively. Seroprevalence was significantly influenced by country, tick infestation, reproductive disorders, age, and body condition of ruminants. Nonruminant mammals, such as dogs (16.8%), horses (6.0%), pigs (3.9%), and rodents (14.8%), were also seropositive. Several avian and reptile species showed EPSP rates of 14.5% and 29.2%, respectively. Bacterial DNA was detected in ticks and soil samples, with EPCP of 1.0% and 3.3%, respectively.

        "abstract": "In 2023, the dengue virus (DENV) outbreak infected over 0.3 million cases and 1500 deaths in Bangladesh. Our study conducted serotyping and genomic surveillance in four districts of Southwest Bangladesh between September and October 2023. The surveillance data from 2019 to 2023 extracted from the Directorate General of Health Services in Bangladesh indicated a significant increase of Dengue infections in 2023, particularly during September-November. The two-layered hypothesis examination confirmed that, despite endemic months, 2023 dengue outbreak had a higher morbidity rate compared to previous years (2019-2022) in the southwest of Bangladesh. Serotyping using RT-PCR and E gene sequence analysis of 25 randomly selected positive samples reveals that DENV-2 was the dominant serotype circulating in this region during the study period. Genomic analysis (phylogenetic analysis and classical multidimensional scaling [cMDS]) exposed a new strain of DENV-2, classified under Cosmopolitan genotype within C clade, distinct from previous Bangladeshi strains until 2022. This strain, possibly migrating from India, might have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic years and exhibited higher morbidity rates, thus challenging our existing mitigation strategies. This investigation provides valuable insights for public health interventions and underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance in managing dengue outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H9N2 has been enzootic in Bangladeshi poultry since 2006. H9N2 outbreaks can decrease egg production and growth and pose a risk to human health. The role of avian hosts in the persistence, evolution, and dispersion of H9N2 is poorly understood in Bangladesh. Hence, this study unveils the intricate role of major host species in virus maintenance and evolution and the temporal and seasonal patterns of H9N2 in Bangladesh from 2006 to 2023. Multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that the circulation of H9N2 in different species and interfaces is significantly influenced by the seasons. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of H9N2 sequences in Bangladesh revealed two distinct lineages: G1 and Eurasian. The G1 lineage split into two clusters, coexisting until 2019, at which point only one cluster persisted. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis of G1 lineage unveiled frequent bidirectional viral transitions among ducks, chickens, and quails. Chickens might be a pivotal source of H9N2 in Bangladesh, with a higher number of viral transitions from chickens to ducks and quails. Quails appear to acquire most of their viral transitions from chickens rather than ducks, suggesting that quail epizootics are primarily triggered by spillover events from chickens. Our results suggest viral circulation in commercial chickens despite vaccination. The vaccination approach should be revised, assess vaccine efficacy, and extension of vaccination to backyard chickens and quails.",

World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) has established different zones worldwide to control such contagious diseases as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Controlling FMD is difficult because of the complicated connection between FMD risk factors, and the deficits of surveillance activities in countries. We used an ecological niche model (ENM) that accounts for the under-reporting of outbreaks to determine FMD risk and risk factors in South Asian countries India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Centered on known outbreak information, we predicted high-risk areas using similar regional ecological features. Using a multi-algorithm machine-learning ensemble that includes random forest, support vector, and gradient boosting, 15 predictive variables (i.e., livestock densities, land cover, and climate), 660 FMD outbreaks from 13 years (2009-2022) in the region including the outbreaks from India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka we identified that Sri Lanka and Bangladesh appeared to have low to medium outbreak risk in the range of 0.04 to 0.55. India was used to fit the model. The machine learning models demonstrated high predictive performance (accuracy >0.87) through cross-validation. Production systems, isothermality, cattle density (per Km2), and mean diurnal range was identified as the most important predictors of FMD outbreaks. These models help to determine FMD low-risk areas to minimize FMD surveillance activities and high-risk areas to focus on performing additional confirmatory testing, and improve surveillance in a regional context.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever remains a substantial public health challenge in low-income and middle-income countries. By 2023, typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) had been introduced in six countries globally, with more than 50 million doses distributed. Now that TCVs are being deployed, there is a need for observational studies to assess vaccine effectiveness in the field. We aimed to evaluate the validity of different observational study designs in estimating vaccine protection. We compared different observational and experimental study designs for assessing vaccine effectiveness by re-analysing data from the TyVAC Bangladesh trial, a participant-blinded and observer-blinded cluster-randomised controlled trial done in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 150 geographical clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine. Eligible children aged 9 months to 15 years were offered a single dose of the vaccine randomly assigned to their cluster of residence, and baseline vaccination was done between April 15 and May 15, 2018. We compared estimates of vaccine effectiveness from the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis-which assessed the risk of blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever among recipients of TCV versus recipients of Japanese encephalitis vaccine-with estimates from cohort study and test-negative case-control study design (TND) analyses, which compared recipients of TCV with non-vaccinees in the 75 geographical clusters where TCV was administered. We further conducted negative-control exposure (NCE) and negative-control outcome (NCO) analyses as bias indicators. 41 344 (67%) of 62 025 age-eligible children in the study area received the TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine during the baseline vaccination campaign. Among the 62 025 age-eligible children, 5582 blood-culture specimens were collected by passive surveillance, including 2546 (46%) specimens from the 75 TCV clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy was 89% (95% CI 81-93) in the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis, 79% (70-86) by the cohort design, 88% (79-93) by the TND when pan-negatives were used as test-negative controls, and 90% (75-96) by the TND when specimens positive for pathogens other than Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi were used as test-negative controls. Using NCE analysis, Japanese encephalitis vaccination was associated with an increased risk of typhoid fever compared with non-vaccinees in the 75 Japanese encephalitis clusters in the cohort design (incidence rate ratio 1·98 [95% CI 1·56-2·52]), but no significant association between Japanese encephalitis vaccination and typhoid fever was found with the TND. Similarly, an increased risk of non-typhoid infections was observed in the cohort NCO analyses when comparing vaccinees with non-vaccinees in both Japanese encephalitis vaccine clusters and TCV clusters, but not in the TND NCO analyses. Our findings suggests that the TND provides reliable estimates of TCV effectiveness, whereas the cohort design can bias vaccine effectiveness estimates, possibly due to unmeasured confounding effects, such as health-care-seeking behaviours. NCE and NCO approaches are useful tools for identifying such biases. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "The management of sanitation systems in unsewered cities in low and middle income countries is a critical issue, yet it is unclear where the risk hotspots are and where interventions should be focused. This study utilised a prototype model, developed by the authors, to map the spatial pattern of faecal flow in Rajshahi city, a secondary city in northwest Bangladesh with a population around a million. This city serves as a representative example of 60 such secondary cities in Bangladesh and hundreds more in the economically developing region in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The model relies on assumptions that carry significant uncertainties; hence, the study employed a sensitivity analysis with multiple plausible scenarios to characterise these uncertainties, aiming to identify ways to improve the model further. Five major influencing factors on the spatial pattern of faecal flow were identified: the emptying of septic tanks, the use of soak pits, and sludge removal from drains, variations in faecal matter production by building types, and the presence or absence of toilets. These factors were shown to collectively have a significant impact (almost 50 % changed) on the model outcome, depending upon the assumptions made. The study offers insights that will guide future data collection efforts by emphasising the need to understand these specific influencing factors and their spatial pattern. Consequently, this research has broader implications for urban sanitation management as well as associated public health research like wastewater surveillance, risk assessment, and disease dynamics in similar urban settings, offering insights into areas of uncertainty that need to be addressed in future modelling efforts.",

        "title": "Development of a culture-independent whole-genome sequencing of Nipah virus using the MinION Oxford Nanopore platform.",
        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly zoonotic pathogen in Southeast Asia causing severe respiratory and encephalitis symptoms with a high fatality rate. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is crucial for tracking transmission, conducting epidemiological analyses, and understanding NiV's adaptive evolution. WGS is essential for analyzing genomes, particularly in understanding pathogen nature, and pathogenesis and aiding in the development of therapeutics. However, sequencing this highly contagious virus directly from samples is challenging in low- and middle-income countries lacking BSL-4 facilities. This study developed and optimized a culture-independent, high-throughput multiplex PCR-based third-generation sequencing protocol for NiV using the Oxford Nanopore Technology platform and a proposed bioinformatics pipeline to generate consensus genome sequences directly from environmental and clinical specimens. We amplified 12 NiV RT-PCR-positive specimens (11 clinical, one environmental) to produce 60 amplicons, each approximately 400 bp, covering the entire ~18.2 kb genome. Using a two-step reverse transcriptase PCR approach, libraries were prepared with a ligation sequencing kit. Raw sequence data were then analyzed using bioinformatics tools. A minimum of 10,000 total reads per sample provided a nearly complete coverage (>95%) of the NiV genome, even with low virus concentrations (Ct ≤ 32), with an average quality score of 10.2. The WGS of 12 NiV-positive samples achieved coverage between 95.71% (Ct 29.54) and 99.3% (Ct 22.34). The entire process, from RNA extraction to finished sequences, took only 24 h. We developed a portable, culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing workflow suitable for resource-limited settings, aiding in real-time monitoring, outbreak investigation, and detection of new NiV strains and genetic evolution. The development of a culture-independent, high-throughput whole-genome sequencing (WGS) protocol for Nipah virus (NiV) using the Oxford Nanopore MinION technology marks a significant advancement in outbreak response, surveillance, and genomic analysis of NiV. NiV is an RG4 category C pathogen; working with the NiV virus is a deep concern of biosafety and biosecurity. It demands the development of biologically safe procedures to get genetic information. This protocol utilizes biologically safe samples that were collected into recommended lysis solution, multiplex PCR, and third-generation sequencing, effectively addressing challenges in sequencing NiV. This optimized workflow achieved over 95% genome coverage without the need for virus culture. It is a cost-effective, rapid, and efficient approach to the WGS of NiV, making it suitable for resource-limited settings like Bangladesh. The method enhances the capacity for outbreak investigations, epidemiological analyses, and monitoring virus, aiding in detecting emerging strains. This work contributes significantly to global pandemic preparedness and response efforts.",

Typhi) and Paratyphi (<i>S</i>. Paratyphi) to provide an evidence base for prevention and control measures in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. From October 2020 to September 2022, we conducted prospective clinical surveillance and retrospective laboratory surveillance at health facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; and Karachi, Pakistan. Patients were eligible if they were outpatients with three or more days of fever in the last week. In Nepal and Pakistan, inpatients were eligible if they had suspected or confirmed enteric fever; in Bangladesh, only inpatients with confirmed enteric fever were enrolled. Patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever identified by hospital laboratories and laboratory network sites were also enrolled. Patients completed interviews and medical records were reviewed and abstracted. All enrolled patients had blood cultures performed. Antibiograms were performed to characterize drug sensitivity. We summarized the data descriptively. A total of 17,593 patients were enrolled from 19 facilities. Of these, 8410 patients had culture-confirmed enteric fever. Case counts in all countries decreased in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but increased over time in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Case counts remained low throughout the study period in Nepal. In all countries, typhoid was more common than paratyphoid; the proportion of paratyphoid cases ranged from 8.4% in Pakistan to 16% in Nepal. Extensively drug-resistant typhoid was common in Pakistan (69%), but was not detected in Bangladesh or Nepal. Cases of enteric fever decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, though it is not clear how much of this decrease relates to true changes in transmission versus health-seeking behavior.

        "abstract": "Countries like Bangladesh face significant challenges in effectively registering and tracking deaths within their civil registration systems, which are essential for public health. To improve data collection for public health policy, death record-keeping at burial sites should be enhanced, particularly in areas where burial certificates are issued. With this in mind, we examined the traditional paper-based practices for recording deaths, the perceived significance of these practices, and the associated challenges, expectations, and concerns related to death record-keeping in Bangladeshi cemeteries. In 2021, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study involving 25 in-depth interviews with individuals who had lost relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and key informant interviews with service providers at cemeteries. We complemented these interviews with non-participant observations of burial registration practices in seven cemeteries across urban, peri-urban, and rural settings. We used thematic analysis to interpret the data. Our findings reveal diverse death record-keeping practices influenced by sociocultural and administrative dynamics, emphasising the necessity of accurate documentation for securing legal rights and social benefits, such as inheritance and welfare. Notable tensions exist between bureaucratic demands and the emotional realities of grieving families, particularly in non-standardised cemeteries, where acquiring death certificates poses challenges. Stakeholders view the anticipated digitalisation of death record-keeping as a transformative opportunity to streamline processes and improve access to information. However, this transition also highlights existing generational and educational disparities in technological skills, alongside ethical concerns regarding data security and user confidentiality. Our findings showcase the complex interaction between cultural practices, bureaucratic frameworks, and emerging digital technologies in managing death records in Bangladesh. They also emphasise the challenges of modernising traditional documentation methods, as well as the importance of maintaining death records for enhancing civil registration and vital statistics, asserting property rights, and monitoring mortality. A digital system could provide innovative and reliable mortality surveillance from cemeteries.",

        "abstract": "Melioidosis, which is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a disease with a high case fatality rate and a wide variety of disease manifestations causing diagnostic dilemmas for medical professionals. Risk factors such as diabetes contribute to a worse prognosis if not treated with appropriate antibiotics during the course of management. This case report describes a diabetic melioidosis case with a rare presentation of venous thrombosis of the lower limb and a successful course of treatment. The patient was a 48-year-old Bangladeshi male who was admitted with gradually increasing left knee pain and intermittent high-grade fever for 7 days. On examination, he had a palpable spleen, high body temperature (102 °F), and pitting edema in the left lower limb during admission. He was treated with empiric meropenem on admission considering his serious illness. Doppler ultrasound of the left lower limb revealed superficial venous thrombosis and thrombophlebitis involving the long saphenous vein and superficial veins of saphenous territory below the knee. The patient was enrolled as an eligible case in a research study called the Acute Febrile Illness study. Blood culture confirmed the diagnosis as melioidosis. Doxycycline was added to his treatment regimen when the research study team informed the treating physician at the hospital about the diagnosis of melioidosis. He was discharged with cotrimoxazole, which was advised to be taken for 3 months. This case report shows us the lack of diagnostics to detect melioidosis in hospital settings in Bangladesh. The successful treatment outcome proved the importance of routine surveillance for rare or unusual diseases, in addition to endemic pathogens. In addition, training is essential to improve knowledge and raise awareness among clinicians about the clinical diagnosis and management of melioidosis.",

        "abstract": "The burden of childhood diarrhoea remains one of the most important public health problems in countries like Bangladesh, which can be reduced by effective preventive measures. We aimed to investigate the trends in preventive measures practised among under five children with diarrhoea over the last 12 years. Data was extracted from the Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance System at Dhaka Hospital for the period 2012-2023. STATA 15 was used for analysis. We used the Joncheere-Terpstra trend test to examine the trend in preventive measures against diarrhoea and the slope index of inequality (SII) to determine their association with the wealth index. Among 20 373 participants, 61.0% were male, with a median (IQR) age of 11 months (8.0-16.0). Most (88.3%) had access to sanitary latrines, and 40.3% of households consumed boiled or filtered water. We found that 50.3% children aged 6-59 months received vitamin A, and 88.4% of children >9 months had measles vaccination. Breastfeeding practices were observed in 17.8% of the children. Significant upward trends were observed for sanitary latrine use and measles vaccination (p<0.001). Receiving vitamin A supplementation and boiled/filtered water consumption showed a declining trend (p<0.001). Parental education and maternal media exposure were found to be significantly associated with the preventive measures (p<0.05). The wealth index showed a significant association with vitamin A supplementation (p<0.01). However, SII does not indicate inequality between the groups. We found that children from wealthier quintile families had a significantly higher rate of measles immunisation, as indicated by the SII (p value=0.039). Improving practices of preventive measures can significantly reduce diarrhoeal diseases among children under five. Emphasis should be placed on vitamin A supplementation and the consumption of boiled or filtered water. A targeted approach is essential, including promoting health education, enhancing health awareness, and increasing media exposure for mothers.",

Metagenome next-generation sequencing was conducted to elucidate diversity of virus sequences in each pool. Homology-based taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analyses identified a broad diversity of putative viruses from 12 known families, with additional unclassified viruses also likely present. Analysis of male mosquitoes showed some of these viruses are likely capable of being vertically transmitted. Moreover, many of the assembled virus sequences share homology and phylogenetic affinity with segments in sequenced <i>Anopheles</i> genomes, and may represent endogenous viral elements derived from a past evolutionary relationship between these putative viruses and their mosquito hosts.",

These NOVC strains show significant genetic diversity and virulence potential. They are closely related to environmental strains from Kenya and clinical strains from Argentina and Haiti, suggesting transmissions across countries and continents, likely facilitated by human carriers. The highly conserved tcpA gene found in some strains from Cameroon is closely related to the tcpA O1 Classical type, suggesting direct or indirect genetic interactions between these environmental NOVC strains and pandemic strains.

        "abstract": "Mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns targeted at subnational areas with high incidence are central to global cholera elimination efforts. Serological surveillance offers a complementary approach to address gaps in clinical surveillance in these regions. However, similar immune responses from vaccination and infection can lead to overestimates of incidence of infection. To address this, we analyzed antibody dynamics in infected and vaccinated individuals to refine seroincidence estimation strategies for partially vaccinated populations. We tested 757 longitudinal serum samples from confirmed <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1 cases and uninfected contacts in Bangladesh as well as vaccinees from Bangladesh and Haiti, using a multiplex bead assay to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA binding to five cholera-specific antigens. Infection elicited stronger and broader antibody responses than vaccination, with rises in cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) and toxin-coregulated pilus A (TcpA) antibodies uniquely associated with infection. Previously proposed random forest models frequently misclassified vaccinated individuals as recently infected (over 20% at some time points) during the first four months post-vaccination. To address this, we developed new random forest models incorporating vaccinee data, which kept false positive rates among vaccinated (1%) and unvaccinated (4%) individuals low without a significant loss in sensitivity. Simulated serosurveys demonstrated that unbiased seroincidence estimates could be achieved within 21 days of vaccination campaigns by ascertaining vaccination status of participants or applying updated models. These approaches to overcome biases in serological surveillance enable reliable seroincidence estimation even in areas with recent vaccination campaigns enhancing the utility of serological surveillance as an epidemiologic tool in moderate-to-high cholera incidence settings.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease prediction models often face stability challenges when applied to public datasets due to significant class imbalances, unlike the more balanced benchmark datasets. These imbalances can adversely affect various stages of prediction, including feature selection, sampling, and modeling, leading to skewed performance, with one class often being favored over another. To enhance stability, this study proposes a Grow Network (GrowNet) architecture, which dynamically configures itself based on the data's characteristics. To enhance GrowNet's stability, this study proposes the use of TriDyn Dependence feature selection and Adaptive Refinement sampling, which ensure the selection of relevant features across imbalanced data and effectively manage class imbalance during training. When evaluated on the benchmark UCI heart disease dataset, GrowNet has outperformed other models, achieving a specificity of 92%, sensitivity of 88%, precision of 90%, and F1 score of 90%. Further evaluation on three public datasets from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), where heart disease cases constitute only about 6% of the data, has demonstrated GrowNet's ability to maintain balanced performance, with an average specificity, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC of 77.67%, 81.67%, and 89.67%, respectively, while other models have exhibited instability. This represents a 22.8% improvement in handling class imbalance compared to prior studies. Additional tests on two public datasets from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) have confirmed GrowNet's robustness and generalizability, with an average specificity, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC of 80.5%, 82.5%, and 90%, respectively, while other models have continued to demonstrate instability. To enhance transparency, this study incorporates SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, enabling healthcare professionals to understand the decision-making process and identify key risk factors for heart disease, such as bronchitis in midlife, renal dysfunction in the elderly, and depressive disorders in individuals aged 35-44. This study presents a robust, interpretable model to assist healthcare professionals in cost-effective, early heart disease detection by focusing on key risk factors, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (SA) is an opportunistic pathogen and human commensal that is frequently present in the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and skin. While SA can cause diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening bacteraemia, it can also be carried asymptomatically. Indigenous individuals in the Southwest USA experience high rates of invasive SA disease. As carriage is the most significant risk factor for disease, understanding the dynamics of SA carriage, and in particular co-carriage of multiple strains, is important to develop strategies to prevent transmission in vulnerable communities. Here, we investigated SA co-carriage and intrahost evolution by sampling several colonies from multiple anatomical sites and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 310 SA isolates collected from 60 Indigenous adults participating in a cross-sectional carriage study. We assessed the richness and diversity of SA isolates <i>via</i> differences in multilocus sequence type, core-genome SNPs and genome content. Using WGS data, we identified 95 distinct SA intra-subject lineages (ISLs) among 60 participants; co-carriage was detected in 42% (25/60). Notably, two participants each carried four distinct SA ISLs. Variation in antibiotic resistance determinants among carried strains was identified among 42% (25/60) of participants. Lastly, we found unequal distribution of clonal complex by body site, suggesting that certain lineages may be adapted to specific anatomical sites. Together, these findings suggest that co-carriage may occur more frequently than previously appreciated and further our understanding of SA intrahost diversity during carriage, which has implications for surveillance activities and epidemiological investigations.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in many resource-poor countries. Despite an available vaccine, data on HEV-associated mortality are scarce, hindering informed decisions. This study aims to estimate the population-based rate of HEV-specific mortality in Bangladesh. During December 2014 to September 2017, we conducted surveillance in 6 tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Patients aged ≥14 years with acute jaundice were recruited, tested for IgM anti-HEV, and followed up postdischarge. A mortality survey in the hospital catchment areas identified deaths associated with acute jaundice, including maternal deaths, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths delivered by a mother with acute jaundice during pregnancy, as confirmed by 2 independent physicians reviewing verbal autopsy data. Out of 1925 patients with acute jaundice enrolled in the surveillance hospitals, 302 died, with 28 (9%) testing positive for IgM anti-HEV. In the hospital catchment areas, the team identified 587 jaundice-associated deaths, including 25 maternal deaths. Combining hospital-based surveillance and mortality survey data, the study estimated 986 (95% CI, 599-1338) HEV-associated deaths annually among individuals aged ≥14 years in Bangladesh, including 163 (95% CI, 57-395) maternal deaths. Additionally, 279 (95% CI, 101-664) stillbirths and 780 (95% CI, 365-1297) neonatal deaths were attributed to HEV infection annually. Prior Global Burden of Disease studies presented wildly varying modeling estimates of HEV-associated annual deaths, ranging from 50 000 in 2013 to 1932 in 2019. This study is the first to directly measure population-based estimates of mortality in Bangladesh, which can be used to determine the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis E vaccination and other interventions.",

        "abstract": "There is paucity of information on the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection as a cause of stillbirths or childhood deaths in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated attribution of CMV-disease in the causal pathway to stillbirths and deaths in children <5 years of age in seven LMICs participating in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network. We analyzed stillbirths and decedents enrolled between December 2016 and July 2023. Deaths were investigated using post-mortem minimally invasive tissue sampling with histopathology and molecular diagnostic investigations of tissues and body fluids, along with review of clinical records. Multi-disciplinary expert panels reviewed findings and reported on the causal pathway to death. CMV was detected in 19.5%(1140/5841) of all evaluated deaths, including 5.0% (111/2204), 6.2% (139/2229), 41.2% (107/260), 68.1%(323/474) and 68.2%(460/674) of stillbirths, neonates (deaths 0-<28 days postnatal), young infants (28-<90 days), older infants (90-<365 days) and children (12-<60 months), respectively. CMV-disease was attributed in the causal pathway to death in 0.9%(20/2204) of stillbirths, 0.8%(17/2229) of neonates, 13.1% (34/260) of young infants, 9.7%(46/474) of older infants and 3.3%(22/674) of children. Decedents with CMV-disease compared with those without CMV-disease in the causal pathway, were more likely to have severe microcephaly (38.2% vs. 21.1%; aOR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.3-3.6) and HIV-infected (36.9% vs. 6.2%; aOR: 10.9, 95%CI: 6.5-18.5). CMV-disease is an important contributor to deaths during infancy and childhood and is often associated with severe microcephaly and HIV-infection. Improving management of CMV in HIV-infected children and a vaccine to prevent CMV are needed interventions.",

        "title": "Clinical characterisation, treatment outcomes, and case fatality risk of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves. We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves. Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99). Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

We estimate and explore factors in awareness of mpox and acceptance of mpox vaccination in Matlab, a rural region of Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in August and September 2022. A total of 700 households were approached, screened against the inclusion criteria and consented. Households were administered a survey questioning basic demographics, health access, community and government trust, sources of health information, awareness of mpox and intent to be vaccinated against mpox if the vaccine were available at no cost. We summarized the data through a univariate analysis and explored factors in awareness of mpox through a logistic regression. Of the 700 recruited households, 501 completed the survey. Of these, 64% were aware of mpox and 94% were willing to be vaccinated against mpox. Older age had a negative association with awareness of mpox, with a -0.5 percentage point difference (95% confidence interval -1.0 to 0.1); no other demographic factor had a significant or near-significant association. Having access to a bank account and attending a clinic for healthcare needs had a significant positive association with mpox awareness. There are strides to be made in increasing mpox awareness to strengthen passive surveillance efforts and personal protection efforts in Matlab and similar regions. This may be done through educational campaigns, increasing access to healthcare and overall improvements in health literacy. However, acceptance of the vaccination is high, presenting a learning opportunity for other contexts.",

Additionally, studying the usability, technology acceptance, and implementation aspects of the digital death record-keeping system, an innovative intervention that has not been previously explored, ensures the effectiveness, user adoption, and long-term sustainability. We designed, implemented, and evaluated a digital mortality surveillance system in graveyards in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. The study was conducted in six graveyards of the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC). First, we conducted formative research to understand the documentation process of the graveyard record-keeping and inform architecture for a digital record-keeping system. We then developed a digital record-keeping system for graveyard. A cross-sectional quantitative and qualitative study was conducted among web and app users, and graveyard managers and death records keepers. A total of 200 app and web users and 14 record-keepers and managers participated. App and web users had high levels of system usability (88%) and found them easy to use (100%) and well-integrated (100%), with disagreement on complexity (100%), inconsistency (100%), and technical support needs (100%). These users had high technology acceptance and agreed the tools help accomplish tasks quickly (100%), improve performance (100%), and were easy to learn (100%). Digital death record-keepers reported using the system frequently (71%) but found it somewhat complex (14%) and not consistently easy to use (28%), with some reported that the systems were well integration (50%) and easy to learn (43%). While technology acceptance varied, death record keepers generally agreed that the system helps with quick task completion (50%) and performance improvement (57%), increase productivity (43%), enhance effectiveness (57%), and easy to use (50%). The digital death record-keeping system received mixed reactions, with younger, tech-savvy operators being optimistic, while older supervisors were sceptical and uncomfortable with technology. Additionally, the system was found to be feasible to an extent, particularly by data entry operators and graveyard managers. The digital death record-keeping system was generally well-received by app and web users for its usability and integration, though graveyard supervisor found it somewhat complex, with mixed reactions based on tech-savviness; overall, the system was deemed feasible and sustainable.",

        "abstract": "Colletotrichum fructicola is one of the most important species causing peach anthracnose around the world, including China. Fludioxonil has been effectively applied to control anthracnose disease as well as several important fungal diseases such as gray mold, leaf blight, early blight, corn stem rot, peanut root rot, rice evil seedling disease, and other diseases transmitted through seeds or soil. In this study, 39C. fructicola isolates were collected from different locations in Guizhou Province and Guangdong Province. A sensitive isolate of C. fructicola, previously thought to be naturally resistant to fludioxonil, was unexpectedly detected. No cross-resistance was found for fludioxonil with procymidone, prochloraz, and pyraclostrobin. Significant differences were observed between sensitive and resistant isolates in terms of mycelial growth rate and osmotic sensitivity experiments (4 %, 6 %, and 8 % NaCl), but no significant difference was found for sporulation. A novel mutation I880V was detected in the Os1 protein from one sensitive isolate. Molecular docking was used to explain the reversal of inherent resistance to sensitivity of C. fructicola to fludioxonil. Results showed that the wild type Os1 protein was docked against fludioxonil with a binding energy of -6.8 kj/mol, while it increased to -6.6 kj/mol between the mutated protein and fludioxonil. At the same time, different interactions were observed between wild type and mutated proteins with fludioxonil. These results suggest that the I880V mutation in the Os1 protein changed the conformation of the binding pocket, potentially leading to the reversal from resistance to sensitivity to fludioxonil. These findings are remarkable in demonstrating the fludioxonil resistance mechanism, and further studies such as genetic transformation and a range of molecular investigations are necessary to validate resistance mechanisms, elucidate the molecular pathways involved, and develop effective disease management strategies.",

        "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, COVID-19, remains a worldwide public health concern due to its high rate of transmission, even in vaccinated and previously infected people. In the endemic state, it continues to cause significant pathology. To elu- cidate the viral mutational changes and screen the emergence of new variants of concern, we conducted this study in Bangladesh. The viral RNA genomes extracted from 25 ran- domly collected samples of COVID-19-positive patients from March 2021 to February 2022 were sequenced using Illumina COVID Seq protocol and genomic data processing, as well as evaluations performed in DRAGEN COVID Lineage software. In this study, the percentage of Delta, Omicron, and Mauritius variants identified were 88%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. All of the 25 samples had 23,403 A>G (D614G, S gene), 3037 C>T (nsp3), and 14,408 C>T (nsp12) mutations, where 23,403 A>G was responsible for increased transmis- sion. Omicron had the highest number of unique mutations in the spike protein (i.e., sub- stitutions, deletions, and insertions), which may explain its higher transmissibility and immune-evading ability than Delta. A total of 779 mutations were identified, where 691 substitutions, 85 deletions, and 3 insertion mutations were observed. To sum up, our study will enrich the genomic database of SARS-CoV-2, aiding in treatment strategies along with understanding the virus's preferences in both mutation type and mutation site for predicting newly emerged viruses' survival strategies and thus for preparing to coun- teract them.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> To aid in the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), we analyzed the patterns and trends in antibiotic prescriptions for patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), utilizing the WHO's AWaRe classification. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed data from hospital-based influenza surveillance from January 2011 to December 2020 across nine Bangladeshi tertiary-level hospitals. Surveillance physicians collected WHO-defined SARI patient data, including demographics, clinical characteristics, and antibiotic prescriptions. Descriptive statistics and parametric and non-parametric tests were used for the analysis. <b>Results:</b> Of 21,566 SARI patients [median age 20 years (IQR: 1.33-45), 66% male], 91% were prescribed at least one antibiotic. A total of 25,133 antibiotics were prescribed, of which 47.0% were third-generation cephalosporins, 16.5% were macrolides, and 11.1% were beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors. According to the AWaRe classification, 28.7% were in the Access group, while 71.3% were in the Watch group, and none were from the Reserve group. A downward trend in Access group (30.4% to 25.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.010) and an upward trend in Watch group antibiotic prescription (69.6% to 74.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.010) were observed. We identified that patients aged < 5 years (aOR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.44-2.25), who were treated in government hospitals (aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.35-1.57), patients with the presence of lung diseases (aOR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.35-1.80) had an increased likelihood of being prescribed Watch group antibiotics. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study reveals a concerning pattern of antibiotic overuse among SARI patients in Bangladesh, with a growing trend over the past decade towards increased Watch group antibiotic prescriptions. Only one-third of the prescribed antibiotics were from the Access group, falling short of the two-thirds threshold recommended by the WHO. Effective ASPs are crucial to optimize antibiotic prescriptions and mitigate the risk of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Approximately half of all antimicrobial prescriptions in intensive care units (ICUs) may be inappropriate, including those prescribed when not needed, in unnecessary combinations or for longer durations than needed. Inappropriate prescribing is costly, exposes patients to unnecessary side-effects and drives population-level antimicrobial resistance, the prevalence and consequences of which are greatest in low- and middle-income countries. However, the implementation of interventions to improve the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing has been variable and requires further study. We propose a type III hybrid implementation/effectiveness interventional cohort trial in 35 ICUs in up to 11 low- and middle- income countries. The study intervention is a structured review of antimicrobial prescriptions as recommended by the World Health Organisation. Strategies to support stakeholder-led implementation include development of local protocols, registry-enabled audit and feedback, and education. Evaluation of implementation, and the determinants of its success, is informed by the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research respectively. The primary outcome is a composite measure of fidelity, reach and adoption. Secondary outcomes describe the effectiveness of the intervention on improving antimicrobial prescribing. Qualitative interviews will assess relevant implementation acceptability, adaptations and maintenance. A baseline survey will investigate ICU-level antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes. This study addresses global policy priorities by supporting implementation research of antimicrobial stewardship, and strengthening associated healthcare professional competencies. It does this in a setting where improvement is sorely needed: low- and middle- income country ICUs. The study will also describe the influence of pre-existing antimicrobial stewardship structures and processes on implementation and improve understanding about the efficacy of strategies to overcome barriers to implementation in these settings. This study protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ref NCT06666738) on 31 Oct 2004. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06666738?term=NCT06666738&rank=1 .",

        "abstract": "Bacteria harness diverse defense systems that protect against phage predation<sup>1</sup>, many of which are encoded on horizontally transmitted mobile genetic elements (MGEs)<sup>2</sup>. In turn, phages evolve counter-defenses<sup>3</sup>, driving a dynamic arms race that remains underexplored in human disease contexts. For the diarrheal pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, a higher burden of its lytic phage, ICP1, in patient stool correlates with reduced disease severity<sup>4</sup>. However, direct molecular evidence of phage-driven selection of epidemic <i>V. cholerae</i> has not been demonstrated. Here, through clinical surveillance in cholera-endemic Bangladesh, we capture the acquisition of a parasitic anti-phage MGE, PLE11, that initiated a selective sweep coinciding with the largest cholera outbreak in recent records. PLE11 exhibited potent anti-phage activity against co-circulating ICP1, explaining its rapid and dominating emergence. We identify PLE11-encoded Rta as the novel defense responsible and provide evidence that Rta restricts phage tail assembly. Using experimental evolution, we predict phage counteradaptations against PLE11 and document the eventual emergence and selection of ICP1 that achieves a convergent evolutionary outcome. By probing how PLEs hijack phage structural proteins to drive their horizontal transmission while simultaneously restricting phage tail assembly, we discover that PLEs manipulate tail assembly to construct chimeric tails comprised of MGE and phage-encoded proteins. Collectively, our findings reveal the molecular basis of the natural selection of a globally significant pathogen and its virus in a clinically relevant context.",

        "abstract": "The WHO South-East Asia Region (SEAR), with its high population density, is recognised by epidemiologists as a critical reservoir for the emergence and global dissemination of novel influenza strains, making it a potential epicentre for future influenza pandemics. Despite this significant risk, most SEAR countries lack comprehensive seasonal influenza vaccination policies, resulting in low vaccine uptake across the region. This review analysed the latest WHO National Influenza Programme factsheets from the 11 SEAR member states and supplemented this with extensive manual literature searches using electronic databases and government websites. As of October 2022, only three countries-India, Bhutan and Thailand-had established seasonal influenza vaccination policies. Among them, Bhutan and Thailand have policies that cover all five WHO-recommended high-risk groups. While national influenza surveillance systems are in place across SEAR, only India and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea claim full population coverage. Influenza vaccine production capacity is limited to Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. The region's varied climatic conditions and insufficient local data have further obscured the true burden of influenza. Thailand offers a successful model for other countries in the region, beginning with the most vulnerable groups and gradually expanding coverage. To effectively develop and implement national influenza vaccination policies, SEAR countries must close the evidence gap by strengthening surveillance systems to provide accurate, timely data and prioritise context-specific research, leverage existing vaccine infrastructure, enhance public education and finally engage with local and international stakeholders to establish strong international cooperation to support these efforts and improve pandemic preparedness.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty is defined as limited knowledge or lack of predictability about past, present or future events. The COVID-19 pandemic management was significantly impacted by uncertainty, as the gaps between existing information and the necessary knowledge hindered decision-making. Current uncertainty literature primarily focuses on natural disasters, leaving a gap in understanding decision-making under uncertainty in times of public health emergencies. Analysing strategies for making decisions under uncertainty during the pandemic is crucial for future pandemic preparedness. Using a comparative research design, we study the strategies governments used to make decisions under uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data through desk reviews, stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders from government, academia and civil society from six purposefully selected countries: Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Bangladesh, Jordan and the UK. Regardless of political, geographic and economic context, all six countries adopted common strategies to make decisions under three types of uncertainties. Decision-making under epistemic uncertainty involved seeking expert advice and collecting evidence from other countries and international organisations. Decision-making under strategic uncertainty involved coordination, collaboration and communication. Decision-making under institutional uncertainty involved using or adapting pre-existing experiences, structures and relationships and establishing new institutions and processes. We contribute to the theory and practice of public health crisis decision-making by presenting a unified national-level applied decision-making framework for events involving uncertainty. We provide practical guidance for approaches to enhance decision-making in future health crises that could also be used for other emergencies.",

        "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that can lead to severe pregnancy outcomes. This study reports the clinical and genomic characteristics of a Listeria-mediated stillbirth identified in January 2022 through the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) project in Bangladesh. The Lm-BD-CHAMPS-01 isolate was recovered from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a male stillborn. Maternal history, clinical, and demographic data were collected by the CHAMPS surveillance platform. An expert panel evaluated all reports to determine the role of L. monocytogenes infection in the causal chain of stillbirth. Genomic characterization included multilocus sequence typing (MLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST), serotyping, and the presence or absence of virulence genes. Genetic divergence and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to determine the relationship with other reported isolates globally. The isolate Lm-BD-CHAMPS-01 was identified as a novel cgMLST CT11424. It belonged to ST 308, Serotype 4b, Clonal Complex 1, and Phylogenetic Lineage 1. Key L. monocytogenes virulence genes facilitating the crossing of the placental barrier, including full-length inlA, LIPI-1, and LIPI-3, were detected. The isolate was closely related to clinical L. monocytogenes isolates, as determined by GrapeTree based on cgMLST. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis found Lm-BD-CHAMPS-01 to be the most distant from other CC1 isolates in the database. Possible sources of infection included the consumption of contaminated raw vegetables or exposure to pigeons. This is the first genome sequence of clinical L. monocytogenes from Bangladesh, which also caused stillbirth. Rural healthcare professionals should be aware of L. monocytogenes infection risks during pregnancy. Pregnant women should be counseled on the dangers of exposure to animals or birds and consumption of potentially contaminated raw food to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes due to L. monocytogenes infection.",

However, information on Euvichol-Plus's effectiveness is limited. Using this vaccine in a cholera epidemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh, provided the opportunity to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a test-negative design. A two-dose regimen of Euvichol-Plus was administered to individuals aged >1 year in a population of ca. 900 000 in two campaign rounds between June and August 2022, with prospective registration of all persons who received at least one dose. We conducted systematic surveillance in two key facilities, enrolling patients with acute watery diarrhoea who were eligible for vaccination from the campaign's start and who presented for care between 21 August 2022 and 20 August 2023. Faecal culture-positive cholera cases were matched to up to four faecal culture-negative controls by age, presentation date and facility. Vaccination status was documented without knowledge of culture results. Conditional logistic regression models estimated the OR for the vaccination-cholera association, and the VE of the two-dose regimen was calculated as [(1-OR) × 100]. The analysis included 226 cases and 552 matched controls. The adjusted VE of two doses of the Euvichol-Plus vaccine against medically attended cholera was 66% (99.5% CI: 30 to 83) for all recipients. Limited protection (12%; 95% CI: -95 to 60) was observed for children aged 1-4 years; whereas, protection was 79% (95% CI: 60 to 89) for those aged ≥5 years. VE against cholera with moderate to severe dehydration was 69% (95% CI: 44 to 83) overall but 6% (95% CI: -206 to 71) for children aged 1-4 years. Euvichol-Plus provided significant protection against medically attended cholera of any severity as well as cholera with moderate to severe dehydration. However, significant levels of protection were only observed for those aged ≥5 years.",

The genetic diversity of IBV, driven by mutations, recombination and deletions, has led to the emergence of numerous serotypes and genotypes, complicating both diagnosis and control measures. Rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are essential for effective disease management and minimizing economic losses. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as PCR, virus isolation, and serological assays, are hindered by limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time. In contrast, innovative biosensor platforms employing advanced detection mechanisms-including electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric sensors-offer a transformative solution. These technologies provide portable, highly sensitive, and rapid diagnostic platforms for IBV detection. Beyond addressing the challenges of conventional methods, these biosensor-based approaches facilitate real-time monitoring and enhance disease surveillance. This review highlights the transformative potential of biosensors and their integration into diagnostic strategies for avian coronavirus infections, presenting them as a promising alternative for precise and efficient IBV detection.",

        "abstract": "During the 2023-dengue outbreak in Bangladesh, a diagnostic evaluation study was conducted to investigate concurrent Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) transmission in Dhaka in 2023. The study explored to simultaneously detect the presence of ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV while considering relevant clinical and epidemiological risk factors, using a real-time multiplex RT-PCR system. Following this, it was planned to sequence the selected samples to identify genetic variations of the ZIKV infections within the population. This study was designed as a diagnostic evaluation, where participants meeting the inclusion criteria were prospectively recruited with written informed consent. A total of 399 febrile individuals were screened, with 185 meeting the inclusion criteria of having a fever onset within 2-5 days, along with one of the following clinical features, e.g. headache, myalgia, arthralgia or bone pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and 152 undergoing real-time RT-PCR testing. Five ZIKV-positive cases were identified, including one DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the ZIKV strains were part of the Asian lineage, closely related to Cambodian and Chinese strains from 2019. All ZIKV-positive cases were male, residing within a one-kilometer radius, with no prior travel history, suggesting community-level transmission. This study marks the first identification of ZIKV in Dhaka city and the first report of ZIKV-DENV co-infection in Bangladesh that highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by the symptomatic similarities between ZIKV and other arboviruses and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and public health interventions to mitigate the spread and impact of ZIKV in dengue-endemic regions.",

This study provides a current overview of the Mpox epidemic as of 2024, emphasizing significant developments and epidemiological trends. The World Health Organization (WHO) initially designated a clade Ⅱb outbreak as a global health emergency in May 2022, which was subsequently managed through vaccination and public health interventions by May 2023. In September 2023, a resurgence of cladeⅠ in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) resulted in a 160 % increase in cases by 2024. The WHO declared this increase a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in August 2024. The outbreak timeline indicates substantial rises in cases and fatalities, especially among children under 15 in the DRC. Regional analysis reveals that the European Region initially recorded the highest incidence of cases and fatalities. In contrast, regions including African Region (AFRO), Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO), South-East Asia Region (SEARO), and Western Pacific Region (WPRO) exhibited a rise in cases, indicating a potential spread or resurgence of the health event. Gender disparities in transmission pathways were apparent, with males exhibiting higher case numbers, particularly via person-to-person contact. The research highlights the necessity of ongoing surveillance, global collaboration, and focused public health measures. The discourse addresses obstacles in vaccine distribution and the necessity for emergency use authorizations, highlighting the imperativeness for adaptive strategies in public health management.

The study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding high salt intake and their association with hypertension among rural women of a selected community in Chandpur. A cross-sectional study was adopted to collect data from 250 households of Chandpur district. The study was conducted during May 2022 to July 2022. The semi-structured pretested WHO-modified step-wise approach to the non-communicable disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS). Instrument version 3.1 module was used to administer the knowledge, attitude and practice questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the participants. Binary logistic regression was performed to examine the factor related with knowledge, attitude, and practices. The result gives evidence that participant who added always salt to their meals were three times more likely to be hypotensive (AOR: 2.99; CI: 1.40, 6.42). Besides, participants who avoid eating outside are significantly less likely (AOR: 0.19; C.I: 0.05 to 0.70) to be hypertensive. Findings showed that daily salt consumption and \"avoid eating out\" were significantly associated with hypertension status.

        "abstract": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) are vector-borne orbiviruses that pose an emerging threat to livestock, including cattle and sheep. This review summarizes the global distribution, genetic diversity, and key factors driving their spread along with the existing knowledge gaps and recommendations to mitigate their impact. Both viruses cause hemorrhagic disease in susceptible ruminants and are commonly reported in tropical and subtropical regions including North America, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and some parts of Europe. The geographical distribution of these viruses, encompassing 27 BTV and 7 EHDV serotypes, has shifted, particularly with the recent invasion of BTV-3, 4, and 8 and EHDV-8 serotypes in Europe. Several factors contribute to the recent spread of these viruses such as the distribution of virulent strains by the movement of temperature-dependent <i>Culicoides</i> vectors into new areas due to rapid climate change, the reassortment of viral strains during mixed infections, and unrestricted global trade. These diseases cause significant economic impacts including morbidity, mortality, reduced production, high management costs, and the disruption of international trade. Effective prevention and control strategies are paramount and rely on vaccination, vector control using insecticides, and the destruction of breeding sites, husbandry practices including the isolation and quarantine of infected hosts, restriction of animal movement, prompt diagnosis and identification of circulating strains, and effective surveillance and monitoring plans such as the pre-export and post-import screening of semen used for artificial insemination. However, challenges remain with intercontinental virus spread, live vaccines, and the failure of inactivated vaccines to produce protective immunity against dissimilar strains. Significant knowledge gaps highlight the need for a better scientific understanding and a strategic plan to ensure healthy livestock and global food security.",

        "abstract": "There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230). 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success. Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

        "abstract": "High mutation rates in SARS-CoV-2, particularly among immunocompromised patients living with HIV, continue to complicate the current COVID-19 pandemic. The threshold for severe COVID-19 and a greater risk of mortality have increased in many immunocompromised individuals due to a weakened immune system. Low CD4+ T-cell counts in people living with both HIV and COVID-19 lead to prolonged disease duration and, therefore, an increased likelihood of viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 mutations in such individuals. These mutations could decrease the efficiency of ongoing vaccines and cause new outbreaks. Recently, the rise of new mutations in this patient population has created increasing concern; however, few data are currently available on the direct association of HIV infection with SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This review highlights the implications of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection, highlighting the need for extra caution and monitoring of the immune-compromised population during a pandemic. Access to HIV care and COVID-19 treatments, careful surveillance, and adapted health strategies are key to reducing risks and protecting these populations. Further research is required to elucidate the dynamics of mutations and develop intervention methods to manage COVID-19 among immunocompromised patients.",

This systematic review aims to describe pathogens studied using MBAs, the operational implementation of MBAs, and how the data generated were synthesised. In November and December 2023, four databases were searched for studies utilising MBAs for the integrated serosurveillance of infectious diseases. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data regarding the study settings and population, methodology, seroprevalence results, and operational implementation elements. Overall, 4765 studies were identified; 47 were eligible for inclusion, of which 41% (<i>n</i> = 19) investigated multiple malaria species, and 14% performed concurrent surveillance of malaria in combination with other infectious diseases (<i>n</i> = 14). Additionally, 14 studies (29%) investigated a combination of multiple infectious diseases (other than malaria), and seven studies examined a combination of vaccine-preventable diseases. Haiti (<i>n</i> = 8) was the most studied country, followed by Ethiopia (<i>n</i> = 6), Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 3), Kenya (<i>n</i> = 3), and Tanzania (<i>n</i> = 3). Only seven studies were found where integrated serosurveillance was the primary objective. The synthesis of data varied and included the investigation of age-specific seroprevalence (<i>n</i> = 25), risk factor analysis (<i>n</i> = 15), and spatial analysis of disease prevalence (<i>n</i> = 8). This review demonstrated that the use of MBAs for integrated surveillance of multiple pathogens is gaining traction; however, more research and capabilities in lower- and middle-income countries are needed to optimise and standardise sample collection, survey implementation, and the analysis and interpretation of results. Geographical and population seroprevalence data can enable targeted public health interventions, highlighting the potential and importance of integrated serological surveillance as a public health tool.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, data related to the future risk of dementia and its associated factors are scarce. Furthermore, no dementia risk prediction tool has yet been applied to estimate the risk in any population in Bangladesh. Therefore, our objective was to assess the risk of dementia and its associated factors among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This cross-sectional study conveniently recruited 280 stable patients with CAD who were admitted for coronary revascularization at a tertiary cardiac hospital situated in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected face-to-face using a pretested questionnaire adapted from the WHO STEP-wise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) of Noncommunicable Diseases Risk Factors questionnaire (Version 3.2). The questionnaire included background information (sociodemographic, comorbidity), behavioral and metabolic risk factors, physical and biochemical measurements. The next 20 years' risk of dementia was estimated using the \"Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia\" score. The risk score, risk levels, and risk factors were presented descriptively. The associated factors of dementia risk were elucidated using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The mean ( ± standard deviation) risk score for dementia was 6.26 ± 2.28. The predicted \"at-risk\" population was 63.6%. The prevalent risk factors were unhealthy diets (84.3%) presented by inadequate fruit/vegetable consumption (70%) and added salt intake (46.4%). In the final model of hierarchical multiple regression, the risk score showed a significant association with several risk factors: family history of diabetes (<i>p</i> = 0.03), alcohol intake (<i>p</i> = 0.03), current smoking (<i>p</i> = 0.03), estimated glomerular filtration rate (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (<i>p</i> = 0.02). A substantial proportion of patients with CAD had a future risk of dementia which demands an urgent risk reduction strategy in Bangladesh.

It included a non-institutionalized adults' population of 6189 men and women aged 18-69 years. Their daily salt consumption was estimated using the spot urine sodium concentration following the Tanaka equation and reported according to the standard nomenclature proposed by the World Hypertension League and partner organizations involved in dietary salt reduction. Out of a total of 6189 participants, 2.4% consumed the recommended amount of salt (<5 g/day), 67.8% consumed a high amount of salt (≥5-10 g/day), 27.2% consumed a very high amount of salt (>10-15 g/day), and 2.6% consumed an extremely high amount of salt (>15 g/day). In univariate analysis, a higher than recommended level of salt intake (≥5 g/day) was significantly prevalent among rural residents (high = 78.4%, very-high = 81.6%, extremely-high = 84.9%, p = 0.01), literates (high = 51.6%, very-high = 57.9%, extremely-high = 59.1%, p = 0.02), newly diagnosed hypertension (high = 20.6%, very-high = 23.6%, extremely-high = 24.1%, p = 0.008), and overweight/obese (high = 25.9%, very-high = 33.3%, extremely-high = 29.8%, p = 0.000). Similarly, in ordinal logistic regression analysis, the categories of daily salt consumption showed a significant association with rural residence (OR: 1.300, CI: 1.109-1.524, p = 0.001), literates (OR: 0.777, CI: 0.671-0.900, p = 0.001), newly diagnosed hypertension (OR: 1.204, CI: 1.022-1.419, p = 0.026), and overweight/obesity (OR: 1.353, CI: 1.145-1.598, p = 0.000).

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge in mitigating waterborne diseases risk exacerbated by climate change. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of these diseases at the district level remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern and identifying the best tree-based ML models for determining the meteorological factors associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh. This study used district-level reported cases of waterborne diseases (cholera, amoebiasis, typhoid and hepatitis A) obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) sourced from NASA for the period spanning 2017 to 2020. Exploratory spatial analysis, spatial regression and tree-based machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 and 2020, Bangladesh reported 73, 606 cholera, 38, 472 typhoid, 2, 510 hepatitis A and 1, 643 amoebiasis disease cases. Among the waterborne diseases cholera showed higher incidence rates in Chapai-Nawabganj (456.23), Brahmanbaria (417.44), Faridpur (225.07), Nilphamari (188.62) and Pirojpur (171.62) districts. The spatial regression model identified mean temperature (β = 12.16, s.e: 3.91) as the significant risk factor of waterborne diseases. The optimal XGBoost model highlighted mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation as determinants associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2020. The findings from the study, incorporating the One Health perspective, provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat waterborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries. Precautionary measures and intensified surveillance need to be implemented in certain high-risk districts for waterborne diseases across the country.",

        "abstract": "Despite global initiatives to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies by 2030, the Arabian Peninsula faces challenges due to insufficient data. This review addresses the current rabies situation and knowledge gaps in the region and proposes One Health interventions. Employing a mixed-method approach combining scoping and systematic review, the study commenced with a Delphi discussion to identify knowledge gaps and set objectives. The literature search encompassed published articles and grey literature. The spatial and temporal distribution of rabies was analysed, alongside quantitative meta-analyses to assess prevalence. Rabies virus gene sequences from the NCBI database were examined for reservoir hosts and evolutionary patterns. The final Delphi discussion with experts focused on addressing knowledge gaps and formulating One Health interventions. The first reported human rabies case in this region occurred in Saudi Arabia in 1980. Yemen reported the highest number of cases (439), followed by Iraq (249), Saudi Arabia (91), Jordan (14), and Oman (9). Fox bites accounted for the most cases (47.4%), followed by dog (36.8%) and wild animal (15.8%) bites. The virus was detected in at least 21 animal species. Phylogenetic analysis detected a single strain with two clades, with foxes being the primary virus reservoir. However, the experts expressed scepticism about the accuracy of rabies reports in scientific literature. To achieve the 2030 goal of eliminating dog-mediated human rabies, a stepwise approach towards rabies elimination assessment is crucial in the region. Enhanced surveillance, awareness campaigns, and access to post exposure prophylaxis are essential to address the disease burden.",

        "abstract": "Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella spp., affecting various animals and humans, leading to significant economic and public health impacts. Traditional diagnostic methods, mainly serological, often fail to detect seronegative carriers, which continue to spread the infection. This review aims to highlight advancements in molecular diagnostics that address these limitations. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus was conducted, focusing on studies using seronegative, PCR, qPCR and biosensor-based techniques. Data extraction and meta-analyses were performed, evaluating pooled detection rates and heterogeneity. Through analysis of existing studies, we review key molecular techniques, including PCR, LAMP and biosensor-based assays, which offer high sensitivity and specificity by detecting bacterial DNA directly, thus overcoming the challenges of antibody-based tests. Meta-analysis of detection rates across different studies showed significant variability, with rates ranging from 0.96% to 100%, highlighting differences in sample types, animal species and regions. The pooled detection proportion from random-effects models was 35.08%, indicating that many seronegative animals still carry Brucella spp. A forest plot analysis further confirmed heterogeneity in detection, underlining the importance of using molecular diagnostics alongside serological tests to identify hidden carriers. Innovations like nanoparticle-enhanced biosensors and CRISPR-Cas systems show promise for rapid, on-site diagnostics. The findings suggest that integrating molecular methods with traditional serology can improve surveillance and disease management. Future research should focus on developing portable, field-ready diagnostic devices and standardised protocols, along with exploring novel biomarkers to detect latent infections.

In this study, we evaluated the disease burden and antimicrobial prescription patterns of Sonali chickens in Bangladesh using a web-based data recording system from 2020 to 2021 and analyzed 1690 cases. The diagnoses recorded in the system were presumptive, as they were based on clinico-epidemiological history, clinical signs, and gross necropsy findings noted by registered veterinarians. We conducted this study in Bogura, a district renowned for its high concentration of Sonali chicken farms. We estimated a higher prevalence of infection among grower chickens (69.0%) compared to starter chickens (31.0%). Small- to medium-sized flocks (63%) were more frequently infected than larger flocks (37.0%). Most disease cases occurred during the summer season (43.0%), followed by winter (27%), the rainy season (15%), and autumn (14%). Overall, climatic factors contributed to 51% of disease occurrence at temperatures below 25°C, 55% at high humidity (≥75%), and 57% during heavy rainfall (≥29 mm). The most prevalent disease was Newcastle disease (ND) (19.5%), followed by Marek's disease (9.8%), coccidiosis (7.4%), necrotic enteritis (4.7%), infectious bursal disease (3.2%), and infectious laryngotracheitis (3.2%). The odds of ND were 1.4 (grower chickens vs. starter chickens), 11.4 (summer vs. winter), 4.1 (autumn vs. winter), 3.9 (rainy vs. winter), 3.5 (≥25 °C vs. <25 °C), and 2.6 (≥75% vs. <75%). Tylvalosin (38.0%) was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic, followed by fluoroquinolones (9.0%), aminoglycosides (8.0%), and colistin sulphate (4.0%).

This study investigated the differential pathogenic profiles ETEC across various age groups, emphasizing the importance of selecting potential ETEC antigens tailored to infection patterns in infants and adults in Bangladesh. This study utilized the icddr,b's 2% systematic hospital surveillance data of diarrheal patients (<i>n</i> = 14,515) from 2017 to 2022 to examine the age-specific pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of ETEC infections. In total ETEC was identified in 1,371 (9.4%) of surveillance samples. ETEC-associated diarrhea was higher in children aged 0-2 years and decreased significantly in the 3-17 years age group. Among all ETEC cases, 56% were adults (<i>p</i> = 0.0079) with severe dehydration. Distinct age-specific distribution of ETEC toxin types and colonization factors (CFs) were observed: heat labile toxin (LT)-associated ETEC infections decreased with age (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), while heat stable toxin (ST)-associated-ETEC was prevalent across all ages. Adults exhibited significantly higher rates of ETEC diarrhea with strains secreting both types of toxins. A high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among ETEC strains, particularly in pediatric cases, with significant resistance observed against commonly used antibiotics such as azithromycin and in line with similar age specific toxin profiles. The most common CFs were CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and CS21. CFA/I positive ETEC infection was more common in children (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while CS5 and CS6 were more common in adults (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The findings provide valuable insights into ETEC epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations.

        "abstract": "Rapid human movement plays a crucial role in the spatial dissemination of the dengue virus. Nevertheless, robust quantification of this relationship using both spatial and temporal models remains necessary. This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue transmission under various human movement contexts. We obtained district-wise aggregated dengue incidence data from the Management Information System, Directorate General of Health Services of Bangladesh. The stringency index (SI), along with eight individual policy measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker database) and six mobility indices (as measured by Google's Community Mobility Reports) were obtained as human movement indicators. A multi-step correlative modelling approach, including various spatial and temporal models, was utilized to explore the associations of dengue incidence with the SI, fourteen human movement indices and the Eid festival. The global Moran's I indicated significant spatial autocorrelation in dengue incidence during the pre-pandemic (Moran's I: 0.14, P < 0.05) and post-pandemic periods (Moran's I: 0.42, P < 0.01), while the pandemic period (2020-2022) showed weaker, non-significant spatial clustering (Moran's I: 0.07, P > 0.05). Following the pandemic, we identified the emergence of new dengue hotspots. We found a strong negative relationship between monthly dengue incidence and the SI (r<sub>spearman</sub>: - 0.62, P < 0.01). Through the selection of an optimal Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we observed that the closure of public transport (β = - 1.66, P < 0.10) and restrictions on internal movement (β = - 2.13, P < 0.10) were associated with the reduction of dengue incidence. Additionally, observed cases were substantially lower than predicted cases during the period from 2020 to 2022. By utilising additional time-series models, we were able to identify in 2023 a rise in dengue incidence associated with the Eid festival intervention, even after adjusting for important climate variables. Overall, rapid human movement was found to be associated with increased dengue transmission in Bangladesh. Consequently, the implemention of effective mosquito control interventions prior to large festival periods is necessary for preventing the spread of the disease nationwide. We emphasize the necessity for developing advanced surveillance and monitoring networks to track real-time human movement patterns and dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) that are ten-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) became available in 2010. We evaluated their global impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in all ages. Serotype-specific IPD cases and population denominators were obtained directly from surveillance sites using PCV10 or PCV13 in their national immunisation programmes and with a primary series uptake of at least 50%. Annual incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated comparing the incidence before any PCV with each year post-PCV10 or post-PCV13 introduction using Bayesian multi-level, mixed-effects Poisson regressions, by site and age group. All site-weighted average IRRs were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression, stratified by product and previous seven-valent PCV (PCV7) effect (none, moderate, or substantial). Analyses included 32 PCV13 sites (488 758 cases) and 15 PCV10 sites (46 386 cases) in 30 countries, primarily high income (39 sites), using booster dose schedules (41 sites). By 6 years after PCV10 or PCV13 introduction, IPD due to PCV10-type serotypes and PCV10-related serotype 6A declined substantially for both products (age <5 years: 83-99% decline; ≥65 years: 54-96% decline). PCV7-related serotype 19A increases before PCV10 or PCV13 introduction were reversed at PCV13 sites (age <5 years: 61-79% decline relative to before any PCV; age ≥65 years: 7-26% decline) but increased at PCV10 sites (age <5 years: 1·6-2·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 3·6-4·9-fold). Serotype 3 IRRs had no consistent trends for either product or age group. Non-PCV13-type IPD increased similarly for both products (age <5 years: 2·3-3·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 1·7-2·3-fold). Despite different serotype 19A trends, all-serotype IPD declined similarly between products among children younger than 5 years (58-74%); among adults aged 65 years or older, declines were greater at PCV13 (25-29%) than PCV10 (4-14%) sites, but other differences between sites precluded attribution to product. Long-term use of PCV10 or PCV13 reduced IPD substantially in young children and more moderately in older ages. Non-vaccine-type serotypes increased approximately two-fold to three-fold by 6 years after introduction of PCV10 or PCV13. Continuing serotype 19A increases at PCV10 sites and declines at PCV13 sites suggest that PCV13 use would further reduce IPD at PCV10 sites.

        "abstract": "In 2020, COVID-19 modeling studies predicted rapid epidemic growth and quickly overwhelmed health systems in humanitarian and fragile settings due to preexisting vulnerabilities and limited resources. Despite the growing evidence from Bangladesh, no study has examined the epidemiology of COVID-19 in out-of-camp settings in Cox's Bazar during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020-March 2021). This paper aims to fill this gap. Secondary data analyses were conducted on case and testing data from the World Health Organization and the national health information system via the District Health Information Software 2. COVID-19 in Cox's Bazar was characterized by a large peak in June 2020, followed by a smaller wave in August/September and a new wave from March 2021. Males were more likely to be tested than females (68% vs. 32%, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and had higher incidence rates (305.29/100 000 males vs. 114.90/100 000 female, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Mortality was significantly associated with age (OR: 87.3; 95% CI: 21.03-350.16, <i>P</i> < 0.001) but not sex. Disparities existed in testing and incidence rates among upazilas. Incidence was lower than expected, with indicators comparable to national-level data. These findings are likely influenced by the younger population age, high isolation rates, and low testing capacity. With testing extremely limited, true incidence and mortality rates are likely higher, highlighting the importance of improving disease surveillance in fragile settings. Data incompleteness and fragmentation were the main study limitations.",

        "abstract": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) remain the leading infectious cause of death among children < 5 years, with viruses contributing to a large proportion of cases. Little is known about the epidemiology and etiology of viral ALRI in rural Bangladesh. We enrolled 3- to 23-month-old children with ALRIs attending a subdistrict hospital outpatient clinic in Sylhet district in Bangladesh. Trained study physicians ascertained the cases and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs to detect 19 respiratory viruses by multiplex PCR using the Luminex Integrated System NxTAG Respiratory pathogen panel. Between August 2016 and September 2017, we enrolled 1477 children. Median age was 10 months; 58.1% were male. Forty-seven percent presented during autumn (mid-June to mid-October). About a third had temperature ≥ 101°F, 95.4% had cough in the previous 3 days, 72.0% had fast breathing, and 80.0% had chest indrawing. Alveolar consolidation occurred in 23.9%, and 4.4% were hypoxemic (saturation < 90% on room air). Nineteen percent required hospitalization; 79.1% of them were discharged within 48 h. A respiratory virus was identified in 81.8%, majority (75.8%) with single virus isolation. Rhinoenterovirus was most commonly identified (HRV/HEV, 37.9%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 20.2%) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 11.7%). Rhinoenterovirus was detected year-round; RSV was detected during August-November and hMPV during December-March. Respiratory viruses were identified in a majority (82%) of children under 2 years of age presenting with ALRI in rural hospitals of Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "Historically, pandemics constitute a major nuisance to public health. They have a debilitating impact on global health with previous occurrences causing major mortalities worldwide. The adverse outcomes are not limited to health outcomes but ravage the social, economic, and political landscapes. The World Health Organization (WHO) stands at the front of the pandemic response, strategizing to contain and mitigate the impacts on humans and the environment. It also intervenes in regional disease outbreaks that pose a threat to global health through strategic technical guidance, resource allocations, and expert support. With emerging pathogens, and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions are currently underway on global preparedness for a potential future pandemic. The effects of previous pandemics underscore the need to improve global health preparedness for upcoming pandemics. The WHO's July 2024 updated list of emerging pathogens serves as a potential tool to foster global health readiness for a future pandemic. It represents a change in the world's approach to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, shifting focus from specific pathogens to adopting a broader family-focused approach. This new list recognizes the shortcomings of previous lists and adopts a more forward-thinking, proactive, and flexible approach to dealing with familiar and unfamiliar pandemic risks, now incorporating 'Prototype Pathogens' and 'Pathogen X' into its risk classification. The WHO has set the pace, developing tools and guidelines for practice. This updated list of high-priority pathogens seeks to gear research and development toward combating and neutralizing the virulence of these pathogens. Recent outbreaks of Cholera, Mpox, and Dengue fever in Africa, Avian influenza (H5N2) in Mexico, Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh, and Oropouche virus in the Americas necessitate intensifying regional disease surveillance Research organizations and institutions must prioritize incorporating these tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies in the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative as outlined by WHO.",

        "abstract": "Clade 2.3.2.1 of the H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV) evolved into several subclades. However, the effect of glycosylation on the biological characteristics of hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) from H5N1 AIVs remains unclear. Here, we determined that the global prevalence of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 AIVs with deglycosylated residue 158 on HA (HA158-) and glycosylated residue 88 on NA (NA88+) were predominant via multiple sequence analysis. The deglycosylation of residue on NA 88 (NA88-) was observed in clade 2.3.2.1a (new) and clade 2.3.2.1e H5N1 AIVs. Interestingly, NA88- was coupled with the acquisition of 158 glycosylation sites on HA (HA158+) in clade 2.3.2.1e H5N1 AIVs from China, and clade 2.3.2.1a (new) H5N1 AIVs exhibiting the HA158-NA88- pattern were predominant in Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the temporal distribution of strain HA158+ NA88- was highly consistent with the implementation of Re-6 vaccine in China. The recombinant H5N1 AIVs constructed using a reverse genetic system showed that the acquisition of the HA158 glycosylation site facilitated viral evasion from Re-6 antisera, and the virus lacking glycosylation sites at HA158 and NA88 resulted in reduced NA activity, replication in mammalian cells, and pathogenicity in both chickens and mice compared to that of the viruses with alternative glycosylation patterns. Therefore, the acquisition of HA158+ in clade 2.3.2.1e H5N1 AIVs enables evasion of Re-6 vaccination pressure, and the virulence of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 AIVs is modulated by the absence of glycosylation sites at HA158 and NA88. Our finding highlighted the importance of epidemiological surveillance and timely updating vaccines of H5 AIVs.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition contributes to 45% of all childhood deaths globally, but these modelled estimates lack direct measurements in countries with high malnutrition and under-5 mortality rates. We investigated malnutrition's role in infant and child deaths in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network. We analysed CHAMPS data from seven sites (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and South Africa) collected between 2016 and 2023. An expert panel assessed each death to determine whether malnutrition was an underlying, antecedent or immediate cause or other significant condition. Malnutrition was further classified based on postmortem anthropometry using WHO growth standards for underweight (z-scores for weight-for-age <-2), stunting (length-for-age <-2), and wasting (weight-for-length or MUAC Z-scores <-2). Of 1601 infant and child deaths, malnutrition was considered a causal or significant condition in 632 (39.5%) cases, including 85 (13.4%) with HIV infection. Postmortem measurements indicated 90.1%, 61.2% and 94.1% of these cases were underweight, stunted and wasted, respectively. Most malnutrition-related deaths (n=632) had an infectious cause (89.1%). The adjusted odds of having malnutrition as causal or significant condition were 2.4 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.2) times higher for deaths involving infectious diseases compared with other causes. Common pathogens in the causal pathway for malnutrition-related deaths included <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (30.4%), <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (21.5%), <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (18.7%) and <i>Escherichia coli/Shigella</i> (17.2%). Malnutrition was identified as a causal or significant factor in 39.5% of under-5 deaths in the CHAMPS network, often in combination with infectious diseases. These findings highlight the need for integrated interventions addressing both malnutrition and infectious diseases to effectively reduce under-5 mortality.",

This study aimed to estimate ehrlichiosis prevalence and identify associated risk factors in pet dogs. A total of 246 peripheral blood samples were purposively collected from pet dogs in Dhaka, Mymensingh, and Rajshahi districts between December 2018 and December 2020. Risk factor data were obtained through face-to-face interviews with dog owners using a pre-structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified risk factors. Polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Ehrlichia spp. PCR results were further validated by sequencing. The prevalence and case fatality of ehrlichiosis were 6.9% and 47.1%, respectively. Dogs in rural areas had 5.8 times higher odds of ehrlichiosis (odd ratio, OR: 5.84; 95% CI: 1.72-19.89) compared to urban areas. Dogs with access to other dogs had 5.14 times higher odds of ehrlichiosis (OR: 5.14; 95% CI: 1.63-16.27) than those without such access. Similarly, irregularly treated dogs with ectoparasitic drugs had 4.01 times higher odds of ehrlichiosis (OR: 4.01; 95% CI: 1.17-14.14) compared to regularly treated dogs. The presence of ticks on dogs increased ehrlichiosis odds nearly by 3 times (OR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.02-8.97). Phylogenetic analysis, based on 17 commercially sequenced isolates, showed different clusters of aggregation, however, BAUMAH-13 (PP321265) perfectly settled with a China isolate (OK667945), similarly, BAUMAH-05 (PP321257) with Greece isolate (MN922610), BAUMAH-16 (PP321268) with Italian isolate (KX180945), and BAUMAH-07 (PP321259) with Thailand isolate (OP164610). Pet owners and veterinarians in rural areas should be vigilant in monitoring dogs for ticks and ensuring proper preventive care. Limiting access to other dogs in high-risk areas can help mitigate disease spread. Tick prevention measures and regular treatment with ectoparasitic drugs will reduce the risk of ehrlichiosis in dogs. The observed genetic similarity of the Bangladeshi Ehrlichia canis strain highlights the need for ongoing surveillance and research to develop effective control and prevention strategies, both within Bangladesh and globally.",

        "title": "The Current Pathogenicity and Potential Risk Assessment of Nipah Virus as Potential Cause of \"Disease X\": A Narrative Review.",
        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the potential for a severe international epidemic and introduced the term \"Disease X\" to classify pathogens that not yet identified. The Nipah virus (NiV) is highly dangerous due to its zoonotic nature, high mortality rate, and ability to cause severe clinical symptoms in humans. In this review, we gather the latest information on the NiV and its potential to become a significant candidate for Disease X. We performed a thorough review of articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using appropriate MeSH terms and keywords. Studies reported NiV infection were considered for this review. The NiV exhibits different epidemiological patterns in different countries that calls for customized prevention and control strategies. Genetic analysis highlights NiV's ability to mutate that alters possible treatment options. Transmission typically involves bats as the primary reservoir, with humans becoming infected either through intermediate hosts or food. This shows NiV's complex nature, including its ability to reach the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve. Promising treatment options, such as monoclonal antibodies, antivirals, and ongoing vaccine research, provide hope. However, the virus's adaptability, human-to-human transmission, and the lack of specific antiviral therapy raise concerns about its potential to cause a global pandemic. The interconnection between animals, humans, and the environment stresses the need for a One Health approach to tackle emerging infectious disease by NiV. Global collaboration, surveillance, and research investments are imperative for the preparation of future pandemics. The ongoing COVID-19 challenges underscoring the critical need for sustained scientific endeavors, global leadership, and recognition of the prominence of NiV as a candidate for the potential Disease X.",

        "title": "Fair and explainable Myocardial Infarction (MI) prediction: Novel strategies for feature selection and class imbalance correction.",
        "abstract": "The rising incidences of myocardial infarction (MI), often affecting individuals without traditional risk factors, highlight the urgent need for improved early detection using personal health data. However, health surveys and electronic health records (EHRs) frequently suffer from class imbalances, leading to prediction biases and differences between specificity and sensitivity, which hinder reliable model development despite the valuable insights contained in these datasets. To address this, we have introduced a novel approach to enhance MI risk prediction using self-reported attributes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset. Our approach incorporates three innovative techniques: the Dual-Path Artificial Neural Network (DP-ANN) to mitigate biased decision making across imbalanced datasets, the Triple Criteria Selection (TCS) for unbiased feature selection, and Minority Weighted Sampling (MWS) to tackle challenges of uncontrolled minority class sampling. These methods collectively enhance MI prediction and feature relevance. The DP-ANN model has achieved balanced performance, with an average specificity of 80%, sensitivity of 82%, and AUC-ROC of 89.5%, improving imbalance variance by approximately 14.96% compared to prior studies. By outperforming other models across four heavily imbalanced datasets, our approach demonstrates robustness and generalizability. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis has revealed key predictors and risk factors for MI, such as coronary heart disease and bronchitis in females, and stroke among individuals aged 35-54. In conclusion, our study provides a robust model for healthcare professionals to assess MI risk through targeted factors, promoting early detection and potentially improving patient outcomes.",
