        "abstract": "The use of nanocarriers in combination with other treatments shows significant promise in addressing drug-resistant diseases, particularly malaria. Given the high prevalence of drug-resistant malaria, research into innovative therapies is crucial. This study focuses on a nanoform of chitosan, a biodegradable polymer, combined with <i>Crocus sativus</i> (saffron) and chloroquine to enhance their antimalarial effects. Saffron extract and chloroquine were separately conjugated with chitosan, followed by confirmation tests to determine conjugation efficiency. Both chloroquine-resistant and sensitive strains of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> were cultured to calculate the IC50 values of various treatments in vitro. This study was conducted at the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran in 2024. Confirmation tests (FTIR, DLS, Zeta potential, TEM) verified proper drug conjugation to nanocomposites, with observed nanosize, the percentage of conjugation was 64.4% for chloroquine and 42.9% for saffron. Toxicity and hemolysis tests confirmed safe doses. The IC50s values for Chloroquine, Nanoparticle-Chloroquine, Saffron, and Nanoparticle-Saffron were 0.3, 0.8, 42.5, and 6.24 μg/ml, respectively, for the sensitive strain, and 5, 1, 12.5, and 3.12 μg/ml, respectively, for the resistant strain. Combination therapy with the fixed ratio method showed synergistic effects. Statistical analysis revealed synthesized nanocomposites' superior inhibition of <i>P. falciparum</i> growth compared to non-nano. Significant differences were observed in some cases (<i>P</i>< 0.05). Utilizing nanocarriers and combination therapy is an appropriate strategy for addressing drug resistance. Saffron's anti-malarial effects on <i>P. falciparum</i> were notably increased when linked to chitosan nanocomposites. Furthermore, employing a fixed ratio technique enhanced the therapeutic effectiveness of saffron when combined with chloroquine and chloroquine-nanocomposites across all concentrations.",

        "abstract": "Malaria continues to pose a significant public health challenge, particularly in certain regions of Indonesia, where it remains endemic. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is responsible for the most severe form of the disease, often leading to life-threatening complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI). Here, we report the case of a 22-year-old male from Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, with a seven-day history of intermittent fever following recent travel to malaria-endemic areas. On physical examination, he appeared somnolent and exhibited icteric sclera, hepatomegaly, and dark yellow urine. Laboratory findings were notable for impaired kidney function (serum creatinine 3.52 mg/dL (311 μmol/L)), elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and a <i>P. falciparum</i> parasitemia level of 9.7%. Imaging studies revealed pulmonary edema, enlarged kidneys, ascites, pleural effusion, and hepatomegaly. The patient was diagnosed with severe falciparum malaria, complicated by AKI, pulmonary edema, and jaundice. He was then treated with intravenous artesunate for six days, followed by a three-day course of oral dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and a single dose of primaquine. Additionally, he underwent two sessions of timely hemodialysis. His clinical condition and kidney function gradually improved thereafter, and he was discharged without sequelae. This case highlights that early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to full recovery from AKI caused by severe <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria.",

        "title": "Red pulp macrophages clear parasites, while marginal metallophilic and marginal zone macrophages support CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation during <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> infection.",
        "abstract": "Malaria, caused by the parasite <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., remains the most prevalent and dangerous vector-borne infectious disease worldwide. Effective pathogen clearance during malaria hinges on the interplay between adaptive and innate immune responses, especially on T cells, B cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and IFNγ response. In a previous study, we demonstrated that dendritic cell (DC) depletion resulted in impaired T cell responses. However, substantial CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation was still detectable, suggesting that other APCs compensate for the lack of DCs. In the present study, we report an increase in splenic marginal zone macrophages (MZMΦ), and marginal metallophilic macrophages (MMMΦ) with an altered cytokine profile in DC-deficient mice upon <i>P. yoelii</i> infection. Ablation of macrophages by clodronate liposome (CL) application resulted in partially reduced T cell activation, which correlated with elevated parasitemia. To further elucidate the specific role of splenic macrophage subsets we studied <i>P. yoelli</i> infections in two transgenic C57BL/6 mouse lines. Treatment of CD169DTR mice with diphtheriatoxin (DT) efficiently depleted MMMΦ and MZMΦ, resulting in reduced IFNγ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in <i>P. yoelii</i>-infected mice, though parasitemia progression was not modulated. In marked contrast, specific red pulp macrophages (RPMΦ) depletion in SpiC<sup>flox/flox</sup> x vav1cre mice resulted in elevated parasitemia. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that splenic macrophages located in or at the marginal zone contribute to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, and that RPMΦs are indispensable for clearing of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) during <i>P. yoelii</i> infection.",

        "abstract": "The escalating challenges posed by climate change have profound implications for public health, particularly concerning the interplay between pregnancy and vector-borne infections. This review explores the multifaceted interactions between climate change, vector ecology, and pregnancy, with a focus on pathogens such as malaria, Zika virus, and dengue fever. For pregnant women, these vector-borne infections carry significant risks, including miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies, necessitating urgent and effective public health responses. Highlighting the heightened vulnerability of pregnant women to these diseases, the review outlines the significant risks, including miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, and congenital anomalies. It advocates actionable public health responses, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced surveillance systems to monitor vector populations and disease incidence, particularly in climate-vulnerable regions. By integrating preventive measures and timely medical interventions into maternal healthcare systems, the study provides a pathway to mitigating adverse outcomes. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to bridge gaps between climate adaptation, vector control, and healthcare strategies. These insights not only enhance our understanding of a critical health challenge but also serve as a foundation for advancing medical research and healthcare practices, thereby promoting resilience in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Insecticide resistance in disease-transmitting arthropods of agricultural, veterinary, and public health significance poses a significant threat to vector control programs worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that blood-feeding arthropod vectors experience high mortality when ingesting blood containing inhibitors of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), the second enzyme in tyrosine metabolism. This study investigated the mosquitocidal efficacy of HPPD inhibitors from the β-triketone class of herbicides against both susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of three major disease vector species, including mosquitoes that transmit historical diseases such as malaria, reemerging infections such as dengue and Zika, and emerging viral threats such as Oropouche and Usutu viruses. Four HPPD inhibitors (nitisinone, mesotrione, sulcotrione, and tembotrione) were screened using glass plate tarsal bioassays at 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> against bloodfed Anopheles gambiae s.s. Kisumu. Nitisinone was selected for evaluation against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu, An. gambiae s.l. Tiassalé 13, An. coluzzii VK7 2014, Culex quinquefasciatus Muhezha, and Aedes aegypti New Orleans. Mosquitocidal activity was assessed using glass plate tarsal contact bioassays, topical application assays (0.0001% to 1% w/v), and modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassays (0-30 μg per bottle). Female mosquitoes aged 3-5 days were bloodfed within 1 h before exposure. Mortality was recorded at 30 min and 24, 48, and 72 h post-exposure under controlled conditions. A total of 3 biological replicates of 30 mosquitoes per treatment were used. Only nitisinone, and not mesotrione, sulcotrione, or tembotrione, exhibited significant mosquitocidal activity when bloodfed mosquitoes were exposed to treated surfaces. No significant differences in susceptibility to nitisinone were observed between insecticide-susceptible An. gambiae and strains harboring multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms. The compound demonstrated consistent efficacy across all three mosquito species tested, indicating broad-spectrum activity against major disease vectors. This study demonstrates that nitisinone exhibits a novel mode of action distinct from current Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) classifications by specifically targeting blood digestion processes. Its efficacy against resistant strains and potential for integration into existing vector control interventions, such as treated bednets and indoor residual spraying, highlight nitisinone as a promising candidate for expanding strategies against malaria, dengue, Zika, and other emerging viral diseases.",

        "abstract": "Information on morbidity and health-seeking behavior beyond early childhood is crucial for planning evidence-based interventions. Currently, data is limited to children under five. This study introduces a method for estimating morbidity and health-seeking behavior in older children and adolescents (5-19 years) using women's birth histories from a household survey in northwestern Tanzania, comparing it with data on children under five. We conducted a household survey among women 15-49 years as part of the Magu Health and Demographic Surveillance from October 2020 to November 2021, including 16,896 children aged 0-19 living with their mothers. The study outcomes were the prevalence of reported illness in the last four weeks and health-seeking behavior, defined as visiting a health facility for recent illness. Modified Poisson regression analysis was performed, accounting for mothers as clusters and adjusting for child and mother characteristics. We compared the prevalence of recent illness and health-seeking behavior among older children and adolescents (5-19 years) with children under five within the same population. Morbidity presented as the prevalence of any illness decreased with age, from 26.1% in children under-five to 10.4% among adolescents aged 15-19. Health seeking behavior also decreased with age, from 48.2% in children under-five to nearly 30% among adolescents aged 15-19. Types of illnesses reported were similar across age groups, with Fever/Malaria accounting more than two-thirds, followed by respiratory tract illnesses. Higher illness prevalence was noted in rural areas for both age groups. Health seeking behavior was higher among mothers with secondary education and above for both children under-fives (APR:1.22;95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and 5-19-year-olds (APR: 1.31; 95% CI:1.01, 1.70). Additionally, those with health insurance also reported higher health seeking behavior (APR: 1.38; 95% CI:1.07, 1.78), while lower for children in rural households (APR: 0.72; 95% CI:0.61, 0.83), for 5-19-year-olds. Our findings on morbidity and health-seeking behavior demonstrate the importance of extending health monitoring beyond early childhood.

Antimalarial drug resistance poses a significant threat to the effectiveness of artemisinin-based combination therapies and preventive strategies such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine chemoprevention in pregnant women. In this genomic surveillance study, dried blood spots and epidemiological data were collected from confirmed Plasmodium falciparum cases at 61 health facilities across all 10 Zambian provinces from March to July 2023. A total of 2,486 samples were genotyped by using multiplexed amplicon sequencing to identify mutations in 12 genes associated with resistance to seven antimalarial drugs. Several mutations potentially associated with artemisinin partial resistance were identified, including the validated kelch 13 (k13) P574L marker (0.66% adjusted national prevalence) and the candidate k13 P441L marker (1.39%). The distribution of mutations was heterogeneous, with many health facilities reporting resistance markers in more than 5% of infections, and in some instances, up to 46% of infections. The multidrug resistance protein 1 N86 genotype, which is associated with decreased lumefantrine susceptibility, was found in all samples. Very high levels of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance markers were observed, including dihydropteroate synthetase K540E (93.26%). The variable prevalence of resistance markers underscores the need for routine molecular surveillance to detect emergent resistance and guide malaria control strategies. These results also call for studies designed to help us understand the clinical implications of these mutations and ensure the continued efficacy of antimalarial interventions in Zambia.",

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major concern in drug safety, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) provides valuable ADR data. However, analyzing FAERS data is complex and requires bioinformatics expertise. Despite the vast amount of ADR data available, there is a lack of user-friendly tools that enable efficient visualization and comparison of ADRs for researchers and health care professionals. This study aimed to develop VisDrugs, a web-based platform that simplifies ADR visualization and comparison using FAERS data. The platform was designed to assist researchers and clinicians in assessing drug safety through interactive and interpretable graphical representations of ADR patterns. FAERS data were extracted in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format, covering the period from Q3 (third quarter) 2014 to Q3 2024. About 2,700,000 reports from health care professionals, where only a single drug was implicated, were aggregated and processed using R for statistical analysis and visualization. The results are presented on a web-based platform for web-based analysis. The platform generates pie charts to visualize the most frequently reported ADRs, which are represented and analyzed using preferred terms based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and forest plots illustrating reporting odds ratios (RORs) for these ADRs. Using Paxlovid (COVID-19 treatment) and hydroxychloroquine (anti-malaria drug) as case studies, we benchmarked VisDrugs using reports for Paxlovid (n=16,708) and hydroxychloroquine (n=6150). Paxlovid was most frequently associated with \"COVID-19\" (ROR=47.26, 95% CI 45.22-49.40) and \"dysgeusia\" (ROR=59.65, 95% CI 55.56-64.03). Hydroxychloroquine showed strong associations with \"retinal toxicity\" (ROR=738.48, 95% CI 583.45-934.71), \"retinopathy\" (ROR=412.27, 95% CI 344.73-493.03), and \"cardiotoxicity\" (ROR=48.36, 95% CI 38.86-60.19). In subgroup analyses, female patients had significantly higher risks of retinopathy (3.24-fold) and cardiomyopathy (13.82-fold) compared to male patients, while patients aged >50 years had higher risks of retinopathy (4.20-fold) and cardiomyopathy (7.84-fold) compared to those ≤50 years. All differences were statistically significant (z test, P<.01). The majority of findings align with existing research, thereby validating the platform's utility. Clinical personnel have evaluated and refined the platform based on user feedback, confirming its efficacy in visualizing complex ADR data and identifying adverse effects across various drug subgroups. VisDrugs is a valuable tool for ADR analysis, offering an intuitive interface for exploring FAERS data. By visualizing and comparing ADRs, it helps researchers and health care providers assess drug safety efficiently. The platform's demographic analysis features add insights into ADR variations by age and gender, supporting drug safety research. In the future, the website will include more subgroup or condition filtering options, offering personalized ADR analysis and comparison features to meet the diverse research needs of users.",

        "abstract": "Malaria elimination is a critical public health goal, particularly in Africa, where the disease disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Egypt's success in achieving World Health Organization (WHO) malaria-free certification on October 20, 2024, through an evidence-based malaria elimination program, offers a valuable model for replication. Our study is identified as an implementation study, evaluating the evidence-based interventions deployed, the implementation strategy tested, and its outcomes to provide insights for scaling similar programs across Africa. A RE-AIM-informed lens was applied to better articulate how contextual factors, intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance influenced observed outcomes. We adopted a retrospective implementation science approach to analyze Egypt's malaria elimination program. The implementation strategy focused on high-priority malaria-endemic regions, targeting vulnerable groups such as children under five and pregnant women. Interventions included vector control measures, such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), antimalarial treatment protocols, and public health education campaigns. Key implementation strategies included workforce training, multilevel stakeholder engagement, integrated data-driven decision-making, and community mobilization. Our study evaluated key implementation outcomes, including fidelity, feasibility, acceptability (measured using a custom-designed tool assessing stakeholder and community perceptions of the interventions), and adaptability alongside health outcomes such as incidence reduction, treatment coverage, and community awareness. Economic evaluations and process analyses provided additional insights into cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. The implementation strategy targeted malaria-endemic regions, achieving a 92% recruitment rate, focusing on vulnerable groups such as children under five (37%) and pregnant women (12%). 78% of the recipient population adhered to preventive measures like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). The program reduced malaria incidence by 96% over 15 years and achieved a 94% reduction in Anopheles mosquito density. Active surveillance led to the detection of 98% of cases within 48 hours of symptom onset, while treatment coverage reached 91%. Community awareness of malaria prevention increased to 84% by the program's conclusion. Economic evaluations revealed a cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted of $24, with an estimated $1.5 billion saved in healthcare costs and productivity losses over 15 years. Sub-group analyses highlighted higher adherence rates in urban areas (89%) compared to rural areas (73%) and significant reductions in malaria-related complications among pregnant women (78%). Implementation outcomes included high fidelity (93%) to planned strategies, high feasibility across urban and rural contexts, and successful adaptability to emerging challenges such as insecticide resistance and funding fluctuations. Routine monitoring systems, continuous feedback loops, and responsive adaptation mechanisms were central to achieving these outcomes. Acceptability scores averaged 87% across stakeholders, reflecting strong alignment with community values, trust in health authorities, and perceived relevance of interventions. Egypt's malaria elimination strategies exemplify the effective integration of implementation science into public health programs. Key success factors included community engagement, robust surveillance systems, and cost-effective resource allocation. The intentional use of implementation strategies and documented outcomes demonstrate alignment with the RE-AIM framework, reinforcing the program's relevance for broader application. Future efforts should emphasize tailored interventions, capacity building, transparent assessment of acceptability, and sustainable funding mechanisms to replicate Egypt's success.",

        "abstract": "Molecular hybridization and metal incorporation are widely employed strategies for drug development aimed at enhancing pharmacological efficacy while mitigating the emergence of drug resistance. The effectiveness of these approaches is supported by numerous studies demonstrating their success against a range of diseases. Despite the deployment of malaria vaccines, effective treatment remains hindered by the persistent emergence of drug-resistant <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> strains, contributing to an alarming global disease burden. Inspired by the antimalarial candidate ferroquine, this study focused on the design and synthesis of ferrocenyl-based quinoline-benzimidazole molecular hybrids. The hybrids were evaluated for their in vitro blood-stage antiplasmodial activity against drug-sensitive NF54 and multidrug-resistant K1 <i>P. falciparum</i> strains, exhibiting potent submicromolar activity. Notably, incorporating an <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethylaminomethyl side chain significantly enhanced activity against both strains. Further assays revealed a compound with multistage antiplasmodial activity, targeting both immature and mature gametocytes. Mechanistic studies implicated the inhibition of hemozoin formation as a key mode of action, supported by in vitro cellular heme fractionation analysis. Additionally, fluorescence assays indicated the generation of reactive oxygen species under oxidative conditions, suggesting a complementary pathway contributing to the compounds' antiplasmodial activity.

In the pharmacodynamic high parasitemia <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> ANKA-luciferase mouse blood-stage model, we investigated curative interaction analysis of multiple, daily dosed, short half-life, artesunate or single-dose, long half-life, pyronaridine against three single-dose, long half-life, quinolines-chloroquine, amodiaquine, and tafenoquine. Positive or negative parasiticidal activity measured by parasite reduction rate in the days post-treatment correlated nonspecifically to final curative interactions. Tafenoquine/artesunate and pyronaridine/amodiaquine also had fractional combination curative doses of 0.83 and 0.93, with the rest of the interactions closer to neutral at 0.9-1.1. All tested combinations are in the additive drug interaction range. Time to return of initial parasitemia in subcurative regimens was also imprecise for the prediction of cure with combinations. Short blood half-life azithromycin, requiring multiple daily doses, was additive to artesunate or pyronaridine in fractional curative dose combination killing. Murine malaria high parasitemia drug interactions at the curative metric <i>in vivo</i> are a potential benchmark for human studies.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis remains a prevalent parasitic disease in tropical and subtropical regions, ranking second to malaria in terms of parasitic burden. The disease manifests in two primary forms: urinary schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma haematobium, and intestinal schistosomiasis, associated with <i>S. mansoni</i> and <i>S. japonicum</i>. This case report describes a 12-year-old female from New Halfa, Sudan, who presented with a progressively enlarging lower abdominal mass. She had a prior history of <i>S. mansoni</i> infection, diagnosed and treated a year earlier. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm, mobile, non-tender suprapubic mass, while imaging studies identified a large abdominopelvic mass with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Surgical exploration confirmed a sigmoid colon tumor, necessitating resection and anastomosis. Histopathological analysis revealed viable Schistosoma ova with granulomatous inflammation, confirming colonic schistosomiasis. The patient recovered well postoperatively and received praziquantel therapy. This case underscores the importance of early schistosomiasis treatment to prevent severe complications, including granuloma formation and intestinal obstruction. It also highlights the diagnostic challenges of intestinal schistosomiasis, which can mimic neoplastic conditions. Enhanced screening, timely praziquantel administration, and improved public health interventions are crucial in endemic areas to mitigate disease progression and long-term morbidity.",

Patients were identified through positive <i>M pneumoniae</i> polymerase chain reaction and <i>ICD-10</i> code J15.7 (<i>M pneumoniae</i> pneumonia). Medical records were reviewed manually, and population data were extracted from statistical databases. Incidence rates were calculated, and treatment outcomes were analyzed using regression models. A total of 747 adults with a median age of 42 (interquartile range [IQR], 33-55) years, of whom 55% (385/747) were male, were hospitalized with <i>M pneumoniae</i> pneumonia.

        "abstract": "The recent emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites harbouring kelch 13 mutations associated with artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) in sub-Saharan Africa is a major concern. Regular molecular epidemiological surveys are recommended to monitor the level of mutant parasites associated with drug resistance. To analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P. falciparum genes associated with resistance to antimalarial drugs in blood samples collected from malaria patients prior to treatment in Busia County, Western Kenya, using a highly multiplexed deep amplicon sequencing protocol. Parasite DNA was extracted from dried blood spots (DBS) collected from patients attending health facilities along the Kenya-Uganda border, in Busia County. A highly multiplexed deep amplicon sequencing protocol was applied to analyze SNPs in genes associated with antimalarial drugs resistance. Out of 118 analysed samples, Pfkelch13 mutations were identified in 6 (5.1%) samples. All the six samples harboured A578S, one of the most frequently detected Pfkelch13 mutations in Africa, which does not confer ART-R. The data also indicated that 11% (13) of the samples had mutant Pfcrt alleles, with 62% harbouring the triple mutant haplotype, CVIET. In contrast, 98% of the samples had dhfr mutations at positions N51I, C59R, or S108N alleles. All the samples carried mutations in the dhps gene with a high prevalence of the single A437G mutation (84%) and a lower frequency of double or triple mutations. Further analysis revealed absence of deletions in the Pfhrp2, with no mutations at Pfmdr1 codons 86 or 1246, both of which are associated with chloroquine resistance. These findings show absence of validated Pfkelch13 markers associated with ART-R in Busia County, Western Kenya. Although chloroquine-sensitive (wild-type) parasites are widely circulating, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-sensitive parasites remain rare. Continued large scale genomic surveillance studies are essential to detect emerging resistance and guide malaria treatment strategies in the region.",

        "abstract": "Vaccines that target the pre-erythrocytic stage of the malaria lifecycle have the potential to provide sterilizing immunity but must elicit sustained, high-titer antibody responses to completely prevent infection. Most pre-erythrocytic vaccines target circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major surface antigen on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. Antibodies targeting distinct epitopes within the central repeat region of CSP have the potential to provide protection from infection, but we have focused on developing vaccines that target a highly vulnerable CSP epitope that is targeted by the potent monoclonal antibody L9. In a previous study, we produced a pre-erythrocytic vaccine displaying a synthetic peptide representing the L9 epitope on Qβ bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs). This vaccine elicited strong anti-CSP antibody responses that protected mice from malaria challenge. Here, we asked whether the structural context of the L9 epitope influences the quality of antibody responses. We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Qβ L9 VLPs to recombinant VLPs that display the L9 peptide in a structure that is hypothesized to mimic its native conformation. Recombinant MS2 bacteriophage VLPs displaying various lengths of the L9 epitope were produced and immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in mice. Our results demonstrate that MS2 L9 VLPs, particularly those displaying longer L9 peptides and in combination with a potent novel adjuvant, elicit strong and durable antibody responses that lower malaria liver burden and prevent infection. We also compared the efficacy of L9-targeted vaccines to the licensed vaccine, RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> (Mosquirix™, GSK). Immunization with Qβ L9 VLPs, MS2 L9 VLPs, and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> provided significant protection from liver-stage infection in a mouse model. Interestingly, immunization with a combination vaccine consisting of MS2 L9 and Qβ L9 VLPs, each presenting the L9 epitope in a distinct structural context, elicited sterilizing immunity in the highest percentage of mice.",

In Ethiopia, despite prevention efforts, malaria continues to be a significant issue, particularly in the post-war Tigray region. Insecticide-treated net (ITN) is a key preventive tool, but data on its distribution and usage in this region are limited. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2024 across 24 randomly selected districts, involving 2,338 households. Data were collected using Open Data Kit and analyzed with SPSS version 21, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. The findings revealed that 58.1% (95% CI 56.1-59.9) of households owned at least one ITN, and 61.6% (95% CI 59.1-64.2) reported using it the previous night. Multivariable logistic regression identified that being single was associated with lower ITN use (AOR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.7), while households with 3-4 members (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.6) and those with sufficient ITNs (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8) had higher usage rates. These findings highlight the need for tailored malaria prevention strategies, including sustained ITN distribution, ongoing health education, and targeted interventions to improve ITN utilization, to contribute to malaria elimination and achieve universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "Liver disease is one of leading causes of death worldwide. However, current liver models have limited research progress. Therefore, models that accurately reflect the physiological functions of the human liver are urgently needed in both clinical and laboratory research. Over the past decade, liver organoids have emerged as valuable research tools offering significant breakthroughs and demonstrating great promise as advanced liver models. Liver organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, have shown significant potential for modeling liver diseases and drug responses. These miniature three-dimensional (3D) structures replicate the complexity of the liver and offer a platform for studying liver development and disease progression. The ability to create personalized organoids from patient-derived cells paves the way for precision medicine and drug screening. Owing to the pluripotency of PSCs, PSC-derived liver organoids (PSC-LOs) closely mimic the true structure of the liver and offer a wide range of applications. With advances in research, bioengineered liver organoids have the potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and the understanding of liver pathophysiology. This review provides an overview of liver organoid development and discusses their applications in liver regeneration, disease modeling, drug screening, toxicity assessment, organ transplantation, and regenerative medicine. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future development directions of PSC-LOs.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a parasitic infectious disease that is endemic in many tropical countries. Even though several effective antimalarial agents have been implemented, treatment failure still occurs, and malaria continues to cause neurological complications and death, particularly in severe or drug-resistant cases. Hence, novel therapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms of action, as well as alternative chemical compounds that can overcome resistance, are still needed to improve malaria therapy. This study aimed to investigate the antimalarial activities of <i>Brucea javanica</i>, a tropical plant extracts against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the major species associated with severe malaria. In this study, malaria parasites were treated with plant extracts using single and co-incubation methods, along with artesunate and chloroquine, and their inhibitory effect on parasite development was determined by microscopy. The results show that all tested doses of the extracts that effectively inhibited malaria parasites did not cause hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs). The root extract (RE) and fruit extract (FE) inhibited parasite growth at IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.41 ± 1.14 µg/mL and 0.26 ± 1.15 µg/mL, respectively. These plant extracts significantly interrupted malaria development at the ring stage, as presented by a reduction in the conversion rate to trophozoites and schizonts. The defective parasites treated with plant extracts were characterized by nuclear clumping, leading to pyknotic cell death. Moreover, RE and FW extracts elicited an additive effect with artesunate and chloroquine, significantly reducing IC<sub>90</sub> levels for the inhibition of parasite development. In conclusion, <i>B. javanica</i> extracts inhibited the asexual blood-stage development of malaria parasites. They distinctively show the additive effects of ATS and CRQ, elucidating their potential for further studies on novel formulas of antimalarial drug regimens.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant public health concern in Pakistan due to its subtropical climate and diverse array of vectors, which contribute to periodic outbreaks and challenges in disease control. Recent outbreaks-particularly in 2022-along with the rising incidence of Plasmodium falciparum and growing resistance of Anopheles mosquito vector to existing control methods, highlight a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of current malaria vector control strategies. This article is a scoping review of published literature on malaria prevention methods with a focus on World Health Organization (WHO) outlined interventions in the endemic region of the lower middle-income country, Pakistan. Relevant articles published in all languages before September 2023 were reviewed. All the articles were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase and Google Scholar. Four independent reviewers performed the selection and characterization of articles based on defined inclusion criteria. The data collected were extracted and analyzed by province, vector, and vector control methods according to WHO recommendations. A total of 46 articles reporting surveillance findings on vector control methods in Pakistan were found. Based on WHO recommendations, the reported strategies included insecticide-treated nets (ITN) (29.79%), indoor residual spraying (IRS) (29.79%), spatial spraying (12.77%), spatial/airborne repellents (4.26%), larval source management (4.26%) and house modifications (4.26%). In contrast to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which employs ITN (55%) as the primary vector control method, Punjab was found to use IRS as the main method of vector control (50%). This review highlights the current strategies for controlling malaria vectors and the strategies used in the past for outbreaks in Pakistan. This review identifies a notable increase in the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) over time and highlights differences in the implementation of vector control strategies across provinces in Pakistan. Current practices and their contrast to WHO guidelines are illustrated. It helps us understand the need for improved research and development with precise reporting. These findings can serve as a reference for guiding policy decisions and improving malaria control efforts in endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Test-negative design (TND) studies are increasingly common in evaluating vaccine effectiveness (VE) for various infectious diseases. TND studies are susceptible to bias due to disease outcome misclassification caused by imperfect test sensitivity and specificity. Several bias correction methods have been proposed. However, sample size or power considerations for TND studies incorporating bias correction for such misclassification have not yet been investigated. We used Monte Carlo simulations to assess how bias correction affects the statistical power and sample size for VE estimation in TND studies. Simulations were conducted under varying levels of diagnostic test sensitivities (60%, 80%, and 95%). Bias correction was implemented using the multiple over-imputation method, which accounts for test misclassification through a parametric bootstrapping approach. Using a malaria vaccine as an example, we defined six vaccination status categories based on the time since receipt of the third or fourth vaccine dose. In the simulated target population, vaccination coverage was assumed to be low (< 10%) except for the group vaccinated more than 12 months after dose 4. We assumed relatively low VE (< 50%) against clinical malaria cases and a 30% malaria positivity rate among unvaccinated individuals presenting with malaria-related symptoms. Statistical power to detect VE was estimated for each vaccination status, both with and without bias correction. Estimated VEs based on observed data were consistently underestimated across all vaccination status groups due to diagnostic misclassification. In contrast, bias-corrected estimates were approximately unbiased but displayed wider confidence intervals, with their precision decreasing at lower test sensitivities. Statistical power to detect VE declined substantially when diagnostic test sensitivity was low. For instance, at 80% sensitivity, only three vaccination status groups reached 80% power with a sample size of 10,000, whereas the same power was achieved with just 6,000 individuals under a perfect test. Bias due to imperfect diagnostic testing can substantially reduce the power of TND studies. Power calculations should account for outcome misclassification and potential correction methods. Failure to do so may lead to underpowered studies and misleading VE estimates.",

        "title": "Novel insecticide resistance mutations associated with variable PBO synergy in Anopheles gambiae s.l. from the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
        "abstract": "Over-reliance on pyrethroid insecticides in insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has imposed significant selection pressure for the evolution of insecticide resistance among major malaria vector species. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the country with the second highest malaria burden globally, pyrethroid resistance is pervasive, but there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular mechanisms driving resistance. A clear understanding of the specificity of resistance mechanisms to individual insecticides and the likelihood of selecting for cross-resistance mechanisms is crucial for the development of new vector control tools. Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations from eight study sites across the DRC were phenotyped for resistance to alpha-cypermethrin, deltamethrin and permethrin, with and without pre-exposure to the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), followed by multiplex amplicon sequencing. Phenotypic pyrethroid resistance and loss of PBO synergy was confirmed in all sites across the DRC. In An. gambiae s.s. four non-synonymous SNPs which have been previously associated with insecticide resistance were detected: gste2-L119V, vgsc-L995F, vgsc-L995S and rdl-A296G, while three were novel: gste2-T154S, ace1-N246T and ace1-P265L. Nationwide geographical trends in insecticide resistance mutation distribution, prevalence and selection were evident. In the West, near fixation of vgsc-L995F and almost complete absence of vgsc-L995S was observed, alongside low-moderate frequencies of rdl-A296G and gste2-L119V. Further East, the converse was apparent. Gste2-L119V was significantly associated with resistance to deltamethrin following PBO-pre-exposure, warranting functional validation to determine its putative role in reduced PBO synergy. Furthermore, gste2-T154S was implicated in deltamethrin and permethrin resistance but susceptibility to alpha-cypermethrin after PBO pre-exposure. Study findings comprise the most comprehensive overview of the prevalence of genetic markers of Anopheles insecticide resistance across the DRC and provide an important baseline for improved malaria vector control and the design of proactive insecticide resistance management strategies. Given the significant scale up in PBO-ITNs, with more than 58% of all ITNs delivered to sub-Saharan Africa in 2023 containing PBO, there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular markers to monitor changes in PBO synergy, which may be predicative of loss of intervention operational efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Bisquinoline is a privileged pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry due to its diverse biological activities, particularly against infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, leishmania, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, schistosomiasis, and HIV. The success of piperaquine, a bisquinoline-derived antimalarial, has underscored its therapeutic potential, driving interest in its role as a small-molecule probe for targeting critical disease pathways. As drug resistance increases and the need for effective treatments rises, bisquinoline's broad pharmacological profile presents promising drug discovery opportunities. This review explores research on bisquinoline derivatives as anti-infective agents, focusing on synthetic approaches, detailed structure-activity relationships, and therapeutic applications. It includes detailed insights into piperaquine, the only approved bisquinoline drug, based on literature from 2000 to 2025 sourced from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science concerning 'bisquinoline scaffold' keywords. In the last two decades, significant progress has been made in developing bisquinoline derivatives with various pharmacological effects. These advancements have expanded our understanding of the scaffold's pharmacological diversity and its potential for creating more effective drugs with fewer side effects. This continued progression will aid the development of the next-generation of bisquinoline-based therapeutics.",

Malaria was once highly prevalent in China; however, China was certified malaria-free by WHO in 2021 following decades of integrated control efforts. As an effective intervention, health education plays a critical role during the progress towards elimination of malaria in China, which remarkably increases the public awareness and action capability of malaria prevention and control knowledge. In addition, health education is of great significance to reduce the risk of re-establishment of imported malaria following disease elimination in the country. This article reviews the application of community-based and school-based health education, health education activities targeting entry-exit personnel and healthcare workers, and diversified media propagation in the progress towards elimination of malaria in China, so as to provide insights into formulation of malaria control strategy during the post-elimination stage in the country.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, necessitating accurate and rapid diagnosis for effective treatment. Conventional diagnostic methods are often prone to human error and limited by data insufficiency, impacting their reliability. This paper introduces MalNet-DAF (Malaria Network with Dual-Attentive Fusion), a novel deep-learning model designed to improve the diagnosis and classification of malaria-infected cells. The proposed architecture integrates stacked Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies. To enhance interpretability and performance, MalNet-DAF incorporates dynamic attention mechanisms. The Spatial Attention Module (SAM) highlights critical disease-affected regions by refining CNN-extracted features, while the Temporal Attention Module (TAM), applied after Bi-LSTM processing, emphasizes informative time steps by suppressing irrelevant signals. The fused spatial and temporal feature vectors are processed through Dense Layers with ReLU activation and Dropout regularization. The model is trained and validated using a publicly available malaria dataset from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Experimental results show that MalNet-DAF achieves a classification accuracy of 99.24%, outperforming traditional baseline models. These findings demonstrate the potential of dynamic attention-driven deep learning (DL) in supporting real-time clinical decision-making and addressing challenges in healthcare diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of p-cymene (CM) alone and in combination with quinine (Qu) against <i>Plasmodium berghei</i>-infected mice. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A total of 108 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into nine groups included six infected groups, which received normal saline, Qu (10 mg/kg), CM 5 mg/kg, CM 10 mg/kg, CM (5 mg/kg) + Qu (10 mg/kg), and CM (10 mg/kg) + Qu (10 mg/kg) as well as three noninfected groups, which received normal saline, CM 5 mg/kg, and CM 10 mg/kg. Mice were intraperitoneally infected by 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> <i>P. berghei</i> malaria-infected erythrocytes. Infected mice were orally treated daily over a period of 4 days. Then parasite growth suppression (PGS), survival rate, the level of oxidant and antioxidant markers, and analysis of immune response-related genes were also evaluated. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The highest survival rate of 100% was observed in infected mice treated with a combination of CM and Qu, which also demonstrated a PGR value of 100% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The combination of CM and Qu resulted in the most significant reductions in tissue concentrations of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, while upregulating the expression of the superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and interleukin-(IL)10 (>fourfold change) genes resulted in a reduction in the expression level of the tumor necrosis factor (<1.3-fold-change) and IL-1β (<1.4-fold change) genes. The combination of CM and Qu also caused significant modulation of serum levels of liver and kidney markers in malaria-infected mice. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The results of this survey indicate that the combination therapy of CM with Qu demonstrates significant effectiveness in treating malaria-infected mice by regulating oxidative stress, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, and modulating inflammatory responses.

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and treatment-resistant subtype of breast cancer (BC) that is a leading global malignancy. A novel drug candidate, 3-(2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoethylidene)indolin-2-one (RAJI), was synthesized using piperidine, isatin, and 3,4-dimethoxy acetophenones. Although these components have established roles in various drug syntheses and malaria treatment, their anti-cancer potential remains underexplored. Hence, the RAJI was designed to bridge this gap. The cytotoxic effects of RAJI on TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) were evaluated using MTT assay, cell migration assay, apoptosis analysis (Annexin V), mitochondrial membrane potential tests, qRT-PCR, and tumor-induced mouse model evaluation. RAJI exhibited cytotoxicity against TNBC cells, with IC50 values of 20 and 25 µg/mL for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. It reduced cell migration and induced apoptosis, as evident from the cell populations in the early and late apoptotic stages. Mitochondrial membrane potential assays revealed mitochondrial depolarization and cellular stress. Gene expression analysis via RT-PCR revealed that RAJI significantly downregulated Akt, PTEN, mTOR (AKT/PI3K signaling), Cyclin D1, indicating the induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via modulation of apoptotic genes such as Bax and Bcl-2. In the in In-vivo analysis, RAJI significantly reduced tumor volume in BALB/c athymic nude mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 cells over four weeks, with no notable toxicity. RAJI demonstrated potent anticancer activity, induced apoptosis, and reduced TNBC tumor progression by altering the Akt/PI3K pathway, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for breast cancer treatment.",

        "title": "Balancing sensitivity and specificity: investigating the effect of age delay and critical illness events on the number of threshold alarms.",
        "abstract": "In critical care settings, continuous vital sign monitoring is crucial to ensure patient safety and timely intervention. While traditional patient monitor threshold alarm systems have been life-saving, they often generate numerous non-actionable alarms, which can overwhelm caregivers and lead to ineffective patient monitoring. We still have these numerous false alarms because we have a gap in understanding the importance of age-specific threshold settings, delay, and critical illness events inclusion in understanding the specificity and sensitivity of the threshold alarms. This study investigated the effect of age-specific thresholds, delay, and critical illness events on the number of threshold alarms to balance their specificity and sensitivity. Secondary data from 772 pediatric patients was extracted from the IMPALA Project conducted in the High Dependency Unit (HDU) at Queen Elizabeth and Zomba Central Hospitals in Malawi. Threshold crossing detector algorithms and age-defining functions were used to generate alarms and impute age-specific thresholds. Z-test was used to determine differences between normal threshold alarms and age-specific threshold alarms. Threshold alarms were categorized into different delays based on their durations to identify an adaptive delay that would minimize the threshold alarms to manageable alarms. Time series analysis was leveraged to extract and compare threshold alarms around patients with and without critical illness events per hour. Additionally, we investigated the variability of threshold alarms during the hour time windows before and after each critical illness event, considering factors such as delay and age. A multi-regression model was used to determine the effects of critical illness events on the number of threshold alarms, with a significance level set at p < 0.05, indicating statistical significance. The age-specific threshold had a positive influence on the threshold alarms by reducing the total number of threshold alarms [31.14% for ECGHR, 17.54% ECGRR and 54.79% for SPO2]. There was a greater significant difference between normal and age-specific threshold alarms (p < 0.00001). A 15-s delay reduced the total number of threshold alarms by 45%. We had more threshold alarms being generated 1 h before critical illness events occurrence, and applying delay and age-specific threshold had more impact on threshold alarms 3 h after the occurrence of critical illness events [Respiratory support (Total threshold alarms (232), 15 s delay (77), 15 s and age-specific threshold (17)] and most threshold alarms 1 h before critical illness events had longer durations. Critical illness [Convulsion (p < 0.0001), Malaria treatment (p < 0.0001), Death (p = 0.053), Respiratory support (p = 0.046), and Sepsis (p = 0.051)] had positive effects on the threshold alarm. There was a drop and increase in the vital sign values during the occurrence of these critical illness events [Bronchodilator support (β =  - 0.0030), Death (β =  - 0.0374), Malaria treatment (β =  - 0.0056), and Inotropic support (β =  - 0.0063)] indicating that more threshold alarms were produced during the occurrence of these critical illness events. Age-specific threshold, delay, and critical illness events can be used to strike a balance between the sensitivity and specificity of threshold alarms. In this way, we can reduce the number of non-actionable (false alarms) alarms and increase the number of actionable alarms around critical illness events. It is necessary to look into critical illness event alarm forecasting further.",

Elttondoub village faces various health problems related to endemic and chronic diseases, contaminated water sources, and poor healthcare accessibility. The present study aims to assess health issues and accessibility in Elttondoub village, reported by community leaders, and to draw effective strategies to improve healthcare accessibility and promote community involvement in healthcare. This community-based qualitative study involved 5 focus group discussions with community leaders and residents in Elttondoub villages, Sudan. The sample was purposive and volunteer-based, and consisted of teachers, medical workers, religious leaders, and the local people's committee. Data was collected through voice recordings and field notes, which were transcribed and analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti9. The interviews were based on the World Health Organization community health needs assessment and were translated into Arabic. A total of 23 community leaders were interviewed. There were several health problems in Elttondoub village, including malaria, chronic diseases, and water contamination. Healthcare accessibility was limited due to transportation, financial, and political issues. Also, there is a shortage of medical professionals. Residents showed good levels of health knowledge regarding their common endemic diseases. The main health challenges were the use of a first aid kit and when to seek medical advice. Medical professionals and religious leaders were the most trusted sources of health education, as the residents headed to them when they sought medical advice. Community solutions suggested included preventive measures, improving healthcare infrastructure, and organizing health education programs. The construction of roads and bridges over creeks and the completion of the landfill project were suggested as feasible ways to improve healthcare accessibility. The study emphasizes the need for health education programs by organizing health training sessions and workshops for the community. Community involvement and engaging with the government to address health issues and establish an appropriate environment for medical personnel to solve the shortage, and assist in educating residents about their health. Healthcare accessibility improvement by constructing roads and bridges will facilitate transportation.",

        "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma associated with poor prognoses. The standard of care for non-resectable tumors consists of surgical excision followed by radiation and chemotherapy. MPNSTs are most common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 but can also occur sporadically. Regardless of origin, MPNSTs most often rely on signaling pathways that increase basal oxidative stress. This provides the basis for developing therapeutics with mechanisms that can potentiate oxidative stress to selectively eradicate tumor cells at doses that are tolerable for normal cells. Artemisinin derivatives are a mainstay of malaria therapy worldwide, with a well-established safety profile. Artemisinin's antimalarial effects are due to an endoperoxide bridge in its chemical structure that induces oxidative stress. We found that artesunate (ARS) and metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) are selectively cytotoxic to MPNST cells relative to normal Schwann cells with the endoperoxide bridge required for activity. Mechanistically, DHA induced oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and DHA-mediated cytotoxicity could be prevented with co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. Furthermore, we found that DHA was able to selectively remove MPNST from co-culture with normal Schwann cells. These data supports the further development of artemisinins for the clinical management of MPNST.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have significantly reduced the malaria burden in recent decades, and this malaria prevalence reduction has been achieved through the upgrading of pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets. However, this reduction has stalled due to many factors, including rapidly developing pyrethroid resistance. <b>Method:</b> The protocol was registered in PROSPERO, and we used Cochrane methodology to assess bias and evidence quality. Three reviewers extracted data from individual studies, and a meta-analysis was performed using Excel and STATA version 17, expressing the data as a risk ratio. <b>Result</b>: A study involving 21,916 households from 11 randomized controlled trials showed that the chlorfenapyr treatment group had a 10% reduction in malaria infection risk, with a pooled overall prevalence of 25.96 per 100 children in the chlorfenapyr group and 32.38 per 100 children in the piperonyl butoxide group, compared to 41.60 per 100 children in the control (pyrethroid-only) group. This meta-analysis determined that the entomological outcomes of effectiveness and efficacy showed that these treatments effectively reduced vector density per household per night and mean inoculation rates, with a 23% reduction in chlorfenapyr, a 7% reduction in pyrethroid-only treatments, and a 12% reduction in piperonyl-butoxide-treated groups. This study shows that chlorfenapyr (CFP) and pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs are highly effective and more efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, and anemia among children, as well as in reducing mean indoor vector density, mean entomological inoculation rate, and sporozoite rate, compared to pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs in Africa. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study found that chlorfenapyr (CFP) LLINs are highly effective and more efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, and anemia among children in Africa. Therefore, policymakers and health planners should place strong emphasis on addressing the effectiveness, efficacy, and resistance management of LLINs as part of their current public health agenda to eliminate malaria.",

This paper looks at how the malaria parasite works inside the body, how it avoids the immune system, and how it becomes resistant to current drugs. Thanks to new advances in genetic and biochemical research, scientists are discovering new weak points in the parasite that could lead to better treatments. New vaccines, like RTS, S and R21, along with antibody-based therapies, offer renewed hope; however, extending the duration of the immunity they induce and ensuring effectiveness across diverse parasite strains remain significant challenges. Solving the malaria crisis will require more than science-it also necessitates equitable and timely access to treatments, robust health systems, and international collaboration.

Additionally, the study aims to explore the role of exosomes (40-130 nm bilipid-layered vesicles released by nearly all cell types) as key mediators of intercellular communication in the context of HIV infection. Recent research has uncovered that cells infected with HIV-1 release exosomes carrying a mix of viral and host components such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites. To decipher the plausible role of exosome-derived proteins in HIV disease progression, the exosomes isolated from HIV patient's serum were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis to identify exosome-derived human and viral protein sequences. The identified proteins were then investigated, annotated, and explored for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network between HIV and the human host's proteins. Earlier experimental efforts focused on identifying PPI networks in host cells or only within the virus. The analysis showed that out of twelve exosome-derived host proteins identified from HIV-1 patient's samples, only five of the proteins were associated with Toll-like receptors (TLR), inflammasome-activation, inhibition of apoptosis, innate immune response modulation, and autophagy pathways. In the TLR pathway, CDH5, ENO1, OGT, TJP1, and TRAF6 exosome-derived host proteins participated in regulation. Notably, CDH5, ENO1, OGT, and TRAF6 were shared among these pathways, BioGRID version 4.4 showed that HIV-1 Gag, Gag-pol, Env, and Nef proteins interact with 196, 162, 158, and 80 human proteins, respectively, associated with different innate immune response pathways. These findings are a step ahead in comprehending the pathophysiology of HIV1 and the innate immune response pathways, providing excellent opportunities to explore further exosome-based biomarkers for theranostic approaches.",

        "title": "Emergence of urban malaria and the associated risk factors: a case-control study in Mutare city, Zimbabwe.",
        "abstract": "Mutare city of Zimbabwe was considered free of autochthonous malaria, until 2017, when the Ministry of Health and Child Care formally confirmed escalating cases of locally transmitted malaria in the city. The current study examined the risk factors for malaria cases in the city to aid in formulation of targeted intervention packages for helping restore malaria-free status. The study employed complementary cross-sectional and case-control designs to ascertain the magnitude and risk factors of urban malaria cases presenting at all eight primary health care facilities of Mutare city from 2022 to 2023. Malaria cases were enrolled as confirmed by RDT or microscopy on presenting all-age symptomatic suspected malaria patients. Controls were similarly enrolled as all-age symptomatic suspected malaria patients found negative by both RDT and microscopy. All cases and controls were enrolled as representative of the presenting population with no matching. Data were analysed for descriptive and prevalence statistics, as well as risk factors, using SPSS Faculty version 27. In a multivariate binary logistic model, significant risk factors for malaria cases found in the city included residential locale (RR [95%CI]: 3 [1.1-5.8], p = 0.029, N = 7,222), household proximity to still surface water pools or unprotected wells (16 [3.8-67.5], p < 0.001) and travel history in the past 2 weeks (9 [5.2-14.4], p < 0.001, N = 7,222), modal travel destinations being malaria-endemic adjoining districts within Zimbabwe, as well as areas of neighbouring Mozambique, mainly for trade or work. By far the most predominant risk factor for malaria cases was artisanal mining (RR [95%CI]: 22 [10.7-44.1], p < 0.001), which was 93% dominated by men, and male residents exhibited four-fold higher odds of being malaria cases than females (4 [2.0-6.5]). Significant risk factors for urban malaria were found that were consistent with both autochthonous transmission and imported malaria in Mutare city. Environmental management and the deployment and concomitant promotion of mass ITNs, personal protection and other intervention packages, especially targeting communities exposed to the identified risk factors, would be instrumental towards re-establishing urban malaria elimination from Mutare city.",

        "abstract": "Although considered safe and widely used, some natural remedies are responsible for health ailments to their users that deserve to be investigated. SAYE PLUS is one of the most widely used traditional recipes as antimalaria for decades and recently against Covid-19 in Burkina Faso and beyond, and is commonly regarded as safe to use. In the present study, sub-chronic toxicity tests were performed orally in Wistar rats at daily doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg for 90 days, following the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The results revealed neither symptoms of toxicity nor mortality. Depending on the dose, time frame, or animal sex, compared with the control, SAYE PLUS powder caused a statistically significant reduction in the water and food consumption of the treated rats. Significantly increases in serum creatinine, total protein, hydrogen phosphate ion (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>), and potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) levels were detected in females at all doses. Compared to control values, the male rats' glucose decreased while its PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> increased significantly at the daily dose of 1000 mg/kg of SAYE PLUS. Histopathological analysis revealed that the rat heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen histostructure were unaffected by sub-chronic exposure to SAYE PLUS up to 1000 mg/kg/d. The Findings provide some scientific information on the toxicological profile of the phytomedicine SAYE PLUS when administered in repeated doses for 90 days. However, they are limited by the absence of analysis of the animals' hematological parameters. Nevertheless, results show that for patient safety, it is not advisable to use SAYE PLUS for more than two consecutive weeks. Furthermore, herbal remedies need careful evaluation before or during their human use, especially when a new form of use other than the traditional one is proposed. Further long-term studies focusing on the hematological parameters and certain kidney and liver functional indicators will add the scientific merit and interest of the present work.",

        "title": "Subnational introduction of the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> malaria vaccine into routine immunization: experience and lessons from the three pilot countries.",
        "abstract": "In October 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> (RTS,S) malaria vaccine for the prevention of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children living in endemic areas informed by evidence from the subnational pilot introduction and evaluation in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi as part of the WHO-coordinated Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). With the global vaccine supply boosted by the pre-qualification of a second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M (R21), in October 2023, many endemic countries (20 as of April 2025) have introduced malaria vaccines into their national childhood immunization and malaria control programmes. More endemic countries are expected to introduce or scale up malaria vaccines in 2025 and beyond. This paper summarizes key operational lessons from the pilot countries to facilitate the introduction and scale-up of malaria vaccination in other countries. Pilot areas were identified, in part, based on local malaria epidemiology. RTS,S was initially introduced in randomly selected areas, while other areas served as comparators until the four-dose schedule vaccine was scaled up following the WHO recommendation in 2021. In Ghana and Kenya, the vaccine was administered at ages 6, 7, 9, and 24 months (Ghana switched to administer the fourth dose at age 18 months in 2023), and Malawi chose a schedule of 5, 6, 7, and 22 months. Vaccination coverage improved over time, reaching about 80% for the first dose and around 75% for the third dose by 2023 in the initial pilot areas. Implementation challenges included an inadequate understanding of age eligibility among healthcare workers during the early phase of introduction, low fourth dose coverage (with a median coverage of 46% in 2023 across the three countries), and disruptions to service delivery caused by disease outbreaks and other natural disasters. Health stakeholders and caregivers attested to the positive impact of introducing the malaria vaccine, including a reduction in malaria hospitalizations and the strengthening of the National Immunization Programme (NIP) through routine immunization refresher training and supportive supervision. The pilot highlighted lessons for malaria vaccine introduction: (1) clearly outlined roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders including NIP and National Malaria Programme (NMP); (2) appropriate approach to vaccine introduction launch, communication, and demand generation to enhance vaccine uptake; (3) flexibility with dose scheduling to optimize coverage; and (4) updated data collection tools for accurate documentation, and data quality.",

        "title": "Seroprevalence of dengue virus infection among febrile patients visiting healthcare facilities in the selected districts of Afar region, Northeast Ethiopia.",
        "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is caused by dengue virus (DENV) and is primarily spread through bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions, including Ethiopia. In the Afar region, DF is often misdiagnosed as malaria due to limited diagnostic capabilities. This study assessed the seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in healthcare facilities in the Afar region. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2022 to March 2023 in Amibara, Harunka and Awash Sebat city administration districts, involving febrile patients suspected of having malaria. Sociodemographic data, clinical features and blood samples were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent or assent. Following blood film examination for Plasmodium infection, sera were tested for anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were entered into Epi Data 3.1 and analyzed with Stata/SE 14.2. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 411 febrile patients (55.5% female, aged 5-80 years, with a mean age of 27.3 ± 13.8 years) participated in the study. Among those tested for anti-DENV antibodies, 101/410 (24.6%) were positive for anti-DENV IgM, indicating an acute DENV infection, and 142/367 (38.7%) were positive for anti-DENV IgG, revealing previous exposure. Only 44/411 (10.7%) were positive for Plasmodium infection, while 18/410 (4.4%) were co-infected with malaria and acute DENV infection and 18/367 (4.9%) were positive for both malaria and previous exposure to DENV. Those diagnosed with malaria were nearly 2.5 times more likely to test positive for acute DENV infection than those without malaria (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.92). The odds of positivity for previous exposure were about two times higher in females than in males (AOR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.32-3.26) and in government and private sector employees than in pastoralists and agro-pastoralists (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.03-8.15), while patients aged 11-20 years had lower odds of previous exposure than those aged 5-10 years (AOR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.88). Experiencing muscle pain was associated with twice the odds of previous exposure (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.04-3.49). The study reveals a high seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in the study area, highlighting the need for routine diagnosis and management of DF in this setting. Improving vector control, disease surveillance and public awareness would be crucial for combating DF and other mosquito-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Poor-quality antimalarial medications, including falsified and substandard formulations, pose significant public health risks, contributing to ineffective treatment and potential drug resistance. Our research conducted in 2013 on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG), found 9.6% (n=61) of the artemisinin-containing antimalarials (ACAs) purchased were of poor quality. This study aimed to update the quality of all sold antimalarials and extend to include regions on the mainland. A total of 637 samples, 564 ACAs and 73 non-ACAs, were purchased from 424 outlets on Bioko Island and mainland EG using a mystery client sampling approach. Samples were analysed for content using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and classified as acceptable, substandard or falsified based on pharmacopoeia tolerance limits. Additionally, bioavailability was assessed through dissolution testing for a select number of samples. Overall, 40.5% of the samples were of acceptable quality, 31.2% were substandard and 28.3% were falsified. Regional differences showed a higher prevalence of falsified samples in Bata, Mangomo, Evinayong and Ebebiyín cities on the mainland (30.9%) compared with Bioko Island (25.6%). Artemether/lumefantrine, the first-line treatment for malaria in EG, showed 25.7% were of acceptable quality, 48.2% substandard and 26.1% falsified. Artemisinin monotherapy tablets had the highest rate of falsification (56.8%). For non-ACAs, 13.3% of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets were of acceptable quality, 48.9% substandard and 37.8% falsified. All quinine syrups were falsified, and most quinine tablets (87.5%) and injections (75.0%) were substandard. The prevalence of substandard and falsified antimalarials in EG has alarmingly increased from 9% in 2013 to 59.5% in 2018, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced regulatory measures. Immediate actions should include strengthening drug quality surveillance, particularly in private sector pharmacies, and implementing low-cost medicine screening methods for early detection of poor-quality medications. Ensuring the quality of antimalarials is critical to maintaining the efficacy of malaria control programmes and preventing the development of drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "Infants may be exposed to bisphenols (BP) via breastfeeding. These chemicals are known endocrine disruptors and may interfere with infant growth. However, their presence in breast milk and their associations with infant size remain unexplored in South Africa, where infants may be especially vulnerable to toxic effects. We measured BPA, BPS, and BPAF in breast milk samples obtained 4-8 weeks postpartum from mothers residing in rural (Vhembe district; n=193) and urban (Pretoria; n=189) areas of South Africa and compared them to samples from Montreal (n=206). Infant length and head circumference were measured in South Africa, with z-scores computed based on World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts. Random forest plots were used to identify top-ranked predictors of bisphenols, and linear marginal structural models were used to estimate associations between bisphenol concentrations and infant size. Bisphenol concentrations were highest in Vhembe relative to Pretoria; in Montreal, only BPS was detected. Microwaving food in plastic containers and maternal diet were important determinants of exposure. In the combined South African sites, total BPAF detection was associated with greater infant length (β=0.38 SD, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.68) and head circumference (β=0.52 SD, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.81). Associations were strongest in Pretoria. In contrast, a tenfold increase in total BPA concentration was associated with a 0.20 SD decrease in head circumference (95% CI: -0.39, -0.01) in Vhembe. Findings point to high exposure to bisphenols in rural Africa and suggest that exposure to BPA and BPAF may alter growth among South African infants.",

Although WNV is endemic to Africa, only few (n=63) whole genomic sequences are available from the continent. In this Review, we examined the status of the molecular testing and genomic sequencing of WNV across Africa and mapped its global spatiotemporal spread. WNV has been detected in 39 African countries, the Canary Islands, and Réunion Island. Although publications, including those with molecular data, originated from 24 of these countries, genomic sequences were available from only 16 countries. Our analysis identified regions with detected viral circulation but without molecular surveillance. The current literature has substantial knowledge gaps in terms of the disease burden, molecular epidemiology, and distribution of WNV in Africa. Addressing these gaps requires an integrated One Health surveillance approach, which is challenging to establish. We propose three key surveillance needs that could improve the current understanding of the WNV disease burden in Africa, to strengthen the global public health response to this vector-borne disease.",

        "abstract": "Malaria and malnutrition adversely affect maternal and neonatal health in Sub-Saharan Africa. While intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is widely used to reduce malaria incidence, the potential additional benefits of combining it with lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) remain unclear. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the effects of LNS in combination with IPTp on malaria incidence, maternal nutritional status, and birth outcomes. A comprehensive search of 4 databases-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CENTRAL-and the gray literature via GOOGLE Scholar-was conducted in January 2024, and updated in July 2024. The review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included studies assessing LNS and IPTp for outcomes related to malaria, nutritional status, or birth outcomes. The review identified 17 studies, focused on 5 main trials: 2 with small-quantity LNS (SQ-LNS), 2 with balanced energy-protein (BEP), and 1 trial with large-quantity LNS (LQ-LNS). LNS supplementation did not significantly affect malaria incidence, anemia, or nutritional status. However, some studies reported improvements in birth outcomes, particularly among specific subgroups and those with baseline undernutrition. Variability in study methodologies and supplementation protocols influenced these findings. While LNS and IPTp show potential for improving selected birth outcomes, the evidence for their effect on malaria incidence or maternal anemia remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of LNS and IPTp among vulnerable groups of women in malaria-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Malaria vector control tools currently focus on insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying in malaria-endemic locations, but additional preventative strategies are needed to address protection gaps. Larval source management (LSM) includes larvicide application to aquatic habitat and an array of alternative forms of environmental efforts. An individual-based transmission model for falciparum malaria is used to demonstrate the theoretical benefit of suppressing malaria adult mosquito vector densities through LSM. The model simulates results of epidemiological trials from Western Kenya (a hilly area with papyrus swamps adjacent to human settlements and moderate to high perennial malaria transmission) and Côte d'Ivoire (an area with Sudanese climate, reducing vegetation cover and high transmission) that applied larvicide alongside ITNs, and investigates whether estimated changes in adult density can be used to project changes in human malaria. In the Western Kenya setting generalised linear models estimate 82% (90% credible intervals: 64% - 92%) and 88% (79% - 94%) reductions in the proportion of adult Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes respectively as measured by CDC light traps. In Côte d'Ivoire, an 82% (56% - 93%) reduction of the dominant An. gambiae vector was estimated using standard window trap and pyrethrum spray catch. Both studies had variable village-level impacts. The transmission dynamics model predicted that these entomological impacts would result in a reduction in malaria prevalence in children of 6-months to 10-years of age of 48 - 72% in Kenya, and a 11 - 78% reduction in all-age clinical incidence across villages in Côte d'Ivoire, which are broadly consistent with the empirically observed outcomes. High heterogeneity between villages within the same study indicate that the relative or absolute reductions in mosquito adult density observed in these trials cannot be simply extrapolated to other regions. The LSM strategy adopted, unit area covered, and multiple environmental covariates all contribute to differences in indicators that could be used to assess entomological impacts and the corresponding epidemiological outcomes. This important malaria control tool was impactful across all sites examined, though further work is needed to understand how best to use this tool in the fight against malaria.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a pressing global health challenge, with rising drug resistance threatening current treatment strategies. Partial resistance to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) has emerged in Southeast Asia, particularly in Plasmodium falciparum strains from Cambodia. While artemisinin partial resistance is associated with mutations in kelch13, reduced PPQ sensitivity has been linked to increased copy numbers of the aspartic protease genes plasmepsin II and III and mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter. In this study, we demonstrate the effective use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate single knockouts (KO) of plasmepsin II and plasmepsin III, as well as a double KO of both genes, in two isogenic Cambodian parasites with varying numbers of plasmepsin gene copies. The deletion of plasmepsin II and/or III increased parasite sensitivity to PPQ. We explored several hypotheses to understand how an increased plasmepsin gene copy number might influence parasite survival under high PPQ pressure. Our findings indicate that protease inhibitors have a minimal impact on parasite susceptibility to PPQ. Additionally, parasites with higher plasmepsin gene copy numbers did not exhibit significantly increased hemoglobin digestion, differences in peptide composition, nor did they produce different amounts of free heme following PPQ treatment compared to wildtype (single copy) parasites. Interestingly, hemoglobin digestion was slowed in parasites with plasmepsin II deletions. We also found that culturing parasites with different plasmepsin II and III copies in amino acid-limited media had little impact on parasite sensitivity to high-dose PPQ. By treating parasites with modulators of digestive vacuole (DV) homeostasis, we found that changes in DV pH potentially affect their response to PPQ. Our research highlights the crucial role of increased plasmepsin II and III gene copy numbers in modulating response to PPQ and begins to uncover the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the contribution of plasmepsin II and III amplification to PPQ resistance in Cambodian parasites.",

        "abstract": "As part of a multi-country evaluation, the SD Biosensor STANDARD Q Filariasis Antigen Test (QFAT) was compared with the Abbott Bioline Filariasis Test Strip (FTS) for assessing Wuchereria bancrofti infection prevalence and for ease of use of QFAT in field conditions in Sierra Leone. The evaluation was done in two districts, Bombali and Karene, where repeat pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS) were planned. Two rural sites, Kagbo and Makorba Yelimini which recorded high LF antigen prevalence of 4.1% and 7.7% respectively in repeat pre-TAS in 2020 were selected for the QFAT evaluation. At least 350 people ≥5 years were targeted per site for inclusion in the study by convenience sampling. Blood was collected by fingerstick; 20μl for QFAT and 75μl for FTS. The reading time for both tests was 10 minutes. For all positive or invalid results, a repeat test was performed for both tests. In total, 728 participants (5-91 years) were tested by QFAT and FTS. Four FTS and three QFAT final results were classified as indeterminate (meaning a positive result followed by a negative result) and were excluded from the analysis. The positive rate was 4.8% (17/357) and 3.5% (13/367) for FTS and 3.4% (12/359) and 4.1% (15/366) for QFAT in Kagbo and Makorba Yelimi, respectively. All participants testing positive for FTS or QFAT underwent further testing by night blood smear to detect microfilariae using microscopy. No W. bancrofti microfilariae was detected in any of the antigen positive cases. In field conditions, QFAT was easy to handle and recorded zero invalid tests compared to FTS (six invalids). The concordance between FTS and QFAT was 0.81 (Cohen's Kappa). The discrepancy found between the two tests in terms of positive tests was not statistically significant (p = 0.78). The results suggest that the QFAT is a credible W. bancrofti diagnostic test when compared to the routinely used FTS; use of either test would result in the same program decision.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a world health challenge; in 2023, 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths were reported around the globe. The parasite's life cycle is complex, and targeted interventions at critical developmental stages are needed to effectively control the disease. Transmission-blocking (TB) strategies aim to interrupt Plasmodium transmission by targeting either the mosquito vector or the parasite's sexual stages through vaccines and drugs. TB interventions can focus on gametocytes in the human host or other forms in the mosquito midgut, such as gametes, zygotes, ookinetes, and oocysts. The development of new TB approaches faces significant challenges. Studying the parasite's sexual stages is inherently difficult, and high-throughput screening (HTS) for gametocytocidal compounds relies primarily on P. falciparum cultures. However, robust in vitro tools for assessing interventions against later sexual stages remain limited. To accelerate the discovery of TB compounds, our group developed a novel HTS assay for gametocyte activation and fertilization using P. berghei, a murine model of Plasmodium infection. The transgenic parasite, Ookluc, expresses nanoluciferase exclusively after zygote formation, with peak luminescence during ookinete development. This luminescence-based assay provides a quantitative readout of gamete to zygote and zygote to ookinete differentiation, where increased luminescence directly correlates with ookinete formation. This video article presents the methods for screening malaria TB compounds using Ookluc.",

To determine its effects on humoral immunity, we conducted a proteomic analysis of polyclonal IgG antibodies directed against the NANP tetrapeptide of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), which comprises the vaccine's core immunogen. In 10 malaria-naïve adult volunteers, R21/Matrix-M induced polarized IgG anti-NANP repertoires, heavily skewed for IGHV3-30/3-33 genes bearing minimal somatic mutation, which remained static in composition following a controlled human malaria infection challenge. Notably, these vaccine-generated antibodies cross-reacted with another protective CSP epitope, the N-terminal junction region, despite its absence from the R21 construct. NANP-specific IGHV3-30/3-33 mAbs mined from polyclonal IgG repertoires blocked sporozoite invasion in vitro and prevented parasitemia in vivo. Overall, R21/Matrix-M elicits polarized, minimally mutated, polyclonal IgG responses that can target multiple protective CSP epitopes, offering molecular insight into the serological basis for its demonstrated efficacy against P. falciparum malaria.",

        "abstract": "Malaria causes around 250 million cases and over 600,000 deaths annually, with the heaviest burden falling on young children living in sub-Saharan Africa. Molecular surveillance of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito vectors are key components of effective malaria control decision-making. Previously, we have designed and implemented a nanopore-based workflow for targeted <i>P. falciparum</i> molecular surveillance in Ghana, which we call DRAG1 (drug resistance + antigen multiplex PCR). Here, we describe an updated and expanded multiplex assay ('DRAG2') with additional amplicon targets that incorporate more antimalarial drug resistance markers, the polymorphic surface antigen <i>merozoite surface protein 2</i> ( <i>msp2</i>), and the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene for <i>Plasmodium</i> species detection. We describe the performance of the DRAG2 assay over a range of parasitaemias and sample types (venous blood and dried blood spots), with suggested systems of quality control including the use of synthetic plasmids for positive controls and recommended coverage thresholds. The plasmids are highly economical, and engineered to include both 'test' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as known drug resistance markers, and 'control' SNPs, which are not found in nature and thus signal contamination if detected in clinical samples. We provide standard operating procedures (SOPs) for use by teams aiming to implement the assay in their laboratory. In summary, we describe an updated nanopore-based method for malaria molecular surveillance, including detailed consideration of quality control processes and SOPs. These are important steps in the transition from research tool to diagnostic assay, which will require further testing in endemic settings and regulatory processes and approvals.",

        "abstract": "Chengdu hosted the 31st Summer World University Games in 2023. The movement and gathering of attendees from other cities and countries posed challenges to local public health, including an increased risk of infectious diseases or outbreaks. To manage these risks, a syndromic surveillance system targeting infectious diseases was established. This system aimed to identify suspicious cases and outbreaks early, enabling timely measures and minimizing their impact. This article reviews the surveillance mechanism, analyzes the surveillance data, and evaluates the system's effectiveness. The mechanism of the syndromic surveillance system was described, and surveillance data were collected to evaluate strategies for infectious disease prevention and control during the Universiade. Epidemiological distributions of diseases were described, and differences were tested using chi-squared tests. Surveillance was carried out among athletes, coaches, entourages, and staff from 1 week before the competition to 1 week after. The surveillance focused on symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, jaundice, conjunctival redness, and sore throat, supported by a self-developed <i>Cloud Health Information System for Health Care Support</i> and <i>Syndromic Surveillance System for Infectious Disease</i>. A total of 351 subjects with disease-related symptoms, mainly including sore throat, cough, and fever, were reported. A total of 33 events of clustered symptoms were detected, none of which met the criteria for an outbreak. Fifty cases were confirmed with infectious diseases, comprising 43 cases of COVID-19, 3 cases of influenza, and 1 case each of infectious mononucleosis, chikungunya, malaria, and another infectious diarrhea. Throughout the event, reports of disease-related symptoms were sporadically distributed, with no secondary cases or outbreaks detected and no health-related risks arising that would impact the continuation of the event. The syndromic surveillance system was sensitive and effective for the early detection and control of infectious disease outbreaks and could be implemented in other mass-gathering events.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden globally, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounting for over 90% of cases and deaths. Children under five and pregnant women are the most vulnerable. Resistance to artemisinin-based therapies and insecticides has compounded the challenge. This review evaluates malaria mitigation strategies, emphasizing the potential of vaccination, particularly RTS,S/AS01, as a cornerstone for malaria eradication and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3). A narrative review approach was adopted. Peer-reviewed literature from 2014 to 2024 was sourced from credible scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Selection prioritized studies on malaria control strategies, vaccine trials, efficacy data, implementation frameworks, and health system challenges specific to SSA. The review critically analyzed vaccine trials, community perceptions, and logistical concerns while incorporating the authors' expert perspective. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine demonstrated moderate efficacy (30-55%) in preventing malaria in children under five in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi. Other candidates such as R21/Matrix-M showed up to 77% efficacy in trials. Implementation challenges include limited funding, vaccine hesitancy, poor healthcare infrastructure, and community misconceptions. However, integration with routine immunization, enhanced community engagement, and increased investment in health systems significantly improve vaccine acceptance and impact. Vaccination represents a promising, cost-effective, and scalable strategy for malaria eradication in SSA. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, amplifying vaccine acceptance campaigns, and increasing funding for research and vaccine production are pivotal. Malaria vaccination offers a practical and sustainable pathway toward global malaria elimination and the realization of SDG 3 by 2030.",

        "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a purified form of tau protein kinase II (TPKII), mediates abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation through activation by its cofactor p25. The resulting Cdk5-p25 complex promotes the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, contributing to elevated expression of the microglial marker Iba-1, an established feature of tauopathy-driven neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396/404 disrupts microtubule stability, leading to neuronal dysfunction, synaptic loss, and cognitive deficits. Notably, approximately 25% of children surviving cerebral malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa experience cognitive impairments, underscoring the urgent need for neuroprotective therapies. In this study, we employed an experimental cerebral malaria model to assess the therapeutic potential of four polycyclic derivatives, SR4-01 to SR4-04, as adjuncts to artemether. We evaluated their efficacy in attenuating Cdk5-p25-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396, with the goal of restoring neuronal architecture and cognitive function. Behavioral assessments included the Barnes maze for long-term memory, T-maze for short-term memory, and a novelty-based recognition task. Among the treatment groups, SR4-02 and SR4-04 demonstrated significant improvements in learning and memory compared to both artemether monotherapy and the SR4-01 and SR4-03 groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus and cortex showed reduced phospho-tau (Ser396) expression in the SR4-02 and SR4-04 groups. Golgi-Cox staining further revealed enhanced neuronal arborization in the CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus and in the cortex. Western blot analysis confirmed reduced Cdk5-p25-mediated tau phosphorylation in the SR4-04 treated group. Collectively, our findings suggest that SR4-02 and SR4-04 hold promise as adjunctive therapies for reducing tau pathology and restoring cognitive function in cerebral malaria-associated neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "Scientists are urged to discover new drugs since treatment resistance makes malaria hard to control. One important source of new drugs is medicinal plants. The antimalarial qualities of Tephrosia villosa roots in vitro demonstrated its good effect to treat malaria infections. On the other hand, its effect in vivo is unknown. This study filled the gap by evaluating the antimalarial effectiveness of Tephrosia villosa's Dichloromethane/methanol (1:1) extract against Plasmodium berghei infection in a mouse model.Dichloromethane/methanol (1:1) was used to extract the dried, powdered roots of Tephrosia villosa, and the extract's safety profile was assessed using an acute toxicity test. By giving 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg dosages of the extract, the antimalarial activity of the extract was assessed by the 4-day suppressive, Rane's, and prophylactic tests. To establish the activity, criteria such as body weight, packed cell capacity, temperature, survival time, and parasitemia level were measured.According to the acute oral toxicity result, the extract caused no signs of toxicity in mice in 24 h and within 14 days of observation. It was proven to have chemosuppressive, curative, and prophylactic activities. It has decreased the level of parasitemia and improved mean survival time in parasite infected mice in used models. The extract at 400 mg/kg dose suppressed parasitemia by 24.78%, 52.16%, and 49.09% in 4-day suppressive, curative and prophylactic test models (p < 0.001) respectively. Moreover, it inhibited reduction in packed cell volume, body weight, and temperature fall in all tested models as compared to the negative control. The findings revealed that the extract of the plant was safe at 2 g/kg dose on acute oral toxicity test and was proven to have antimalarial effect for plasmodium berghei infection in mice which supports the in vitro test.",

Heterologous m8Δ-prime and AAV1-boost immunization provided 70% protection against both PfCSP/Pb and PvCSP/Pb transgenic sporozoites.

        "abstract": "Splenic rupture is a potentially life-threatening condition and most commonly linked to abdominal or thoracic trauma. When it occurs without trauma, it is termed as spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR). However, it is exceedingly rare and typically occurs secondary to underlying pathological processes. In malaria-endemic regions, Plasmodium infections can cause splenic enlargement and increase the risk of rupture. We present four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture, all occurring in patients with a recent history of malaria treatment. One patient was a 30-year-old previously healthy male from a malaria-endemic region in Ethiopia who presented with acute left upper quadrant abdominal pain, dizziness, and massive hemoperitoneum, requiring an emergency splenectomy. The remaining three patients, although diagnosed with SSR, were hemodynamically stable and managed successfully with conservative treatment, including close monitoring, supportive care, and serial imaging. None of the non-operatively managed patients required surgery during follow-up. SSR due to malaria is rare but more common in endemic areas. Malaria-associated splenic rupture is due to vascular congestion, reticuloendothelial hyperplasia, and a fragile splenic capsule. A high index of suspicion is important in patients with malaria who develop abdominal pain. Such patients need proper abdominal imaging and exclusion of trauma. Treatment depends mainly on hemodynamic stability, with splenectomy reserved for uncontrolled bleeding. Malaria-related spontaneous splenic rupture may present with variable clinical severity. Early recognition, appropriate imaging, and timely surgical intervention are critical for favorable outcomes, particularly in malaria-endemic settings.",

        "abstract": "Bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina Delile) and Siam weed (Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M.King & H.Rob.) are herbal plants known for their diverse therapeutic purposes, including the treatment of malaria. However, there is a dearth of information on their ability to reverse the negative impacts of malaria infection on reproduction-linked organs such as the testes. This study investigated the effect of bitter leaf and Siam weed aqueous extracts in reversing testicular oxidative damage caused by plasmodium berghei Infection in male mice. The bioactive components of Siam weed and bitter leaf were analysed. Sixty-four (64) male mice were inoculated with strain NK65 Plasmodium berghei (Chloroquine, CQ sensitive), and the parasitemia suppression was assessed. The mice were treated with bitter leaf and Siam weed aqueous extracts (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) for five (5) days, with Chloroquine (10 mg/kg) as standard. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidant levels and enzyme activities were assessed on the testes of the mice. Bitter leaf and Siam weed contain several antioxidants and anti-inflammatory bioactive components. Treatments with these herbs suppressed the parasitemia level, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ROS, TBARS, and had an inhibitory effect on enzyme activities, with an increase in antioxidant levels in a dose-dependent manner compared to infected, untreated mice. These findings indicate that bitter leaf and Siam weed aqueous extracts can reverse the negative effects of malaria infection on the testes via modulation of oxidative stress pathways.",

Notably, the calibration range was established from 0.25 to 15 mg/L, demonstrating improvements over previous methodologies with lower limits of quantification of 0.5-1.0 mg/L. Using the developed LC-MS/MS method, plasma samples were analysed from a clinical trial conducted in Gabon, as well as from a pharmacokinetic study involving male Wistar rats, revealing viable pharmacokinetic profiles for fosmidomycin. These findings confirm the utility of the developed analytical method for supporting the clinical development of fosmidomycin as a potential therapy for malaria.",

        "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, 20-40% of people living with HIV present with advanced HIV disease (AHD), which can be diagnosed, treated, and prevented using a package of care recommended by WHO. We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

There is a lack of published research from Pakistan regarding the negative effects of anti-TB treatment on children, specifically about ADRs. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ADR associated with anti-DR-TB treatment in children. (2) Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in the multicenter setting of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. A total of 450 TB children in multicenter hospitals under ATT were assessed for ADRs. Naranjo Causality Assessment and Hartwig's Severity Assessment Scale were used to evaluate the causality and severity. (3) Results: A total of 300 (66.66%) ADRs were reported in 450 people with DRTB. Anemia was the most frequently observed ADR (37.6%) followed by nausea and vomiting (18.6%). On multivariate analysis, the independent variables that had a statistically significant positive association with ADRs were participants aged, 5-14 years (AOR, 0.3 (0.1-0.5), <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001), normal weight (1.1 (2.0-1.9), <i>p</i> < 0.001), and children having comorbidities (AOR, 0.5 (0.1-0.8), <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001).

        "abstract": "Background Safe blood transfusion remains a challenge, and transmission of infections is always a concern. The detection of infectious diseases in blood donors ensures the safety of blood transfusion. Another challenge is the differences in blood group antigens due to the ability of clinically significant antibodies to cause adverse reactions. This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of distribution and the possible correlation of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) with different blood groups. This study also aimed to evaluate the frequencies of minor blood group antigens detected on screening in a few infected blood donors. Methodology This study included replacement donors who were fit to donate blood after screening. After blood donation, tests for TTIs was done using the chemiluminescence immunoassay for hepatitis B virus (HBV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HCV), and rapid diagnostic kits were used for malaria and syphilis. Blood grouping was performed by IMMUCOR'S NEO IRIS instrument using commercial antisera. Samples of blood donors infected with TTIs over the study period of two months were also tested for minor antigens. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Software, version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results In total, 46,549 blood donors were included, of whom 3,064 (6.6%) donors were reactive for TTIs, with the most prevalent being HBV infection (n = 1,183, 2.5%). In this study, 2.4% (n = 23) of the total B-negative blood donors were HCV reactive (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.3, p = 0.038; statistically significant), and 0.9% (n = 8) of the total B-negative blood donors were malaria reactive (Fisher's exact test = 11.06, p = 0.001; statistically significant). Blood donors with A-positive blood group were significantly associated with syphilis infection (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.86, p = 0.05). The Fyb antigen was relatively more prevalent among HIV-reactive donors (n = 24, 77.4%), while E (n = 3, 9.7%) and c (n = 13, 41.9%) antigens were relatively lesser prevalent compared to other infected donors. Similarly, malaria-reactive donors had a lower prevalence of C antigen (n = 17, 73.9%) and a higher prevalence of E antigen (n = 8, 34.8%). The most common Rh phenotype found among all the TTI-infected reactive donors was CCDee, and among the Rh-negative infected donors, ccdee was the only phenotype observed. Conclusions This study determined the regional prevalence of TTIs among blood donors and noted a significant association of B-negative blood group with HCV and malaria. This study also assessed the frequency of some minor blood group antigens among TTI-infected blood donors.",

        "abstract": "The WHO and onchocerciasis-endemic countries target elimination of the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite causing onchocerciasis, primarily through ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA). In Africa, alternative treatment strategies are required to achieve or accelerate elimination. One of these is the MDA of moxidectin, an anthelmintic drug for which an 8 mg dose to individuals aged 12 years and older has received regulatory approval. This study was conducted to identify dose levels for children aged 4 to 11 years. An open-label, non-comparative, single-dose study in an onchocerciasis-endemic area of Ghana was designed to evaluate moxidectin pharmacokinetics and safety in four groups comprising nine individuals each: those aged 12-17 years, after administration of 8 mg; those aged 8-11 years after administration of 8 mg; those aged 8-11 years after administration of 6 mg; and those aged 4-7 years after administration of 4 mg moxidectin. Evaluations to identify adverse events included physical examination, vital signs, haematology, clinical chemistry and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Moxidectin plasma concentrations were measured at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 72 h and at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks post-dose. The maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>; ng/ml) and area under the concentration-time curve from dosing to infinity (AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>; ng h/ml) were obtained through non-compartmental analysis. The 38 adverse events in 24 participants were illnesses typically seen in the study population without treatment (primarily malaria) and were considered not moxidectin-related. The arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> in all groups (range 84.6 ± 18.2 to 118 ± 26.5 ng/ml and 2070 ± 587 to 3910 ± 1070 ng h/ml, respectively) were lower than in those in healthy adults administered 36 mg moxidectin (range 252 ± 50.3 to 296 ± 47 ng/ml and 10835 ± 2587 to 14972 ± 2233 ng h/ml, respectively), the highest and well-tolerated dose given to humans. Mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> in groups 1-3 (range 84.6 ± 18.2 to 118 ± 26.5 ng/ml and 2920 ± 2120 to 3910 ± 1070 ng h/ml, respectively) exceeded those in O. volvulus-infected adults administered 8 mg (63.1 ± 20.0 ng/ml and 2738 ± 1606 ng h/ml, respectively). In group 4, mean C<sub>max</sub> (89.4 ± 24.1 ng/ml) exceeded that in O. volvulus-infected adults administered 8 mg moxidectin (63.1 ± 20.0 ng/ml). Mean AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> (2070 ± 587 ng h/ml) exceeded that in O. volvulus-infected adults administered 4 mg moxidectin (1169 ± 488 ng h/ml), a dose shown to be almost as efficacious as 8 mg. Considering the safety data, exposures and potential MDA operational aspects, 8 mg for children aged between 8 and 11 years and 4 mg for children aged between 4 and 7 years were selected for further single-dose studies.",

        "abstract": "The prevailing public health threat posed by malaria, especially in developing countries, remains a serious concern despite the availability of preventive and control measures. While vaccination offers a powerful means of combating malaria, it has not been fully exploited due to previous unsuccessful attempts before the launch of the RTS,S vaccine. A major challenge in malaria vaccine development continues to be the identification of effective targets capable of eliciting robust immunity, given the complexity of the parasites' life cycle. Leveraging on the breakthrough of the newly approved malaria vaccine, efforts to develop more effective prophylactic solutions continue with renewed determination. In this study, a standard structural bioinformatics pipeline was employed to design a multiepitope subunit vaccine against <i>Plasmodium</i>, particularly <i>P. falciparum</i>. Thirty subunit epitopes were mined from selected variant surface antigens of <i>P. falciparum</i> proteins expressed at different stages of its life cycle, based on their vaccine-likeness. These epitopes were conjugated with suitable adjuvants and linkers into a vaccine construct, which was then subjected to stringent downstream analyses. Out of an initial pool of 133 epitopes, 30 vaccine-fit epitopes were selected, resulting in a final vaccine construct comprising 570 amino acid residues. This included 12 linear B-cells, 11 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and 7 helper T-lymphocyte epitopes, all with favorable predicted structural, antigenic, and physicochemical properties. The construct also demonstrated strong global population coverage (95.04%), robust molecular binding, and simulated immune responses. With the evolving \"Omics\" technologies through reverse vaccinology, discovering and designing promising vaccine candidates becomes easier without many challenging experimental rigors. This study highlights the potential of immunoinformatics-aided approaches in accelerating effective malaria vaccine development.",

        "title": "Conceptualization of gender in published malaria and gender research: a systematic descriptive review.",
        "abstract": "Malaria disproportionately affects vulnerable and marginalised population subgroups, including women and girls, migrants, and persons with disabilities. Gender roles expose men and women differently to malaria risks. Similarly, restrictive gender norms pose unique challenges to women and girls in accessing preventive treatment and care. Gender norms that perpetuate hegemonic masculinity also expose men and boys to malaria, resulting from occupational exposure and untimely access to malaria treatment and care. Unfortunately, the gender dimensions of malaria remain under-researched. This systematic descriptive review examines how gender has been conceptualised in published malaria and gender research over the last three decades. The keywords \"malaria AND gender\" were used to search for articles published in English from 1995 to 2024 in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was adopted for this review. The Rayyan intelligent systematic review software was used to collate, manage, and screen articles retrieved from the search engines. The gender analysis matrix advanced by Morgan and colleagues was used to analyse the conceptualisation of gender in published malaria and gender research. A total of 57 published articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final review. We found that the majority of the published papers on malaria and gender have been biomedical in nature, consequently reducing gender analysis to only sex-disaggregated data. Moreover, most of the studies employed a quantitative research approach, with the majority being laboratory-based research, focussing on sub-Saharan Africa. There is a need for more social science research that employs qualitative, mixed-methods, and community-based approaches to malaria and gender research. These approaches extend gender analysis beyond sex and/or gender-disaggregated data, and includes other domains, such as access to resources; distribution of labour; practices and roles; norms, values and beliefs; and decision-making power.",

        "abstract": "In August 2022, an epidemiologic investigation into an outbreak of cases of black water fever, a severe and fatal complication of malaria, was conducted in Kakumiro District, Central Uganda. Findings revealed an association between self-medication and the development of severe malaria complications. Factors associated with self-medication for uncomplicated malaria were described for improved malaria management and prevention of malaria related mortality in Uganda. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Kakumiro District in August 2023. Using multistage sampling, 592 households were selected. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview one participant per household about self-medication for malaria in a family member of any age who suffered from malaria 6 months prior to the interview. Data on demographics, socio-economic factors, health-seeking behaviour, self-medication and antimalarial storage at home were obtained. Modified Poisson regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Of the 592 participants interviewed, 368 (62%; 95% CI 58.2-65.9%) had self-medicated for malaria. Self-medication was significantly associated with household heads aged ≥ 35 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]: 1.77; 95% CI 1.04-3.01); distances ≥ 5 km to the health facility (APR: 3.05; 95% CI 2.09-4.47), and storage of antimalarial drugs at home (APR: 2.21; 95% CI 1.36-3.59). Having malaria episodes ≥ 6 in the household within 6 months was protective (APR: 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.65). The major reason for self-medication was antimalarial stockouts at health facilities. Drugs used for self-medication were commonly known to 65% of the respondents and were bought from drug shops (75%). Although, 85% used the recommended drug for malaria treatment, the dose was inappropriate for 66% of the patients and despite the under dose, 85% of the patients recovered without hospitalization. The common occurrence of self-medication for malaria and the high potential for malaria drug resistance and increased malaria mortality due to inappropriate treatment was demonstrated. Adequate antimalarial stock to health facilities, instituting policies prohibiting the sale of incomplete doses by drug shops, social behavioural change campaigns against drug storage in homes and sensitization of communities on the dangers of self-medication and the consumption of inappropriate doses could reduce self-medication practices and its eventual consequences.",

        "abstract": "Malaria during pregnancy remains a significant public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 32 million pregnant women are at risk. Despite the progress made in the coverage of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria during pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), notable gaps persist in understanding the individual and community-level factors that correlate with optimal dosing adherence. This study aims to assess these correlates in Tanzania using recent Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) data. This study employed an analytical cross-sectional design, utilizing data from the 2022 TDHS. This study's analysis included 4497 women who had given birth within two years before the survey. The data were analzed using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, employing four models to identify factors associated with optimal IPTp-SP dose uptake. The overall uptake of optimal (≥ 3 doses) IPTp-SP was 31.2% (95% CI 29.1-33.3). In the adjusted analysis, individual correlates were women aged 25-34 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.21-1.90) and 35-49 years (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.10-1.96) compared to women aged 15-24 years. Women with primary education (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68) were more likely to achieve optimal uptake than those with no formal education. Furthermore, women with one child (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.26-2.17) and two children (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.74) showed higher odds of optimal uptake compared to women with no children. Having more than three antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.47-2.12) increased the likelihood of optimal uptake compared to those with fewer than three visits. Community-level correlates of optimal IPTp-SP uptake included communities with higher ANC visit rates (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.13-1.97), which showed higher odds of optimal uptake than those with low ANC visit rates. Residing in the Northern (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.59) and Lake zones (AOR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.12-2.53) was also associated with higher odds of optimal uptake compared to women in the Western zone. Conversely, women in Zanzibar (AOR = 0.01, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) had low uptake because IPTp-SP is no longer recommended. This study revealed low uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP influenced by several individual and community factors. Future malaria prevention in pregnancy requires integrating control programs with reproductive health services, overcoming socio-cultural barriers, and utilizing community engagement to enhance IPTp-SP coverage.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) receive a free long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) during their first antenatal care (ANC) visit to prevent malaria. This study, conducted in Benin, evaluates the distribution and utilization rates of LLINs provided at the first ANC visit among pregnant women. Data were collected from 14 public and private health centers located in urban and rural areas across Southern, Central, and Northern Benin. Pregnant women were enrolled in the study during their initial ANC visit and were subsequently visited at home twice, where a questionnaire was administered. The study assessed the distribution and use of LLINs during the first ANC visit. After the second home visit, the LLIN found on the pregnant women's sleeping unit was collected to evaluate its physical integrity and bio-efficacy. Chi-square tests were used to compare each indicator across three variables: region, urban/rural setting, and public/private status of health centers. A total of 718 pregnant women were included in the study. LLIN ownership and usage before the first ANC visit were 94% [89-97%] and 93% [85-97%], respectively. During the first ANC visit, 63% [40-80%] of the pregnant women received an LLIN, but only 11% [7-22%] installed it on their sleeping area. During the pregnancy period, 72% [64-78%] of the LLINs in use were found to be either physically damaged or not bio-effective. The distribution of LLINs to pregnant women during their first ANC visit was inadequate, with only a small fraction of recipients actively using the net. This shortfall leads to suboptimal protection for this vulnerable population during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Disease tolerance is a key defense mechanism that limits damage to the host without directly reducing pathogen levels. In malaria, these mechanisms are essential for preventing severe disease and death but remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated processes play a vital role in disease tolerance during Plasmodium chabaudi AS infection. GR deletion in infected mice resulted in lethal hypoglycemia and a cytokine storm. Hypoglycemia was driven by severe metabolic dysfunction in the liver and spleen, characterized by increased glucose uptake, glycogen depletion, a dominant glycolytic profile and reduced gluconeogenic gene expression. Importantly, this hypoglycemic state was strongly associated with overactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway and excessive cytokine expression. Treatment with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib significantly improved survival by preventing lethal hypoglycemia and suppressing hyperinflammation. Our findings reveal a novel link between GR signaling, STAT3 activation, cytokine expression and glucose metabolism during severe malaria. This underscores the critical role of GR-mediated processes in disease tolerance and highlights ruxolitinib as a promising adjuvant therapy for managing life-threatening metabolic complications in malaria.",

The disease is defined clinically as an otherwise unexplained coma in someone with malaria parasitemia. One in 6 children with cerebral malaria dies and many survivors are left with neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral sequelae. Acute seizures are common and increasing numbers of them during the index illness are associated with a greater likelihood of adverse outcomes. Optimal treatment pathways for children with cerebral malaria have been standardized but the search for an adjunctive therapy that decreases cerebral malaria mortality or morbidity has, so far, remained elusive. After hospital discharge, care gaps for survivors continue in the diagnosis and management of educational challenges, behavioral abnormalities, and epilepsy, especially in the rural settings where malaria incidence is highest. In the past decade, science has elucidated much about cerebral malaria pathogenesis. Observational studies using magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, and transcranial doppler have all provided insight on the pathway from the initial infection transmitted by a mosquito, to death. Findings from each of these high technology modalities are also associated with outcomes in children with cerebral malaria. We review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic considerations, optimal clinical care pathways, neurological sequalae, and existing care gaps in the management of cerebral malaria and its complications.",

        "abstract": "Malaria control and elimination is threatened by the spread of insecticide resistance and behavioral adaptation of vectors. Whether mass administration of ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug that also kills mosquitoes feeding on treated persons, can reduce malaria transmission is unclear. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in Kwale, a county in coastal Kenya in which malaria is highly endemic and coverage and use of insecticide-treated nets are high. Clusters of household areas were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mass administration of ivermectin (400 μg per kilogram of body weight) or albendazole (400 mg, active control) once a month for 3 consecutive months at the beginning of the \"short rains\" season. Children 5 to 15 years of age were tested for malaria infection monthly for 6 months after the first round of treatment. The two primary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of malaria infection (assessed among children 5 to 15 years of age) and of adverse events (assessed among all eligible participants). Analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 84 clusters comprising 28,932 eligible participants underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the participants were similar in the trial groups. Six months after the first round of treatment, the incidence of malaria infection was 2.20 per child-year at risk in the ivermectin group and 2.66 per child-year at risk in the albendazole group; the adjusted incidence rate ratio (ivermectin vs. albendazole) was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95, P = 0.02). The incidence of serious adverse events per 100 treatments did not differ significantly between the trial groups (incidence rate ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.91). Among children 5 to 15 years of age who were living in an area with high coverage and use of bed nets, ivermectin, administered once a month for 3 consecutive months, resulted in a 26% lower incidence of malaria infection than albendazole.

        "abstract": "Despite several rounds of ivermectin treatment, onchocerciasis transmission persists in Mvolo and Mundri West Counties (Western Equatoria State, South Sudan). A community-based \"Slash and clear\" (S&C) vector control method was recently introduced, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Between October 2023 and November 2024, entomological studies were conducted to map blackfly breeding sites along River Naam (Mvolo County) and River Yei (Mundri West County). Following baseline assessment of daily biting rates at multiple catching sites, one round of S&C was implemented at selected intervention sites. Monthly biting rates (MBR) were monitored over a follow-up period of 8-14 months and compared between intervention and control sites. Thirteen breeding sites of Simulium damnosum, sensu lato. were found on the Naam and Yei Rivers. Biting rates were consistently higher during the rainy season than the dry season across both Counties. On the Naam River (14 months of follow-up), Mann-Kendall trend tests showed non-significant reductions in MBRs at both intervention (tau = -0.038, p-value = 0.881) and control sites (tau = -0.135, p-value = 0.313). Similar non-significant changes were observed on the Yei River (8 months follow-up), with tau = 0.046 (p-value = 0.820) and tau = 0.163 (p-value = 0.363) for intervention and control sites, respectively. Generalized additive models (GAM) regression analysis indicated that seasonality was the only significant predictor of MBR, with increased biting rates during the rainy season (p < 0.001). A single round of S&C at baseline did not result in significant reductions in MBRs (p-value = 0.651 in Mvolo and p-value = 0.531 in Mundri West). Blackfly biting rates in Mvolo and Mundri West Counties are strongly influenced by seasonal variations, peaking during the rainy season. Our findings indicate that a single round of S&C is insufficient to reduce blackfly biting in the medium term. Repeated and strategically timed annual implementation of S&C is likely required to achieve significant and lasting vector control impacts.",

Engineering the antibody Fc region to more effectively engage immune effector functions has produced therapeutic antibodies with enhanced potency against viral and oncological targets. However, whether Fc-dependent immune effector functions can contribute to the protection of malaria CSP mAbs or be further enhanced via engineering has been limitedly tested. Here, we report that Fc-dependent effector functions are required for achieving maximal protection via prophylactic treatment with the CSP mAb 317. We further report that Fc engineering modulated the activity of multiple CSP mAbs in multiple <i>in vitro</i> assays of effector function. Our studies revealed that the mAbs L9 and CIS43 were more potent drivers of antibody-dependent phagocytosis, NK activation and killing, and complement deposition. In contrast, 317, but not L9 and CIS43, drove enhanced activation of CSP-responsive T-cells after DC acquisition of mAb-complexed antigens. Collectively, our data suggest that effector function represents an important mechanism of anti-CSP antibodies with the potential to enhance activity through Fc engineering.IMPORTANCEMalaria disease imposes a major burden on global health, causing over half a million annual deaths. Recent clinical trials in humans have shown that therapeutic antibodies can provide prophylactic protection against malaria in target populations. However, the cost of goods for therapeutic antibodies is high, and the malaria disease burden is concentrated in resource-challenged regions. Engineering the antibody Fc domain to more efficiently engage the immune system is an appealing strategy to increase the potency of therapeutic antibodies but has been minimally tested for malaria. Here, we present evidence that the Fc domain of malaria therapeutic antibodies can confer protection in animal models and can be engineered for more potent stimulation of diverse parasite-targeting immune responses.",

        "abstract": "Joint bleeding (hemarthrosis) is a major manifestation of joint trauma, especially repeated and spontaneous in hemophilia patients. Hemarthrosis has been identified to induce the excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and permanent damage in articular cartilage. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a well-known clinical anti-malaria drug with few sides effects therapy, has been reported to possess anti-oxidative activity. This study was aimed at exploring the effect of DHA on blood-induced cartilage erosion and its underlying mechanisms. Two distinct hemarthrosis models were constructed respectively by fresh blood joint injection in WT and joint needle puncture in <i>F8</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice, and then treated with DHA (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. <i>In vitro</i> chondrocytes treated with frozen-thaw blood and DHA (1, 5 or 10 μM) for 24 h. Histopathological, immunofluorescence and western blotting were investigated to demonstrate the effects of DHA on blood-induced chondrocyte senescence, ROS accumulation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Additionally, Nrf2 inhibitor (MLB385, 30 mg/kg for once a four days) and Nrf2-siRNA were used to investigate the relationship between DHA and Nrf2/Keap1 signaling <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, respectively. DHA remarkably ameliorated the cartilage degeneration in both two hemarthrosis models. Similarly, <i>in vitro</i> experiments confirmed that DHA promoted the synthesis of ECM in blood-stimulated chondrocytes with a dose-dependent manner. DHA also effectively suppressed blood-induced chondrocyte senescence and ROS accumulation. Mechanistically, DHA activated the Nrf2 signaling by accelerating Keap1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, Nrf2 siRNA and antagonist abolished the anti-senescence and anti-oxidative functions of DHA, resulting the severe cartilage degeneration in bleeding joint of <i>F8</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice. Our findings indicate that DHA effectively reduces chondrocyte senescence and mitigates cartilage destruction following hemarthrosis via activation of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. On the one hand, this study highlights the important role of chondrocyte senescence in hemarthrosis-induced cartilage degradation, implying that inhibiting chondrocyte senescence may be a viable therapeutic strategy for blood-induced arthropathy. On the other hand, our findings demonstrate the remarkable chondroprotective effect of DHA in bleeding joint by modulating the Nrf2/Keap1 anti-oxidative signaling pathway, suggesting DHA may serve as a potential candidate drug for the therapy of blood-induced arthropathy.",

All studies that used PCR for detecting Plasmodium infections were included in this study. Further information was retrieved on molecular targets used and the type of PCR assay used. An independent search was also made to explore the identification/development of newer molecular targets. Almost all studies (93%) used 18S rRNA gene as a molecular target. Nested PCR alone (68%) was the most frequently used assay. Eighty-five percent of the studies that exploited the 18S rRNA gene target and nested PCR used the approach developed in 1993.

This paper explores the factors that influence community engagement as a plausible strategy in promoting the uptake of the malaria vaccine among children under five. A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study design was employed using structured questionnaires. Using a systematic sampling method, a sample of 1,183 was recruited based on sample size table for 2,500 under five population. The study utilized bivariate analysis and random forest analysis to identify important factors influencing community participation in malaria vaccine promotion. The results from the random forest analysis highlighted perception of vaccine effectiveness, educational level, and age as the most relevant factors influencing community engagement. Additionally, the study identified vaccine safety and acceptability as moderate factors that could significantly contribute to promoting community engagement as a strategy for increasing malaria vaccine uptake among children under five. The findings further highlight that individuals with high educational attainment tend to prioritize vaccine effectiveness and safety, while those with lower educational attainment prioritize factors such as vaccine cost and cultural considerations to effectiveness. By tailoring educational programs to address demographic variations in perceptions of vaccine efficacy, community engagement can be leveraged to promote widespread uptake of the malaria vaccine among children under five.",

Primaquine (PQ), the drug of choice for eliminating hypnozoites, requires metabolic activation by Cytochrome P450-2D6 (CYP2D6). Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can alter PQ metabolism, potentially increasing the risk of relapses. This study aimed to determine CYP2D6 polymorphisms in subjects with Plasmodium vivax under supervised chloroquine-primaquine treatment and explore their association with relapses and PQ plasma levels. CYP2D6 phenotypes and genotypes were successfully determined for 71 out of 78 patients included in the study. Nine polymorphisms (SNPs and indels) and gene copy number variation were analyzed. The association between the CYP2D6 phenotype, P. vivax relapse over six months follow-up, and PQ plasma levels were explored. Most diplotypes (81.7 %) were associated with normal (gNM-F) and ultrarapid (gUM) CYP2D6 metabolizers, while 18.3 % were associated with poor (gPM) and intermediate (gIM and gNM-S) metabolizers. The median plasma PQ concentration on day 2 was higher in impaired CYP2D6 activity group (poor/intermediate) compared normal metabolizers (normal/ultrarapid) (660.4 ng/ml vs 313.5 ng/ml; effect size r -0.51, 95 % CI -0.82 to 0.03). No significant difference was found in the hazard ratio (HR) of relapse between impaired and normal CYP2D6 activity (adjusted HR: 1.45; 95 % CI: 0.39-5.39). Impaired CYP2D6 activity phenotypes were frequent in individuals infected with P. vivax from an endemic region of Colombia.

This case highlights the rarity of adult S. haematobium worms in a sub-granuloma area and explores how they may reach this site. A 25-year-old man presented with hematuria, dysuria, and urinary incontinence, with no prior history of schistosomiasis. Investigations revealed numerous RBCs, pus cells, and S. haematobium eggs in his urine. An abdominal ultrasound showed a thickened bladder wall with filling defects. Cystoscopy revealed two bladder tumors and sandy patches, where multiple mobile worms were found beneath granulomas. The granulomas and worms were completely removed (TURBT). Histopathology confirmed bilharzial granuloma and adult S. haematobium. The patient was treated by empirical regimen postoperatively and reported symptom improvement at follow-up. Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, where over 90 % of cases occur in areas with inadequate sanitation. In Sudan, urinary schistosomiasis was first reported in 1919. The disease manifests in two forms: urogenital, caused by S. haematobium, and intestinal, caused by other species. Adult worms reside in the bladder, and their eggs lead to symptoms such as dysuria and \"sandy patches.\" Praziquantel has been the gold standard treatment for over 30 years. Granulomas around adult worms are rare due to their location in the peri-vesical plexus and inability to migrate to bladder cavity. The presence of viable adult worms in uncommon sites may be explained by many possibilities such as angiogenesis in chronic inflammation or aberrant vascularity that early led the small adult worm to reach this site and to grow to this size. This case mirroring rarity of the presence of adult S. haematobium in sub-granuloma area, it's also discuss the different possibilities of how this adult worm reach this rare site.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia has typically been linked to high-altitude regions but has recently emerged at an unusually low altitude of 500 meters in the Somali Region, raising public health concerns. Cutaneous leishmaniasis has not been previously identified in the region. There is a conflict in the starting area and only militias have been infected with very serious lesions. Routine clinical and socio-demographic information was extracted from the patient chart using a case report form. Additionally, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from 30 patients suspected for CL. Skin scraping and fine needle aspirates were collected from the raised edges, nodular and centre of the lesions followed by DNA extraction using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. There were a total of 1050 CL patients recruited, all of them were male militia members, immunologically naïve and displaced into a conflict area with a likely sylvatic transmission cycle. We identified Leishmania tropica as the causative species, challenging the previous assumption that L. aethiopica was the primary agent of CL in Ethiopia. Notably, over 77% of patients had more than 10 lesions, a presentation atypical for L. tropica elsewhere. Phlebotomus orientalis and P. sergenti, vectors for visceral leishmaniasis and CL in North Africa respectively, were found in the outbreak area. Further research is needed to explore the eco-epidemiology of the outbreak and patient's treatment responses. Insights will help develop management strategies to control this newly emerging form of CL, prevent its spread to other regions and hybridization with Leishmania strains causing VL endemic in the area.",

        "abstract": "Southern Africa remains burdened by malaria, with growing concern about the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. While artemisinin resistance has not yet been observed in the region, molecular surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa has identified Plasmodium falciparum k13 mutations known to confer resistance, making it vitally important to take proactive and creative measures to protect current treatment regimens. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), the multifunctional enzymes involved in detoxification and redox control, have emerged as key contributors to drug resistance in Plasmodium species. The role of GSTs in the development of resistance is discussed in the review, and GSTs are presented as prospective molecular targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. We examine the complexity of antimalarial resistance in Southern Africa and highlight the potential of GST inhibition as an adjunct therapy to current malaria control measures. The review promotes a paradigm shift towards GST-targeting approaches as a pre-emptive strategy to avert resistance and consolidate malaria control initiatives throughout the region, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good health and wellbeing) among Southern African populations.",

        "abstract": "The recently licenced R21/Matrix-M vaccine induces a protective antibody response. In this study, we examined vaccine-induced responses in semi-immune adults in a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) Phase IIb clinical trial. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy adult volunteers living in coastal Kenya were analysed following vaccination with R21/Matrix-M (<i>n</i> = 19) and CHMI challenge with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>SPZ NF54) sporozoites (<i>n</i> = 17). Humoral immunity was evaluated by quantifying antigen specific antibody subtypes and subclasses via ELISA, alongside functional antibody properties including avidity and complement fixation elicited by vaccination and challenge. Antigen-specific memory B cells were characterised using FluoroSpot assays to detect concurrent secretion of multiple antibody isotypes and the frequency and phenotypes of circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells were assessed using multiparametric flow cytometry. Vaccination increased antibody titres across IgA, IgM, and IgG isotypes and IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses but not IgG2 or IgG4 subclasses, targeting different vaccine antigens (full-length R21, NANP, and C-terminus), indicating a broad and heterogeneous response. The responses were maintained over time and, importantly, they demonstrated complement-fixing capabilities. IgG+ and IgA+ antigen-specific memory B cells were boosted but were short-lived for IgA. We observed an increase in total CXCR5+/PD1+ cTfh cells following vaccination and challenge with the predominant Th2/Th17 population. We provide insights into the diverse immune responses induced by R21/Matrix-M vaccination and their potential contribution to protection against malaria. These findings highlight the potential of the R21/Matrix-M vaccination and protection in adults with varying levels of prior malaria exposure.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Despite considerable progress through biomedical interventions, persistent transmission underscores the need to examine additional influencing factors. This scoping review maps existing evidence on community knowledge in malaria prevention and control strategies, aiming to inform more targeted and culturally adapted interventions. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed, English-language studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies focused on community knowledge related to malaria prevention, control, and elimination among non-specific populations. Two independent reviewers screened the literature, while a third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. Data were extracted using a standardised framework and analysed systematically in Microsoft Excel. The review included 63 studies from 27 countries, predominantly from Africa (68.3%) and Asia (28.6%), with a notable increase in publications in 2021. The findings revealed significant regional variations in community knowledge of malaria transmission, symptoms, and prevention. Higher levels of awareness were consistently linked with better preventive practices and earlier treatment-seeking behaviour. However, critical knowledge gaps persisted, particularly concerning environmental risk factors and vector control, highlighting the need for context-specific health education programmes. Community knowledge is a pivotal determinant of malaria prevention success, yet disparities persist across endemic regions. To optimise control efforts, it is essential to prioritise locally tailored, evidence-based education that addresses knowledge gaps and strengthens community engagement. Integrating local perspectives into intervention design will be essential for achieving sustainable malaria elimination.",

        "abstract": "During the asymptomatic liver stage<i>, Plasmodium</i> resides within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that protects the parasite from immune clearance while also restricting nutrient exchange with its host cell. Although it is known that <i>Plasmodium</i> must scavenge resources from its environment, the specific nutrients sequestered and the mechanisms for transporting them to the PV are poorly understood, particularly during the liver stage. In this study, we investigated the role of host lipids and discovered that sphingolipids are critical for both <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> liver stage development and invasion. Specifically, exogenous C16-ceramide enhanced parasite development and nuclear replication, while sphingomyelin in the host cell membrane was essential for parasite invasion. Live microscopy studies using NBD labeled sphingolipids further found that exogenous lipids are actively transported into the PV with sphingolipid scavenging occurring at all tested time points throughout the liver stage. This was, in part, supported by the host ceramide transporter, CERT1. CERT1 was enriched at the PV and genetic disruption significantly reduced both <i>P. berghei</i> load and ceramide trafficking into the PV. Finally, we identified proteins of the host salvage pathway as critical for the <i>Plasmodium</i> liver stage using chemical and genetic approaches. In particular, depletion of <i>CERS3</i> and <i>SPHK1</i> affected PV size and infection rate, but not invasion. Our findings enhance our understanding of host-parasite lipid interactions and may offer novel therapeutic targets to reduce disease burden.IMPORTANCE<i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent of malaria, remains a significant global health challenge, placing approximately half the world's population at risk of infection. Despite the existence of antimalarial treatments, the emergence of drug-resistant parasites highlights the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets. The <i>Plasmodium</i> liver stage represents a promising avenue for drug discovery as inhibiting parasite development would prevent both symptomatic disease and transmission to the mosquito vector. In this study, we examined the role of host sphingolipids and found that members perform distinct functions, supporting parasite invasion and/or development. We also identified several host proteins that influence <i>Plasmodium</i> liver stage viability and contribute to sphingolipid acquisition. In addition to their role in the liver stage, sphingolipids are known to be critical for the asexual and sexual blood stages, suggesting that targeting host sphingolipid metabolism could offer a novel multistage therapeutic strategy against malaria.",

        "abstract": "A novel oral combination of the long-acting antimalarials pyronaridine (PYR) and piperaquine (PQP) has potential for malaria chemoprevention. This single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the effects of PYR and PQP alone and when co-administered on Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF). Between February 14, 2022, and May 31, 2022, thirty-seven healthy black adults of African sub-Saharan origin were enrolled and randomized to PYR + PQP (n = 15), PYR + placebo (n = 8), PQP + placebo (n = 8) or double placebo (n = 6) administered once daily (fasted) for 3 days at doses approved for malaria treatment. Triplicate digitalized electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and pharmacokinetic samples were taken at matched timepoints. Concentration-response analysis was performed for QTcF changes from baseline (ΔQTcF), and the impact of PYR, PQP, and PYR + PQP administration on placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) was assessed. The final qualified and validated concentration-QTc model included a linear component for PYR and an E<sub>max</sub> component for PQP. The maximum predicted effect on ΔΔQTcF on day 3 was +4.94 msec (90% CI 0.338, 9.54) with PYR + placebo, +19.2 msec (14.6, 23.8) with PQP + placebo, and + 23.1 msec (18.5, 27.6) with PYR + PQP. As expected, PQP increased ΔΔQTcF above the regulatory threshold of concern (+10 msec), whereas PYR did not. The small additional increase in ΔΔQTcF with PYR + PQP coadministration was explained mainly by an increase in PQP C<sub>max</sub> (1.4-fold) versus monotherapy. In healthy adults, PYR + PQP coadministration does not appear to increase significantly the effect of PQP on ΔΔQTcF versus PQP administered alone. However, further studies are needed in malaria patients to confirm these findings in the target population.

        "abstract": "A study in Burkina Faso revealed ivermectin inhibits malaria transmission by killing malaria parasites and mosquitoes. However, it is unknown what effect this drug will have on the malaria transmission intensities of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To address this issue, we created a mathematical model using malaria transmission data from 41 SSA countries to evaluate the antimalarial benefits of a mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. To account for ivermectin's effect on malaria, we incorporate estimates of its ability to inhibit malaria transmission and kill mosquitoes. We consider scenarios where 0, 12.5 %, 25.0 %, and 50.0 % of the population receive ivermectin over five years and estimate malaria incidence averted, disability-adjusted life years saved, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Our findings show that an MDA of ivermectin to 12.5 %, 25 %, or 50 % of the population annually averts 248.7, 261.4, and 288.7 incidences per thousand people and saves 5.4, 5.7, and 6.3 disability-adjusted life years, respectively. These values indicate that an MDA of ivermectin would be cost-effective in 41, 18, and 6 countries, and very cost-effective in 22, 6, and 3 countries for the 12.5 %, 25 %, and 50 % scenarios. Altogether, our results indicate that ivermectin would prevent a substantial number of malaria incidences and save disability-adjusted life years in the majority of SSA. Therefore, an MDA of ivermectin would greatly aid in ongoing malaria control efforts and should be considered strongly as a complementary intervention to current malaria protocols.",

Its presentation can imitate that of malaria, which often leads to misdiagnosis. We present here a case of a 54-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who was initially diagnosed with malaria but, with further investigation, was found to have babesiosis. The patient initially presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia, prompting an extensive and meticulous workup including a peripheral blood smear and autoimmune studies. From these tests, we were able to diagnose her with a malarial infection that was treated with quinine and doxycycline, then atovaquone/proguanil following worsening infection. Despite the appropriate treatment, she developed septic shock and respiratory failure, prompting a higher level of care in the intensive care unit. With persistent parasitemia, a sample was sent to the department of health for speciation, which determined that she was infected with Babesia. Clinically, she improved after the transition to atovaquone and azithromycin, but unfortunately, she was readmitted due to persistent hemolysis and pneumonia requiring extended antibiotic therapy and supportive care. This case highlights the challenges posed by the similarities of babesia and malaria infection and emphasizes the importance of geographical location and confirmatory testing in differentiating these two infections. It raises awareness among clinicians regarding tick-borne illnesses in endemic regions, as in this case, to minimize delays in diagnosis and treatment. This case also shows how early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications of babesiosis, including septic shock, especially in the immunocompromised and elderly population.",

        "abstract": "Infectious disease research is essential for disease prevention and management within refugee camps and informal settlements. The objective of this study is to identify the characteristics of existing infectious disease research in these settings and to assess stated research challenges, ethical considerations, and studied interventions within these studies. This is a systematic review of forty primary studies focused on infectious disease research conducted among displaced populations. Included studies are published in English between 1995 and 2023. Three databases were searched, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, and this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023461567). The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. 85 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 34) researched an intervention for infectious disease prevention or control and 70 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 28) were randomized controlled trials. 75 % of studies were located in Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 15) or Pakistan (<i>n</i> = 15). 40 % of studies focused on diarrheal diseases (<i>n</i> = 16) and 28 % on malaria (<i>n</i> = 11). Common identified research challenges included population mobility, limited external validity, and low recruitment. No studies included the community in the initial study conception or investigated the research impact on the community. Community involvement was often through community health workers (45 %). Of the 18 studies that studied a resource-based intervention, 20 % explicitly noted that the intervention was unsustainable. While guidelines for conducting research in displaced settings exist, there are gaps in their utilization. We identified a disconnect between where displaced individuals reside and where research is conducted, as well as a prioritization of particular infectious diseases. Researchers identified numerous challenges in conducting research in these settings, though the community was rarely involved in the research. Context-specific considerations and community involvement are vital in research with displaced communities. Wellcome Trust (Contract Number C-010,656).",

        "title": "Evaluation of health impacts of a disability-inclusive graduation programme among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda: secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial.",
        "abstract": "People with disabilities experience significant health inequalities and barriers to healthcare access globally. While poverty alleviation interventions show promise for improving health outcomes, evidence specifically for people with disabilities remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a disability-inclusive graduation (DIG) programme on health outcomes among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda. We conducted a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial in four districts of Northern Uganda. Clusters were randomly assigned to either the DIG intervention (96 clusters) or control group (89 clusters). This analysis focused on households with people with disabilities, as identified by the Washington Group Short Set questions and verified by BRAC programme managers. Households in treatment clusters received up to 18 months DIG intervention between December 2020 and June 2022, combining asset transfers, cash support, skills training, financial inclusion activities, and disability-specific services including rehabilitation and assistive devices. The primary outcome was experience of illness/injury in the past 3 months, assessed at both first follow-up (immediately post-intervention) and second follow-up (about 16 months post-intervention), with secondary outcomes including unmet health needs, mental health status, unmet assistive product needs, and healthcare expenditure. Effects were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression or generalized estimating equations, reporting minimally-adjusted and fully-adjusted mean differences (FAMD) or odds ratios (FAOR) with 95% CIs. The trial was registered with RIDIE (RIDIE-STUDY-ID-626008898983a) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN-78592382). At baseline, 691 participants (370 intervention, 321 control) were included. The DIG intervention did not significantly impact overall illness/injury prevalence at either first follow-up (41.18% vs 45.86%, FAOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22) or second follow-up (55.65% vs 53.98%, FAOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.56). However, the intervention demonstrated a progressively strengthening effect on reducing unmet health needs, from marginal improvement immediately post-intervention (FAOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.02, p = 0.06) to significant reduction at 16 months post-intervention (FAOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Notably, the intervention produced temporal potential shifts in disease patterns, with malaria showing contrasting trends between follow-up periods. Sex-differentiated effects emerged by second follow-up, with females in the intervention group experiencing fewer injuries (FAOR for interaction 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.74, p = 0.02) but more pain-related conditions compared to males (FAOR for interaction 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.59, p = 0.04), though these subgroup findings require replication in future studies. No significant differences were observed in mental health outcomes or health expenditure. This first randomized evaluation of a disability-inclusive graduation programme demonstrates that while economic empowerment alone may not reduce overall illness prevalence among people with disabilities, it can progressively improve healthcare access over time. The temporal evolution of effects and emerging sex-differentiated impacts highlight the need for sustained support and gender-sensitive approaches in future disability-inclusive poverty reduction programmes, with additional health-specific components to achieve broader improvements in health outcomes.

        "abstract": "Mosquito-borne infections are a common cause of illness among returning travelers. Frontline healthcare providers should maintain a high degree of suspicion for these infections when evaluating ill returning travelers. This narrative review provides an overview of the most common mosquito-borne infections in travelers. We conducted a search of the medical literature for updates in the past 5 y. We reviewed resources of the US Centers for Disease Control (Yellow Book, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices), and US Food and Drug Administration. Arboviral infections and malaria are the most frequently diagnosed mosquito-borne infections in returning travelers. Among the mosquito-borne arboviral infections, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis are all vaccine preventable. Dengue fever, although the most common arboviral infection worldwide, does not yet have a vaccine approved for use in US travelers. The incidence of Zika virus infection has decreased substantially in recent years, including a reduced frequency of infections reported in travelers. The risk of mosquito-borne illnesses can be reduced by behavioral changes and use of insect repellent, screens, netting, and insecticide-impregnated clothing. Malaria can be further prevented through the appropriate use of chemoprophylaxis.",

        "abstract": "In 2023 malaria claimed ≈600000 lives, with 90% of those deaths attributed to the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. This resurgence in mortality emphasizes the necessity of adopting alternative models to accelerate therapeutic development. The Malaria-on-a-Chip model used here incorporated human liver, spleen, and endothelium with P. falciparum-infected blood, and was maintained for 7 days using serum-free medium. This model sustained all stages of the intraerythrocytic life cycle and allowed for organ-organ interaction, providing advantageous preclinical insight into malaria pathophysiology. Chloroquine, lumefantrine, or artesunate were delivered as monotherapies to 3D7 or W2-infected systems. Dose-dependent parasite clearance was observed in both strains for all compounds. Recrudescence occurred in the 3D7-infected model following treatment with chloroquine or lumefantrine, but not artesunate. In W2-infected systems, chloroquine and lumefantrine treatment resulted in parasitemia stabilization by day 7, while artesunate further reduced parasitemia. Population dynamics modeling of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) outcomes were utilized to predict human in vivo parameters for efficacy and off-target toxicity using in vitro results.",

        "title": "Combating Drug-Resistant Protozoal Infections: A Review of Emerging Therapeutics.",
        "abstract": "Protozoal infections remain a significant global health burden despite significant progress in understanding these infections in recent years due to the continuing emergence of multidrug resistance among protozoal parasites. This review focuses on recent innovations in protozoal disease treatment aimed at combating this growing challenge of drug resistance. The escalating prevalence of multidrug resistance among protozoal parasites, especially those responsible for widespread diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis, is rapidly emerging as a grave threat to human health worldwide. This resistance undermines the efficacy of existing treatments, making it imperative to develop and explore novel therapeutic approaches. Diverse strategies, including the concept of hybrid drugs, the development of advanced analogs of existing drugs, and drug repurposing, have been employed to counter drug resistance by outmaneuvering the evolution of resistant parasites and restoring the effectiveness of treatments. In this review, we delve into the significant findings reported between 2020 and 2024, with the aim of providing an overview of the state of protozoal disease treatment, highlighting the progress made, exploring promising avenues for tackling these devastating diseases, and offering insights into future directions for overcoming the persistent challenge of drug resistance. Given that the emergence of drug resistance calls for a multifaceted approach to address protozoal infections, long-term success depends on interdisciplinary research collaborations, equitable access to treatment, and appropriate drug resistance surveillance, in addition to the advancement of research and the development of therapeutic strategies described in this review.",
