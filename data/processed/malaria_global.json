        "abstract": "Insecticide resistance in disease-transmitting arthropods of agricultural, veterinary, and public health significance poses a significant threat to vector control programs worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that blood-feeding arthropod vectors experience high mortality when ingesting blood containing inhibitors of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), the second enzyme in tyrosine metabolism. This study investigated the mosquitocidal efficacy of HPPD inhibitors from the β-triketone class of herbicides against both susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of three major disease vector species, including mosquitoes that transmit historical diseases such as malaria, reemerging infections such as dengue and Zika, and emerging viral threats such as Oropouche and Usutu viruses. Four HPPD inhibitors (nitisinone, mesotrione, sulcotrione, and tembotrione) were screened using glass plate tarsal bioassays at 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> against bloodfed Anopheles gambiae s.s. Kisumu. Nitisinone was selected for evaluation against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu, An. gambiae s.l. Tiassalé 13, An. coluzzii VK7 2014, Culex quinquefasciatus Muhezha, and Aedes aegypti New Orleans. Mosquitocidal activity was assessed using glass plate tarsal contact bioassays, topical application assays (0.0001% to 1% w/v), and modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassays (0-30 μg per bottle). Female mosquitoes aged 3-5 days were bloodfed within 1 h before exposure. Mortality was recorded at 30 min and 24, 48, and 72 h post-exposure under controlled conditions. A total of 3 biological replicates of 30 mosquitoes per treatment were used. Only nitisinone, and not mesotrione, sulcotrione, or tembotrione, exhibited significant mosquitocidal activity when bloodfed mosquitoes were exposed to treated surfaces. No significant differences in susceptibility to nitisinone were observed between insecticide-susceptible An. gambiae and strains harboring multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms. The compound demonstrated consistent efficacy across all three mosquito species tested, indicating broad-spectrum activity against major disease vectors. This study demonstrates that nitisinone exhibits a novel mode of action distinct from current Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) classifications by specifically targeting blood digestion processes. Its efficacy against resistant strains and potential for integration into existing vector control interventions, such as treated bednets and indoor residual spraying, highlight nitisinone as a promising candidate for expanding strategies against malaria, dengue, Zika, and other emerging viral diseases.",

        "abstract": "Information on morbidity and health-seeking behavior beyond early childhood is crucial for planning evidence-based interventions. Currently, data is limited to children under five. This study introduces a method for estimating morbidity and health-seeking behavior in older children and adolescents (5-19 years) using women's birth histories from a household survey in northwestern Tanzania, comparing it with data on children under five. We conducted a household survey among women 15-49 years as part of the Magu Health and Demographic Surveillance from October 2020 to November 2021, including 16,896 children aged 0-19 living with their mothers. The study outcomes were the prevalence of reported illness in the last four weeks and health-seeking behavior, defined as visiting a health facility for recent illness. Modified Poisson regression analysis was performed, accounting for mothers as clusters and adjusting for child and mother characteristics. We compared the prevalence of recent illness and health-seeking behavior among older children and adolescents (5-19 years) with children under five within the same population. Morbidity presented as the prevalence of any illness decreased with age, from 26.1% in children under-five to 10.4% among adolescents aged 15-19. Health seeking behavior also decreased with age, from 48.2% in children under-five to nearly 30% among adolescents aged 15-19. Types of illnesses reported were similar across age groups, with Fever/Malaria accounting more than two-thirds, followed by respiratory tract illnesses. Higher illness prevalence was noted in rural areas for both age groups. Health seeking behavior was higher among mothers with secondary education and above for both children under-fives (APR:1.22;95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and 5-19-year-olds (APR: 1.31; 95% CI:1.01, 1.70). Additionally, those with health insurance also reported higher health seeking behavior (APR: 1.38; 95% CI:1.07, 1.78), while lower for children in rural households (APR: 0.72; 95% CI:0.61, 0.83), for 5-19-year-olds. Our findings on morbidity and health-seeking behavior demonstrate the importance of extending health monitoring beyond early childhood. The inequalities identified point to gaps in programming and health service delivery that require attention.",

        "abstract": "Antimalarials are central to Zambia's strategies for malaria control and elimination. Antimalarial drug resistance poses a significant threat to the effectiveness of artemisinin-based combination therapies and preventive strategies such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine chemoprevention in pregnant women. In this genomic surveillance study, dried blood spots and epidemiological data were collected from confirmed Plasmodium falciparum cases at 61 health facilities across all 10 Zambian provinces from March to July 2023. A total of 2,486 samples were genotyped by using multiplexed amplicon sequencing to identify mutations in 12 genes associated with resistance to seven antimalarial drugs. Several mutations potentially associated with artemisinin partial resistance were identified, including the validated kelch 13 (k13) P574L marker (0.66% adjusted national prevalence) and the candidate k13 P441L marker (1.39%). The distribution of mutations was heterogeneous, with many health facilities reporting resistance markers in more than 5% of infections, and in some instances, up to 46% of infections. The multidrug resistance protein 1 N86 genotype, which is associated with decreased lumefantrine susceptibility, was found in all samples. Very high levels of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance markers were observed, including dihydropteroate synthetase K540E (93.26%). The variable prevalence of resistance markers underscores the need for routine molecular surveillance to detect emergent resistance and guide malaria control strategies. These results also call for studies designed to help us understand the clinical implications of these mutations and ensure the continued efficacy of antimalarial interventions in Zambia.",

        "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major concern in drug safety, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) provides valuable ADR data. However, analyzing FAERS data is complex and requires bioinformatics expertise. Despite the vast amount of ADR data available, there is a lack of user-friendly tools that enable efficient visualization and comparison of ADRs for researchers and health care professionals. This study aimed to develop VisDrugs, a web-based platform that simplifies ADR visualization and comparison using FAERS data. The platform was designed to assist researchers and clinicians in assessing drug safety through interactive and interpretable graphical representations of ADR patterns. FAERS data were extracted in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format, covering the period from Q3 (third quarter) 2014 to Q3 2024. About 2,700,000 reports from health care professionals, where only a single drug was implicated, were aggregated and processed using R for statistical analysis and visualization. The results are presented on a web-based platform for web-based analysis. The platform generates pie charts to visualize the most frequently reported ADRs, which are represented and analyzed using preferred terms based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and forest plots illustrating reporting odds ratios (RORs) for these ADRs. Using Paxlovid (COVID-19 treatment) and hydroxychloroquine (anti-malaria drug) as case studies, we benchmarked VisDrugs using reports for Paxlovid (n=16,708) and hydroxychloroquine (n=6150). Paxlovid was most frequently associated with \"COVID-19\" (ROR=47.26, 95% CI 45.22-49.40) and \"dysgeusia\" (ROR=59.65, 95% CI 55.56-64.03). Hydroxychloroquine showed strong associations with \"retinal toxicity\" (ROR=738.48, 95% CI 583.45-934.71), \"retinopathy\" (ROR=412.27, 95% CI 344.73-493.03), and \"cardiotoxicity\" (ROR=48.36, 95% CI 38.86-60.19). In subgroup analyses, female patients had significantly higher risks of retinopathy (3.24-fold) and cardiomyopathy (13.82-fold) compared to male patients, while patients aged >50 years had higher risks of retinopathy (4.20-fold) and cardiomyopathy (7.84-fold) compared to those ≤50 years. All differences were statistically significant (z test, P<.01). The majority of findings align with existing research, thereby validating the platform's utility. Clinical personnel have evaluated and refined the platform based on user feedback, confirming its efficacy in visualizing complex ADR data and identifying adverse effects across various drug subgroups. VisDrugs is a valuable tool for ADR analysis, offering an intuitive interface for exploring FAERS data. By visualizing and comparing ADRs, it helps researchers and health care providers assess drug safety efficiently. The platform's demographic analysis features add insights into ADR variations by age and gender, supporting drug safety research. In the future, the website will include more subgroup or condition filtering options, offering personalized ADR analysis and comparison features to meet the diverse research needs of users.",

        "title": "Comparative analysis of Egypt's malaria elimination strategies and implementation science: Pathways to achieve malaria-free status for other African countries.",
        "abstract": "Malaria elimination is a critical public health goal, particularly in Africa, where the disease disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Egypt's success in achieving World Health Organization (WHO) malaria-free certification on October 20, 2024, through an evidence-based malaria elimination program, offers a valuable model for replication. Our study is identified as an implementation study, evaluating the evidence-based interventions deployed, the implementation strategy tested, and its outcomes to provide insights for scaling similar programs across Africa. A RE-AIM-informed lens was applied to better articulate how contextual factors, intervention reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance influenced observed outcomes. We adopted a retrospective implementation science approach to analyze Egypt's malaria elimination program. The implementation strategy focused on high-priority malaria-endemic regions, targeting vulnerable groups such as children under five and pregnant women. Interventions included vector control measures, such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), antimalarial treatment protocols, and public health education campaigns. Key implementation strategies included workforce training, multilevel stakeholder engagement, integrated data-driven decision-making, and community mobilization. Our study evaluated key implementation outcomes, including fidelity, feasibility, acceptability (measured using a custom-designed tool assessing stakeholder and community perceptions of the interventions), and adaptability alongside health outcomes such as incidence reduction, treatment coverage, and community awareness. Economic evaluations and process analyses provided additional insights into cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. The implementation strategy targeted malaria-endemic regions, achieving a 92% recruitment rate, focusing on vulnerable groups such as children under five (37%) and pregnant women (12%). 78% of the recipient population adhered to preventive measures like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). The program reduced malaria incidence by 96% over 15 years and achieved a 94% reduction in Anopheles mosquito density. Active surveillance led to the detection of 98% of cases within 48 hours of symptom onset, while treatment coverage reached 91%. Community awareness of malaria prevention increased to 84% by the program's conclusion. Economic evaluations revealed a cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted of $24, with an estimated $1.5 billion saved in healthcare costs and productivity losses over 15 years. Sub-group analyses highlighted higher adherence rates in urban areas (89%) compared to rural areas (73%) and significant reductions in malaria-related complications among pregnant women (78%). Implementation outcomes included high fidelity (93%) to planned strategies, high feasibility across urban and rural contexts, and successful adaptability to emerging challenges such as insecticide resistance and funding fluctuations. Routine monitoring systems, continuous feedback loops, and responsive adaptation mechanisms were central to achieving these outcomes. Acceptability scores averaged 87% across stakeholders, reflecting strong alignment with community values, trust in health authorities, and perceived relevance of interventions. Egypt's malaria elimination strategies exemplify the effective integration of implementation science into public health programs. Key success factors included community engagement, robust surveillance systems, and cost-effective resource allocation. The intentional use of implementation strategies and documented outcomes demonstrate alignment with the RE-AIM framework, reinforcing the program's relevance for broader application. Future efforts should emphasize tailored interventions, capacity building, transparent assessment of acceptability, and sustainable funding mechanisms to replicate Egypt's success.",

        "abstract": "Molecular hybridization and metal incorporation are widely employed strategies for drug development aimed at enhancing pharmacological efficacy while mitigating the emergence of drug resistance. The effectiveness of these approaches is supported by numerous studies demonstrating their success against a range of diseases. Despite the deployment of malaria vaccines, effective treatment remains hindered by the persistent emergence of drug-resistant <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> strains, contributing to an alarming global disease burden. Inspired by the antimalarial candidate ferroquine, this study focused on the design and synthesis of ferrocenyl-based quinoline-benzimidazole molecular hybrids. The hybrids were evaluated for their in vitro blood-stage antiplasmodial activity against drug-sensitive NF54 and multidrug-resistant K1 <i>P. falciparum</i> strains, exhibiting potent submicromolar activity. Notably, incorporating an <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethylaminomethyl side chain significantly enhanced activity against both strains. Further assays revealed a compound with multistage antiplasmodial activity, targeting both immature and mature gametocytes. Mechanistic studies implicated the inhibition of hemozoin formation as a key mode of action, supported by in vitro cellular heme fractionation analysis. Additionally, fluorescence assays indicated the generation of reactive oxygen species under oxidative conditions, suggesting a complementary pathway contributing to the compounds' antiplasmodial activity. These findings highlight the potential of ferrocenyl-based molecular hybrids as promising candidates in antiplasmodial drug development.",

Clinical evaluation revealed a firm, mobile, non-tender suprapubic mass, while imaging studies identified a large abdominopelvic mass with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Surgical exploration confirmed a sigmoid colon tumor, necessitating resection and anastomosis. Histopathological analysis revealed viable Schistosoma ova with granulomatous inflammation, confirming colonic schistosomiasis.

        "abstract": "The recent emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites harbouring kelch 13 mutations associated with artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) in sub-Saharan Africa is a major concern. Regular molecular epidemiological surveys are recommended to monitor the level of mutant parasites associated with drug resistance. To analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P. falciparum genes associated with resistance to antimalarial drugs in blood samples collected from malaria patients prior to treatment in Busia County, Western Kenya, using a highly multiplexed deep amplicon sequencing protocol. Parasite DNA was extracted from dried blood spots (DBS) collected from patients attending health facilities along the Kenya-Uganda border, in Busia County. A highly multiplexed deep amplicon sequencing protocol was applied to analyze SNPs in genes associated with antimalarial drugs resistance. Out of 118 analysed samples, Pfkelch13 mutations were identified in 6 (5.1%) samples. All the six samples harboured A578S, one of the most frequently detected Pfkelch13 mutations in Africa, which does not confer ART-R. The data also indicated that 11% (13) of the samples had mutant Pfcrt alleles, with 62% harbouring the triple mutant haplotype, CVIET. In contrast, 98% of the samples had dhfr mutations at positions N51I, C59R, or S108N alleles. All the samples carried mutations in the dhps gene with a high prevalence of the single A437G mutation (84%) and a lower frequency of double or triple mutations. Further analysis revealed absence of deletions in the Pfhrp2, with no mutations at Pfmdr1 codons 86 or 1246, both of which are associated with chloroquine resistance. These findings show absence of validated Pfkelch13 markers associated with ART-R in Busia County, Western Kenya. Although chloroquine-sensitive (wild-type) parasites are widely circulating, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-sensitive parasites remain rare. Continued large scale genomic surveillance studies are essential to detect emerging resistance and guide malaria treatment strategies in the region.",

        "abstract": "Vaccines that target the pre-erythrocytic stage of the malaria lifecycle have the potential to provide sterilizing immunity but must elicit sustained, high-titer antibody responses to completely prevent infection. Most pre-erythrocytic vaccines target circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major surface antigen on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. Antibodies targeting distinct epitopes within the central repeat region of CSP have the potential to provide protection from infection, but we have focused on developing vaccines that target a highly vulnerable CSP epitope that is targeted by the potent monoclonal antibody L9. In a previous study, we produced a pre-erythrocytic vaccine displaying a synthetic peptide representing the L9 epitope on Qβ bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs). This vaccine elicited strong anti-CSP antibody responses that protected mice from malaria challenge. Here, we asked whether the structural context of the L9 epitope influences the quality of antibody responses. We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Qβ L9 VLPs to recombinant VLPs that display the L9 peptide in a structure that is hypothesized to mimic its native conformation. Recombinant MS2 bacteriophage VLPs displaying various lengths of the L9 epitope were produced and immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in mice. Our results demonstrate that MS2 L9 VLPs, particularly those displaying longer L9 peptides and in combination with a potent novel adjuvant, elicit strong and durable antibody responses that lower malaria liver burden and prevent infection. We also compared the efficacy of L9-targeted vaccines to the licensed vaccine, RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> (Mosquirix™, GSK). Immunization with Qβ L9 VLPs, MS2 L9 VLPs, and RTS,S/AS01<sub>E</sub> provided significant protection from liver-stage infection in a mouse model. Interestingly, immunization with a combination vaccine consisting of MS2 L9 and Qβ L9 VLPs, each presenting the L9 epitope in a distinct structural context, elicited sterilizing immunity in the highest percentage of mice.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is a major public health problem, with nearly half of the world's population at risk. In Ethiopia, despite prevention efforts, malaria continues to be a significant issue, particularly in the post-war Tigray region. Insecticide-treated net (ITN) is a key preventive tool, but data on its distribution and usage in this region are limited. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from January to February 2024 across 24 randomly selected districts, involving 2,338 households. Data were collected using Open Data Kit and analyzed with SPSS version 21, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. The findings revealed that 58.1% (95% CI 56.1-59.9) of households owned at least one ITN, and 61.6% (95% CI 59.1-64.2) reported using it the previous night. Multivariable logistic regression identified that being single was associated with lower ITN use (AOR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.7), while households with 3-4 members (AOR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.6) and those with sufficient ITNs (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8) had higher usage rates. These findings highlight the need for tailored malaria prevention strategies, including sustained ITN distribution, ongoing health education, and targeted interventions to improve ITN utilization, to contribute to malaria elimination and achieve universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "Liver disease is one of leading causes of death worldwide. However, current liver models have limited research progress. Therefore, models that accurately reflect the physiological functions of the human liver are urgently needed in both clinical and laboratory research. Over the past decade, liver organoids have emerged as valuable research tools offering significant breakthroughs and demonstrating great promise as advanced liver models. Liver organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, have shown significant potential for modeling liver diseases and drug responses. These miniature three-dimensional (3D) structures replicate the complexity of the liver and offer a platform for studying liver development and disease progression. The ability to create personalized organoids from patient-derived cells paves the way for precision medicine and drug screening. Owing to the pluripotency of PSCs, PSC-derived liver organoids (PSC-LOs) closely mimic the true structure of the liver and offer a wide range of applications. With advances in research, bioengineered liver organoids have the potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and the understanding of liver pathophysiology. This review provides an overview of liver organoid development and discusses their applications in liver regeneration, disease modeling, drug screening, toxicity assessment, organ transplantation, and regenerative medicine. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future development directions of PSC-LOs.",

This study evaluated the antiplasmodial potential of <i>Ziziphus mauritiana</i> Lam. (Rhamnaceae) roots through an integrated phytochemical and pharmacological approach. The ethanol extract, along with its derived fractions, demonstrated potent in vitro activity against the <i>chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum</i> strain 3D7 (<i>Pf</i>3D7), with the ethyl acetate-soluble (IC<sub>50</sub> = 11.35 µg/mL) and alkaloid-rich (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.75 µg/mL) fractions showing particularly strong inhibition. UHPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS-based molecular networking enabled the identification of thirty-two secondary metabolites (<b>1</b>-<b>32</b>), comprising twenty-five cyclopeptide alkaloids (CPAs), five of which had not yet been described (<b>11</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>), and seven known triterpenoids.

Quantitative analysis revealed exceptionally high concentrations of key bioactive constituents, notably zizyberenalic acid (24.3 mg/g) in the root extracts. These findings provide robust scientific validation for the traditional use of Z. mauritiana in malaria treatment while identifying specific cyclopeptide alkaloids and triterpenoids as valuable scaffolds for antimalarial drug development.

        "abstract": "Malaria is a parasitic infectious disease that is endemic in many tropical countries. Even though several effective antimalarial agents have been implemented, treatment failure still occurs, and malaria continues to cause neurological complications and death, particularly in severe or drug-resistant cases. Hence, novel therapeutic agents with distinct mechanisms of action, as well as alternative chemical compounds that can overcome resistance, are still needed to improve malaria therapy. This study aimed to investigate the antimalarial activities of <i>Brucea javanica</i>, a tropical plant extracts against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, the major species associated with severe malaria. In this study, malaria parasites were treated with plant extracts using single and co-incubation methods, along with artesunate and chloroquine, and their inhibitory effect on parasite development was determined by microscopy. The results show that all tested doses of the extracts that effectively inhibited malaria parasites did not cause hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs). The root extract (RE) and fruit extract (FE) inhibited parasite growth at IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.41 ± 1.14 µg/mL and 0.26 ± 1.15 µg/mL, respectively. These plant extracts significantly interrupted malaria development at the ring stage, as presented by a reduction in the conversion rate to trophozoites and schizonts. The defective parasites treated with plant extracts were characterized by nuclear clumping, leading to pyknotic cell death. Moreover, RE and FW extracts elicited an additive effect with artesunate and chloroquine, significantly reducing IC<sub>90</sub> levels for the inhibition of parasite development. In conclusion, <i>B. javanica</i> extracts inhibited the asexual blood-stage development of malaria parasites. They distinctively show the additive effects of ATS and CRQ, elucidating their potential for further studies on novel formulas of antimalarial drug regimens.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant public health concern in Pakistan due to its subtropical climate and diverse array of vectors, which contribute to periodic outbreaks and challenges in disease control. Recent outbreaks-particularly in 2022-along with the rising incidence of Plasmodium falciparum and growing resistance of Anopheles mosquito vector to existing control methods, highlight a critical gap in understanding the effectiveness of current malaria vector control strategies. This article is a scoping review of published literature on malaria prevention methods with a focus on World Health Organization (WHO) outlined interventions in the endemic region of the lower middle-income country, Pakistan. Relevant articles published in all languages before September 2023 were reviewed. All the articles were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase and Google Scholar. Four independent reviewers performed the selection and characterization of articles based on defined inclusion criteria. The data collected were extracted and analyzed by province, vector, and vector control methods according to WHO recommendations. A total of 46 articles reporting surveillance findings on vector control methods in Pakistan were found. Based on WHO recommendations, the reported strategies included insecticide-treated nets (ITN) (29.79%), indoor residual spraying (IRS) (29.79%), spatial spraying (12.77%), spatial/airborne repellents (4.26%), larval source management (4.26%) and house modifications (4.26%). In contrast to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which employs ITN (55%) as the primary vector control method, Punjab was found to use IRS as the main method of vector control (50%). This review highlights the current strategies for controlling malaria vectors and the strategies used in the past for outbreaks in Pakistan. This review identifies a notable increase in the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) over time and highlights differences in the implementation of vector control strategies across provinces in Pakistan. Current practices and their contrast to WHO guidelines are illustrated. It helps us understand the need for improved research and development with precise reporting. These findings can serve as a reference for guiding policy decisions and improving malaria control efforts in endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Test-negative design (TND) studies are increasingly common in evaluating vaccine effectiveness (VE) for various infectious diseases. TND studies are susceptible to bias due to disease outcome misclassification caused by imperfect test sensitivity and specificity. Several bias correction methods have been proposed. However, sample size or power considerations for TND studies incorporating bias correction for such misclassification have not yet been investigated. We used Monte Carlo simulations to assess how bias correction affects the statistical power and sample size for VE estimation in TND studies. Simulations were conducted under varying levels of diagnostic test sensitivities (60%, 80%, and 95%). Bias correction was implemented using the multiple over-imputation method, which accounts for test misclassification through a parametric bootstrapping approach. Using a malaria vaccine as an example, we defined six vaccination status categories based on the time since receipt of the third or fourth vaccine dose. In the simulated target population, vaccination coverage was assumed to be low (< 10%) except for the group vaccinated more than 12 months after dose 4. We assumed relatively low VE (< 50%) against clinical malaria cases and a 30% malaria positivity rate among unvaccinated individuals presenting with malaria-related symptoms. Statistical power to detect VE was estimated for each vaccination status, both with and without bias correction. Estimated VEs based on observed data were consistently underestimated across all vaccination status groups due to diagnostic misclassification. In contrast, bias-corrected estimates were approximately unbiased but displayed wider confidence intervals, with their precision decreasing at lower test sensitivities. Statistical power to detect VE declined substantially when diagnostic test sensitivity was low. For instance, at 80% sensitivity, only three vaccination status groups reached 80% power with a sample size of 10,000, whereas the same power was achieved with just 6,000 individuals under a perfect test. Bias due to imperfect diagnostic testing can substantially reduce the power of TND studies. Power calculations should account for outcome misclassification and potential correction methods. Failure to do so may lead to underpowered studies and misleading VE estimates.",

        "abstract": "Over-reliance on pyrethroid insecticides in insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has imposed significant selection pressure for the evolution of insecticide resistance among major malaria vector species. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the country with the second highest malaria burden globally, pyrethroid resistance is pervasive, but there is a paucity of information regarding the molecular mechanisms driving resistance. A clear understanding of the specificity of resistance mechanisms to individual insecticides and the likelihood of selecting for cross-resistance mechanisms is crucial for the development of new vector control tools. Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations from eight study sites across the DRC were phenotyped for resistance to alpha-cypermethrin, deltamethrin and permethrin, with and without pre-exposure to the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), followed by multiplex amplicon sequencing. Phenotypic pyrethroid resistance and loss of PBO synergy was confirmed in all sites across the DRC. In An. gambiae s.s. four non-synonymous SNPs which have been previously associated with insecticide resistance were detected: gste2-L119V, vgsc-L995F, vgsc-L995S and rdl-A296G, while three were novel: gste2-T154S, ace1-N246T and ace1-P265L. Nationwide geographical trends in insecticide resistance mutation distribution, prevalence and selection were evident. In the West, near fixation of vgsc-L995F and almost complete absence of vgsc-L995S was observed, alongside low-moderate frequencies of rdl-A296G and gste2-L119V. Further East, the converse was apparent. Gste2-L119V was significantly associated with resistance to deltamethrin following PBO-pre-exposure, warranting functional validation to determine its putative role in reduced PBO synergy. Furthermore, gste2-T154S was implicated in deltamethrin and permethrin resistance but susceptibility to alpha-cypermethrin after PBO pre-exposure. Study findings comprise the most comprehensive overview of the prevalence of genetic markers of Anopheles insecticide resistance across the DRC and provide an important baseline for improved malaria vector control and the design of proactive insecticide resistance management strategies. Given the significant scale up in PBO-ITNs, with more than 58% of all ITNs delivered to sub-Saharan Africa in 2023 containing PBO, there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular markers to monitor changes in PBO synergy, which may be predicative of loss of intervention operational efficacy.",

Conventional diagnostic methods are often prone to human error and limited by data insufficiency, impacting their reliability. This paper introduces MalNet-DAF (Malaria Network with Dual-Attentive Fusion), a novel deep-learning model designed to improve the diagnosis and classification of malaria-infected cells. The proposed architecture integrates stacked Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies. To enhance interpretability and performance, MalNet-DAF incorporates dynamic attention mechanisms. The Spatial Attention Module (SAM) highlights critical disease-affected regions by refining CNN-extracted features, while the Temporal Attention Module (TAM), applied after Bi-LSTM processing, emphasizes informative time steps by suppressing irrelevant signals. The fused spatial and temporal feature vectors are processed through Dense Layers with ReLU activation and Dropout regularization. The model is trained and validated using a publicly available malaria dataset from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Experimental results show that MalNet-DAF achieves a classification accuracy of 99.24%, outperforming traditional baseline models. These findings demonstrate the potential of dynamic attention-driven deep learning (DL) in supporting real-time clinical decision-making and addressing challenges in healthcare diagnostics.",

The combination of CM and Qu also caused significant modulation of serum levels of liver and kidney markers in malaria-infected mice. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The results of this survey indicate that the combination therapy of CM with Qu demonstrates significant effectiveness in treating malaria-infected mice by regulating oxidative stress, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, and modulating inflammatory responses. However, to further validate the therapeutic potential of this compound, it is essential to conduct clinical trials that evaluate both its toxicity and therapeutic efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and treatment-resistant subtype of breast cancer (BC) that is a leading global malignancy. A novel drug candidate, 3-(2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-oxoethylidene)indolin-2-one (RAJI), was synthesized using piperidine, isatin, and 3,4-dimethoxy acetophenones. Although these components have established roles in various drug syntheses and malaria treatment, their anti-cancer potential remains underexplored. Hence, the RAJI was designed to bridge this gap. The cytotoxic effects of RAJI on TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) were evaluated using MTT assay, cell migration assay, apoptosis analysis (Annexin V), mitochondrial membrane potential tests, qRT-PCR, and tumor-induced mouse model evaluation. RAJI exhibited cytotoxicity against TNBC cells, with IC50 values of 20 and 25 µg/mL for MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. It reduced cell migration and induced apoptosis, as evident from the cell populations in the early and late apoptotic stages. Mitochondrial membrane potential assays revealed mitochondrial depolarization and cellular stress. Gene expression analysis via RT-PCR revealed that RAJI significantly downregulated Akt, PTEN, mTOR (AKT/PI3K signaling), Cyclin D1, indicating the induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via modulation of apoptotic genes such as Bax and Bcl-2. In the in In-vivo analysis, RAJI significantly reduced tumor volume in BALB/c athymic nude mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 cells over four weeks, with no notable toxicity. RAJI demonstrated potent anticancer activity, induced apoptosis, and reduced TNBC tumor progression by altering the Akt/PI3K pathway, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for breast cancer treatment.",

        "title": "Balancing sensitivity and specificity: investigating the effect of age delay and critical illness events on the number of threshold alarms.",
        "abstract": "In critical care settings, continuous vital sign monitoring is crucial to ensure patient safety and timely intervention. While traditional patient monitor threshold alarm systems have been life-saving, they often generate numerous non-actionable alarms, which can overwhelm caregivers and lead to ineffective patient monitoring. We still have these numerous false alarms because we have a gap in understanding the importance of age-specific threshold settings, delay, and critical illness events inclusion in understanding the specificity and sensitivity of the threshold alarms. This study investigated the effect of age-specific thresholds, delay, and critical illness events on the number of threshold alarms to balance their specificity and sensitivity. Secondary data from 772 pediatric patients was extracted from the IMPALA Project conducted in the High Dependency Unit (HDU) at Queen Elizabeth and Zomba Central Hospitals in Malawi. Threshold crossing detector algorithms and age-defining functions were used to generate alarms and impute age-specific thresholds. Z-test was used to determine differences between normal threshold alarms and age-specific threshold alarms. Threshold alarms were categorized into different delays based on their durations to identify an adaptive delay that would minimize the threshold alarms to manageable alarms. Time series analysis was leveraged to extract and compare threshold alarms around patients with and without critical illness events per hour. Additionally, we investigated the variability of threshold alarms during the hour time windows before and after each critical illness event, considering factors such as delay and age. A multi-regression model was used to determine the effects of critical illness events on the number of threshold alarms, with a significance level set at p < 0.05, indicating statistical significance. The age-specific threshold had a positive influence on the threshold alarms by reducing the total number of threshold alarms [31.14% for ECGHR, 17.54% ECGRR and 54.79% for SPO2]. There was a greater significant difference between normal and age-specific threshold alarms (p < 0.00001). A 15-s delay reduced the total number of threshold alarms by 45%. We had more threshold alarms being generated 1 h before critical illness events occurrence, and applying delay and age-specific threshold had more impact on threshold alarms 3 h after the occurrence of critical illness events [Respiratory support (Total threshold alarms (232), 15 s delay (77), 15 s and age-specific threshold (17)] and most threshold alarms 1 h before critical illness events had longer durations. Critical illness [Convulsion (p < 0.0001), Malaria treatment (p < 0.0001), Death (p = 0.053), Respiratory support (p = 0.046), and Sepsis (p = 0.051)] had positive effects on the threshold alarm. There was a drop and increase in the vital sign values during the occurrence of these critical illness events [Bronchodilator support (β =  - 0.0030), Death (β =  - 0.0374), Malaria treatment (β =  - 0.0056), and Inotropic support (β =  - 0.0063)] indicating that more threshold alarms were produced during the occurrence of these critical illness events. Age-specific threshold, delay, and critical illness events can be used to strike a balance between the sensitivity and specificity of threshold alarms. In this way, we can reduce the number of non-actionable (false alarms) alarms and increase the number of actionable alarms around critical illness events. It is necessary to look into critical illness event alarm forecasting further.",

Elttondoub village faces various health problems related to endemic and chronic diseases, contaminated water sources, and poor healthcare accessibility. The present study aims to assess health issues and accessibility in Elttondoub village, reported by community leaders, and to draw effective strategies to improve healthcare accessibility and promote community involvement in healthcare. This community-based qualitative study involved 5 focus group discussions with community leaders and residents in Elttondoub villages, Sudan. The sample was purposive and volunteer-based, and consisted of teachers, medical workers, religious leaders, and the local people's committee. Data was collected through voice recordings and field notes, which were transcribed and analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti9. The interviews were based on the World Health Organization community health needs assessment and were translated into Arabic. A total of 23 community leaders were interviewed. There were several health problems in Elttondoub village, including malaria, chronic diseases, and water contamination. Healthcare accessibility was limited due to transportation, financial, and political issues. Also, there is a shortage of medical professionals. Residents showed good levels of health knowledge regarding their common endemic diseases. The main health challenges were the use of a first aid kit and when to seek medical advice. Medical professionals and religious leaders were the most trusted sources of health education, as the residents headed to them when they sought medical advice. Community solutions suggested included preventive measures, improving healthcare infrastructure, and organizing health education programs. The construction of roads and bridges over creeks and the completion of the landfill project were suggested as feasible ways to improve healthcare accessibility. The study emphasizes the need for health education programs by organizing health training sessions and workshops for the community. Community involvement and engaging with the government to address health issues and establish an appropriate environment for medical personnel to solve the shortage, and assist in educating residents about their health. Healthcare accessibility improvement by constructing roads and bridges will facilitate transportation.",

        "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma associated with poor prognoses. The standard of care for non-resectable tumors consists of surgical excision followed by radiation and chemotherapy. MPNSTs are most common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 but can also occur sporadically. Regardless of origin, MPNSTs most often rely on signaling pathways that increase basal oxidative stress. This provides the basis for developing therapeutics with mechanisms that can potentiate oxidative stress to selectively eradicate tumor cells at doses that are tolerable for normal cells. Artemisinin derivatives are a mainstay of malaria therapy worldwide, with a well-established safety profile. Artemisinin's antimalarial effects are due to an endoperoxide bridge in its chemical structure that induces oxidative stress. We found that artesunate (ARS) and metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) are selectively cytotoxic to MPNST cells relative to normal Schwann cells with the endoperoxide bridge required for activity. Mechanistically, DHA induced oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and DHA-mediated cytotoxicity could be prevented with co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. Furthermore, we found that DHA was able to selectively remove MPNST from co-culture with normal Schwann cells. These data supports the further development of artemisinins for the clinical management of MPNST.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have significantly reduced the malaria burden in recent decades, and this malaria prevalence reduction has been achieved through the upgrading of pyrethroid long-lasting insecticidal nets. However, this reduction has stalled due to many factors, including rapidly developing pyrethroid resistance. <b>Method:</b> The protocol was registered in PROSPERO, and we used Cochrane methodology to assess bias and evidence quality. Three reviewers extracted data from individual studies, and a meta-analysis was performed using Excel and STATA version 17, expressing the data as a risk ratio. <b>Result</b>: A study involving 21,916 households from 11 randomized controlled trials showed that the chlorfenapyr treatment group had a 10% reduction in malaria infection risk, with a pooled overall prevalence of 25.96 per 100 children in the chlorfenapyr group and 32.38 per 100 children in the piperonyl butoxide group, compared to 41.60 per 100 children in the control (pyrethroid-only) group. This meta-analysis determined that the entomological outcomes of effectiveness and efficacy showed that these treatments effectively reduced vector density per household per night and mean inoculation rates, with a 23% reduction in chlorfenapyr, a 7% reduction in pyrethroid-only treatments, and a 12% reduction in piperonyl-butoxide-treated groups. This study shows that chlorfenapyr (CFP) and pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs are highly effective and more efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, and anemia among children, as well as in reducing mean indoor vector density, mean entomological inoculation rate, and sporozoite rate, compared to pyriproxyfen (PPF) LLINs in Africa. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study found that chlorfenapyr (CFP) LLINs are highly effective and more efficacious in reducing malaria infection, case incidence, and anemia among children in Africa. Therefore, policymakers and health planners should place strong emphasis on addressing the effectiveness, efficacy, and resistance management of LLINs as part of their current public health agenda to eliminate malaria.",

Despite significant advancements in testing, treatment, and prevention, malaria continues to seriously impact millions, primarily young children and populations in rural and impoverished areas. This paper looks at how the malaria parasite works inside the body, how it avoids the immune system, and how it becomes resistant to current drugs. Thanks to new advances in genetic and biochemical research, scientists are discovering new weak points in the parasite that could lead to better treatments. New vaccines, like RTS, S and R21, along with antibody-based therapies, offer renewed hope; however, extending the duration of the immunity they induce and ensuring effectiveness across diverse parasite strains remain significant challenges. Solving the malaria crisis will require more than science-it also necessitates equitable and timely access to treatments, robust health systems, and international collaboration.

        "abstract": "The objective of this research is to investigate the pathophysiological progression of HIV from acute infection to chronic immunodeficiency (AIDS) and to understand the host's immunological responses, which are pivotal for elucidating disease aetiology and optimizing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Additionally, the study aims to explore the role of exosomes (40-130 nm bilipid-layered vesicles released by nearly all cell types) as key mediators of intercellular communication in the context of HIV infection. Recent research has uncovered that cells infected with HIV-1 release exosomes carrying a mix of viral and host components such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites. To decipher the plausible role of exosome-derived proteins in HIV disease progression, the exosomes isolated from HIV patient's serum were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis to identify exosome-derived human and viral protein sequences. The identified proteins were then investigated, annotated, and explored for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network between HIV and the human host's proteins. Earlier experimental efforts focused on identifying PPI networks in host cells or only within the virus. The analysis showed that out of twelve exosome-derived host proteins identified from HIV-1 patient's samples, only five of the proteins were associated with Toll-like receptors (TLR), inflammasome-activation, inhibition of apoptosis, innate immune response modulation, and autophagy pathways. In the TLR pathway, CDH5, ENO1, OGT, TJP1, and TRAF6 exosome-derived host proteins participated in regulation. Notably, CDH5, ENO1, OGT, and TRAF6 were shared among these pathways, BioGRID version 4.4 showed that HIV-1 Gag, Gag-pol, Env, and Nef proteins interact with 196, 162, 158, and 80 human proteins, respectively, associated with different innate immune response pathways. These findings are a step ahead in comprehending the pathophysiology of HIV1 and the innate immune response pathways, providing excellent opportunities to explore further exosome-based biomarkers for theranostic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Mutare city of Zimbabwe was considered free of autochthonous malaria, until 2017, when the Ministry of Health and Child Care formally confirmed escalating cases of locally transmitted malaria in the city. The current study examined the risk factors for malaria cases in the city to aid in formulation of targeted intervention packages for helping restore malaria-free status. The study employed complementary cross-sectional and case-control designs to ascertain the magnitude and risk factors of urban malaria cases presenting at all eight primary health care facilities of Mutare city from 2022 to 2023. Malaria cases were enrolled as confirmed by RDT or microscopy on presenting all-age symptomatic suspected malaria patients. Controls were similarly enrolled as all-age symptomatic suspected malaria patients found negative by both RDT and microscopy. All cases and controls were enrolled as representative of the presenting population with no matching. Data were analysed for descriptive and prevalence statistics, as well as risk factors, using SPSS Faculty version 27. In a multivariate binary logistic model, significant risk factors for malaria cases found in the city included residential locale (RR [95%CI]: 3 [1.1-5.8], p = 0.029, N = 7,222), household proximity to still surface water pools or unprotected wells (16 [3.8-67.5], p < 0.001) and travel history in the past 2 weeks (9 [5.2-14.4], p < 0.001, N = 7,222), modal travel destinations being malaria-endemic adjoining districts within Zimbabwe, as well as areas of neighbouring Mozambique, mainly for trade or work. By far the most predominant risk factor for malaria cases was artisanal mining (RR [95%CI]: 22 [10.7-44.1], p < 0.001), which was 93% dominated by men, and male residents exhibited four-fold higher odds of being malaria cases than females (4 [2.0-6.5]). Significant risk factors for urban malaria were found that were consistent with both autochthonous transmission and imported malaria in Mutare city. Environmental management and the deployment and concomitant promotion of mass ITNs, personal protection and other intervention packages, especially targeting communities exposed to the identified risk factors, would be instrumental towards re-establishing urban malaria elimination from Mutare city.",

        "abstract": "Although considered safe and widely used, some natural remedies are responsible for health ailments to their users that deserve to be investigated. SAYE PLUS is one of the most widely used traditional recipes as antimalaria for decades and recently against Covid-19 in Burkina Faso and beyond, and is commonly regarded as safe to use. In the present study, sub-chronic toxicity tests were performed orally in Wistar rats at daily doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg for 90 days, following the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The results revealed neither symptoms of toxicity nor mortality. Depending on the dose, time frame, or animal sex, compared with the control, SAYE PLUS powder caused a statistically significant reduction in the water and food consumption of the treated rats. Significantly increases in serum creatinine, total protein, hydrogen phosphate ion (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>), and potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) levels were detected in females at all doses. Compared to control values, the male rats' glucose decreased while its PO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> increased significantly at the daily dose of 1000 mg/kg of SAYE PLUS. Histopathological analysis revealed that the rat heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen histostructure were unaffected by sub-chronic exposure to SAYE PLUS up to 1000 mg/kg/d. The Findings provide some scientific information on the toxicological profile of the phytomedicine SAYE PLUS when administered in repeated doses for 90 days. However, they are limited by the absence of analysis of the animals' hematological parameters. Nevertheless, results show that for patient safety, it is not advisable to use SAYE PLUS for more than two consecutive weeks. Furthermore, herbal remedies need careful evaluation before or during their human use, especially when a new form of use other than the traditional one is proposed. Further long-term studies focusing on the hematological parameters and certain kidney and liver functional indicators will add the scientific merit and interest of the present work.",

With the global vaccine supply boosted by the pre-qualification of a second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M (R21), in October 2023, many endemic countries (20 as of April 2025) have introduced malaria vaccines into their national childhood immunization and malaria control programmes. More endemic countries are expected to introduce or scale up malaria vaccines in 2025 and beyond. This paper summarizes key operational lessons from the pilot countries to facilitate the introduction and scale-up of malaria vaccination in other countries. Pilot areas were identified, in part, based on local malaria epidemiology. RTS,S was initially introduced in randomly selected areas, while other areas served as comparators until the four-dose schedule vaccine was scaled up following the WHO recommendation in 2021. In Ghana and Kenya, the vaccine was administered at ages 6, 7, 9, and 24 months (Ghana switched to administer the fourth dose at age 18 months in 2023), and Malawi chose a schedule of 5, 6, 7, and 22 months. Vaccination coverage improved over time, reaching about 80% for the first dose and around 75% for the third dose by 2023 in the initial pilot areas. Implementation challenges included an inadequate understanding of age eligibility among healthcare workers during the early phase of introduction, low fourth dose coverage (with a median coverage of 46% in 2023 across the three countries), and disruptions to service delivery caused by disease outbreaks and other natural disasters. Health stakeholders and caregivers attested to the positive impact of introducing the malaria vaccine, including a reduction in malaria hospitalizations and the strengthening of the National Immunization Programme (NIP) through routine immunization refresher training and supportive supervision. The pilot highlighted lessons for malaria vaccine introduction: (1) clearly outlined roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders including NIP and National Malaria Programme (NMP); (2) appropriate approach to vaccine introduction launch, communication, and demand generation to enhance vaccine uptake; (3) flexibility with dose scheduling to optimize coverage; and (4) updated data collection tools for accurate documentation, and data quality.",

        "title": "Seroprevalence of dengue virus infection among febrile patients visiting healthcare facilities in the selected districts of Afar region, Northeast Ethiopia.",
        "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is caused by dengue virus (DENV) and is primarily spread through bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions, including Ethiopia. In the Afar region, DF is often misdiagnosed as malaria due to limited diagnostic capabilities. This study assessed the seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in healthcare facilities in the Afar region. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2022 to March 2023 in Amibara, Harunka and Awash Sebat city administration districts, involving febrile patients suspected of having malaria. Sociodemographic data, clinical features and blood samples were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent or assent. Following blood film examination for Plasmodium infection, sera were tested for anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were entered into Epi Data 3.1 and analyzed with Stata/SE 14.2. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 411 febrile patients (55.5% female, aged 5-80 years, with a mean age of 27.3 ± 13.8 years) participated in the study. Among those tested for anti-DENV antibodies, 101/410 (24.6%) were positive for anti-DENV IgM, indicating an acute DENV infection, and 142/367 (38.7%) were positive for anti-DENV IgG, revealing previous exposure. Only 44/411 (10.7%) were positive for Plasmodium infection, while 18/410 (4.4%) were co-infected with malaria and acute DENV infection and 18/367 (4.9%) were positive for both malaria and previous exposure to DENV. Those diagnosed with malaria were nearly 2.5 times more likely to test positive for acute DENV infection than those without malaria (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.92). The odds of positivity for previous exposure were about two times higher in females than in males (AOR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.32-3.26) and in government and private sector employees than in pastoralists and agro-pastoralists (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.03-8.15), while patients aged 11-20 years had lower odds of previous exposure than those aged 5-10 years (AOR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.88). Experiencing muscle pain was associated with twice the odds of previous exposure (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.04-3.49). The study reveals a high seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in the study area, highlighting the need for routine diagnosis and management of DF in this setting. Improving vector control, disease surveillance and public awareness would be crucial for combating DF and other mosquito-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Poor-quality antimalarial medications, including falsified and substandard formulations, pose significant public health risks, contributing to ineffective treatment and potential drug resistance. Our research conducted in 2013 on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG), found 9.6% (n=61) of the artemisinin-containing antimalarials (ACAs) purchased were of poor quality. This study aimed to update the quality of all sold antimalarials and extend to include regions on the mainland. A total of 637 samples, 564 ACAs and 73 non-ACAs, were purchased from 424 outlets on Bioko Island and mainland EG using a mystery client sampling approach. Samples were analysed for content using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and classified as acceptable, substandard or falsified based on pharmacopoeia tolerance limits. Additionally, bioavailability was assessed through dissolution testing for a select number of samples. Overall, 40.5% of the samples were of acceptable quality, 31.2% were substandard and 28.3% were falsified. Regional differences showed a higher prevalence of falsified samples in Bata, Mangomo, Evinayong and Ebebiyín cities on the mainland (30.9%) compared with Bioko Island (25.6%). Artemether/lumefantrine, the first-line treatment for malaria in EG, showed 25.7% were of acceptable quality, 48.2% substandard and 26.1% falsified. Artemisinin monotherapy tablets had the highest rate of falsification (56.8%). For non-ACAs, 13.3% of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine tablets were of acceptable quality, 48.9% substandard and 37.8% falsified. All quinine syrups were falsified, and most quinine tablets (87.5%) and injections (75.0%) were substandard. The prevalence of substandard and falsified antimalarials in EG has alarmingly increased from 9% in 2013 to 59.5% in 2018, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced regulatory measures. Immediate actions should include strengthening drug quality surveillance, particularly in private sector pharmacies, and implementing low-cost medicine screening methods for early detection of poor-quality medications. Ensuring the quality of antimalarials is critical to maintaining the efficacy of malaria control programmes and preventing the development of drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "Infants may be exposed to bisphenols (BP) via breastfeeding. These chemicals are known endocrine disruptors and may interfere with infant growth. However, their presence in breast milk and their associations with infant size remain unexplored in South Africa, where infants may be especially vulnerable to toxic effects. We measured BPA, BPS, and BPAF in breast milk samples obtained 4-8 weeks postpartum from mothers residing in rural (Vhembe district; n=193) and urban (Pretoria; n=189) areas of South Africa and compared them to samples from Montreal (n=206). Infant length and head circumference were measured in South Africa, with z-scores computed based on World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts. Random forest plots were used to identify top-ranked predictors of bisphenols, and linear marginal structural models were used to estimate associations between bisphenol concentrations and infant size. Bisphenol concentrations were highest in Vhembe relative to Pretoria; in Montreal, only BPS was detected. Microwaving food in plastic containers and maternal diet were important determinants of exposure. In the combined South African sites, total BPAF detection was associated with greater infant length (β=0.38 SD, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.68) and head circumference (β=0.52 SD, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.81). Associations were strongest in Pretoria. In contrast, a tenfold increase in total BPA concentration was associated with a 0.20 SD decrease in head circumference (95% CI: -0.39, -0.01) in Vhembe. Findings point to high exposure to bisphenols in rural Africa and suggest that exposure to BPA and BPAF may alter growth among South African infants.",

        "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a priority pathogen that poses a high risk for public health emergencies of global concern. Although WNV is endemic to Africa, only few (n=63) whole genomic sequences are available from the continent. In this Review, we examined the status of the molecular testing and genomic sequencing of WNV across Africa and mapped its global spatiotemporal spread. WNV has been detected in 39 African countries, the Canary Islands, and Réunion Island. Although publications, including those with molecular data, originated from 24 of these countries, genomic sequences were available from only 16 countries. Our analysis identified regions with detected viral circulation but without molecular surveillance. The current literature has substantial knowledge gaps in terms of the disease burden, molecular epidemiology, and distribution of WNV in Africa. Addressing these gaps requires an integrated One Health surveillance approach, which is challenging to establish. We propose three key surveillance needs that could improve the current understanding of the WNV disease burden in Africa, to strengthen the global public health response to this vector-borne disease.",

        "abstract": "Malaria and malnutrition adversely affect maternal and neonatal health in Sub-Saharan Africa. While intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is widely used to reduce malaria incidence, the potential additional benefits of combining it with lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) remain unclear. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the effects of LNS in combination with IPTp on malaria incidence, maternal nutritional status, and birth outcomes. A comprehensive search of 4 databases-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CENTRAL-and the gray literature via GOOGLE Scholar-was conducted in January 2024, and updated in July 2024. The review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included studies assessing LNS and IPTp for outcomes related to malaria, nutritional status, or birth outcomes. The review identified 17 studies, focused on 5 main trials: 2 with small-quantity LNS (SQ-LNS), 2 with balanced energy-protein (BEP), and 1 trial with large-quantity LNS (LQ-LNS). LNS supplementation did not significantly affect malaria incidence, anemia, or nutritional status. However, some studies reported improvements in birth outcomes, particularly among specific subgroups and those with baseline undernutrition. Variability in study methodologies and supplementation protocols influenced these findings. While LNS and IPTp show potential for improving selected birth outcomes, the evidence for their effect on malaria incidence or maternal anemia remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of LNS and IPTp among vulnerable groups of women in malaria-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Malaria vector control tools currently focus on insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying in malaria-endemic locations, but additional preventative strategies are needed to address protection gaps. Larval source management (LSM) includes larvicide application to aquatic habitat and an array of alternative forms of environmental efforts. An individual-based transmission model for falciparum malaria is used to demonstrate the theoretical benefit of suppressing malaria adult mosquito vector densities through LSM. The model simulates results of epidemiological trials from Western Kenya (a hilly area with papyrus swamps adjacent to human settlements and moderate to high perennial malaria transmission) and Côte d'Ivoire (an area with Sudanese climate, reducing vegetation cover and high transmission) that applied larvicide alongside ITNs, and investigates whether estimated changes in adult density can be used to project changes in human malaria. In the Western Kenya setting generalised linear models estimate 82% (90% credible intervals: 64% - 92%) and 88% (79% - 94%) reductions in the proportion of adult Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes respectively as measured by CDC light traps. In Côte d'Ivoire, an 82% (56% - 93%) reduction of the dominant An. gambiae vector was estimated using standard window trap and pyrethrum spray catch. Both studies had variable village-level impacts. The transmission dynamics model predicted that these entomological impacts would result in a reduction in malaria prevalence in children of 6-months to 10-years of age of 48 - 72% in Kenya, and a 11 - 78% reduction in all-age clinical incidence across villages in Côte d'Ivoire, which are broadly consistent with the empirically observed outcomes. High heterogeneity between villages within the same study indicate that the relative or absolute reductions in mosquito adult density observed in these trials cannot be simply extrapolated to other regions. The LSM strategy adopted, unit area covered, and multiple environmental covariates all contribute to differences in indicators that could be used to assess entomological impacts and the corresponding epidemiological outcomes. This important malaria control tool was impactful across all sites examined, though further work is needed to understand how best to use this tool in the fight against malaria.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a pressing global health challenge, with rising drug resistance threatening current treatment strategies. Partial resistance to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) has emerged in Southeast Asia, particularly in Plasmodium falciparum strains from Cambodia. While artemisinin partial resistance is associated with mutations in kelch13, reduced PPQ sensitivity has been linked to increased copy numbers of the aspartic protease genes plasmepsin II and III and mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter. In this study, we demonstrate the effective use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate single knockouts (KO) of plasmepsin II and plasmepsin III, as well as a double KO of both genes, in two isogenic Cambodian parasites with varying numbers of plasmepsin gene copies. The deletion of plasmepsin II and/or III increased parasite sensitivity to PPQ. We explored several hypotheses to understand how an increased plasmepsin gene copy number might influence parasite survival under high PPQ pressure. Our findings indicate that protease inhibitors have a minimal impact on parasite susceptibility to PPQ. Additionally, parasites with higher plasmepsin gene copy numbers did not exhibit significantly increased hemoglobin digestion, differences in peptide composition, nor did they produce different amounts of free heme following PPQ treatment compared to wildtype (single copy) parasites. Interestingly, hemoglobin digestion was slowed in parasites with plasmepsin II deletions. We also found that culturing parasites with different plasmepsin II and III copies in amino acid-limited media had little impact on parasite sensitivity to high-dose PPQ. By treating parasites with modulators of digestive vacuole (DV) homeostasis, we found that changes in DV pH potentially affect their response to PPQ. Our research highlights the crucial role of increased plasmepsin II and III gene copy numbers in modulating response to PPQ and begins to uncover the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the contribution of plasmepsin II and III amplification to PPQ resistance in Cambodian parasites.",

The evaluation was done in two districts, Bombali and Karene, where repeat pre-transmission assessment surveys (pre-TAS) were planned. Two rural sites, Kagbo and Makorba Yelimini which recorded high LF antigen prevalence of 4.1% and 7.7% respectively in repeat pre-TAS in 2020 were selected for the QFAT evaluation. At least 350 people ≥5 years were targeted per site for inclusion in the study by convenience sampling. Blood was collected by fingerstick; 20μl for QFAT and 75μl for FTS. The reading time for both tests was 10 minutes. For all positive or invalid results, a repeat test was performed for both tests. In total, 728 participants (5-91 years) were tested by QFAT and FTS. Four FTS and three QFAT final results were classified as indeterminate (meaning a positive result followed by a negative result) and were excluded from the analysis. The positive rate was 4.8% (17/357) and 3.5% (13/367) for FTS and 3.4% (12/359) and 4.1% (15/366) for QFAT in Kagbo and Makorba Yelimi, respectively. All participants testing positive for FTS or QFAT underwent further testing by night blood smear to detect microfilariae using microscopy. No W. bancrofti microfilariae was detected in any of the antigen positive cases. In field conditions, QFAT was easy to handle and recorded zero invalid tests compared to FTS (six invalids). The concordance between FTS and QFAT was 0.81 (Cohen's Kappa). The discrepancy found between the two tests in terms of positive tests was not statistically significant (p = 0.78). The results suggest that the QFAT is a credible W. bancrofti diagnostic test when compared to the routinely used FTS; use of either test would result in the same program decision.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a world health challenge; in 2023, 263 million cases and 597,000 deaths were reported around the globe. The parasite's life cycle is complex, and targeted interventions at critical developmental stages are needed to effectively control the disease. Transmission-blocking (TB) strategies aim to interrupt Plasmodium transmission by targeting either the mosquito vector or the parasite's sexual stages through vaccines and drugs. TB interventions can focus on gametocytes in the human host or other forms in the mosquito midgut, such as gametes, zygotes, ookinetes, and oocysts. The development of new TB approaches faces significant challenges. Studying the parasite's sexual stages is inherently difficult, and high-throughput screening (HTS) for gametocytocidal compounds relies primarily on P. falciparum cultures. However, robust in vitro tools for assessing interventions against later sexual stages remain limited. To accelerate the discovery of TB compounds, our group developed a novel HTS assay for gametocyte activation and fertilization using P. berghei, a murine model of Plasmodium infection. The transgenic parasite, Ookluc, expresses nanoluciferase exclusively after zygote formation, with peak luminescence during ookinete development. This luminescence-based assay provides a quantitative readout of gamete to zygote and zygote to ookinete differentiation, where increased luminescence directly correlates with ookinete formation. This video article presents the methods for screening malaria TB compounds using Ookluc.",

In 10 malaria-naïve adult volunteers, R21/Matrix-M induced polarized IgG anti-NANP repertoires, heavily skewed for IGHV3-30/3-33 genes bearing minimal somatic mutation, which remained static in composition following a controlled human malaria infection challenge. Notably, these vaccine-generated antibodies cross-reacted with another protective CSP epitope, the N-terminal junction region, despite its absence from the R21 construct. NANP-specific IGHV3-30/3-33 mAbs mined from polyclonal IgG repertoires blocked sporozoite invasion in vitro and prevented parasitemia in vivo. Overall, R21/Matrix-M elicits polarized, minimally mutated, polyclonal IgG responses that can target multiple protective CSP epitopes, offering molecular insight into the serological basis for its demonstrated efficacy against P. falciparum malaria.",

Molecular surveillance of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites and <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito vectors are key components of effective malaria control decision-making. Previously, we have designed and implemented a nanopore-based workflow for targeted <i>P. falciparum</i> molecular surveillance in Ghana, which we call DRAG1 (drug resistance + antigen multiplex PCR). Here, we describe an updated and expanded multiplex assay ('DRAG2') with additional amplicon targets that incorporate more antimalarial drug resistance markers, the polymorphic surface antigen <i>merozoite surface protein 2</i> ( <i>msp2</i>), and the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene for <i>Plasmodium</i> species detection. We describe the performance of the DRAG2 assay over a range of parasitaemias and sample types (venous blood and dried blood spots), with suggested systems of quality control including the use of synthetic plasmids for positive controls and recommended coverage thresholds. The plasmids are highly economical, and engineered to include both 'test' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as known drug resistance markers, and 'control' SNPs, which are not found in nature and thus signal contamination if detected in clinical samples. We provide standard operating procedures (SOPs) for use by teams aiming to implement the assay in their laboratory. In summary, we describe an updated nanopore-based method for malaria molecular surveillance, including detailed consideration of quality control processes and SOPs.

        "title": "Analysis of a syndromic surveillance system for infectious diseases of the 31st summer World University Games in Chengdu, China.",
        "abstract": "Chengdu hosted the 31st Summer World University Games in 2023. The movement and gathering of attendees from other cities and countries posed challenges to local public health, including an increased risk of infectious diseases or outbreaks. To manage these risks, a syndromic surveillance system targeting infectious diseases was established. This system aimed to identify suspicious cases and outbreaks early, enabling timely measures and minimizing their impact. This article reviews the surveillance mechanism, analyzes the surveillance data, and evaluates the system's effectiveness. The mechanism of the syndromic surveillance system was described, and surveillance data were collected to evaluate strategies for infectious disease prevention and control during the Universiade. Epidemiological distributions of diseases were described, and differences were tested using chi-squared tests. Surveillance was carried out among athletes, coaches, entourages, and staff from 1 week before the competition to 1 week after. The surveillance focused on symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, jaundice, conjunctival redness, and sore throat, supported by a self-developed <i>Cloud Health Information System for Health Care Support</i> and <i>Syndromic Surveillance System for Infectious Disease</i>. A total of 351 subjects with disease-related symptoms, mainly including sore throat, cough, and fever, were reported. A total of 33 events of clustered symptoms were detected, none of which met the criteria for an outbreak. Fifty cases were confirmed with infectious diseases, comprising 43 cases of COVID-19, 3 cases of influenza, and 1 case each of infectious mononucleosis, chikungunya, malaria, and another infectious diarrhea. Throughout the event, reports of disease-related symptoms were sporadically distributed, with no secondary cases or outbreaks detected and no health-related risks arising that would impact the continuation of the event. The syndromic surveillance system was sensitive and effective for the early detection and control of infectious disease outbreaks and could be implemented in other mass-gathering events.",

        "title": "Mitigation of Malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa through Vaccination: A Budding Road Map for Global Malaria Eradication.",
        "abstract": "Malaria remains a major public health and economic burden globally, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounting for over 90% of cases and deaths. Children under five and pregnant women are the most vulnerable. Resistance to artemisinin-based therapies and insecticides has compounded the challenge. This review evaluates malaria mitigation strategies, emphasizing the potential of vaccination, particularly RTS,S/AS01, as a cornerstone for malaria eradication and achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3). A narrative review approach was adopted. Peer-reviewed literature from 2014 to 2024 was sourced from credible scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Selection prioritized studies on malaria control strategies, vaccine trials, efficacy data, implementation frameworks, and health system challenges specific to SSA. The review critically analyzed vaccine trials, community perceptions, and logistical concerns while incorporating the authors' expert perspective. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine demonstrated moderate efficacy (30-55%) in preventing malaria in children under five in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi. Other candidates such as R21/Matrix-M showed up to 77% efficacy in trials. Implementation challenges include limited funding, vaccine hesitancy, poor healthcare infrastructure, and community misconceptions. However, integration with routine immunization, enhanced community engagement, and increased investment in health systems significantly improve vaccine acceptance and impact. Vaccination represents a promising, cost-effective, and scalable strategy for malaria eradication in SSA. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure, amplifying vaccine acceptance campaigns, and increasing funding for research and vaccine production are pivotal. Malaria vaccination offers a practical and sustainable pathway toward global malaria elimination and the realization of SDG 3 by 2030.",

        "title": "Polycyclitol Derivatives Restore Long- Term Memory Via cdk5/p25 Activation of Tau Signaling in Experimental Cerebral Malaria.",
        "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a purified form of tau protein kinase II (TPKII), mediates abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation through activation by its cofactor p25. The resulting Cdk5-p25 complex promotes the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, contributing to elevated expression of the microglial marker Iba-1, an established feature of tauopathy-driven neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396/404 disrupts microtubule stability, leading to neuronal dysfunction, synaptic loss, and cognitive deficits. Notably, approximately 25% of children surviving cerebral malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa experience cognitive impairments, underscoring the urgent need for neuroprotective therapies. In this study, we employed an experimental cerebral malaria model to assess the therapeutic potential of four polycyclic derivatives, SR4-01 to SR4-04, as adjuncts to artemether. We evaluated their efficacy in attenuating Cdk5-p25-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396, with the goal of restoring neuronal architecture and cognitive function. Behavioral assessments included the Barnes maze for long-term memory, T-maze for short-term memory, and a novelty-based recognition task. Among the treatment groups, SR4-02 and SR4-04 demonstrated significant improvements in learning and memory compared to both artemether monotherapy and the SR4-01 and SR4-03 groups. Immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus and cortex showed reduced phospho-tau (Ser396) expression in the SR4-02 and SR4-04 groups. Golgi-Cox staining further revealed enhanced neuronal arborization in the CA1 and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus and in the cortex. Western blot analysis confirmed reduced Cdk5-p25-mediated tau phosphorylation in the SR4-04 treated group. Collectively, our findings suggest that SR4-02 and SR4-04 hold promise as adjunctive therapies for reducing tau pathology and restoring cognitive function in cerebral malaria-associated neurodegeneration.",

        "abstract": "Scientists are urged to discover new drugs since treatment resistance makes malaria hard to control. One important source of new drugs is medicinal plants. The antimalarial qualities of Tephrosia villosa roots in vitro demonstrated its good effect to treat malaria infections. On the other hand, its effect in vivo is unknown. This study filled the gap by evaluating the antimalarial effectiveness of Tephrosia villosa's Dichloromethane/methanol (1:1) extract against Plasmodium berghei infection in a mouse model.Dichloromethane/methanol (1:1) was used to extract the dried, powdered roots of Tephrosia villosa, and the extract's safety profile was assessed using an acute toxicity test. By giving 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg dosages of the extract, the antimalarial activity of the extract was assessed by the 4-day suppressive, Rane's, and prophylactic tests. To establish the activity, criteria such as body weight, packed cell capacity, temperature, survival time, and parasitemia level were measured.According to the acute oral toxicity result, the extract caused no signs of toxicity in mice in 24 h and within 14 days of observation. It was proven to have chemosuppressive, curative, and prophylactic activities. It has decreased the level of parasitemia and improved mean survival time in parasite infected mice in used models. The extract at 400 mg/kg dose suppressed parasitemia by 24.78%, 52.16%, and 49.09% in 4-day suppressive, curative and prophylactic test models (p < 0.001) respectively. Moreover, it inhibited reduction in packed cell volume, body weight, and temperature fall in all tested models as compared to the negative control. The findings revealed that the extract of the plant was safe at 2 g/kg dose on acute oral toxicity test and was proven to have antimalarial effect for plasmodium berghei infection in mice which supports the in vitro test.",

We previously developed monovalent vaccines against P. falciparum or P. vivax using vaccinia virus LC16m8Δ (m8Δ) and adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1). Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of a novel bivalent malaria vaccine against P. falciparum and P. vivax. The m8Δ vaccine harbors two gene cassettes encoding Pfs25-PfCSP and Pvs25-PvCSP fusion proteins, while the AAV1 vaccine includes two recombinant AAV1s carrying one of these cassettes as a mixture. Heterologous m8Δ-prime and AAV1-boost immunization provided 70% protection against both PfCSP/Pb and PvCSP/Pb transgenic sporozoites. Moreover, a membrane feeding assay using P. vivax isolates from infected patients in the Brazilian Amazon showed 90% transmission-blocking efficacy. The bivalent vaccine outperformed monovalent combinations, maintaining immune responses for over 7 months, and shows promise for malaria control and elimination.",

Here, we present a transmission-blocking drug discovery and development platform that builds on transgenic NF54/iGP1_RE9H<sup>ulg8</sup> parasites engineered to conditionally produce large numbers of stage V gametocytes expressing a red-shifted firefly luciferase viability reporter. Besides developing a robust in vitro screening assay for the reliable identification of stage V gametocytocidal compounds, we also establish a preclinical in vivo malaria transmission model based on infecting female humanized NODscidIL2Rγ<sup>null</sup> mice with pure NF54/iGP1_RE9H<sup>ulg8</sup> stage V gametocytes. Using whole animal bioluminescence imaging, we assess the in vivo gametocyte killing and clearance kinetics of antimalarial reference drugs and clinical drug candidates and identify markedly different pharmacodynamic response profiles. Finally, we combine this mouse model with mosquito feeding assays and thus firmly establish a valuable tool for the systematic in vivo evaluation of transmission-blocking drug efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Splenic rupture is a potentially life-threatening condition and most commonly linked to abdominal or thoracic trauma. When it occurs without trauma, it is termed as spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR). However, it is exceedingly rare and typically occurs secondary to underlying pathological processes. In malaria-endemic regions, Plasmodium infections can cause splenic enlargement and increase the risk of rupture. We present four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture, all occurring in patients with a recent history of malaria treatment. One patient was a 30-year-old previously healthy male from a malaria-endemic region in Ethiopia who presented with acute left upper quadrant abdominal pain, dizziness, and massive hemoperitoneum, requiring an emergency splenectomy. The remaining three patients, although diagnosed with SSR, were hemodynamically stable and managed successfully with conservative treatment, including close monitoring, supportive care, and serial imaging. None of the non-operatively managed patients required surgery during follow-up. SSR due to malaria is rare but more common in endemic areas. Malaria-associated splenic rupture is due to vascular congestion, reticuloendothelial hyperplasia, and a fragile splenic capsule. A high index of suspicion is important in patients with malaria who develop abdominal pain. Such patients need proper abdominal imaging and exclusion of trauma. Treatment depends mainly on hemodynamic stability, with splenectomy reserved for uncontrolled bleeding. Malaria-related spontaneous splenic rupture may present with variable clinical severity. Early recognition, appropriate imaging, and timely surgical intervention are critical for favorable outcomes, particularly in malaria-endemic settings.",

        "abstract": "Bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina Delile) and Siam weed (Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M.King & H.Rob.) are herbal plants known for their diverse therapeutic purposes, including the treatment of malaria. However, there is a dearth of information on their ability to reverse the negative impacts of malaria infection on reproduction-linked organs such as the testes. This study investigated the effect of bitter leaf and Siam weed aqueous extracts in reversing testicular oxidative damage caused by plasmodium berghei Infection in male mice. The bioactive components of Siam weed and bitter leaf were analysed. Sixty-four (64) male mice were inoculated with strain NK65 Plasmodium berghei (Chloroquine, CQ sensitive), and the parasitemia suppression was assessed. The mice were treated with bitter leaf and Siam weed aqueous extracts (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) for five (5) days, with Chloroquine (10 mg/kg) as standard. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidant levels and enzyme activities were assessed on the testes of the mice. Bitter leaf and Siam weed contain several antioxidants and anti-inflammatory bioactive components. Treatments with these herbs suppressed the parasitemia level, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ROS, TBARS, and had an inhibitory effect on enzyme activities, with an increase in antioxidant levels in a dose-dependent manner compared to infected, untreated mice. These findings indicate that bitter leaf and Siam weed aqueous extracts can reverse the negative effects of malaria infection on the testes via modulation of oxidative stress pathways.",

Fosmidomycin, initially recognized for its antibacterial properties, has emerged as a promising candidate in the fight against malaria. In this study, a sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS method for quantifying fosmidomycin in human and rat plasma was developed and validated. Plasma samples were prepared using a simple protein precipitation method with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The assay featured a rapid run time of 5 min, and validation was performed according to the European Medicines Agency's guidelines. The method validation confirmed its selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and stability. Notably, the calibration range was established from 0.25 to 15 mg/L, demonstrating improvements over previous methodologies with lower limits of quantification of 0.5-1.0 mg/L. Using the developed LC-MS/MS method, plasma samples were analysed from a clinical trial conducted in Gabon, as well as from a pharmacokinetic study involving male Wistar rats, revealing viable pharmacokinetic profiles for fosmidomycin.

We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

The detection of infectious diseases in blood donors ensures the safety of blood transfusion. Another challenge is the differences in blood group antigens due to the ability of clinically significant antibodies to cause adverse reactions. This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of distribution and the possible correlation of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) with different blood groups. This study also aimed to evaluate the frequencies of minor blood group antigens detected on screening in a few infected blood donors. Methodology This study included replacement donors who were fit to donate blood after screening. After blood donation, tests for TTIs was done using the chemiluminescence immunoassay for hepatitis B virus (HBV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HCV), and rapid diagnostic kits were used for malaria and syphilis. Blood grouping was performed by IMMUCOR'S NEO IRIS instrument using commercial antisera. Samples of blood donors infected with TTIs over the study period of two months were also tested for minor antigens. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Software, version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results In total, 46,549 blood donors were included, of whom 3,064 (6.6%) donors were reactive for TTIs, with the most prevalent being HBV infection (n = 1,183, 2.5%). In this study, 2.4% (n = 23) of the total B-negative blood donors were HCV reactive (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.3, p = 0.038; statistically significant), and 0.9% (n = 8) of the total B-negative blood donors were malaria reactive (Fisher's exact test = 11.06, p = 0.001; statistically significant). Blood donors with A-positive blood group were significantly associated with syphilis infection (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.86, p = 0.05). The Fyb antigen was relatively more prevalent among HIV-reactive donors (n = 24, 77.4%), while E (n = 3, 9.7%) and c (n = 13, 41.9%) antigens were relatively lesser prevalent compared to other infected donors. Similarly, malaria-reactive donors had a lower prevalence of C antigen (n = 17, 73.9%) and a higher prevalence of E antigen (n = 8, 34.8%). The most common Rh phenotype found among all the TTI-infected reactive donors was CCDee, and among the Rh-negative infected donors, ccdee was the only phenotype observed. Conclusions This study determined the regional prevalence of TTIs among blood donors and noted a significant association of B-negative blood group with HCV and malaria.

        "title": "Identification of a moxidectin dose for 4- to 11-year-old children to support registration and potential use for onchocerciasis elimination: results of an open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study.",
        "abstract": "The WHO and onchocerciasis-endemic countries target elimination of the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite causing onchocerciasis, primarily through ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA). In Africa, alternative treatment strategies are required to achieve or accelerate elimination. One of these is the MDA of moxidectin, an anthelmintic drug for which an 8 mg dose to individuals aged 12 years and older has received regulatory approval. This study was conducted to identify dose levels for children aged 4 to 11 years. An open-label, non-comparative, single-dose study in an onchocerciasis-endemic area of Ghana was designed to evaluate moxidectin pharmacokinetics and safety in four groups comprising nine individuals each: those aged 12-17 years, after administration of 8 mg; those aged 8-11 years after administration of 8 mg; those aged 8-11 years after administration of 6 mg; and those aged 4-7 years after administration of 4 mg moxidectin. Evaluations to identify adverse events included physical examination, vital signs, haematology, clinical chemistry and 12-lead electrocardiograms. Moxidectin plasma concentrations were measured at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 72 h and at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks post-dose. The maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>; ng/ml) and area under the concentration-time curve from dosing to infinity (AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>; ng h/ml) were obtained through non-compartmental analysis. The 38 adverse events in 24 participants were illnesses typically seen in the study population without treatment (primarily malaria) and were considered not moxidectin-related. The arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> in all groups (range 84.6 ± 18.2 to 118 ± 26.5 ng/ml and 2070 ± 587 to 3910 ± 1070 ng h/ml, respectively) were lower than in those in healthy adults administered 36 mg moxidectin (range 252 ± 50.3 to 296 ± 47 ng/ml and 10835 ± 2587 to 14972 ± 2233 ng h/ml, respectively), the highest and well-tolerated dose given to humans. Mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> in groups 1-3 (range 84.6 ± 18.2 to 118 ± 26.5 ng/ml and 2920 ± 2120 to 3910 ± 1070 ng h/ml, respectively) exceeded those in O. volvulus-infected adults administered 8 mg (63.1 ± 20.0 ng/ml and 2738 ± 1606 ng h/ml, respectively). In group 4, mean C<sub>max</sub> (89.4 ± 24.1 ng/ml) exceeded that in O. volvulus-infected adults administered 8 mg moxidectin (63.1 ± 20.0 ng/ml). Mean AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> (2070 ± 587 ng h/ml) exceeded that in O. volvulus-infected adults administered 4 mg moxidectin (1169 ± 488 ng h/ml), a dose shown to be almost as efficacious as 8 mg. Considering the safety data, exposures and potential MDA operational aspects, 8 mg for children aged between 8 and 11 years and 4 mg for children aged between 4 and 7 years were selected for further single-dose studies.",

        "title": "Search continues: Exploring immunoinformatics platforms for designing an effective multiepitope malaria vaccine candidate.",
        "abstract": "The prevailing public health threat posed by malaria, especially in developing countries, remains a serious concern despite the availability of preventive and control measures. While vaccination offers a powerful means of combating malaria, it has not been fully exploited due to previous unsuccessful attempts before the launch of the RTS,S vaccine. A major challenge in malaria vaccine development continues to be the identification of effective targets capable of eliciting robust immunity, given the complexity of the parasites' life cycle. Leveraging on the breakthrough of the newly approved malaria vaccine, efforts to develop more effective prophylactic solutions continue with renewed determination. In this study, a standard structural bioinformatics pipeline was employed to design a multiepitope subunit vaccine against <i>Plasmodium</i>, particularly <i>P. falciparum</i>. Thirty subunit epitopes were mined from selected variant surface antigens of <i>P. falciparum</i> proteins expressed at different stages of its life cycle, based on their vaccine-likeness. These epitopes were conjugated with suitable adjuvants and linkers into a vaccine construct, which was then subjected to stringent downstream analyses. Out of an initial pool of 133 epitopes, 30 vaccine-fit epitopes were selected, resulting in a final vaccine construct comprising 570 amino acid residues. This included 12 linear B-cells, 11 cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and 7 helper T-lymphocyte epitopes, all with favorable predicted structural, antigenic, and physicochemical properties. The construct also demonstrated strong global population coverage (95.04%), robust molecular binding, and simulated immune responses. With the evolving \"Omics\" technologies through reverse vaccinology, discovering and designing promising vaccine candidates becomes easier without many challenging experimental rigors. This study highlights the potential of immunoinformatics-aided approaches in accelerating effective malaria vaccine development.",

        "title": "Conceptualization of gender in published malaria and gender research: a systematic descriptive review.",
        "abstract": "Malaria disproportionately affects vulnerable and marginalised population subgroups, including women and girls, migrants, and persons with disabilities. Gender roles expose men and women differently to malaria risks. Similarly, restrictive gender norms pose unique challenges to women and girls in accessing preventive treatment and care. Gender norms that perpetuate hegemonic masculinity also expose men and boys to malaria, resulting from occupational exposure and untimely access to malaria treatment and care. Unfortunately, the gender dimensions of malaria remain under-researched. This systematic descriptive review examines how gender has been conceptualised in published malaria and gender research over the last three decades. The keywords \"malaria AND gender\" were used to search for articles published in English from 1995 to 2024 in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was adopted for this review. The Rayyan intelligent systematic review software was used to collate, manage, and screen articles retrieved from the search engines. The gender analysis matrix advanced by Morgan and colleagues was used to analyse the conceptualisation of gender in published malaria and gender research. A total of 57 published articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final review. We found that the majority of the published papers on malaria and gender have been biomedical in nature, consequently reducing gender analysis to only sex-disaggregated data. Moreover, most of the studies employed a quantitative research approach, with the majority being laboratory-based research, focussing on sub-Saharan Africa. There is a need for more social science research that employs qualitative, mixed-methods, and community-based approaches to malaria and gender research. These approaches extend gender analysis beyond sex and/or gender-disaggregated data, and includes other domains, such as access to resources; distribution of labour; practices and roles; norms, values and beliefs; and decision-making power.",

        "abstract": "In August 2022, an epidemiologic investigation into an outbreak of cases of black water fever, a severe and fatal complication of malaria, was conducted in Kakumiro District, Central Uganda. Findings revealed an association between self-medication and the development of severe malaria complications. Factors associated with self-medication for uncomplicated malaria were described for improved malaria management and prevention of malaria related mortality in Uganda. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Kakumiro District in August 2023. Using multistage sampling, 592 households were selected. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview one participant per household about self-medication for malaria in a family member of any age who suffered from malaria 6 months prior to the interview. Data on demographics, socio-economic factors, health-seeking behaviour, self-medication and antimalarial storage at home were obtained. Modified Poisson regression model was used for multivariate analysis. Of the 592 participants interviewed, 368 (62%; 95% CI 58.2-65.9%) had self-medicated for malaria. Self-medication was significantly associated with household heads aged ≥ 35 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]: 1.77; 95% CI 1.04-3.01); distances ≥ 5 km to the health facility (APR: 3.05; 95% CI 2.09-4.47), and storage of antimalarial drugs at home (APR: 2.21; 95% CI 1.36-3.59). Having malaria episodes ≥ 6 in the household within 6 months was protective (APR: 0.39; 95% CI 0.23-0.65). The major reason for self-medication was antimalarial stockouts at health facilities. Drugs used for self-medication were commonly known to 65% of the respondents and were bought from drug shops (75%). Although, 85% used the recommended drug for malaria treatment, the dose was inappropriate for 66% of the patients and despite the under dose, 85% of the patients recovered without hospitalization. The common occurrence of self-medication for malaria and the high potential for malaria drug resistance and increased malaria mortality due to inappropriate treatment was demonstrated. Adequate antimalarial stock to health facilities, instituting policies prohibiting the sale of incomplete doses by drug shops, social behavioural change campaigns against drug storage in homes and sensitization of communities on the dangers of self-medication and the consumption of inappropriate doses could reduce self-medication practices and its eventual consequences.",

        "abstract": "Malaria during pregnancy remains a significant public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 32 million pregnant women are at risk. Despite the progress made in the coverage of Intermittent Preventive Treatment of malaria during pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), notable gaps persist in understanding the individual and community-level factors that correlate with optimal dosing adherence. This study aims to assess these correlates in Tanzania using recent Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) data. This study employed an analytical cross-sectional design, utilizing data from the 2022 TDHS. This study's analysis included 4497 women who had given birth within two years before the survey. The data were analzed using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, employing four models to identify factors associated with optimal IPTp-SP dose uptake. The overall uptake of optimal (≥ 3 doses) IPTp-SP was 31.2% (95% CI 29.1-33.3). In the adjusted analysis, individual correlates were women aged 25-34 years (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.21-1.90) and 35-49 years (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.10-1.96) compared to women aged 15-24 years. Women with primary education (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.68) were more likely to achieve optimal uptake than those with no formal education. Furthermore, women with one child (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.26-2.17) and two children (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.74) showed higher odds of optimal uptake compared to women with no children. Having more than three antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.47-2.12) increased the likelihood of optimal uptake compared to those with fewer than three visits. Community-level correlates of optimal IPTp-SP uptake included communities with higher ANC visit rates (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.13-1.97), which showed higher odds of optimal uptake than those with low ANC visit rates. Residing in the Northern (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.59) and Lake zones (AOR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.12-2.53) was also associated with higher odds of optimal uptake compared to women in the Western zone. Conversely, women in Zanzibar (AOR = 0.01, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) had low uptake because IPTp-SP is no longer recommended. This study revealed low uptake of optimal doses of IPTp-SP influenced by several individual and community factors. Future malaria prevention in pregnancy requires integrating control programs with reproductive health services, overcoming socio-cultural barriers, and utilizing community engagement to enhance IPTp-SP coverage.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) receive a free long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) during their first antenatal care (ANC) visit to prevent malaria. This study, conducted in Benin, evaluates the distribution and utilization rates of LLINs provided at the first ANC visit among pregnant women. Data were collected from 14 public and private health centers located in urban and rural areas across Southern, Central, and Northern Benin. Pregnant women were enrolled in the study during their initial ANC visit and were subsequently visited at home twice, where a questionnaire was administered. The study assessed the distribution and use of LLINs during the first ANC visit. After the second home visit, the LLIN found on the pregnant women's sleeping unit was collected to evaluate its physical integrity and bio-efficacy. Chi-square tests were used to compare each indicator across three variables: region, urban/rural setting, and public/private status of health centers. A total of 718 pregnant women were included in the study. LLIN ownership and usage before the first ANC visit were 94% [89-97%] and 93% [85-97%], respectively. During the first ANC visit, 63% [40-80%] of the pregnant women received an LLIN, but only 11% [7-22%] installed it on their sleeping area. During the pregnancy period, 72% [64-78%] of the LLINs in use were found to be either physically damaged or not bio-effective. The distribution of LLINs to pregnant women during their first ANC visit was inadequate, with only a small fraction of recipients actively using the net. This shortfall leads to suboptimal protection for this vulnerable population during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Disease tolerance is a key defense mechanism that limits damage to the host without directly reducing pathogen levels. In malaria, these mechanisms are essential for preventing severe disease and death but remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated processes play a vital role in disease tolerance during Plasmodium chabaudi AS infection. GR deletion in infected mice resulted in lethal hypoglycemia and a cytokine storm. Hypoglycemia was driven by severe metabolic dysfunction in the liver and spleen, characterized by increased glucose uptake, glycogen depletion, a dominant glycolytic profile and reduced gluconeogenic gene expression. Importantly, this hypoglycemic state was strongly associated with overactivation of the JAK/STAT pathway and excessive cytokine expression. Treatment with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib significantly improved survival by preventing lethal hypoglycemia and suppressing hyperinflammation. Our findings reveal a novel link between GR signaling, STAT3 activation, cytokine expression and glucose metabolism during severe malaria. This underscores the critical role of GR-mediated processes in disease tolerance and highlights ruxolitinib as a promising adjuvant therapy for managing life-threatening metabolic complications in malaria.",

Acute seizures are common and increasing numbers of them during the index illness are associated with a greater likelihood of adverse outcomes.

After hospital discharge, care gaps for survivors continue in the diagnosis and management of educational challenges, behavioral abnormalities, and epilepsy, especially in the rural settings where malaria incidence is highest. In the past decade, science has elucidated much about cerebral malaria pathogenesis. Observational studies using magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, and transcranial doppler have all provided insight on the pathway from the initial infection transmitted by a mosquito, to death.

        "abstract": "Malaria control and elimination is threatened by the spread of insecticide resistance and behavioral adaptation of vectors. Whether mass administration of ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug that also kills mosquitoes feeding on treated persons, can reduce malaria transmission is unclear. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in Kwale, a county in coastal Kenya in which malaria is highly endemic and coverage and use of insecticide-treated nets are high. Clusters of household areas were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mass administration of ivermectin (400 μg per kilogram of body weight) or albendazole (400 mg, active control) once a month for 3 consecutive months at the beginning of the \"short rains\" season. Children 5 to 15 years of age were tested for malaria infection monthly for 6 months after the first round of treatment. The two primary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of malaria infection (assessed among children 5 to 15 years of age) and of adverse events (assessed among all eligible participants). Analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. A total of 84 clusters comprising 28,932 eligible participants underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the participants were similar in the trial groups. Six months after the first round of treatment, the incidence of malaria infection was 2.20 per child-year at risk in the ivermectin group and 2.66 per child-year at risk in the albendazole group; the adjusted incidence rate ratio (ivermectin vs. albendazole) was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95, P = 0.02). The incidence of serious adverse events per 100 treatments did not differ significantly between the trial groups (incidence rate ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.91). Among children 5 to 15 years of age who were living in an area with high coverage and use of bed nets, ivermectin, administered once a month for 3 consecutive months, resulted in a 26% lower incidence of malaria infection than albendazole.

Monthly biting rates (MBR) were monitored over a follow-up period of 8-14 months and compared between intervention and control sites. Thirteen breeding sites of Simulium damnosum, sensu lato. were found on the Naam and Yei Rivers. Biting rates were consistently higher during the rainy season than the dry season across both Counties. On the Naam River (14 months of follow-up), Mann-Kendall trend tests showed non-significant reductions in MBRs at both intervention (tau = -0.038, p-value = 0.881) and control sites (tau = -0.135, p-value = 0.313). Similar non-significant changes were observed on the Yei River (8 months follow-up), with tau = 0.046 (p-value = 0.820) and tau = 0.163 (p-value = 0.363) for intervention and control sites, respectively. Generalized additive models (GAM) regression analysis indicated that seasonality was the only significant predictor of MBR, with increased biting rates during the rainy season (p < 0.001). A single round of S&C at baseline did not result in significant reductions in MBRs (p-value = 0.651 in Mvolo and p-value = 0.531 in Mundri West). Blackfly biting rates in Mvolo and Mundri West Counties are strongly influenced by seasonal variations, peaking during the rainy season. Our findings indicate that a single round of S&C is insufficient to reduce blackfly biting in the medium term. Repeated and strategically timed annual implementation of S&C is likely required to achieve significant and lasting vector control impacts.",

        "abstract": "Antibodies targeting the malaria circumsporozoite protein (CSP) can prophylactically protect against malaria by targeting <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites before they establish symptomatic blood-stage disease. Engineering the antibody Fc region to more effectively engage immune effector functions has produced therapeutic antibodies with enhanced potency against viral and oncological targets. However, whether Fc-dependent immune effector functions can contribute to the protection of malaria CSP mAbs or be further enhanced via engineering has been limitedly tested. Here, we report that Fc-dependent effector functions are required for achieving maximal protection via prophylactic treatment with the CSP mAb 317. We further report that Fc engineering modulated the activity of multiple CSP mAbs in multiple <i>in vitro</i> assays of effector function. Our studies revealed that the mAbs L9 and CIS43 were more potent drivers of antibody-dependent phagocytosis, NK activation and killing, and complement deposition. In contrast, 317, but not L9 and CIS43, drove enhanced activation of CSP-responsive T-cells after DC acquisition of mAb-complexed antigens. Collectively, our data suggest that effector function represents an important mechanism of anti-CSP antibodies with the potential to enhance activity through Fc engineering.IMPORTANCEMalaria disease imposes a major burden on global health, causing over half a million annual deaths. Recent clinical trials in humans have shown that therapeutic antibodies can provide prophylactic protection against malaria in target populations. However, the cost of goods for therapeutic antibodies is high, and the malaria disease burden is concentrated in resource-challenged regions. Engineering the antibody Fc domain to more efficiently engage the immune system is an appealing strategy to increase the potency of therapeutic antibodies but has been minimally tested for malaria. Here, we present evidence that the Fc domain of malaria therapeutic antibodies can confer protection in animal models and can be engineered for more potent stimulation of diverse parasite-targeting immune responses.",

        "abstract": "Joint bleeding (hemarthrosis) is a major manifestation of joint trauma, especially repeated and spontaneous in hemophilia patients. Hemarthrosis has been identified to induce the excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and permanent damage in articular cartilage. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a well-known clinical anti-malaria drug with few sides effects therapy, has been reported to possess anti-oxidative activity. This study was aimed at exploring the effect of DHA on blood-induced cartilage erosion and its underlying mechanisms. Two distinct hemarthrosis models were constructed respectively by fresh blood joint injection in WT and joint needle puncture in <i>F8</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice, and then treated with DHA (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. <i>In vitro</i> chondrocytes treated with frozen-thaw blood and DHA (1, 5 or 10 μM) for 24 h. Histopathological, immunofluorescence and western blotting were investigated to demonstrate the effects of DHA on blood-induced chondrocyte senescence, ROS accumulation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Additionally, Nrf2 inhibitor (MLB385, 30 mg/kg for once a four days) and Nrf2-siRNA were used to investigate the relationship between DHA and Nrf2/Keap1 signaling <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, respectively. DHA remarkably ameliorated the cartilage degeneration in both two hemarthrosis models. Similarly, <i>in vitro</i> experiments confirmed that DHA promoted the synthesis of ECM in blood-stimulated chondrocytes with a dose-dependent manner. DHA also effectively suppressed blood-induced chondrocyte senescence and ROS accumulation. Mechanistically, DHA activated the Nrf2 signaling by accelerating Keap1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, Nrf2 siRNA and antagonist abolished the anti-senescence and anti-oxidative functions of DHA, resulting the severe cartilage degeneration in bleeding joint of <i>F8</i> <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice. Our findings indicate that DHA effectively reduces chondrocyte senescence and mitigates cartilage destruction following hemarthrosis via activation of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. On the one hand, this study highlights the important role of chondrocyte senescence in hemarthrosis-induced cartilage degradation, implying that inhibiting chondrocyte senescence may be a viable therapeutic strategy for blood-induced arthropathy. On the other hand, our findings demonstrate the remarkable chondroprotective effect of DHA in bleeding joint by modulating the Nrf2/Keap1 anti-oxidative signaling pathway, suggesting DHA may serve as a potential candidate drug for the therapy of blood-induced arthropathy.",

Reliance on single/limited molecular targets could be detrimental as evidenced by false-negative PfHRP2-based RDTs, and the same may apply to PCR targets. No systematic exploration of the commonly used PCR targets has yet been documented. A systematic search was made using a previously generated database through PubMed® and Google Scholar® and supplemented by additional searches. All studies that used PCR for detecting Plasmodium infections were included in this study. Further information was retrieved on molecular targets used and the type of PCR assay used. An independent search was also made to explore the identification/development of newer molecular targets. Almost all studies (93%) used 18S rRNA gene as a molecular target. Nested PCR alone (68%) was the most frequently used assay. Eighty-five percent of the studies that exploited the 18S rRNA gene target and nested PCR used the approach developed in 1993. Overreliance on a solitary molecular target (18S rRNA gene) for many years might be a cause for concern. Research is needed to validate newer multi-copy targets in terms of limit of detection, robust reproducibility, reduced costs, and a possibility of multiplexing.",

We report retrospectively analyzed data from a cross-sectional study of children aged 2-17 years with acute febrile illness (fever ≤7 days) in Lambaréné, Gabon (NCT03047642). Symptom-based microbiological testing identified infection etiology. Blood count, C-reactive protein, iron parameters, and cytokines levels assessed iron deficiency, anemia, and immune activation. Among 415 screened children with acute febrile illness, hemoglobin and iron parameters are available in 197. Of those, 145 (73.6%) are anemic: 53 (36.6%) show anemia of inflammation (AI), 11 (7.6%) iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), and 29 (20.0%) combined AI/IDA.

Despite the development of the malaria vaccine, widespread adoption continues to be a challenge. This paper explores the factors that influence community engagement as a plausible strategy in promoting the uptake of the malaria vaccine among children under five. A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study design was employed using structured questionnaires. Using a systematic sampling method, a sample of 1,183 was recruited based on sample size table for 2,500 under five population. The study utilized bivariate analysis and random forest analysis to identify important factors influencing community participation in malaria vaccine promotion. The results from the random forest analysis highlighted perception of vaccine effectiveness, educational level, and age as the most relevant factors influencing community engagement. Additionally, the study identified vaccine safety and acceptability as moderate factors that could significantly contribute to promoting community engagement as a strategy for increasing malaria vaccine uptake among children under five. The findings further highlight that individuals with high educational attainment tend to prioritize vaccine effectiveness and safety, while those with lower educational attainment prioritize factors such as vaccine cost and cultural considerations to effectiveness. By tailoring educational programs to address demographic variations in perceptions of vaccine efficacy, community engagement can be leveraged to promote widespread uptake of the malaria vaccine among children under five.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax relapse due to hypnozoites represents a significant mechanism for parasite persistence in the population. Primaquine (PQ), the drug of choice for eliminating hypnozoites, requires metabolic activation by Cytochrome P450-2D6 (CYP2D6). Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can alter PQ metabolism, potentially increasing the risk of relapses. This study aimed to determine CYP2D6 polymorphisms in subjects with Plasmodium vivax under supervised chloroquine-primaquine treatment and explore their association with relapses and PQ plasma levels. CYP2D6 phenotypes and genotypes were successfully determined for 71 out of 78 patients included in the study. Nine polymorphisms (SNPs and indels) and gene copy number variation were analyzed. The association between the CYP2D6 phenotype, P. vivax relapse over six months follow-up, and PQ plasma levels were explored. Most diplotypes (81.7 %) were associated with normal (gNM-F) and ultrarapid (gUM) CYP2D6 metabolizers, while 18.3 % were associated with poor (gPM) and intermediate (gIM and gNM-S) metabolizers. The median plasma PQ concentration on day 2 was higher in impaired CYP2D6 activity group (poor/intermediate) compared normal metabolizers (normal/ultrarapid) (660.4 ng/ml vs 313.5 ng/ml; effect size r -0.51, 95 % CI -0.82 to 0.03). No significant difference was found in the hazard ratio (HR) of relapse between impaired and normal CYP2D6 activity (adjusted HR: 1.45; 95 % CI: 0.39-5.39). Impaired CYP2D6 activity phenotypes were frequent in individuals infected with P. vivax from an endemic region of Colombia.

This case highlights the rarity of adult S. haematobium worms in a sub-granuloma area and explores how they may reach this site. A 25-year-old man presented with hematuria, dysuria, and urinary incontinence, with no prior history of schistosomiasis. Investigations revealed numerous RBCs, pus cells, and S. haematobium eggs in his urine. An abdominal ultrasound showed a thickened bladder wall with filling defects. Cystoscopy revealed two bladder tumors and sandy patches, where multiple mobile worms were found beneath granulomas. The granulomas and worms were completely removed (TURBT). Histopathology confirmed bilharzial granuloma and adult S. haematobium. The patient was treated by empirical regimen postoperatively and reported symptom improvement at follow-up. Schistosomiasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, where over 90 % of cases occur in areas with inadequate sanitation. In Sudan, urinary schistosomiasis was first reported in 1919. The disease manifests in two forms: urogenital, caused by S. haematobium, and intestinal, caused by other species. Adult worms reside in the bladder, and their eggs lead to symptoms such as dysuria and \"sandy patches.\" Praziquantel has been the gold standard treatment for over 30 years. Granulomas around adult worms are rare due to their location in the peri-vesical plexus and inability to migrate to bladder cavity. The presence of viable adult worms in uncommon sites may be explained by many possibilities such as angiogenesis in chronic inflammation or aberrant vascularity that early led the small adult worm to reach this site and to grow to this size. This case mirroring rarity of the presence of adult S. haematobium in sub-granuloma area, it's also discuss the different possibilities of how this adult worm reach this rare site.",

In this study, we examined vaccine-induced responses in semi-immune adults in a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) Phase IIb clinical trial.

Humoral immunity was evaluated by quantifying antigen specific antibody subtypes and subclasses via ELISA, alongside functional antibody properties including avidity and complement fixation elicited by vaccination and challenge. Antigen-specific memory B cells were characterised using FluoroSpot assays to detect concurrent secretion of multiple antibody isotypes and the frequency and phenotypes of circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells were assessed using multiparametric flow cytometry. Vaccination increased antibody titres across IgA, IgM, and IgG isotypes and IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses but not IgG2 or IgG4 subclasses, targeting different vaccine antigens (full-length R21, NANP, and C-terminus), indicating a broad and heterogeneous response. The responses were maintained over time and, importantly, they demonstrated complement-fixing capabilities. IgG+ and IgA+ antigen-specific memory B cells were boosted but were short-lived for IgA. We observed an increase in total CXCR5+/PD1+ cTfh cells following vaccination and challenge with the predominant Th2/Th17 population. We provide insights into the diverse immune responses induced by R21/Matrix-M vaccination and their potential contribution to protection against malaria.

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Despite considerable progress through biomedical interventions, persistent transmission underscores the need to examine additional influencing factors. This scoping review maps existing evidence on community knowledge in malaria prevention and control strategies, aiming to inform more targeted and culturally adapted interventions. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed, English-language studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies focused on community knowledge related to malaria prevention, control, and elimination among non-specific populations. Two independent reviewers screened the literature, while a third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. Data were extracted using a standardised framework and analysed systematically in Microsoft Excel. The review included 63 studies from 27 countries, predominantly from Africa (68.3%) and Asia (28.6%), with a notable increase in publications in 2021. The findings revealed significant regional variations in community knowledge of malaria transmission, symptoms, and prevention. Higher levels of awareness were consistently linked with better preventive practices and earlier treatment-seeking behaviour. However, critical knowledge gaps persisted, particularly concerning environmental risk factors and vector control, highlighting the need for context-specific health education programmes. Community knowledge is a pivotal determinant of malaria prevention success, yet disparities persist across endemic regions. To optimise control efforts, it is essential to prioritise locally tailored, evidence-based education that addresses knowledge gaps and strengthens community engagement. Integrating local perspectives into intervention design will be essential for achieving sustainable malaria elimination.",

        "title": "Host sphingolipids support <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> liver stage development.",
        "abstract": "During the asymptomatic liver stage<i>, Plasmodium</i> resides within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that protects the parasite from immune clearance while also restricting nutrient exchange with its host cell. Although it is known that <i>Plasmodium</i> must scavenge resources from its environment, the specific nutrients sequestered and the mechanisms for transporting them to the PV are poorly understood, particularly during the liver stage. In this study, we investigated the role of host lipids and discovered that sphingolipids are critical for both <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> liver stage development and invasion. Specifically, exogenous C16-ceramide enhanced parasite development and nuclear replication, while sphingomyelin in the host cell membrane was essential for parasite invasion. Live microscopy studies using NBD labeled sphingolipids further found that exogenous lipids are actively transported into the PV with sphingolipid scavenging occurring at all tested time points throughout the liver stage. This was, in part, supported by the host ceramide transporter, CERT1. CERT1 was enriched at the PV and genetic disruption significantly reduced both <i>P. berghei</i> load and ceramide trafficking into the PV. Finally, we identified proteins of the host salvage pathway as critical for the <i>Plasmodium</i> liver stage using chemical and genetic approaches. In particular, depletion of <i>CERS3</i> and <i>SPHK1</i> affected PV size and infection rate, but not invasion. Our findings enhance our understanding of host-parasite lipid interactions and may offer novel therapeutic targets to reduce disease burden.IMPORTANCE<i>Plasmodium</i>, the causative agent of malaria, remains a significant global health challenge, placing approximately half the world's population at risk of infection. Despite the existence of antimalarial treatments, the emergence of drug-resistant parasites highlights the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets. The <i>Plasmodium</i> liver stage represents a promising avenue for drug discovery as inhibiting parasite development would prevent both symptomatic disease and transmission to the mosquito vector. In this study, we examined the role of host sphingolipids and found that members perform distinct functions, supporting parasite invasion and/or development. We also identified several host proteins that influence <i>Plasmodium</i> liver stage viability and contribute to sphingolipid acquisition. In addition to their role in the liver stage, sphingolipids are known to be critical for the asexual and sexual blood stages, suggesting that targeting host sphingolipid metabolism could offer a novel multistage therapeutic strategy against malaria.",

        "abstract": "A novel oral combination of the long-acting antimalarials pyronaridine (PYR) and piperaquine (PQP) has potential for malaria chemoprevention. This single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the effects of PYR and PQP alone and when co-administered on Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF). Between February 14, 2022, and May 31, 2022, thirty-seven healthy black adults of African sub-Saharan origin were enrolled and randomized to PYR + PQP (n = 15), PYR + placebo (n = 8), PQP + placebo (n = 8) or double placebo (n = 6) administered once daily (fasted) for 3 days at doses approved for malaria treatment. Triplicate digitalized electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and pharmacokinetic samples were taken at matched timepoints. Concentration-response analysis was performed for QTcF changes from baseline (ΔQTcF), and the impact of PYR, PQP, and PYR + PQP administration on placebo-corrected ΔQTcF (ΔΔQTcF) was assessed. The final qualified and validated concentration-QTc model included a linear component for PYR and an E<sub>max</sub> component for PQP. The maximum predicted effect on ΔΔQTcF on day 3 was +4.94 msec (90% CI 0.338, 9.54) with PYR + placebo, +19.2 msec (14.6, 23.8) with PQP + placebo, and + 23.1 msec (18.5, 27.6) with PYR + PQP. As expected, PQP increased ΔΔQTcF above the regulatory threshold of concern (+10 msec), whereas PYR did not. The small additional increase in ΔΔQTcF with PYR + PQP coadministration was explained mainly by an increase in PQP C<sub>max</sub> (1.4-fold) versus monotherapy. In healthy adults, PYR + PQP coadministration does not appear to increase significantly the effect of PQP on ΔΔQTcF versus PQP administered alone. However, further studies are needed in malaria patients to confirm these findings in the target population.

        "abstract": "A study in Burkina Faso revealed ivermectin inhibits malaria transmission by killing malaria parasites and mosquitoes. However, it is unknown what effect this drug will have on the malaria transmission intensities of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To address this issue, we created a mathematical model using malaria transmission data from 41 SSA countries to evaluate the antimalarial benefits of a mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. To account for ivermectin's effect on malaria, we incorporate estimates of its ability to inhibit malaria transmission and kill mosquitoes. We consider scenarios where 0, 12.5 %, 25.0 %, and 50.0 % of the population receive ivermectin over five years and estimate malaria incidence averted, disability-adjusted life years saved, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Our findings show that an MDA of ivermectin to 12.5 %, 25 %, or 50 % of the population annually averts 248.7, 261.4, and 288.7 incidences per thousand people and saves 5.4, 5.7, and 6.3 disability-adjusted life years, respectively. These values indicate that an MDA of ivermectin would be cost-effective in 41, 18, and 6 countries, and very cost-effective in 22, 6, and 3 countries for the 12.5 %, 25 %, and 50 % scenarios. Altogether, our results indicate that ivermectin would prevent a substantial number of malaria incidences and save disability-adjusted life years in the majority of SSA. Therefore, an MDA of ivermectin would greatly aid in ongoing malaria control efforts and should be considered strongly as a complementary intervention to current malaria protocols.",

        "abstract": "Since time immemorial, Tanzanians, particularly the Luguru tribe, have utilised medicinal herbs (MHs) to manage various ailments. However, few ethnobotanical studies have been conducted to document and quantitatively analyze them. This study documents and quantitatively analyzes MHs used by the Luguru people of Morogoro Rural District to address various ailments. The research was conducted between September 2022 and October 2023. Ethnobotanical data on MH were collected from 100 informants identified through the snowball method, employing semistructured interviews, focus group discussions, and field walks. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an independent samples <i>t</i>-test were employed to examine statistically significant differences among social demographic variables. Quantitative indices, including family use value (FUV), MH use value (UV), fidelity level (FL), plant part value (PPV), and informant agreement ratio (IAR), were computed. A total of 30 MHs belonging to 13 families were reported to be used for managing various ailments. Asteraceae was the most represented family (seven species, FUV = 2.23). <i>Vernonia amygdalina</i> Del. (Asteraceae) had the highest UV index (0.571), while the root was the most utilised plant part (0.692). Malaria and fever (0.96) and metabolic disorders (0.94) had the highest IAR. The preferred modes of preparation and administration were decoction and oral, respectively. Female, illiterate, and elderly informants possessed significantly higher medicinal knowledge. The study demonstrates that the Luguru people possess a rich understanding of MHs and continue to rely on them to treat various ailments. The MHs with high UV, IAR, and FL can be a foundation for future phytochemical and pharmacological studies.",

The anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity of ethanol-extracted Propolis was assessed against <i>P. falciparum</i> NF54 using the SYBR Green I fluorescence assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified major phytochemicals in the most active extract. Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the binding affinity and stability of selected compounds (tectochrysin and galangin) against PfLDH in both holo (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 1LDG) and apo (PDB ID: 2X8L) forms. Propolis collected from Kermanshah city exhibited the highest anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.69 ± 1.44 μg/mL). GC-MS analysis identified tectochrysin and galangin as major constituents. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities of tectochrysin (-7.8 kcal/mol) and galangin (-7.5 kcal/mol) to PfLDH, surpassing the binding energies of standard antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and quinine). MD simulations confirmed the stability of tectochrysin and galangin within the PfLDH active sites, with favorable root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, molecular surface area, and polar surface area profiles, indicating persistent and stable protein-ligand interactions throughout the simulation. The findings support the promising anti-<i>Plasmodium</i> potential of Propolis-derived compounds, particularly tectochrysin and galangin, as novel PfLDH inhibitors.

        "abstract": "Babesiosis is a parasitic protozoan infection caused primarily by <i>Babesia microti</i> in the United States. Its presentation can imitate that of malaria, which often leads to misdiagnosis. We present here a case of a 54-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who was initially diagnosed with malaria but, with further investigation, was found to have babesiosis. The patient initially presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia, prompting an extensive and meticulous workup including a peripheral blood smear and autoimmune studies. From these tests, we were able to diagnose her with a malarial infection that was treated with quinine and doxycycline, then atovaquone/proguanil following worsening infection. Despite the appropriate treatment, she developed septic shock and respiratory failure, prompting a higher level of care in the intensive care unit. With persistent parasitemia, a sample was sent to the department of health for speciation, which determined that she was infected with Babesia. Clinically, she improved after the transition to atovaquone and azithromycin, but unfortunately, she was readmitted due to persistent hemolysis and pneumonia requiring extended antibiotic therapy and supportive care. This case highlights the challenges posed by the similarities of babesia and malaria infection and emphasizes the importance of geographical location and confirmatory testing in differentiating these two infections. It raises awareness among clinicians regarding tick-borne illnesses in endemic regions, as in this case, to minimize delays in diagnosis and treatment. This case also shows how early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent severe complications of babesiosis, including septic shock, especially in the immunocompromised and elderly population.",

The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. 85 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 34) researched an intervention for infectious disease prevention or control and 70 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 28) were randomized controlled trials. 75 % of studies were located in Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 15) or Pakistan (<i>n</i> = 15). 40 % of studies focused on diarrheal diseases (<i>n</i> = 16) and 28 % on malaria (<i>n</i> = 11). Common identified research challenges included population mobility, limited external validity, and low recruitment. No studies included the community in the initial study conception or investigated the research impact on the community. Community involvement was often through community health workers (45 %). Of the 18 studies that studied a resource-based intervention, 20 % explicitly noted that the intervention was unsustainable. While guidelines for conducting research in displaced settings exist, there are gaps in their utilization. We identified a disconnect between where displaced individuals reside and where research is conducted, as well as a prioritization of particular infectious diseases. Researchers identified numerous challenges in conducting research in these settings, though the community was rarely involved in the research.

While poverty alleviation interventions show promise for improving health outcomes, evidence specifically for people with disabilities remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a disability-inclusive graduation (DIG) programme on health outcomes among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda. We conducted a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial in four districts of Northern Uganda. Clusters were randomly assigned to either the DIG intervention (96 clusters) or control group (89 clusters). This analysis focused on households with people with disabilities, as identified by the Washington Group Short Set questions and verified by BRAC programme managers. Households in treatment clusters received up to 18 months DIG intervention between December 2020 and June 2022, combining asset transfers, cash support, skills training, financial inclusion activities, and disability-specific services including rehabilitation and assistive devices. The primary outcome was experience of illness/injury in the past 3 months, assessed at both first follow-up (immediately post-intervention) and second follow-up (about 16 months post-intervention), with secondary outcomes including unmet health needs, mental health status, unmet assistive product needs, and healthcare expenditure. Effects were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression or generalized estimating equations, reporting minimally-adjusted and fully-adjusted mean differences (FAMD) or odds ratios (FAOR) with 95% CIs. The trial was registered with RIDIE (RIDIE-STUDY-ID-626008898983a) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN-78592382). At baseline, 691 participants (370 intervention, 321 control) were included. The DIG intervention did not significantly impact overall illness/injury prevalence at either first follow-up (41.18% vs 45.86%, FAOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22) or second follow-up (55.65% vs 53.98%, FAOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.56). However, the intervention demonstrated a progressively strengthening effect on reducing unmet health needs, from marginal improvement immediately post-intervention (FAOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.02, p = 0.06) to significant reduction at 16 months post-intervention (FAOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Notably, the intervention produced temporal potential shifts in disease patterns, with malaria showing contrasting trends between follow-up periods. Sex-differentiated effects emerged by second follow-up, with females in the intervention group experiencing fewer injuries (FAOR for interaction 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.74, p = 0.02) but more pain-related conditions compared to males (FAOR for interaction 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.59, p = 0.04), though these subgroup findings require replication in future studies. No significant differences were observed in mental health outcomes or health expenditure. This first randomized evaluation of a disability-inclusive graduation programme demonstrates that while economic empowerment alone may not reduce overall illness prevalence among people with disabilities, it can progressively improve healthcare access over time. The temporal evolution of effects and emerging sex-differentiated impacts highlight the need for sustained support and gender-sensitive approaches in future disability-inclusive poverty reduction programmes, with additional health-specific components to achieve broader improvements in health outcomes.

This resistance undermines the efficacy of existing treatments, making it imperative to develop and explore novel therapeutic approaches. Diverse strategies, including the concept of hybrid drugs, the development of advanced analogs of existing drugs, and drug repurposing, have been employed to counter drug resistance by outmaneuvering the evolution of resistant parasites and restoring the effectiveness of treatments. In this review, we delve into the significant findings reported between 2020 and 2024, with the aim of providing an overview of the state of protozoal disease treatment, highlighting the progress made, exploring promising avenues for tackling these devastating diseases, and offering insights into future directions for overcoming the persistent challenge of drug resistance. Given that the emergence of drug resistance calls for a multifaceted approach to address protozoal infections, long-term success depends on interdisciplinary research collaborations, equitable access to treatment, and appropriate drug resistance surveillance, in addition to the advancement of research and the development of therapeutic strategies described in this review.",

        "title": "Bridging urban-rural disparities in malaria care during pregnancy in Senegal: evidence from household and health facility surveys.",
        "abstract": "Despite the World Health Organization's recommendations, the uptake of Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) in Senegal remains suboptimal, with disparities observed between urban and rural areas. More remains to be known about how malaria service readiness would affect the utilization of IPTp-SP. Data were obtained from seven annual rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Service Provision Assessments (SPA) in Senegal from 2012 to 2019. Using sample domain linkage to link the databases at the regional level. A malaria service readiness index was calculated to quantify the malaria service delivery capacity within the service environment where women reside. The Heckman selection model was utilized to analyze the relationship between malaria service readiness and IPTp-SP utilization. From 2012 to 2019, the average number of IPTp-SP doses received in Senegal was 1.66 (95% CI: 1.65-1.68), higher in urban areas [1.73 (95% CI: 1.71-1.75)] than rural areas [1.63 (95% CI: 1.62-1.65)]. Each one-point increase in malaria service readiness led to a rise of 0.251 doses in IPTp-SP. The significant interaction (Coef. = - 0.523, P < 0.001) indicated that women in rural areas received fewer doses of IPTp-SP (0.089) than in urban areas (0.612) for every unit increase in malaria service readiness. Linking household and health facility surveys revealed significant room for improvement in malaria service readiness and IPTp-SP utilization in rural areas in Senegal. For better IPTp-SP coverage, differential strategies are required for urban and rural settings. Urban areas need to enhance malaria service readiness, while rural areas should focus on improving service readiness alongside infrastructure and community engagement to bridge the urban-rural disparities.",

        "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, results from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein whose deficiency impacts many targeted mRNA and brain functions. However, how these FMRP targets contribute to the pathogenesis of FXS is not fully understood, and effective treatment is lacking. Here, we identify signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a target of FMRP in adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). FMRP regulates Stat3 mRNA stability and protein translation, and loss of FMRP results in elevated Stat3 mRNA and protein, leading to aberrant neurogenesis and impaired dendritic maturation in adult NSCs and developing neurons. Activation of Stat3 in adult mouse hippocampal NSCs impairs cognitive flexibility. We show that STAT3 phosphorylation specifically binds to MYC, which is essential for adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Both genetic reduction of STAT3 and pharmacological treatment with artesunate, the first-line drug for treating malaria worldwide, rescue neurogenic and cognitive deficits in FMRP-deficient mice. Our work reveals a potential regulatory role for FMRP and STAT3-MYC signaling pathway in adult neurogenesis and cognitive flexibility, and provides a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating adult FXS patients.",

        "title": "Increased reproductive cancer risks following early-life dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure: Evidence from a historical population-based study in Taiwan (1952-1957).",
        "abstract": "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was extensively applied for malaria control in Taiwan between 1952 and 1957, resulting in widespread early-life exposure. Limited evidence suggests that exposure to DDT during critical developmental windows may increase the risk of endocrine-related malignancies in adulthood. To investigate this association, we conducted a left-truncated cohort study utilizing Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), including 2,327,099 individuals born during the DDT-based malaria eradication campaign. DDT exposure levels were estimated from historical indoor residual spraying records and categorized into six groups based on township-level spraying frequency (0-5 times). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to estimate the association between early-life DDT exposure and the cumulative incidence of reproductive cancers. Over a 22-year follow-up (2000-2022), 81,592 reproductive cancer cases were identified. Each additional episode of township-level DDT spraying was significantly associated with an elevated cancer risk (aHR: 1.04, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.04 in women; aHR: 1.05, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.07 in men). Among women, breast (aHR: 1.04, 95 % CI:1.03-1.05), corpus uteri (aHR: 1.03, 95 % CI:1.01-1.05), and ovarian cancers (aHR: 1.06, 95 % CI:1.02-1.09) showed the strongest associations. In men, prostate cancer demonstrated the highest risk (aHR: 1.05, 95 % CI:1.03-1.07). A significant dose-response trend was observed (p < 0.0001). This historical exposure setting, grounded in a unique context and a nationwide database, provides epidemiologic evidence on the potential association between early-life DDT exposure and long-term carcinogenic risk. The findings contribute to the limited body of evidence from Asia and underscore the need for long-term surveillance in countries where DDT spraying is still ongoing.",

        "abstract": "In order to overcome obstacles in diagnosis, surveillance, treatment, and vector control, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial weapon in the fight against malaria. The eradication of malaria has benefited greatly from the exceptional accuracy and efficiency of AI-driven solutions. This review of the literature examines several uses of AI in the fight against malaria, emphasizing new developments. AI-driven solutions have the potential to improve malaria prevention and eradication efforts with sustained innovation and investment, ultimately enhancing global health security. AI is transforming the treatment of malaria by facilitating personalised medicine, speeding up drug discovery, and enhancing diagnostics. AI is improving treatment approaches and tackling the problems caused by drug-resistant malaria parasites through machine learning, deep learning, and in silico drug repurposing. Achieving long-term malaria eradication targets will require sustained investment in AI-driven malaria research. In epidemiological tracking, artificial intelligence (AI) has also become a potent instrument. AI-driven methods offer creative ways to find novel treatment approaches, maximize drug discovery, and forecast the dynamics of malaria transmission, especially in light of the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to current medications. Thus, this review paper provides insights into the developments made by AI in combating malaria.",

        "title": "Identification of chemosensory protein inhibitors as a potential strategy to combat pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae.",
        "abstract": "Insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae, the primary malaria vector, poses a serious threat to global public health. Chemosensory proteins (CSPs), key components of the insect olfactory system responsible for detecting chemical signals, have been implicated in insecticide resistance by binding and sequestering pyrethroids, thereby reducing their bioavailability at target sites. Developing effective strategies to counteract CSP-mediated insecticide resistance remains a critical challenge in modern vector and pest control. In this study, we identified two cinnamaldehyde derivatives, α-hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA) and α-pentylcinnamaldehyde (PCA), as high-affinity ligands for Anopheles gambiae CSPs (AgCSPs). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays revealed that HCA and PCA bind AgCSPs with significantly higher affinities than deltamethrin and permethrin. Notably, preincubation of AgCSPs with HCA and PCA effectively blocked pyrethroid binding, indicating competitive occupation of the same binding sites. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further elucidated the binding modes of these ligands, which were experimentally validated through site-directed mutagenesis. Bioassays with mosquito larvae confirmed the in vitro findings, showing that AgCSP-sequestered deltamethrin treatment significantly reduced larval mortality compared to deltamethrin alone. Importantly, the addition of PCA competitively displaced deltamethrin from AgCSPs, restoring its insecticidal efficacy. Our findings suggest that high-affinity CSP inhibitors capable of competitively blocking insecticide sequestration represent a promising strategy for overcoming CSP-mediated resistance. This study provides a foundation for the development of novel insecticide synergists to enhance the efficacy of pyrethroids and combat resistance in malaria vectors. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

        "abstract": "Semi-field experiments are an efficient way of assessing the impacts of potential new vector control tools (VCTs) before field trials. However, their design is critically important to ensure their results are unbiased and informative. An essential element of the design of semi-field experiments is power analysis, which empowers researchers to ensure that only designs with adequate statistical power are adopted. In this study, a methodology was developed, and its use was demonstrated in a tutorial, to determine the required number of semi-field chambers, sampling frequency and the number of mosquitoes required to achieve sufficient power for evaluating the impact of a single VCT or two in combination. By analysing data simulated from a generalized linear mixed-effects model, power was estimated for various experimental designs, including short- (24 h) vs. long-term (3 months) experiments and single vs. combined application of interventions (e.g., insecticide-treated nets combined with pyriproxyfen autodissemination). Although power increased with increasing number of chambers, sampling frequency and the number of mosquitoes, the number of chambers and variance between chambers were the dominant factors determining power relative to all other design choices. High variance between chambers decreased power, highlighting the importance of making conditions similar among chambers, by reducing variation if possible and by rotating variables if not. As compared to a single intervention, an additional intervention required an increase in the number of chambers, while short and long experiments were similar in terms of key aspects such as the number of chambers per treatment. Determining the most efficient experimental design for a semi-field experiment will depend on a balance of design choices and resource constraints. The power analysis framework and tutorial provided here can aid in the robust design of these widely used experiments and ultimately facilitate the development of new vector control tools (VCTs).",

        "abstract": "Malaria case management is a vital component of strategies to ensure malaria elimination programme. Despite continuous preventive strategies in place, malaria remains a major public health problem in resource-limited countries particularly in Ethiopia due to treatment-related problems. Hence, this study aimed to determine the level of adherence to malaria diagnosis and treatment guidelines among healthcare providers working in the public health facilities in Southwest Ethiopian Peoples Regional State (SWEPRS). A facility-based cross-sectional study triangulated with qualitative inquiry was applied from March 2024 and July 2024. A multi-stage stratified and purposive sampling technique was used for the quantitative and qualitative study, respectively. Data were collected by the records review, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), and In-depth Interviews (IDIs). The adherence of healthcare providers was evaluated according to recommendations of the current malaria diagnosis and treatment guidelines. The findings in the qualitative analysis were presented in the thematic analysis and triangulated with the quantitative findings. 1,684 patient cards were reviewed. The mean age of patients was 20.99 (± 15.61) years. 1,616 (95.96%) patients were screened through microscopy and/or multispecies rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). The overall adherence of healthcare providers to the updated malaria treatment standards was 36.99% (95%CI: 33.93-38.52%) and the majority, 982 (58.31%) were diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum followed by Plasmodium vivax, and mixed infections. Shortage of anti-malarial drugs was reported as the foremost barrier followed by lack of training on the updated malaria case management guideline, shortage of health professionals, and lack of laboratory materials. In addition, shortage of electric supply, shortage of computers, shortage of outpatient department (OPD) rooms, lack of transport, distance from a health facility, community resistance, improper use of prescribed anti-malarial drugs, perceived inefficacy of drugs, inability to afford the anti-malarial drugs, lack of new malaria case management guideline, lack of private pharmacy, language barriers, and poor quality of Giemsa, were identified barriers. The adherence level of healthcare providers was found to be low. Hence, ensuring the availability of all nationally recommended anti-malarial drugs and supplies, qualified health professionals, providing continuous training, strengthening continuous follow-up and supervision in the public health facilities are recommended to improve the adherence level of health professionals to national malaria treatment guideline.",

Malaria, characterized by marked endothelial activation and microvascular pathology, may involve endocan, but its role remains unclear. This study aimed to assess serum endocan levels in various clinical presentations of malaria and evaluate its correlation with laboratory parameters of disease severity. Leftover serum samples from 99 participants were categorized into four groups: healthy controls (n = 20), Plasmodium vivax malaria (n = 36), uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (n = 30), and severe P. falciparum malaria (n = 13). Serum endocan concentrations were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on day 0 (pre-treatment) and day 7 (post-treatment). Correlation analyses examined associations between endocan levels and laboratory parameters, including parasite density, white blood cell count, haemoglobin, and platelet count. All malaria groups showed significantly higher serum endocan levels compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Levels were highest in severe P. falciparum (median 4.67 [IQR 2.85-7.93] ng/ml), followed by uncomplicated P. falciparum (median 3.27 [IQR 2.24-4.33] ng/ml), and P. vivax malaria (median 1.85 [IQR 1.44-3.23] ng/ml).

        "abstract": "Ethiopia aims to eliminate local malaria transmission by 2030, but rising malaria cases, due to different factors, present a challenge. Understanding the prevalence and distribution of artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) and other markers related to partner drugs as well as parasite connectivity in Ethiopia can greatly inform malaria control. We analyzed 1199 clinical Plasmodium falciparum infections from 12 sentinel sites across five regions in Ethiopia, collected between 2019 and 2023. Using two molecular inversion probe (MIP) panels targeting key drug resistance genes and genome-wide SNPs, we assessed the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations, complexity of infection (COI), and parasite relatedness through identity-by-descent (IBD) and principal component analysis (PCA). The most prevalent k13 R622I mutation appears in 15.7% of samples, with marked regional variation. Three validated ART-R mutations (P441L, P574L, A675V) are detected in Ethiopia for the first time, as far as we are aware, with A675V found exclusively in a Gambella clinic serving refugees from Sudan and South Sudan. Additionally, polymorphisms associated with resistance to partner drugs, including those in crt, mdr1, dhps, and dhfr genes, are nearly fixed. Most samples (87.2%) consist of monogenomic infections (COI = 1), and mutant parasites show high local genetic relatedness at the health facility level, suggesting clonal transmission. PCA reveals regional clustering, particularly in Gambella, highlighting the influence of local drug pressure, regional transmission dynamics, and importation as drivers of the observed drug resistance patterns. The increasing prevalence of k13 R622I and the emergence of additional ART-R mutations underscore the urgent need for enhanced ACT efficacy monitoring. Early detection of partner drug resistance and ACT failure will be essential to address malaria resurgence and support Ethiopia's elimination goals.",

During the design stage, CRT sample sizes need to be inflated to account for the cluster heterogeneity in measured outcomes. The coefficient of variation (k), a measure of such heterogeneity, is typically used in malaria CRTs yet is often predicted without prior data. Underestimation of k decreases study power, thus increases the probability of generating null results. In this meta-analysis of cluster-summary data from 24 malaria CRTs, we calculate true prevalence and incidence k values using methods-of-moments and regression modelling approaches. Using random effects regression modelling, we investigate the impact of empirical k values on original trial power and explore factors associated with elevated k. Results show empirical estimates of k often exceed those used in sample size calculations, which reduces study power and effect size precision. Elevated k values are associated with incidence outcomes (compared to prevalence), lower endemicity settings, and uneven intervention coverage across clusters. Study findings can enhance the robustness of future malaria CRT sample size calculations by providing informed k estimates based on expected prevalence or incidence, in the absence of cluster-level data.",

Following decades of intense research efforts, the first malaria vaccine has been approved for clinical use in October of 2021. However, its 36 % efficacy highlights the ongoing need for novel and effective drugs to combat malaria. The majority of current antimalarials are derivatives of previous efficient compounds whilst new treatments with diverse chemical scaffolds have not been implemented into clinical practice since 1996. We argue that current research efforts should focus on developing novel chemical classes of compounds to help fight drug resistant malaria. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the antimalarial treatments currently in clinical use and discuss their significant limitations due to parasite drug resistance. Further, we discuss various approaches to antimalarial drug discovery and offer new perspectives on the topic, informing on current methods, both rarely and extensively used. Collating the most recent and up-to-date drug discovery strategies will not only maximise current global research efforts but will ensure all possible drug development avenues are trialed.

        "abstract": "Mosquito control has successfully reduced the burden of malaria globally, but current vector control technologies cannot achieve malaria elimination. Precision guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT) is one of the most promising interventions being developed for malaria elimination. Mass release of genetically sterile males can act as a chemical-free species-specific insecticide. Before translating pgSIT from the bench to the field, however, it is essential to understand the potential costs and capabilities of this technology in a malaria-endemic region to determine if further investment into research and development of this technology is worthwhile. Therefore, we estimated the health outcomes and costs of a pgSIT program working jointly with current interventions to control the Anopheles gambiae malaria vector in the Upper River region of The Gambia. The pgSIT intervention in this region is predicted to prevent approximately 230 deaths and about 48,000 sick days per year. We have provided a range of costs that include risks associated with research and development, the facility, mass rearing efficiency, and distribution. This intervention should save disability-adjusted life years (DALY) at 11-94 USD per year and will prevent cases at 10-86 USD per infection. These estimates predict that pgSIT will cost 0.36-3.03 USD per person in the treated region annually. The cost per DALY shows life-saving at a cost comparable to current interventions in the Upper River region.",

A phenotypic screen uncovered the <i>N</i>-aryl acetamide class that inhibits the development of <i>P. falciparum</i> asexual ring-stage parasites. The structure-activity relationship of this class was investigated, and key modifications were introduced that produced WEHI-326 with potent antimalarial activity. Enhancing the metabolic stability of this class will be a future challenge to achieve efficacy in a malaria mouse model. WEHI-326 was found to have a moderate barrier to resistance and a moderate rate of asexual kill, potently inhibited gametocyte and gamete development, and in turn, blocked the transmission of parasites to the mosquito. Forward genetics and cross-resistance profiling determined that parasites resistant to <i>N</i>-aryl acetamides had mutations in rhomboid protease 8 (ROM8) and the putative cation channel, CSC1.

Parasites were genetically depauperate: 1726 single-genotype infections comprised 166 unique genomes (≥90% IBD), while nine families (≥45% IBD) accounted for 62.5% of parasites sampled. Parasite effective population size decreased over the study period, but there was minimal change in artemisinin resistance alleles until 2020, when just one predominant genotype (carrying kelch13-R561H) remained. We observed sustained localized transmission of unique parasite genotypes revealing transmission chains: this resulted in positive correlations in parasite relatedness for ≤20 km. MDA resulted in parasite founder effects, providing genomic evidence for the efficacy of this control tool.

Attributes of lead candidate T111 include potent in vitro activity against cultured parasites, ex vivo activity against clinical isolates, oral single dose cure in an asexual blood stage rodent model, inhibition of sexual blood stage parasites, activity against relapsing parasites in non-human primate liver cells, prevention of parasite development in mosquitoes, and synergy in combination with tafenoquine against blood and liver stage parasites. Analysis of parasites selected for resistance to T111 suggested inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, but with a mechanism distinct from that of other antimalarials in use or under development. Safety profiles, including toxicology evaluations in rats, showed a favorable therapeutic index. Overall, T111 emerges as a promising candidate for treatment and prevention of malaria.",

        "abstract": "In Uganda, malaria is a year-round health threat, with transmission intensity varying across regions. Despite ongoing intensified interventions, an unprecedented malaria resurgence in early 2022 affected several districts, prompting a swift response from the National Malaria Control Division (NMCD). This study aims to assess the scale and underlying causes of the epidemics, quantify the excess cases and deaths, and propose targeted prevention and response strategies. District Health Information System (DHIS2) data from 2017 to 2022 were analysed. A 75th percentile threshold from 2017 to 2021 was used to define true malaria epidemics and compare them to the suspected 2022 epidemic. Excess cases, admissions, and deaths were quantified using area under the curve (AUC) calculations. The level of epidemics was compared across districts with Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) and Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) interventions. Precipitation data from multiple sources were used to evaluate rainfall patterns and their impact on malaria epidemics. Malaria cases were lowest in 2018 but rose by 31% in 2022 compared to the 2017-2021 3rd quartile. Sixty-four of 146 districts experienced epidemics, with 4 facing persistent epidemics year-round. The 2022 epidemic accounted for 3,379,309 (95% CI 1,553,714, 5,339,709) total excess outpatient malaria cases (confirmed and presumed), 3,018,920 (95% CI 1,321,951, 4,661,201) excess confirmed cases, 149,789 (95% CI 66,029, 235,743) excess inpatient cases. Paradoxically, more epidemics occurred in IRS and iCCM districts. Precipitation patterns were consistent across years and were insignificantly correlated with the 2022 epidemic. Provinces with bimodal rainfall patterns were more prone to epidemics, while unimodal regions had fewer epidemics but higher incidence rates. Rainfall lagged by two months (Lag 2) significantly increased malaria incidence (p < 0.01), with each millimetre of rainfall two months prior associated with 13.4 additional malaria cases. The 2022 malaria epidemic affected 64 districts, with over 3.3 million excess cases and nearly 150,000 excess admissions. Gaps in IRS, iCCM, and intervention coverage, along with minimal rainfall correlation and high vulnerability in bimodal regions, highlight the need for better surveillance, sustainable funding, and tailored responses. While climate was not the main driver, programmatic deficiencies, vector composition shift, reduced efficacy of insecticides, coverage and effectiveness of the interventions likely fueled the epidemic. Strengthening epidemic preparedness, response, and investment will be crucial to preventing future outbreaks and achieving long-term malaria control in Uganda.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant public health challenge in Tanzania, with women of reproductive age particularly vulnerable to its effects. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) are a proven vector control strategy; however, their usage remains suboptimal due to various barriers. This study examines the sociodemographic, behavioural, and environmental factors associated with ITN use among women of reproductive age in Tanzania. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS). A total of 15,254 women aged 15-49 years were included in the study. Survey-weighted logistic regression was employed to determine adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for factors associated with ITN usage. All data cleaning and analyses were done using STATA 17 software. Several factors were significantly associated with ITN use. Women with primary education had 2.2 times higher odds of ITN use compared to those with no education (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.23-4.06). Women residing in the Southern zone had nearly three times higher odds of using ITNs (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.57-5.09), while those in the Lake zone had 1.6 times higher odds (AOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.12-2.33) compared to the Western zone. Women in polygamous marriages had lower odds of ITN use (AOR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61-0.95) compared to those in monogamous relationships. Perceived ITN effectiveness was a strong predictor, with those in the high-effectiveness category having 2.7 times higher odds of ITN use (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 0.94-5.46). ITN usage among women of reproductive age in Tanzania is influenced by education level, geographic location, marital status, and perceived ITN effectiveness. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, such as educational campaigns, equitable ITN distribution, and context-appropriate malaria prevention strategies, to improve ITN coverage and reduce the malaria burden.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant global health issue, particularly among children under 5 years of age and pregnant women. In Guinea and Sierra Leone, malaria care in these vulnerable groups remains suboptimal and may have deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, evidence on the state of the malaria care cascade is urgently needed to guide public health interventions after the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional household survey to evaluate the state of the malaria care cascade-in terms of care-seeking, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes-and explore factors associated with receiving malaria testing during an episode of fever among children under 5 years of age and pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic between May and August 2022. Steps of the care cascade were assessed against WHO recommendations, and factors associated with receiving a malaria test were explored by multivariable regression. We surveyed caregivers of 1377 children under 5 years of age and 254 pregnant women with an episode of fever in three regions and three districts in Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively. Reported malaria testing rates varied from 42% to 96% in children and 62% to 91% in pregnant women by region/district. Trust in the healthcare system, not avoiding health facilities, receiving informative messages about malaria and pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) services were factors associated with receiving a malaria test. Between 54% and 81% of children and 24% to 69% of pregnant women with malaria received treatment within 2 days of fever-onset by region/district, while delays were reported at all steps of the care cascade. Hospitalisation due to the malaria episode was reported by 6.5% and 4.3% of children, as well as 9.5% and 12% of pregnant women in Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively. Our study reveals maintained reported use of malaria care services during the COVID-19 pandemic and heterogeneous potential for improvement along all steps of the malaria care cascade in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Interventions promoting trust in the healthcare system, informative malaria messages and ANC coverage among pregnant women may improve malaria care in both countries.",

        "abstract": "Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine threatens the antimalarial effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (ITPp-SP) in sub-Saharan Africa. We updated an aggregated-data meta-analysis to assess the associations between sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance and the effectiveness of IPTp-SP to inform policy. We searched databases (Jan 1, 1990, to June 8, 2024) for observational studies or trials reporting data on malaria, low birthweight (<2500 g), anaemia, and other outcomes by IPTp-SP dose and matched these by year and location with studies that reported on molecular markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. Studies including only women with HIV or combined interventions were excluded. We evaluated how sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance influenced the adjusted risk ratio (aRR) between three and two doses of IPTp-SP for various outcomes using Poisson mixed-effects models that allowed for non-linear relationships. Initially, we performed a threshold analysis, stratified by region, to identify the resistance levels most predictive of altered effect of IPTp-SP doses on malaria parasitaemia at delivery (peripheral or placental parasitaemia by any test), our primary outcome. These resistance strata were then used in all subsequent models for other outcomes. All analyses were adjusted for malaria transmission intensity, HIV infection, percentage of paucigravidae, and insecticide-treated net use. Performance of models was evaluated using cross-validation. The trial was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021250359). Overall, 122 studies involving 148 693 participants were included. For west and central Africa (69 studies comprising 63 745 participants), very low resistance was categorised as a prevalence of the dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) Lys540Glu mutation in the parasite population of less than 4%, and low resistance as a prevalence of Lys540Glu of 4% or higher. In east and southern Africa (53 studies comprising 84 948 participants), moderate resistance was categorised as a prevalence of the Lys540Glu mutation of less than 60% combined with a prevalence of the Ala581Gly mutation of less than 5%, high resistance as a prevalence of Lys540Glu of 60% or higher combined with a prevalence of Ala581Gly of less than 5%, and very high resistance as a prevalence of the Lys540Glu mutation of 60% or higher combined with a prevalence of Ala581Gly of 5% or higher. There was a marked trend towards lower efficacy of IPTp-SP on reducing malaria infection with increasing resistance levels. In west and central Africa, when comparing three versus two doses, the aRR was 0·71 (95% CI 0·65-0·78) in areas with very low resistance and 0·83 (0·72-0·95) in areas with low resistance (p=0·0144 for the difference between dose-response curves in very low vs low resistance). For east and southern Africa, the same trend was observed: the aRR was 0·63 (95% CI 0·57-0·69) in areas with moderate resistance, 0·89 (0·82-0·96) in areas with high resistance, and 0·93 (0·85-1·01) in areas with very high resistance (p<0·0001 for dose-response curves differences between moderate vs high and moderate vs very high resistance). This pattern was not seen for low birthweight. When comparing three versus two doses in west and central Africa, the aRR was 0·58 (95% CI 0·48-0·68) in areas with very low resistance and 0·56 (0·44-0·68) in areas with low resistance (p=0·72 for dose-response curves very low vs low resistance). For east and southern Africa, the aRR was 0·75 (95% CI 0·52-0·98) in areas with moderate resistance, 0·73 (0·69-0·78) in areas with high resistance, and 0·75 (0·63-0·87) in areas with very high resistance (p=0·80 for dose-response curves moderate vs high resistance; p=0·90 for moderate vs very high resistance). Dose comparisons in some resistance strata were limited by sample size. IPTp-SP antimalarial efficacy is greatly reduced in very high resistance areas. However, it remains effective at reducing low birthweight in these areas, possibly through non-malaria effects on fetal growth. While IPTp-SP use should continue in high SP-resistance areas, alternative malaria preventive strategies are urgently needed in these areas. WHO and WorldWide-Antimalarial-Resistance-Network.",

        "abstract": "The recurrent occurrence of malaria and anemia are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In tropical regions, malaria is a major contributor to anemia which occurs due to reduced hemoglobin levels caused by hemolysis of infected and uninfected red blood cells and as a result bone marrow dyserythropoiesis. Though malaria and anemia are two interlinked health problems among school children, there is scarce information about the issue in the study area. Hence the current study aimed to assess the prevalence of malaria and anemia and associated factors among school children in Hawassa City, Sidama, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2024 in selected public primary schools in Hawassa City, recruiting 329 children. Socio-demographic data were collected using a pretested questionnaire. Thick and thin blood films were prepared for microscopic examination of malaria parasites, and parasite counts were conducted. A rapid diagnostic test was also performed for malaria diagnosis. A digital hemoglobinometer was used to determine hemoglobin levels and assess anemia prevalence. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27, with bivariate and multivariate logistic regression performed. The strength of association was determined by computing adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Malaria and anemia were present in 8.5% and 9.4% of the children, respectively while, 29% of anemic children were also infected by malaria. The odds of having anemia were highest in children with malaria (AOR = 4.983, 95% CI: 1.067-23.265), previous history of malaria (AOR = 9.121, 95% CI: 1.686-49.336). Using insecticide treated-net (AOR = 0.024, 95% CI: 0.001-0.755), knowledge of malaria transmission (AOR = 0.205, 95% CI: 0.049-0.854),has significantly reduced malaria risk, highlighting the role of preventive practices and awareness. Meal frequency (AOR = 6.243, 95% CI: 1.956-19.923), malaria infection (AOR = 13.258, 95% CI: 3.188-55.139), and history of wasting (AOR = 5.760, 95% CI: 2.059-16.112) were identified as significant risk factors of anemia. This study found that 8.5% of school children in Hawassa City had malaria and 9.4% were anemic, indicating a mild public health concern. A strong association was observed between the two conditions: malaria-infected children were over 13 times more likely to be anemic. These findings highlight the need for integrated malaria prevention and nutrition programs. Interventions should focus on ITN use, improving dietary practices, and identifying asymptomatic malaria carriers to reduce the burden of both diseases.",

        "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has a disproportionately high malaria fatality rate globally, with young children accounting for the majority of fatalities. The objective of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of malaria infection risk and assess the effect of vector control interventions on malaria infection rates in SSA nations. We utilized data from the Malaria Atlas Project regarding the prevalence of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria infections and vector control interventions across 634 administrative areas in 45 SSA countries over a decade. This study adopted spatiotemporal regression models using Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods with a Bayesian setup. Between 2011 and 2020, the average annual prevalence rates of malaria infection among children aged 2 to 10 in SSA diminished from 21.32% in 2011 to 16.75% in 2016, with a slight resurgence observed in 2017. Each unit increase in the number of individuals utilizing insecticide-treated nets (ITN) annually correlates with a 34.07% reduction in the risk of malaria infection. A rise in malaria cases has prompted SSA to undertake serious control measures. The auto-regressive process reveals a highly significant temporal correlation, while the global spatial dependency parameter indicates a modest spatial correlation. The highest risk of malaria infection prevalence among children aged 2 to 10 was indicated in states in the West-central, Central, and certain Eastern regions. Given that the West-central, Central, and select Eastern states exhibit the highest rates of malaria infection, the global end malaria councils and the malaria control and elimination program should prioritize interventions in these regions, enhancing vector control measures and providing comprehensive training on their effective utilization to mitigate malaria risk in these areas.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax malaria remains an important threat to the public in the Asia Pacific region. Preventing P. vivax relapses is crucial for reducing morbidity from malaria and ultimately controlling and eliminating this species. Primaquine is the only widely available drug with antirelapse activity against dormant stages of P. vivax. Its widespread use in clinical practice is limited by its potential to cause severe haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The primary aims of this staged, binational, multicentre, before-and-after implementation study are to determine the safety, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of a revised package of case management interventions for improved P. vivax radical cure. The interventions include: i) pre-treatment testing of patients for G6PD deficiency using a semi-quantitative point-of-care device from SDBiosensor (ROK); ii) prescription of high dose primaquine (7mg/kg total dose) either over 7 days for G6PD normal patients (≥ 70% activity) or 14 days for intermediate patients (30- < 70% activity), or lower dose weekly primaquine over 8 weeks for deficient patients (< 30% activity); iii) improved patient education processes; iv) routine community-based review on day 3 (and day 7 for Stage 1) and v) enhanced malariometric surveillance and community pharmacovigilance. Stage 1 of the study (800 patients) will be implemented at 4 community clinics across Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) and will focus on analysis of treatment safety. If safety of the intervention is confirmed during Stage 1, the study will proceed to Stage 2, in which patient recruitment will be expanded to 10 clinics across Indonesia and PNG, and the feasibility of the similar intervention package will be assessed, but with a single community-based review on day 3. Stage 2 will run for 12 months and recruit approximately 11,410 patients. Mixed methods analyses of Stage 2 data will focus on the operational feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the revised case management package, with effectiveness determined through analysis of individual-level risk of P. vivax recurrence and population-level changes in incidence (with comparison to the pre-implementation period). Feasibility will be assessed via qualitative observations, in-depth interviews and focus groups of health care workers and participants. The intervention package will provide critical information on the safety, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of achieving radical cure with G6PD testing prior to high dose primaquine treatment and community-based follow-up. The study results will inform national malaria programs aiming to eliminate P. vivax in Indonesia and PNG by 2030. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov for Indonesia: NCT05879224 on the 18th May 2023 and PNG: NCT05874271 on the 16th May 2023.",

        "abstract": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and malaria pose a major health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Initially, we performed a descriptive analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database, categorizing data by subtypes. Next, linear regression models were employed to analyze temporal trends. We then utilized four predictive models to forecast the future burden. Additionally, we explored the relationship between estimated annual percentage change (EAPCs) and age-standardized rates (ASRs), as well as Human Development Index (HDI) scores for 2021. Furthermore, decomposition analysis was applied to assess the influence of aging, population dynamics, and epidemiological changes. Lastly, frontier analysis was conducted to examine the connection between disease burden and sociodemographic development. In 2021, NTDs and malaria contributed significantly to the global disease burden, with considerable disparities across genders, age groups, Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions, GBD regions, and individual countries. From 1990 to 2021, both the number of cases and the associated ASRs have shown a recent downward trend. The EAPCs are positively correlated with ASRs and HDI scores. Projections indicate a continued decline in disease burden through 2046. Additionally, our decomposition analysis highlighted the positive impact of aging and epidemiological shifts on the reduction of the disease burden. Finally, frontier analysis revealed that countries and regions with higher SDI scores have greater potential for further reducing their health burden. While the global burden of NTDs and malaria has improved overall, significant disparities remain across regions and countries. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing targeted intervention strategies and maintaining sustained investments to tackle the ongoing challenges.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a major global health challenge, responsible for millions of cases and substantial mortality each year. The emergence of drug-resistant strains and the lack of an effective vaccine underscore the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Recent research has highlighted the pivotal role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly small EVs derived via the endosomal pathway-commonly known as exosomes-in the progression of malaria and modulation of immune responses. These exosomes carry bioactive molecules that influence both innate and adaptive immunity. The biogenesis of exosomes is regulated by various cellular factors, and their involvement in host-pathogen interactions has revealed complex molecular mechanisms underlying parasitic diseases. This review provides an overview of exosome biogenesis, their molecular cargo, and their functional roles in malaria pathogenesis. Within this context, the growing interest in exosomes as therapeutic targets is discussed, given their immunomodulatory potential and utility as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, we explore the significance of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and in vivo models in elucidating exosome-mediated host-parasite interactions, emphasizing their contribution to advancing malaria research. Finally, we address current developments and future perspectives in the field, advocating for exosome-based interventions as a promising new paradigm in malaria therapy. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the interplay between malaria and exosomes, opening avenues for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Malaria, a potentially fatal disease caused by various Plasmodium species, continues to be a significant global health burden, with Plasmodium falciparum responsible for over 90% of malaria mortality worldwide (Snow, 2015). Current treatments, primarily relying on chemotherapy, face challenges due to drug resistance and severe side effects, highlighting the need for more effective and sustainable solutions. Vaccine-based approaches offer a promising alternative, providing potential long-term immunity with reduced risk of resistance. This study aims to develop a robust multi-epitope vaccine targeting four key Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 proteins: PfPHB1, PfPHB2, PfHSP70, and PfGARP. These proteins were selected based on their crucial roles in the parasite's survival and pathogenicity, as well as their conserved sequences present during the blood stage of infection. Using an array of bioinformatics tools, we identified B cell epitopes, HTL epitopes, and CTL epitopes, ensuring their antigenicity, non-toxicity, and non-allergenicity. These epitopes were then assembled into a vaccine construct, enhanced with the FliC protein of Salmonella typhimurium as an adjuvant to boost the immune response. The vaccine construct's secondary and tertiary structures were predicted and refined using PSIPRED and AlphaFold2, respectively. Molecular docking studies demonstrated strong interactions between the vaccine and TLR5, indicating potential efficacy in inducing an immune response. Codon optimization and in silico cloning in Escherichia coli K12 ensured efficient expression of the vaccine construct. Immune simulation using the C-ImmSim server predicted a robust and comprehensive immune response, further validating the vaccine's potential. This in-silico study represents a significant step towards developing a multi-epitope vaccine for malaria, addressing the limitations of current treatments and paving the way for experimental validation and future clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Progress in malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa is stalling, partly due to the spread of insecticide resistance in <i>Anopheles</i> vectors. Monitoring the evolution of insecticide resistance alleles and their spatial heterogeneity is important for malaria control programmes, and genomic surveillance has emerged as a pivotal tool for this purpose. Earlier genomics research has typically employed convenience-based sampling, and research has yet to be performed to optimise sampling regimens for malaria vector genomics. In an earlier study, we developed a spatially explicit sampling framework that considers the underlying ecology to enable sampling mosquitoes with reduced bias. We applied this framework to sample and perform whole-genome sequencing on 485 individual specimens of <i>An. gambiae s.l</i> mosquitoes from Obuasi, central Ghana, an area with extensive gold mining activities. In this region, <i>An. gambiae s.l</i> have been documented as highly resistant to multiple insecticides, including pyrethroids used for the treatment of bed-nets. High resolution of fine-scale population structure enabled the detection of isolation-by-distance in <i>An. coluzzii</i> in Obuasi, whilst finding that at this scale, geographic distance, rather than the underlying habitat, drives population structure. We examine methods to estimate mosquito kinship, demonstrating that polymorphic chromosomal inversions significantly confound established analytical tools, while revealing how the mosquito's chromosome architecture generates high variance in genetic relatedness among kin. Using genome-wide selection scans and clustering, we discover the novel mutations <i>Gste2-</i> F120L and <i>Cyp9K1</i> -N224I in detoxification enzymes that are driving selective sweeps, likely in response to insecticidal pressure. We find that the frequencies of some resistance variants are associated with artisanal-gold mines, and elucidate the continued evolution of the <i>Voltage-gated sodium channel</i> , the target of pyrethroid insecticides. Overall, we show that sampling vectors strategically may enhance our ability to perform effective genomic surveillance.",

        "abstract": "<i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria remains a significant global health challenge, complicated by the parasite's ability to form dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) that cause relapses. Radical cure of <i>P. vivax</i> malaria requires administration of a hypnozoitocidal drug, such as primaquine or tafenoquine. However, these drugs can cause severe haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency is caused by more than 230 different variants at the gene level that confer different degrees of deficiency phenotypically. Understanding the distribution of different G6PD variants in affected populations is essential to inform safer antimalarial treatment strategies. This study aimed to develop a cost-effective sequencing assay targeting key regions of the G6PD gene, suitable for field deployment. A novel assay based on Nanopore technology was designed to amplify two amplicons covering exon 3 to exon 13, focusing on known variants associated with enzyme deficiency. A total of 79 samples from individuals in Cambodia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and China were sequenced, and a bioinformatics pipeline was created for the targeted variant calling of 192 G6PD SNP mutations. The assay demonstrated reliable detection of known variants, with high concordance between runs, within runs, and with Sanger sequencing. The Nanopore MinION long-amplicon sequencing assay offers a robust and portable solution for large-scale G6PD genotyping in low-resource settings, that will improve malaria control and elimination strategies by enabling safer antimalarial treatment.",

Mutations in the <i>kelch13</i> (<i>k13</i>) gene confer artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R), compromising the efficacy of combination therapies. In the Horn of Africa, the validated mutation <i>k13</i> R622I has rapidly emerged in parallel with other mutations elsewhere in Eastern Africa. To monitor and inform control efforts, we conducted in-depth sampling where R622I was first detected, using molecular inversion probe (MIP) targeted sequencing of key resistance mutations and informative SNPs across the genome. Samples were collected for a year within two districts, Gondar Zuria and Tach Armachiho, representing different ecological zones in northwest Ethiopia. Among 903 people with <i>P. falciparum</i> malaria, we observed a markedly higher prevalence of R622I (44.3%) compared to earlier reports, with significantly higher prevalence in Gondar Zuria (52%) than in Tach Armachiho (40%; p<0.001). Alarmingly, the prevalence of histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) negativity was higher in R622I mutants compared to wild types (48.3% vs 30.7%; p<0.001). Furthermore, 98.2% of R622I samples carried the multidrug resistance protein 1 NFD haplotype associated with reduced susceptibility to lumefantrine. We also detected the <i>k13</i> C580Y mutation in two patients (0.4%) from Gondar Zuria, the first report in the Horn of Africa. Identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis showed C580Y mutant parasites were likely clonal (IBD=1). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed their clonal nature and revealed flanking haplotypes distinct from those seen in Southeast Asia where the mutation was first observed, suggesting a local, de novo emergence. These findings highlight increasing prevalence and types of ART-R mutations and the concerning association now with RDT negativity that will further challenge malaria control and elimination efforts.",

        "abstract": "Control and elimination programs for malaria in Iran have consistently faced significant challenges due to various factors, including the presence of neighboring malaria-endemic countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. In recent years, Golestan Province in northern Iran has recorded few cases of imported malaria, with a sudden increase of 22 cases in 2023. This article provides an overview of the malaria situation in northern Iran, along with a detailed report of these 22 cases. The study population comprises all individuals exhibiting symptoms suspected of malaria (n = 445) who were referred to the Malaria Diagnosis Center in Golestan Province, located in northeastern Iran, for diagnosis between March 23, 2023, and December 23, 2023. A drop of peripheral blood, collected from a finger prick of each patient, was utilized for Plasmodium falciparum/P. vivax antigen detection. Moreover, thin and thick smears were prepared for each patient to investigate morphological characteristics and parasitemia percentage of the parasites. In total, 4.94% (22/445) of individuals with malaria-suspected symptoms were infected with Plasmodium species. All 22 infected individuals were native to Golestan Province, and none had a previous history. The mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) for the number of parasites/µL of blood sample was 16,029 ± 5,060 for P. vivax and 105,460 ± 102,146 for P. falciparum. Among the patients, 77.27% (17/22) were infected with P. vivax, 18.18% (4/22) were infected with P. falciparum, and 4.54% (1/22) were co-infected with both P. vivax and P. falciparum. In the case of P. falciparum, 40% (1/5) of the samples presented the ring form, 60% (3/5) trophozoite form, and 20% (1/5) gametocyte form. All patients demonstrated a positive response to the treatment, with a decrease in both the number of parasites and the number of clinical symptoms over time. This study discussed 22 cases of malaria diagnosed in 2023 in Golestan Province in northern Iran. Given the presence of malaria vectors in this area and the observation of gametocytes in specimens from some patients, the increase in reported malaria cases could be worrisome in terms of establishing local transmission in this area.",

        "abstract": "Severe malaria (SM) remains a leading cause of child mortality and an important global contributor to acute kidney injury (AKI), which can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in some survivors. Notably, 80% of AKI deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Despite this burden, the mechanisms and recovery trajectory of SM associated AKI remain poorly understood. There is a critical need to define the etiology and pathophysiology of SM-AKI, uncover pathways of maladaptive repair, identify risk factors for CKD, and evaluate long-term health and development. This prospective multi-site cohort study will enroll children at three sites in Uganda: Mulago National Referral and Teaching Hospital, Jinja Regional Referral Hospital, and Lira Regional Referral Hospital. We aim to recruit 750 children with severe malaria and 375 community controls between 3 months of age and < 16 years. Participants will be followed for two years. Children with severe malaria will be assessed at 1-, 2-, and 4-months to evaluate short-term kidney recovery and 12- and 24-months to assess kidney function and health-related quality of life. The study will investigate short-term and long-term kidney disease risk factors following severe malaria. We will characterize host pathways involved in maladaptive kidney repair, focusing on mechanisms related to cell stress, angiogenesis, and tubulointerstitial injury. Additionally, we will assess the impact of AKI and persistent kidney disease on morbidity, mortality, and health-related quality of life. Cognitive and behavioral assessments, along with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be used to evaluate the effects of AKI on brain injury and edema. This study will generate key insights into the prevalence of persistent kidney disease following SM-AKI and identify risk factors for CKD to inform clinical follow-up. Defining specific pathways involved with maladaptive repair in severe malaria will provide the foundation for targeted interventions to promote adaptive recovery. The research has the potential to transform long-term health outcomes following SM-AKI. ISRCTN10885288.",

We analyzed 1,463 plasma proteins during and after acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adult travelers and linked responses to peripheral immune cells by integrating with single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a subset of donors. We identified extensive perturbations in over 250 proteins with diverse origins, including many not previously analyzed in malaria patients, such as hormones, circulating receptors, and intracellular or membrane-bound proteins from affected tissues. The protein profiles clustered participants according to disease severity, enabling the identification of a compressed 11-protein signature enriched in severe malaria. Conceptually, this study advances our understanding of malaria by linking systemic proteomic changes to immune cell communication and organ-specific responses.

Several proteins of the <i>P. vivax</i> Pvfam \"a\" family are known to bind with host erythrocytes. Some of them share their erythrocyte receptors with each other and <i>vice versa</i>, but the identification of these receptors is awaited with the exception of PvTRAg38.

These interactions seem to be important for the parasite's survival since each of these proteins interfered with the parasite's growth in a heterologous culture system. Furthermore, a higher parasite growth inhibition rate was observed with the combination of these proteins, suggesting the significance of multiple parasite ligand's interaction with the same erythrocyte receptor during the invasion process.

        "abstract": "Malaria acute kidney injury (MAKI) is associated with severe malaria and correlates with poor prognosis and death of patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The pathogenesis of MAKI is not completely understood but some hypotheses are well recognized. Host-parasite interactions lead to mechanical obstruction, disorders in the renal microcirculation, and immune-mediated glomerular injury. We investigated the influence of CD8⁺ T cells in the pathogenesis of malaria-induced renal disease. To assess the role of T lymphocytes in MAKI pathogenesis, we used adoptive transfer; antibody-driven CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depletion and treatment with FYT720. The transference of total T cells isolated from malaria-infected donor mice into naive recipient animals reproduced kidney tubule-interstitial damage without affecting glomerular function. It was associated with increased accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the kidneys of recipient mice. The selective depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in infected animals resulted in protection from tubular injury, although glomerular alterations still occurred. Finally, we evaluated FTY720, an immunomodulatory drug that sequesters T cells in lymphoid organs and limits their migration, as a potential therapeutic strategy. Treatment with FTY720 prevented the development of proteinuria and the increase in the urine to creatinine ratio. Moreover, FTY720 reduced urinary γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) levels, a marker of tubular injury, but did not alter plasma urea and creatinine, two markers of glomerular function. Our results add new knowledge demonstrating that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have a specific role in tubule-interstitial injury pathology during MAKI.",

        "abstract": "We investigated parasite population genomics during an intensive malaria elimination program in Kayin State (Myanmar), in which malaria posts were used for rapid detection and treatment of malaria cases, while mass drug administration (MDA) was used in villages with high submicroscopic reservoirs. We collected 5014 dried blood spots from <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> infected patients from 413 malaria posts, over 58-months (November 2015 - August 2020), and sequenced 2270 parasite genomes, each with geographic references (latitude and longitude). We used identity-by-descent (IBD) relationships to examine how control efforts impact parasite population structure. Parasites were genetically depauperate: 1726 single-genotype infections comprised 166 unique genomes (≥90% IBD), while nine families (≥45% IBD) accounted for 62·5% of parasites sampled. We observed localized, temporally stable transmission of unique parasite genotypes, identifying transmission chains. Parasite relatedness was positively correlated up to approximately 20 km revealing the scale of parasite subpopulations. <i>Kelch13</i> diversity was stable from 2016-2019, but only one predominant clonal genotype ( <i>kelch13</i> -R561H) remained in 2020. MDA resulted in parasite founder effects, providing genomic evidence for the efficacy of this malaria control tool. Our genomic data show that parasite population size decreased over the study period, and we observed regional distribution of parasite genotypes, which can define operational units for parasite control. One parasite genotype ( <i>kelch13</i> -R561H) from the north rose to high frequency in 2020, because transmission was halted elsewhere in the control area. Future surveillance will reveal whether this genotype spreads to neighboring regions. Genetic drift may have a stronger impact on parasite population structure than selection in low-transmission elimination settings. National Institutes of Health; Wellcome Trust; Global Fund to Fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. <b>Evidence before this study:</b> This study describes the genomic analysis of malaria parasites collected during a malaria elimination program targeting four townships (Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Hlaingbwe, and Hpapun) in Kayin State, eastern Myanmar. We searched PubMed on May 10, 2025, using the terms: \"malaria\", \"transmission\", \"drug resistance\", \"southeast Asia\" and \"genetic surveillance\" without any date or language restrictions. Our search yielded 58 publications, including reports on declined immunity to malaria and increased drug resistance in southeast Asia; genetic diversity and population structure shaped by mass drug administration, transmission intensity, human movement and mosquito ecology; and the spread of <i>kelch13</i> and <i>pfcrt</i> mutations conferring dihydroartemimsinin-piperaquine resistance in east southeast Asia countries. <b>Added value of this study:</b> We sequenced and analyzed 2270 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> whole genomes (each with geographic location) collected between November 2015 and August 2020 in Kayin State. We described fine-scale molecular epidemiology changes during intense malaria elimination interventions. We observed localized, temporally stable transmission of parasite genotypes, with different parasite families and <i>kelch13</i> haplotypes predominating in different subregions over the 5-year period. We found <i>kelch13</i> haplotypes with local or regional origin, but none originating from eastern southeast Asia. The genomic data indicated decreasing parasite population size, but we observed no selection towards drug-resistance parasites. In 2020, only one predominant lineage ( <i>kelch13</i> -R561H) remained in our studying region, consistent with genetic drift in a pre-elimination setting. <b>Implications of all the available evidence:</b> The parasite population was genetically depauperate, with a spatially localized and temporally stable distribution of parasite lineages, and declining population size. In this situation genetic drift may play a heightened role in parasite epidemiology. Consistent with this, parasites carrying <i>kelch13</i> -R561H rose to high frequency in 2020, because transmission was eliminated in all regions except the north of Kayin State, where parasites bearing this <i>kelch13</i> genotype have predominated since 2017. Future surveillance will determine whether this parasite genotype is transmitted to neighboring regions, and thus related to changes in <i>P. falciparum</i> drug resistance dynamics on the Thailand Myanmar border. These data illustrate how genetic drift in small populations can result in instantaneous changes in the resistance status of parasite populations in near elimination settings.",

To assess whether AL and AS-AQ remain efficacious and to confirm that DP and AS-PY are potential alternatives for uncomplicated malaria treatment, an in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted in Mozambique at five sentinel sites. This study was conducted in the districts of Montepuez (AL), Dondo (AL and AS-AQ), Mopeia (AL and AS-PY), Moatize (AL and AS-AQ), and Massinga (AL and DP) following the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended protocol. Patients aged 6 months to 11 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria (1000-200,000 parasites/µl) were enrolled, followed, and assessed for 28 days (AL and AS-AQ) or 42 days (DP and AS-PY). Genotyping for msp1/msp2/poly-α markers and match counting via the WHO/Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) 3/3 algorithm were used to differentiate recrudescences from new infections. The primary outcome was polymerase chain reaction corrected efficacy for each drug. In total, 828 participants were enrolled in the four study arms: AL (462), AS-AQ (183), DP (91), and AS-PY (92). Among the recruited participants, 10.2% (85/828) were lost to follow-up or withdrew, and 60 had recurrent malaria infections, 55 of which were considered new infections and five recrudescences. Day 28 corrected AL efficacy was 100% (95% CI 94.3-100) in Massinga, 100% in Dondo, 100% (95% CI 95.5-100) in Moatize, 97.63% (95% CI 94.4-100) in Mopeia, and 98.68% (95% CI 96.2-100) in Montepuez. Day 28 corrected AS-AQ efficacy was 100% in Dondo and 100% (95% CI 95.4-100) in Moatize.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major global health concern due to multidrug resistance and lack of a vaccine. This study explored the potential of B. subtilis spores engineered to express IsdB, a key S. aureus iron acquisition protein, on their surface and evaluated the immunogenic effect of recombinant spores through oral administration in mice. B. subtilis spores were engineered to display a key S. aureus protein, IsdB, fused with spore coat protein, CotB, and confirmed by PCR. Western blotting, sporeELISA, and immunofluorescence microscopy verified the surface expression of IsdB. The engineered BsHT2377 spores were orally administered to Swiss mice at two different doses, and antibody levels in both serum and feces were measured using ELISA. PCR confirmed the targeted integration of the isdB gene into B. subtilis, generating the strain BsHT2377. Western blotting, sporeELISA, and immunofluorescence microscopy validated IsdB surface display on BsHT2377 spores. Oral administration triggered a gut-localised immune response in mice, with significantly elevated fecal IgA but no substantial increase in serum IgG. This study engineered a novel B. subtilis strain, BsHT2377, that displays the S. aureus IsdB protein on its spore surface. Oral administration in mice significantly increased fecal IgA, indicating a mucosal immune response.

Characterizing the molecular epidemiology of drug resistance genes helps to understand the emergence and spread of resistant parasites. In this study, the effects of drug pressure and human migration on antimalarial resistance in P. falciparum were evaluated. Sixty-seven samples from northwestern Ecuador from the 2019-2021 period were analyzed. SNPs in Pfcrt, Pfdhps, Pfdhfr, Pfmdr-1, Pfk13 and Pfaat1 were identified by Sanger sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. A comparison of the frequencies of the haplotypes was made with data from the 2013-2015 period. Also, nucleotide and haplotype diversity were calculated. The frequencies of the mutant haplotypes, CVMET in Pfcrt and CICNI in Pfdhfr increased and became dominant (100% of infections) in Esmeraldas. NEDFSDFY in Pfmdr-1 was detected for the first time, while two wild-type haplotypes, SAKAA in Pfdhps and MYRIC in Pfk13, remained in 100% of samples. Interestingly, the A16V mutation in Pfdhfr that gives resistance to proguanil is reported in Ecuador for the first time. In conclusion, parasites resistant to chloroquine (Pfcrt) and pyrimethamine (Pfdhfr) increased in recent years, while parasites sensitive to sulfadoxine (Pfdhps) and artemisinin (Pfk13) prevail in Ecuador. These results suggest that the current first-line treatment (artemether-lumefantrine + primaquine) is still useful against P. falciparum.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis programmes in many settings rely heavily on international donor funding. In 2025, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled, and other countries announced cuts to overseas development assistance. We quantified the potential epidemiological impacts on the tuberculosis burden attributable to these reductions in funding. We calibrated a deterministic tuberculosis model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, progression, and care to epidemiological indicators in selected low-income and middle-income countries. Calibration was done with the history matching with emulation method, implemented with the hmer package in R and the Approximate Bayesian computation Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We projected three future scenarios with the following assumptions: that levels of funding in 2024 would continue, that USAID funding would be terminated from 2025, and that additional reductions in funding through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria would occur (alongside termination of funding from USAID) in line with current donor announcements from 2025. We assumed a reduction in tuberculosis treatment initiation rates proportional to budget reductions for each scenario, estimating cumulative excess episodes of symptomatic tuberculosis and tuberculosis deaths for each scenario. We modelled 79 countries, representing 91% of global tuberculosis incidence and 90% of global tuberculosis mortality in 2023. Our modelling suggested that termination of USAID funding might lead to 1·4 million (95% uncertainty interval 1·1-1·7) excess tuberculosis episodes and 537 700 (451 900-662 300) excess deaths by 2035. Further reductions in funding in line with current announcements by the USA, France, the UK, and Germany could lead to 2·8 million (2·1-3·7), 257 600 (192 500-332 900), 206 000 (153 900-266 100), and 124 700 (93 200-161 000), additional episodes, respectively, of symptomatic tuberculosis and 1·0 million (0·8-1·3), 90 500 (72 400-112 800), 72 400 (57 900-90 100), and 43 800 (35 000-54 500) additional tuberculosis deaths, respectively, in the same period, relative to the scenario of termination of USAID funding. We estimate substantial potential impacts on tuberculosis morbidity and mortality due to reductions in international donor funding. Expanded support from domestic and international donors is essential to address immediate gaps in services for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. None.",

        "abstract": "Yellow fever (YF), a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic fever, is endemic to Uganda and has caused numerous outbreaks in recent years. This study explored local perceptions of YF outbreaks among vulnerable groups in Uganda to inform future public health campaigns. A qualitative study examined community perceptions of YF and its treatment practices. Data were collected in six districts where YF outbreaks were reported in 2010 and 2016. A total of 76 individuals participated, comprising 43 semi-structured interviews, 10 expert interviews, and 4 focus group discussions, including vulnerable groups of older adults ≥ 65 years and pregnant women. Data were analyzed using grounded theory. Participants often recognized jaundice but did not distinguish YF from other causes of jaundice, such as newborn jaundice, severe malaria or hepatitis. Nevertheless, participants still considered YF a deadly disease. It was perceived to be transmitted through multiple pathways, including mosquito bites, airborne transmission, close contact with sick individuals, sexual intercourse, vertical transmission during pregnancy, poor hygiene, and certain foods. Treatments ranged from herbal remedies to visiting health centers. Several YF survivors shared first-hand experience, often relying on traditional medicine due to limited access to health facilities, diagnostic options, and no specific treatment for YF. In remote areas, participants often did not know the cause of the outbreak, as awareness campaigns focused on symptoms, prevention, and mass vaccination. If YF is not seen as a distinct disease entity, implementing diagnostic and preventive measures may be impeded. Moreover, failure to diagnose YF in clinical settings can hamper timely outbreak response. We recommend strengthening health literacy through health education and public participation in vulnerable communities with programs tailored to local needs, given that other infectious diseases are prevalent in the region. Furthermore, we propose that access to diagnostic testing for YF may be enhanced.",

        "abstract": "To assess the benefits of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), the monthly administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine during the high malaria season, beyond malaria prevention in real-world program settings. We conducted a pre-post comparison of non-malarial diagnoses (pneumonia, diarrhea, acute malnutrition) and antibiotic prescription rates during SMC administration weeks versus a three-week post-intervention period in rural Burkina Faso. Data came from clinic surveillance at 51 health facilities, a population-based census, and National Malaria Control Program data on SMC timing. Poisson regression models with person-weeks as an offset and standard errors clustered by health post estimated changes in rates. Interaction terms assessed variation across SMC cycles. Positive (malaria diagnoses, antimalarial prescriptions) and negative (injury) control outcomes were used to evaluate potential unmeasured confounding. Compared to administration weeks, modest declines were observed in pneumonia, diarrhea, and acute malnutrition diagnoses, as well as in antibiotic prescription rates during the post-SMC period. Absolute reductions were 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3-1.0), 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.4), 0.05 (95% CI: 0.001-0.09), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.4-1.4) per 1,000 person-weeks, respectively. Positive control outcomes also declined, with malaria diagnoses and antimalarial prescriptions decreasing by 3.7 (95% CI: 2.6-4.8) and 3.6 (95% CI: 2.5-4.7) per 1,000 person-weeks. Injury rates (negative control) remained stable (0.02; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.07). Reductions varied across SMC cycles and were most pronounced following the final round.

        "abstract": "Reliable assessment of antimalarial drug efficacy is crucial for effective response to emerging drug resistance, and therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) are the primary means of estimating <i>in vivo</i> efficacy. Accuracy of such estimates rests on correctly classifying recurrent infections developed during follow-up as recrudescences or new infections. Genotyping is used to guide classification, but polyclonal infections and allele chance matching still make classification challenging, especially in high transmission settings. Established methods for analyzing genotyping data are biased or difficult to use; few take full advantage of data from modern genotyping methods such as multiplexed amplicon sequencing. We propose an Adaptable Statistical framework for Therapeutic Efficacy and Recrudescence (Aster) that delivers accurate and consistent results by explicitly incorporating complexity of infection (COI), population allele frequencies, and imperfect detection of alleles in minority strains. Using an identity by descent approach, Aster accounts for alleles matching by chance and background relatedness that can otherwise lead to misclassification. The extensible framework can also utilize external information, such as parasite density and performance characteristics of a genotyping panel. Aster employs efficient combinatorial algorithms to process unphased polyclonal data, making it fast and fully scalable. Using simulations, we show that Aster dramatically outperforms match-counting algorithms currently recommended by WHO in a wide variety of settings and demonstrates consistently balanced performance measures that improve with more informative genotyping panels. Aster provides accurate study-level estimates of treatment failure for TES with any type of genotyping data, facilitating reliable evaluation of drug efficacy and effective management of malaria.",

Artesunate (ART), derived from Artemisia annua and used for malaria treatment, shows potential as a frozen semen antioxidant. We investigated the effects of various ART concentrations (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mM) on yak semen cryopreservation and examined the molecular mechanisms involved. Post-freezing, sperm quality markedly declined. However, 0.2 mM ART significantly improved sperm motility (both total and progressive) and reduced membrane damage. ART treatment effectively alleviated oxidative stress by reducing ROS levels and MDA content in the sperm while selectively upregulating SOD1 activity and protein levels, which are involved in maintaining DNA integrity and mitochondrial function. These findings support the hypothesis that ART exerts antioxidant effects via a SOD1-mediated mechanism, highlighting its potential to improve frozen semen quality and offering a novel strategy for cryopreserving sperm in other species.",

This assessment can help guide future PBO-synergist ITN procurement and replacement strategies. This prospective study tracked 370 households and 652 campaign-distributed ITNs from 2020, followed annually for 36 months. Districts were purposefully selected based on shared characteristics. Household surveys were conducted, and 30 ITNs per round were tested for bioefficacy and chemical residue. Key indicators included ITN survival, 24-h mosquito mortality, and chemical content reduction compared to manufacturer targets doses. Cox proportional hazard models identified factors influencing ITN survival. Median useful life was 3.0 (95% CI 2.7-3.5) years for PermaNet<sup>®</sup> 3.0 ITNs in Bo and 2.2 (95% CI 2.0-2.4) years for Olyset<sup>®</sup> Plus ITNs in Moyamba. PermaNet<sup>®</sup> 3.0 ITNs displayed 13% 24-h mortality against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes on roof panels, with a 46% reduction in PBO content 34 months post-distribution. Olyset<sup>®</sup> Plus ITNs had 3% f24-hour mortality against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, with a 77% reduction in PBO content. Several factors were associated with improved ITN survival, including cohort ITNs from Bo (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.33, p < 0.001), households without children under five (CU5) (aHR = 0.64, p = 0.003), highest socio-economic status tertile (aHR = 0.63, p = 0.016), exposure to social and behaviour change (SBC) messages combined with positive net attitudes (aHR = 0.63, p = 0.008), lack of food storage in sleeping spaces (aHR = 0.56, p = 0.006), exclusive adult use of ITNs (aHR = 0.72, p = 0.048), net folding when not in use (aHR = 0.67, p = 0.015), and drying nets outside (aHR = 0.44, p = 0.008). ITNs in Bo outperformed those in Moyamba in both physical and insecticidal performance. However, ITN survival is highly context specific, and further investigation into field performance of new ITN types is necessary across diverse epidemiological settings.",

This study investigates the implementation of the RASR strategy in terms of its timeliness, facilitators and barriers, and acceptability for implementation, thereby providing recommendations to improve the strategy in the context of the national health system. A mixed-methods study of secondary data analysis of aggregated routine malaria datasets, and cross-sectional survey, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with malaria programme stakeholders, frontline health workers and mobile and migrant populations was conducted in Ratanakiri and Stung Treng provinces. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed descriptively and thematically. In 2020 and 2022, 72% and 59% of malaria cases were notified and investigated within one day after diagnosis. Timeliness of reactive case detection was 89% and 45% in 2020 and 2022 respectively. Despite having challenges including minimal community participation in reactive case detection, poor mobile phone network coverage and road conditions, a heavy workload at the commune health centre level, inadequate surveillance technical knowledge among village malaria workers and insufficient budget to execute RASR, the existing RASR strategy was deemed acceptable among all levels of health personnels. The RASR strategy implemented in northeast Cambodia was generally functioning well despite some challenges. To improve the RASR strategy to achieve 100% timeliness and progress towards malaria elimination in Cambodia, allocating sufficient budget, capacity building to frontline health workers and better community engagement strategies are required.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is infectious disease with low occurrence in Brazil extra-Amazon Region. Despite this, higher lethality is observed in this region compared to the country's endemic area. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse factors associated with malaria hospitalizations (severe malaria) in the extra-Amazon Region, in order to prevent deaths. A case-control design was used, utilizing data from the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sinan) and hospitalization records from the Unified Health System (SIH/SUS) from 2011 to 2019. Cases comprised hospitalized malaria patients, while controls included reported malaria notifications without hospitalization. Probabilistic record linkage techniques were employed, and associations were analysed using multiple logistic regression with a 0.05 significance level. The main risk factors identified were: Black or mixed-race ethnicity (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.43), low education (elementary school OR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.78-2.75 or high school OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.39-2.13), infection outside the extra-Amazon Region (Amazon Region OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.15-1.96 or abroad OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.28-2.32), high parasite count (501 to 10,000/mm<sup>3</sup> OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.27-1.80, 10,001 to 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> OR = 1.77; 95% CI 2.87-1.96 or higher than 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> OR = 3.15; 95% CI 2.20-4.50) and delayed treatment (after 3-7 days symptoms onset OR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.36-2.24 or 8 days or more OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.62-2.66). Active case detection was a protective factor (OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.54-0.78). Delayed treatment remains a key factor in the occurrence of severe malaria, leading to high parasitaemia and revealing inequalities in access to healthcare based on socioeconomic differences.

Though Odisha has seen a decline in malaria cases over the past few years, it remains a contributing factor in deciding India's malaria journey. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-based systematic review aims to investigate and compile the ethnomedicinal evidence-based documented research data on anti-malarial medicinal plants in Mayurbhanj, Odisha. An extensive literature survey was conducted using online databases, following the PRISMA-Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines for anti-malarial prophylaxis and diagnosis using the ethnomedicinal plants in Mayurbhanj. Using appropriate exclusion and inclusion criteria, 20 literature/book chapters were included in the study. Origin 2024b was used for the analysis of the ethnomedicinal information. The study identified 40 plant species used by traditional healers in anti-malarial treatment. These 40 plant species belong to 24 families, the majority of which are the Acanthaceae and Apocyanaceae. Most of the formulations came from a decoction, paste, juice and powder. It was interesting to note that the formulations were predominantly provided by oral route. The leaves and roots were the significant parts used by the healers for the anti-malarial treatment. However, no side effects were reported for these plants. The review highlights the rich variety of ethnomedicinal plants and their recipes for anti-malarial treatment in Mayurbhanj. The disease still plagues Odisha, necessitating study on dispersed ethnomedicinal studies for a better therapeutic comprehension of the diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Malaria may seriously threaten an individual's health and wellbeing, and early screening is pivotal for timely treatment and recovery. In malaria screening, thick blood smears are exploited to count the parasites and assess the severity of the disease. Parasites are tiny objects that can be found in high resolution blood smear images, which renders them difficult for detection. Other than using object detection based methods, prior works also applied image classification techniques to this problem. They first extracted image patches from blood smears as parasite candidates and then utilized convolutional neural networks to classify these patches as parasites or non-parasites. However, these approaches overlook the fact that the blood smear images may contain noises, errors, and background artifacts, which introduces uncertainty and makes the model predictions less stable. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-guided attention learning based network for malaria parasite detection from thick blood smears, which incorporates pixel attention mechanism to identify more fine-grained and pixel-wise informative features, to improve the classification capability of our model. We further put uncertainty estimation on channels of the feature map to guide pixel attention learning, such that the features from channels with higher uncertainty are considered unreliable and are thus restrictively exploited by pixel attention learning. To estimate channel-wise uncertainty, we introduce the Bayesian channel attention, which reformulates the traditional channel attention under the Bayesian framework. As a result, it denotes channel uncertainties with estimated variances that guide the pixel attention learning. We compared to several state-of-the-art baselines on two public datasets using parasite-level and patient-level evaluations. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance with respect to most metrics on two datasets, especially achieving highest average precision (AP) scores in both parasite and patient-level scenarios.",

        "title": "Phytochemical Screening and Biological Activities of <i>Lippia multiflora</i> Moldenke.",
        "abstract": "<i>Lippia multiflora</i> Moldenke is widely used in Angola, on the African continent, and beyond for the treatment of many health conditions such as hypertension, enteritis, colds, gastrointestinal disturbances, stomachaches, jaundice, coughs, fevers, nausea, bronchial inflammation, conjunctivitis, malaria, and venereal diseases. However, there is limited literature about the active compounds linked with the reported biological activities. This study aims to assess the chemical profiles, antioxidant properties, and the cytotoxicity effects of the roots, stem bark, and leaves of <i>L. multiflora</i>. Chemical characterization of the crude extracts was assessed through quantification of total phenolic and flavonoid contents followed by Q exactive plus orbitrap™ ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS) screening. The correlation between the extracts and the correlation between the compounds were studied using the multivariate analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) loading scores and principal component analysis (PCA) biplots and correlation plots were used to connect specific compounds with observed biological activities. The antioxidant activities of the crude extracts were carried out in vitro using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging and reducing power assays, while the in vitro toxicology of the crude extracts was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. A total of twenty constituents were characterized and identified using the UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS. The methanol leaf extract showed the highest antioxidant activity in the DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.559 ± 0.269 μg/mL); however, the stem bark extract had the highest reducing power (IC<sub>0.5</sub> = 0.029 ± 0.026 μg/mL). High phenolic and flavonoid content was found in the dichloromethane leaf extract (32.100 ± 1.780 mg GAE/g) and stem bark extract (624.153 ± 29.442 mg QE/g), respectively. The results show the stem bark, methanol leaf, and dichloromethane leaf extracts were well-tolerated by the Vero cell line at concentrations up to 50 µg/mL. However, at 100 µg/mL onward, some toxicity was observed in the root, methanol leaf, and dichloromethane leaf extracts. The UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS profiles showed the presence of terpenoids (n = 5), flavonoids (n = 5), phenols (n = 4), alkaloids (n = 3), coumarins (n = 1), fatty acids (n = 1), and organic acids (n = 1). According to several studies, these secondary metabolites have been reported and proven to be the most abundant for antioxidant potential. The identified flavonoids (catechin, quercitrin, and (-)-epigallocatechin) and phenolic compound (6-gingerol) can significantly contribute to the antioxidant properties of different plant parts of <i>L. multiflora</i>. The research findings obtained in this study provide a complete phytochemical profile of various parts of <i>L. multiflora</i> that are responsible for the antioxidant activity using UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS analysis. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study contribute to the scientific information or data on the therapeutic properties of <i>Lippia multiflora</i> and provide a basis for further assessment of its potential as a natural remedy.",

        "abstract": "Although China has achieved malaria elimination, the risk of reintroduction persists due to imported Plasmodium falciparum cases. Occasional infections without a clear travel history present challenge to routine epidemiological investigation and underscore the need for advanced tracing tools. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), principal component analysis (PCA), and identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis were applied to investigate a P. falciparum case reported in Chongqing, China, in 2019. The patient had no overseas travel history but was treated at the same hospital with a confirmed imported case from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Genomic analysis placed the unidentified case within the West and Central African parasite cluster. IBD analysis showed a high degree of relatedness (IBD = 0.9) between this case and the DRC-imported case, suggesting a potential transmission link. These findings indicate the likely Central African origin of the infection and raise concerns about local transmission risk even in a post-elimination setting. This case highlights the limitations of traditional epidemiology in detecting cryptic transmission routes. Genomic epidemiology enables finer-scale resolution of parasite origin and relatedness, providing critical evidence in elimination-phase malaria control. Genomic tools such as WGS, PCA, and IBD analysis can enhance national malaria surveillance systems by identifying infection sources and clarifying transmission routes. Their integration supports elimination-stage strategies and helps prevent malaria reintroduction in formerly endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Imported malaria remains a significant diagnostic challenge, particularly in regions approaching elimination. This case report is novel in its exploration of the complexities involved in diagnosing malaria imported from a high-endemic area to a low-endemic region, emphasizing the critical role of detailed travel history and molecular diagnostics in identifying the disease. The case underscores the potential public health implications of missing such diagnoses in regions where routine malaria testing is not performed due to low endemicity. A 25-year-old male presented to a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry, India, with symptoms of intermittent fever, headache, loss of appetite, and vomiting, which persisted over a week. Initial laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, with negative tests for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus. Further investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified Plasmodium falciparum. The patient had recently returned from Burkina Faso, West Africa, where he had experienced similar episodes of fever, establishing the diagnosis of imported malaria. This case highlights the necessity of considering imported malaria in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses in India, a country nearing malaria elimination. It illustrates the importance of incorporating travel history into clinical evaluations and supports the use of molecular diagnostics to effectively diagnose malaria in settings where traditional diagnostic methods may overlook imported cases. The findings advocate for enhanced surveillance and diagnostic preparedness to manage imported cases of malaria, thereby supporting ongoing elimination efforts and preventing the re-establishment of local transmission.

        "abstract": "Antimalarial drug resistance poses a significant challenge towards global efforts to combat malaria, so new strategies must be explored. Previously we showed promising antimalarial activity of ultra diluted malarial antigen (UdMAg), a novel biotherapic drug which was developed from in vitro cultures of a combination of cell-free parasites and infected red blood cells from Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 (chloroquine sensitive) and RKL-9 strains (chloroquine resistant). The stock was collected and sent to Dr. Willmar Schwabe India Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi for preparing its homeopathic dilutions to 30c by repeated succussions and potentization. The final ultradiluted Malarial antigen 30c (UdMAg) was used for the treatment along with the standard antimalarial drug mefloquine (MQ) not only to enhance the therapeutic outcomes but also ameliorate its side effects. The prophylactic efficacy of MQ in combination with UdMAg was assessed in P. berghei infected mice (ANKA strain) using Peters (1980) method. Assessment of parasitaemia and mean survival time was studied along with immunological parameters which included analysis of cell surface expression, nitric oxide (NO) concentration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The results demonstrated enhanced prophylactic efficacy of the MQ, accompanied by 100 % mean survival time when given along with UdMAg. Further, the combination treatment exhibited improved immunological responses, increased concentration of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen specie levels. MQ, a standard antimalarial has significant side-effects, so a novel antimalarial (UdMAg) was used as a biotherapy in combination to improve its prophylactic efficacy through the generation of immune responses in the host. Our findings highlight the potential of UdMAg in enhancing the prophylactic efficacy of standard antimalarial drug. This novel integrative approach strengthens the impact of standard antimalarial treatment while offering a potential avenue for immune-based prophylaxis. Such an approach may have significant translational relevance for developing adjunct therapies in malaria-endemic regions, particularly where immune resilience is crucial.",

        "abstract": "Inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) accounts for a high burden of morbidity and mortality in impoverished regions. This is significantly due to infectious diseases and the direct impact on social and economic well-being. The high burden of communicable diseases and malnutrition in Mozambique, as well as high vulnerability to climate change, results in increased risk of WASH-related diseases. Our objective was to describe access to safe water and sanitation practices in Mopeia, a remote rural district in Mozambique. The source of data for this analysis is a cross-sectional, demographic survey carried out in Mopeia in 2021 under the Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa project, a cluster-randomised trial to assess the impact of ivermectin on malaria transmission. The survey was conducted in all households of a sub-population created for the trial, and it included questions about WASH-related practices at the household level. The results showed that  4200 (56.29%) households have an improved water source at walking distance, which is drastically different to sanitation practices, where 6608 (88.56%) households do not have access to at least one basic sanitation service. Data on water access for Mopeia was similar to that reported in rural contexts in sub-Saharan Africa, yet the district remains off-track from achieving universal safe water coverage in the next few years. Regarding sanitation, the use of unsafe sanitation services is more widespread than in the average rural sub-Saharan Africa (75.00%), with twice as many households (n = 3897, 56.08%) practising open land defecation. Mopeia is still far from achieving universal safe water and sanitation coverage by 2030, especially in sanitation, and remains prone to outbreaks and has a high burden of WASH-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "The pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine R21 vaccine adjuvanted with Matrix-M reported good efficacy (75%) in an ongoing phase 3 trial and was recommended World Health Organization for use in children 5-36 months. Vaccine-induced antibodies against NANP are associated with protection, however, various factors such as age, pre-existing immunity, and vaccine dose have been shown to influence vaccine responses. Samples from adults (n =18), children (n = 17), and infants (n = 51) vaccinated with R21/Matrix-M in a phase I trial were assayed for vaccine-specific antibody responses. We measured antibodies (quantity) by MSD and ELISA; and function (quality) by complement (C1q) fixation assay, inhibition of sporozoite invasion (ISI) assay, and avidity assay. Pre-existing malaria antibody exposure was assessed using an anti-3D7 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> crude parasite lysate ELISA. Vaccine-induced CSP antibodies (against full-length R21, NANP, and C terminus), exhibited complement fixation and inhibition of sporozoites. These were significantly lower in adults compared to children and infants. Additionally, children had a higher rate of decay of vaccine-induced antibodies compared to adults 2 years post-vaccination. Furthermore, a higher Matrix-M adjuvant dose resulted in significantly higher C1q fixation, and ISI than the low adjuvant dose in infants. Importantly, functional measures ISI and C1q-fixation were positively associated with the vaccine-induced antibodies overall, but avidity was not. Interestingly, in adults, previous malaria exposure was negatively associated with ISI but positively correlated with avidity and C1q fixation. At baseline, all the study participants were seropositive for anti-HBsAg IgG above the WHO-required protective threshold of 10 mIU/mL, and titers significantly increased post-vaccination. R21/Matrix-M was immunogenic across all age groups, with age and vaccine dose significantly affecting antibody magnitude and function. These findings emphasize the importance of evaluating the right adjuvant and vaccine dose for clinical development progression. This could thus inform the development of next-generation malaria vaccines. However, additional crucial factors need further exploration.",

Peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to 2024 were retrieved from PubMed<sup>®</sup>, Web of Science™ and Google Scholar databases. The study incorporated a total of 1563 peer-reviewed scientific documents and, after filtration, 37 were utilised for systematic review. The findings revealed that AI and digital technology play a key role in patient management, quality assurance and laboratory operations, including healthcare decision-making, disease monitoring and prognosis. Metadata reflected the disproportionate research outputs distribution across Africa. In relation to non-communicable diseases, Egypt, South Africa, and Morocco lead in cardiovascular, diabetes and cancer research. Representing communicable diseases research, Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa were prominent in HIV/AIDS research. South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and Egypt lead in malaria and tuberculosis research. Facilitation of widespread adoption of AI and digital technology in laboratory diagnostics across Africa is critical for maximising patient benefits.

        "abstract": "Free-living amoebas (FLAs) can cause severe and fatal central nervous system infections that are difficult to diagnose. We present the case of a 74-year-old immunocompetent woman admitted for focal neurological symptoms with enhancing lesions in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A first cerebral biopsy showed granulomatous inflammation, but no microorganisms were identified. After transient clinical improvement, she eventually deteriorated 4 months after initial presentation, with an MRI confirming multiple new masses affecting all cerebral lobes. A second brain biopsy revealed granulomatous and acute inflammation with organisms containing a large central nucleus with prominent karyosome, consistent with FLAs. Immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction assays performed at CDC were positive for <i>Acanthamoeba</i> spp, confirming the diagnosis of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) caused by <i>Acanthamoeba</i> spp. The patient was treated with combination therapy recommended by CDC, but died a few days later. Upon histopathological rereview, amoebic cysts and trophozoites were identified by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods in the first cerebral biopsy. FLA infections can be challenging to diagnose because of the low incidence, non-specific clinical and radiological presentation, lack of accessible diagnostic tools, and clinicians' unfamiliarity. This case highlights the importance of recognizing FLA as a potential cause of granulomatous encephalitis, even in the absence of risk factors, as early treatment might be associated with favourable outcomes in case reports.

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mass distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to prevent malaria transmission. Unfortunately, resistance to pyrethroids affects the efficacy of standard ITNs. To overcome this resistance and continue to protect the population, the WHO has recommended new types of ITNs that combine a pyrethroid insecticide with either a synergist (PBO) or a second insecticide, such as chlorfenapyr. This study examines the baseline characteristics of malaria vectors prior to the distribution of three types of insecticide-treated nets as part of a three-arm randomised controlled trial: Interceptor G2 (pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr), VEERALIN (pyrethroid-PBO), and MAGNet (pyrethroid only). The study was carried out in 40 villages (grouped into 33 clusters) of Tiébissou district in central Côte d'Ivoire. To assess biting rate and biting behaviour, human landing catches were conducted hourly indoors and outdoors in six randomly selected houses in each cluster, starting at 18:00 and continuing until 08:00 the next morning. Adult mosquitoes collected were morphologically identified, and a subset of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and An. funestus s.l. were speciated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Plasmodium sporozoite infections were detected by qPCR to estimate infection rates. The entomological inoculation rate was calculated as the product of the mosquito biting rate and the sporozoite infection rate. Among the 10,698 mosquitoes collected, An. gambiae s.l. was the predominant species, accounting for 62.5% (n = 6683) of the catch, followed by An. funestus s.s., which accounted for 19.8% (n = 2120). Of the sub-sample of An. gambiae s.l. processed by PCR, 79.0% (n = 1291/1635) were An. coluzzii and the remaining were Anopheles gambiae s.s. Malaria vectors were highly aggressive, with an average of 14.8 bites/person/night for An. coluzzii, 2.0 b/p/n for An. gambiae s.s. and 5.4 b/p/n for An. funestus, representing an overall average of 22.2 b/p/n (95% CI 17.2-27.2 b/p/n). No significant difference was found in biting activity between indoor and outdoor environments (Z = -0.25, P = 0.803). Plasmodium sporozoite infection rate was 2.4% (95% CI 1.3-3.6%) for An. coluzzii, 1.5% (95% CI 0.3-2.6%) for An. gambiae s.s. and 2.7% (95% CI 1.2-4.3%) for An. funestus. The estimated overall entomological inoculation rate was 0.4 infected b/p/n (95% CI 0.3-0.6) and varied between 0.0 and 0.2 infective bites/person/night according to species. There was no difference observed in entomological infection rate (EIR) between capture locations (indoors versus outdoors; Z = 1.521, P = 0.128). This study shows that An. coluzzii and An. funestus were the main malaria vectors and showed similar biting patterns both indoors and outdoors. Anopheles funestus was found in high density in a limited number of villages. Malaria transmission was high despite universal distribution of pyrethroid-ITN in the district.",

Current vaccines elicit antibody responses against circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) that prevent the infection of hepatocytes but offer only moderate protection. Cellular immunity has emerged as a critical component of preerythrocytic protection that might be leveraged to develop improved PfCSP vaccines. Here, we characterized the clonality, molecular features, epitope specificity, and HLA restrictions of the human PfCSP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response to vaccination with an adjuvanted PfCSP vaccine, FMP013/ALFQ. Using TCR expression cloning, we identified novel conserved CD4+ T cell epitopes in the PfCSP N terminus and showed that the C-terminal CS.T3 epitope was targeted by CD4+ and rare CD8+ T cells, which recognized this epitope co-receptor independently presented on a class II HLA. Our findings provide insights into the utility of these epitopes as targets for strain-transcending immunity compared with the immunodominant but highly polymorphic epitopes in the PfCSP C terminus, offering guidance for the design of improved malaria vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Malaria continues to be a significant public health issue, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite extensive efforts to reduce its burden through various control programs, malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This study aims to assess the burden of malaria in a community and evaluate the community's response to malaria control and management programs. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malaria and evaluate the community's awareness, participation, and response to malaria control and management programs. This cross-sectional study included 550 participants from a community-based population. Data were collected through interviews, surveys, and medical records to determine malaria prevalence, treatment-seeking behavior, and knowledge of malaria control measures such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and antimalarial treatments.  The study found a malaria prevalence of 32% (176 participants), with higher rates in females at 35% (96 out of 275) compared to males at 30% (81 out of 275). A total of 85% (468 participants) recognized malaria symptoms. Awareness of prevention methods was reported by 72% (396 participants) for ITNs and 58% (319 participants) for IRS. Regarding treatment-seeking behavior, 60% (330 participants) visited health facilities, while 25% (138 participants) relied on traditional healers. Participation in malaria control programs was moderate: 62% (341 participants) reported using ITNs, and 50% (275 participants) had participated in IRS activities. Identified barriers included a lack of awareness in 30% (165 participants) and high costs in 20% (110 participants). Socioeconomic status influenced program engagement, with higher participation observed among individuals from wealthier households. Although malaria control and management programs have had a positive impact, only 62% (341 participants) used ITNs and 50% (275 participants) engaged in IRS, indicating a gap in community adherence. Despite 85% (468 participants) being aware of malaria symptoms, knowledge and practical application of preventive measures remain suboptimal. Improving public education, enhancing access to malaria control tools, and addressing socioeconomic barriers are essential to effectively reduce the malaria burden in the community.",

        "abstract": "Early evening and outdoor biting by vector mosquitoes undermines the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), as users of nets are exposed to vector biting whilst not under a net, both outdoors and indoors. This study assessed exposure to malaria vector bites amongst users and non-users of ITNs in southwestern Mali. Using cross-sectional household survey data of human behaviour and malaria infection prevalence, along with mosquito human landing catch (HLC) data collected in 30 separate communities, the average number of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) mosquito bites per person per night (bppn) received outdoors and indoors were estimated for each survey respondent. The proportion of bites that were not preventable by using a net, the relative contributions of outdoor and indoor residual biting, and the risk factors for exposure to vector bites were estimated. Despite very high use of nets (93.2%), malaria infection prevalence was 34% overall. A large proportion of respondents (78%) reported being outdoors at 8 pm, but by midnight, 98% were indoors. Net users were exposed to indoor biting for 1 h, on average, between going indoors and going to bed. For 91%, the net used was an ITN. Human biting rates peaked between 2 and 4 am, when most people (90%) were in bed. Individuals using a net received 11.2 bppn in total, of which 7.1 bppn (63%) occurred outdoors. Those not using a net received almost 10 times the number of bites indoors as net users (38.4 bppn versus 4.0 bppn). The total number of bites received by net users was about one third the total number of bites received by non-net users, indicating the proportion of bites not preventable by use of a net alone. Risk factors for biting exposure included not using a net, going indoors late, location near the river and age over 15 years. ITNs substantially reduce exposure to indoor biting, but in this setting, net users still received a large number of Anopheles mosquito bites, giving rise to high malaria infection prevalence despite near-universal net use. Most residual biting occurred outdoors, but about a third still occurred with individuals indoors before going under a net. Effective interventions that reduce residual outdoor and indoor biting are necessary to reduce the high malaria burden in settings like southwestern Mali.",

        "abstract": "The burden of malaria is lower than ten years ago. However, in the last few years, there has been an increase in the number of malaria cases around the world. a systematic review of studies on the cost of malaria were conducted to understand its economic burden to the health system, the household, and the society as whole. Published articles on the cost of malaria in Africa from 2000 to 2024 were included to this review. Cochrane library, PubMed, and google scholar were searched to access the included articles and the results of the studies were described using text, tables, and diagram. The costs of malaria were presented using minimum and maximum values. The total treatment cost for simple (uncomplicated) malaria per case ranged from USD 4.03 to USD 31.23 and for the severe malaria, it ranged from USD 10.48 to USD 70.86. The maximum preventive cost for insecticide-treated bed nets distribution per unit ITN, larvicide per individual, and indoor residual spraying per a single use was about USD 10.81, USD 28.43, and USD 18.55, respectively. The cost variability across studies and/or countries might be accounted for either the use of different costing methods, spatial variation, or the population considered while estimating the cost for malaria. To synthesise the cost data using meta-analysis, studies on the COI required to follow uniform costing methods and considering the discount rates while calculating health service costs. It can also facilitate meaningful comparison of cost estimates and to apply the results for evidence-based practices.

        "abstract": "Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) remain the WHO-recommended treatment for uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria. However, the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance (ART-R) threatens ACT efficacy. ART-R is phenotypically expressed as delayed parasite clearance, which can facilitate ACT partner drug resistance. ART-R has been causally linked to specific mutations in the <i>Pfkelch13</i> gene. The systematic review and associated meta-analysis aim to determine the correlation between <i>Pfkelch13</i> (alleles present in the <i>Kelch13</i> gene region of the <i>P. falciparum</i> parasite) genotypes and clinical and parasitological response to ACTs from a globally representative data set pooling individual patient data (IPD) from eligible published and unpublished studies. The eligibility criteria include <i>Pfkelch13</i> genotyping results at baseline complemented by individually linked parasitological and clinical assessments following artemisinin-based treatment. The data will be curated, standardised and analysed using this proposed statistical analysis plan (SAP), adhering to PRISMA-IPD (PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Our SAP will apply hierarchical modelling to assess the effect of the <i>P. falciparum</i> parasite <i>Pfkelch13</i> mutations on parasite clearance half-life and therapeutic efficacy across different regions. This will include study sites as random effects in the model and potential predictors such as age, sex, baseline parasite load and other potential effect modifiers as fixed effects. This analysis will enhance the understanding of the influence of <i>Pfkelch13</i> mutations on malaria treatment outcomes. Data were obtained with informed consent and ethical approvals from the relevant countries and were pseudonymised before curation in the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO)/WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) repository. Data ownership remains with contributors. This IPD meta-analysis met the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee criteria for waiving ethical review, as it is a secondary analysis of existing pseudonymised data.

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a global health challenge, necessitating novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we explore the role of the sphingolipid metabolism in Plasmodium infection. We focus on the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (Asm), which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, a structural but also bioactive membrane molecule. We demonstrate induction of Asm activity in infected mice, leading to elevated ceramide levels in infected red blood cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Asm with the functional inhibitor amitriptyline in Plasmodium yoelii (Py)- and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected mice significantly reduces parasitemia and mitigates disease-associated pathology. Amitriptyline treatment also reduces T cell activation, preserving blood-brain barrier integrity upon PbA infection. Remarkably, we observe inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum growth in vitro upon exposure to amitriptyline. Mechanistically, we elucidate that amitriptyline impedes intra-erythrocytic parasite development, due to a reduced glucose uptake and thereby interfering with the spreading of blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. Our findings highlight the therapeutic promise of targeting sphingolipid metabolism to combat Plasmodium infections.",

        "abstract": "Patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) are at risk of severe illness and death if infected by malaria, and lifelong prophylaxis is recommended to individuals in malaria endemic regions. Although its efficacy is declining due to parasite resistance, the antimalarial drug Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) is still given to patients with SCA in several countries of sub-Saharan Africa. A clinical trial was performed to compare SP with Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) for malaria chemoprevention in children with SCA in Uganda and Malawi. This paper describes a study on acceptability which was nested within the trial. To explore views on malaria chemoprevention and the proposed treatment regimens, 29 focus group discussions were conducted with children above 10 years of age with SCA and caregivers of children with SCA. The discussions were transcribed and translated to English before coding and reflexive thematic analysis. Participants from the DP arm reported a reduced number of sick events and hospital admissions while they were in the trial, and ranked DP above SP in terms of perceived effectiveness. Although concerns were raised about initial side effects, a high pill burden, and the unpleasant smell and taste of tablets, most participants were willing to continue long-term administration of DP due to its observed or experienced health benefits. Despite positive attitudes towards the use of weekly DP, monthly dosing was frequently suggested as a better option as it would lower the pill burden and expand the time interval between treatment courses. To mitigate transport costs and time spent away from school and work, most participants preferred a period of two months or longer between drug refill visits at the hospital. During routine care visits, counselling about the importance of accurate dosing and ongoing adherence should be provided to ensure sustainable and successful use of malaria chemoprevention among children with SCA.",

        "abstract": "Currently approved vaccines for the prevention of malaria provide only partial protection against disease, due to high variability in the quality of induced antibodies. These vaccines present the unstructured central repeat region, as well as the C-terminal domain, of the circumsporozoite protein ( <i>Pf</i> CSP) of the malaria parasite, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (1). A recently discovered protective monoclonal antibody, L9, recognizes three structured copies of the <i>Pf</i> CSP minor repeat. Similarly to other highly potent anti-malarial antibodies, L9 relies on critical homotypic interactions between antibodies for its high protective efficacy (2, 3). Here, we report the design of immunogens scaffolding one copy of <i>Pf</i> CSP's minor repeat capable of binding L9. To design immunogens capable of presenting multiple, structure-based epitopes in one scaffold, we developed a machine-learning-driven structural immunogen design pipeline, MESODID, tailored to focus on multi-epitope vaccine targets. We use this pipeline to design multiple scaffolds that present three copies of the <i>Pf</i> CSP minor repeat. A 3.6 Å cryo-EM structure of our top design, minor repeat targeting immunogen (M-TIM), demonstrates that M-TIM successfully orients three copies of L9, effectively recapitulating its critical homotypic interactions. The wide prevalence of repeated epitopes in key vaccine targets, such as HIV-1 Envelope, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and Influenza Hemagglutinin, suggests that MESODID will have broad utility in creating immunogens that incorporate such epitopes, offering a new powerful approach to developing vaccines against a range of challenging infections, including malaria. In this study, we present a machine learning driven, structure-guided protein design pipeline built specifically for the design of multi-epitope vaccine immunogens. We employ the pipeline here to design and solve the cryo-EM structure of a <i>de novo</i> immunogen that binds and properly orients three copies of the anti-malarial monoclonal antibody L9, producing a promising next-generation malaria vaccine immunogen. This design pipeline could be employed to design any number of structurally constrained multi-epitope immunogens, as well as other proteins designed to bind multiple targets.",

        "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections (STIs/RTIs) are important, but underdiagnosed risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), used for intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp), may reduce STI/RTI burden due to its antibacterial activity. We assessed the impact of IPTp regimens on STI/RTI prevalence at delivery and associations between these infections and adverse birth outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing monthly IPTp with SP, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), or DP+SP among pregnant women in Uganda. Vaginal swabs collected at or near delivery were tested for <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>, <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, and Group B <i>Streptococcus</i> (GBS) using GeneXpert; bacterial vaginosis was assessed using Nugent scoring. Log-binomial regression was used to compare STI/RTI prevalence by IPTp arm, using IPTp-DP as the reference arm. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to evaluate associations between infections and preterm delivery, term low birthweight (LBW), overall LBW, and small-for-gestational age. Among the 2265 participants assessed, IPTp-SP reduced prevalence of <i>C. trachomatis</i> by 80% (2.5% vs. 12.4%; RR=0.20, 95% CI: 0.12-0.33) and of GBS by 35% (7.7% vs 11.7%; RR=0.65, 95% CI: 0.43-0.99) compared to IPTp-DP. <i>C. trachomatis</i> was associated with increased preterm delivery risk (RR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.07-3.25) and GBS was associated with increased term LBW risk (RR=2.08, 95% CI: 1.06-4.08).

        "abstract": "Bed bugs (Cimex spp.) are obligate ectoparasites that have long been associated with human dwellings, causing discomfort and psychosocial distress. Conventional control strategies relying on insecticides are increasingly challenged by resistance, necessitating alternative interventions. Ivermectin, an endectocide known to impact various neglected tropical diseases and hematophagous arthropods, is currently being assessed for malaria vector control. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of ivermectin on Cimex hemipterus, the predominant bed bug species in Africa, within the framework of the Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa (BOHEMIA) project in Kwale, Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 352 households to obtain information on self-reported bed bug infestations, socioeconomic status, and household characteristics. Bed bugs were collected from 40 infested households. After collection, bed bugs were acclimatized and exposed to blood meals spiked with ivermectin at five concentrations (85 ng/ml, 64 ng/ml, 43 ng/ml, 21 ng/ml, and 11 ng/ml), corresponding to expected serum levels 4 h to 6-7 days following a 400 µg/kg oral dose. Mortality and fecundity were monitored over a 14-day period. Statistical analyses, including Cox proportional hazard models and probit regression, were applied to assess dose-response relationships. Bed bug infestation was common, with 75% of participating households reporting their presence, with infestations being strongly associated with the number of people residing in a household. Ivermectin exposure resulted in significant dose-dependent mortality in Cimex hemipterus, with the higher concentrations (43, 64, and 85 ng/ml) inducing over 90% mortality within 3 days postfeeding. Bed bugs that ingested blood meals containing sublethal doses of ivermectin did not lay eggs. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated a clear inverse relationship between ivermectin concentration and bed bug survival. These findings provide evidence that ivermectin, administered as part of a mass drug administration campaign, could contribute to bed bug control alongside its intended impact on other diseases or vectors. The results underscore the potential for integrated public health approaches leveraging endectocide interventions. Further field evaluations in diverse locations are needed to determine the optimal number of administrations and treatment intervals required for complete infestation elimination.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where asymptomatic cases contribute to ongoing transmission and hinder elimination efforts. Asymptomatic individuals act as hidden reservoirs, sustaining onward malaria transmission. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of asymptomatic malaria in Mwandi District, Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted between January to May 2024 in Mwandi District. Blood samples were collected for malaria diagnosis and simultaneously tested using rapid diagnostic tests and Giemsa-stained blood smear microscopy techniques to detect Plasmodium infections. Structured questionnaires were administered to gather demographic data and information on potential risk factors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data while categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between outcomes and independent variables, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. A total of 370 participants were enrolled in the study, with females comprising the majority (52.4%) and a median age of 24 years (IQR: 9-30). The overall prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was (4.1%), as determined by microscopy. Logistic regression analysis showed that females had significantly lower odds of asymptomatic malaria compared to males (AOR: 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.68; p = 0.010). Additionally, participants residing in Matoya and Sikute were more likely to have asymptomatic malaria, with adjusted odds ratios of 4.56 (95% CI 1.10-18.80; p = 0.036) and 4.72 (95% CI 1.03-21.50; p = 0.045), respectively. No significant associations were found with insecticide-treated net use, indoor residual spraying, or socioeconomic status. The findings highlight the need for targeted surveillance and interventions in high-risk groups and locations to curb silent transmission. Despite limitations in diagnostic sensitivity, the study underscores the importance of integrating asymptomatic malaria screening into control programmes to advance elimination efforts in Zambia and similar endemic regions.",

We identified compound 12, a type II kinase inhibitor based on aminopyridine and 2,6-benzimidazole scaffolds, as a lead compound with nanomolar potency, fast action, and in vivo activity in the Plasmodium berghei rodent malaria model. Three-hybrid luciferase fragment complementation, enzymatic studies, and cellular thermal shift assays implicated Plasmodium protein kinase 6 (PfPK6) as the target. However, conditional knockdown of PfPK6 did not alter 12 potency, suggesting complex mechanisms of action. In vitro selection for compound 12 resistance revealed mutations in three transporters: multidrug-resistance protein 1, chloroquine resistance transporter and V-type ATPase, indicating a digestive vacuole site of action. Compound 12 inhibited β-hematin and hemozoin formation while increasing free heme levels, suggesting antimalarial activity via blockade of heme detoxification. Our studies repurpose a safe human kinase inhibitor as a potent, fast-acting antimalarial with established in vivo efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Viral zoonoses pose a significant public health challenge in Africa, characterized by a diverse array of pathogens transmitted from animals to humans. This review maps the geographic distribution of zoonotic viral diseases in Africa, including rodent-borne, bat-borne, tick-borne, mosquito-borne, and sandfly-associated viral zoonoses, along with those transmitted via fecal-oral and respiratory routes. This review informs surveillance, resource allocation, and One Health strategies by mapping zoonotic viral disease risks across Africa based on geographic existence. The overlapping clinical symptoms of these infections, particularly fever and headache, with endemic parasitic diseases, such as malaria and/or other intestinal parasitic infections, complicate accurate diagnosis, timely treatment, and case management, and further contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. The limited diagnostic capabilities and resource constraints of healthcare systems hinder effective surveillance and outbreak response, exacerbating the risks associated with zoonotic diseases. The economic burden of viral infections poses significant challenges for communities reliant on livestock. Therefore, identifying and mapping zoonotic viral diseases is critical to informing integrated strategies that address human, animal, and environmental health. A One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of these domains, is essential for managing the complex dynamics of zoonotic diseases transmission. strengthening surveillance systems, improving public health education, and strategically allocating resources are key to reducing the impact of viral zoonoses across Africa. Collaborative engagement among governments, non-governmental organizations, and international health agencies is crucial for building resilient health systems capable of responding effectively to both existing and emerging zoonotic threats.",

        "abstract": "Malaria poses an enormous threat to human health. With ever-increasing resistance to currently deployed antimalarials, new targets and starting point compounds with novel mechanisms of action need to be identified. Here, we explore the antimalarial activity of the Streptomyces sp natural product, 5'-O-sulfamoyl-2-chloroadenosine (dealanylascamycin, DACM) and compare it with the synthetic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) mimic, 5-O-sulfamoyladenosine (AMS). These nucleoside sulfamates exhibit potent inhibition of P. falciparum growth with an efficacy comparable to that of the current front-line antimalarial, dihydroartemisinin. Exposure of P. falciparum to DACM leads to inhibition of protein translation, driven by eIF2α phosphorylation. We show that DACM targets multiple aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), including the cytoplasmic aspartyl tRNA synthetase (AspRS). The mechanism involves hijacking of the reaction product, leading to the formation of a tightly bound inhibitory amino acid-sulfamate conjugate. We show that recombinant P. falciparum and P. vivax AspRS are susceptible to hijacking by DACM and AMS, generating Asp-DACM and Asp-AMS adducts that stabilize these proteins. By contrast, human AspRS appears less susceptible to hijacking. X-ray crystallography reveals that apo P. vivax AspRS exhibits a stabilized flipping loop over the active site that is poised to bind substrates. By contrast, human AspRS exhibits disorder in an extended region around the flexible flipping loop as well as in a loop in motif II. These structural differences may underpin the decreased susceptibility of human AspRS to reaction-hijacking by DACM and AMS. Our work reveals Plasmodium AspRS as a promising antimalarial target and highlights structural features that underpin differences in the susceptibility of aaRSs to reaction hijacking inhibition.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis, transmitted by sandflies, causes a severe health threat in East African refugee camps. High mobility, poor conditions and limited healthcare access heighten the risk of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) among refugees. Though, data on infection prevalence is remains limited. This study aims to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection in refugee camps in Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella regions to improve VL detection and guide effective control strategies in humanitarian settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August 2023 in four refugee camps to determine Leishmania infection using DAT and rtPCR on blood samples. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using structured questionnaires. Ethical approval was granted, and informed consent was obtained. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23, with associations assessed using logistic regression and Chi-square tests at a 0.05 significance level. Continuous variables summarized by median and interquartile range (IQR). The study included 1,223 participants (440 from Tsore camp and 220 from Sherkole in Benishangul Gumuz Region; 288 from Kule camp and 275 from Terkidi in Gambella Region), most of whom were from South Sudan (66.7%) and the majority were females (56.5%). 17.8% of the participants reported fever, with no spleen or liver enlargement and 0.2% lymph node swelling. Real-time PCR positivity was significantly higher in Tsore (14.6%, χ² = 21.4, p < 0.001), no significant difference in DAT positivity was observed across refugee camps (χ² = 6.6, p = 0.084). Leishmania DAT positivity rates were 6.0%, 4.6% and 4.7% in those with fever, chills and headache, respectively. Leishmania kDNA based rtPCR positivity rate were 11.7%, 8.8%, 7.3% and 6.2% in those with fever, chills, headache and weakness, respectively. Participants from Benishangul Gumuz region [AOR: 3.67 (95%CI: 1.57-8.59); p = 0.003]; South Sudanese [AOR: 2.87 (95%CI: 1.26-6.50); p = 0.012 and those with fever [AOR: 2.08 (95%CI: 1.01-4.28); p = 0.047] had a higher odds of DAT positivity. On the other hand, lower rtPCR positivity rates were seen in the Sherkole refugee camp compared to Tsore camps in Benishangul Gumuz region [AOR: 0.19 (95%CI: 0.08-0.45); p < 0.0001]. Leishmania infection was prevalent in refugee camps in Gambella and Benishangul Gumuz regions.

        "abstract": "Natural antimalaria agent have been documented in different plants materials. Medicinal plants have been part of human society for the treatment of infectious diseases. Plants have invariably been a rich source for new drugs, most especially antimalarial drugs; this has resulted to the discovery of quinine and artemisinin which are plant-based malaria drug. The study determined the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical constituents of Xylopia aethiopica leaf extract and to evaluate the curative antimalaria potency and prophylactic potentials of Xylopia aethiopica leaf extract in the management of malaria parasite in an animal mode. This study is designed to test the curative and prophylactic effects of Xylopia aethiopica leaf extract in the treatment and prevention of malaria infection using albino mice infected with Plasmodium berghei and compare the effects with known antimalaria drug artemether lumefantrine (A-L) combination therapy using mice as experimental model. The Xylopia aethiopica leaf was collection, identification and air-dried. After air-drying, the plant material was pulverized and kept in a Ziplock bag. The pulverized plant material was macerated by soaking it in absolute methanol for 72 h. The extraction was filtered and concentrated under vacuum in a rotatory evaporator. Phytochemical constituents were determined using standard procedure. Swiss albino mouse infected with P. berghei was used for inoculum preparation. Curative and prophylactic efficacy of the extract was tested using three doses of the extract (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg), while 4 mg/kg of Artemether-Lumefantrine (A-L) standard drug was included in the study as positive control and normal saline as negative control. Parasitaemia level was determined to check the level of infection and potency of the plant product. Phytochemical analysis of the leaf extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, sterols, and saponins. The curative effect of Xylopia aethiopica leaf extract against Plasmodium berghei infection in mice was found to be dose-dependent. A significantly higher parasite clearance rate (p < 0.05) was observed in the artemether-lumefantrine treatment group compared to all extract-treated groups on day 1 post-treatment. However, by day 2, mice treated with 30 mg/kg (45.74%) and 100 mg/kg (46.14%) of the leaf extract showed higher parasite clearance rates than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine (35.42%). By day 5, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in parasite clearance between the 100 mg/kg extract group and the artemether-lumefantrine group, with both achieving a clearance rate of 99.60%. Throughout the study, both the extract (particularly at 100 mg/kg) and artemether-lumefantrine showed significantly higher parasite clearance rates (p < 0.05) compared to the negative control group. On days 4 and 5, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed in parasite clearance between the 100 mg/kg extract group (93.60% and 99.60%) and the artemether-lumefantrine group (92.70% and 99.60%), respectively. In prophylactic efficacy study, the extract also demonstrated dose-dependent prevention against P. berghei. Mice treated with 100 mg/kg of the extract showed significantly lower parasitemia levels (p < 0.05), with rates of 23.98%, 24.02%, and 24.08% recorded on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively, compared to other extract dosages. The plant extract showed potential early-stage parasite clearance effectiveness and indicated a strong preventive potential against P. berghei infection at the application of the higher dose. The significant parasite clearance observed along with the dose-dependent preventive effect shows that X. aethiopica leaf extract has promising therapeutic and prophylactic potential.",

        "abstract": "In Madagascar, a sentinel surveillance system was set up in 18 hospitals since 2014 and was managed by the Ministry of Public Health and the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. In order to improve the access to appropriate health care in Madagascar, the main clinical diagnoses in hospitalized patients were analyzed. At hospitalization of a patient, each unit involved in the sentinel surveillance recorded the clinical diagnosis through an e-health platform. Data from September 2014 to July 2018 were analyzed. Morbidity and annual incidence of diseases according to ICD-10 were reported. A total of 140,789 inpatients information was recorded. The median age was 28.2 years (IQR: 18.3; 45.3). 21.6% of the children < 15 years suffered from communicable diseases. The hospital morbidity was 4.01% for malaria, 0.84% for tuberculosis, 0.09% for HIV/AIDS and 0.05% for plague. The hospital morbidity of non-communicable diseases was higher compared to communicable diseases with 7.8%, 7.1% and 3.1% for \"Diseases of the circulatory system\", \"Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes\" and \"Mental and behavioural disorders\", respectively. \"Pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium\" represented 20.5% of the hospitalized patients. The e-health platform enabled continuous and standardized data collection. Communicable diseases affect mainly children < 15 years. Non-communicable diseases are on the rise and need more attention by national health authorities. A number of hospitalizations could be prevented by a better health care management at the community-based health care level and by implementation of a Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Madagascar.",

        "abstract": "Malaria is endemic in 96% of Uganda, making targeted malaria prevention programming critical to malaria elimination. In areas with low transmission rates prevention resources are limited to mass distribution of bednets every three years. Mosquito nets remain one of the most efficient and affordable malaria prevention strategies. While net distributions have increased net ownership, that has not translated to a comparable increase in net use. The Luwero District is one of two areas with increased rates of severe malaria between 2017-2021. Findings from previous studies indicate that there are a variety of factors associated with individuals choosing not to use a net even when available. This study examined community members' knowledge about malaria, their prevention methods, net ownership, net characteristics, and net use. Using a convenience sample of 106 adults, quantitative data were collected using a structured, in-person survey in four villages in central rural Uganda. Questions and response categories were read aloud; the researcher documented each response electronically. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the sample populations. Theoretical constructs were compared between those with and without a recent diagnosis of malaria with the household. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between the theoretical constructs and recent malaria diagnosis after controlling for demographic characteristics. Findings from this study indicate high rates of net ownership and self-reported use within the rural areas. Perceived susceptibility and barriers were greater among those with a recent diagnosis of malaria within the household. The positive association remained significant after controlling for household size. Understanding the specific factors related to individuals' knowledge and use of bednets is key to reducing rates of severe malaria.",

        "abstract": "Malaria remains a significant public health challenge in Ethiopia, with over 7.3 million cases and 1,157 deaths reported between January 1 and October 20, 2024. Despite extensive distribution campaigns, 35% of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) remain underutilized, hindering malaria control efforts. Traditional statistical approaches have identified socioeconomic and demographic factors as predictors of ITN use, but often fail to capture complex, nonlinear interactions. This study applies machine learning to identify non-apparent factors of ITN utilization and investigates its performance in prediction as compared to traditional logistic regression. This study applied ML models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, to predict ITN utilization using the 2023 Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) Ethiopia dataset, a nationally representative survey of 9,763 households. The dataset included 18 variables: region, household size, wealth quintile, and housing conditions. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The values of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) were used to interpret feature importance and interaction effects. Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed traditional logistic regression, achieving AUC scores of 0.89(0.91 after optimization) and 0.88, respectively. Key determinants of ITN utilization included geographic region, household size, wealth quintile, and maternal education. Nonlinear interactions, such as the moderating effect of maternal education on income-related barriers, were identified. Regional disparities were evident, with Amhara and Oromia showing higher ITN Utilization compared to urban areas like Harari and Dire Dawa. Middle-income households exhibited the highest ITN usage (23.7%), challenging the assumption of linear wealth gradients. This study demonstrates the superiority of machine learning (ML) models in capturing complex, nonlinear determinants of ITN utilization, providing actionable insights for targeted malaria prevention strategies. Findings underscore the need for region-specific interventions, integration of ITN distribution with educational and economic empowerment programs, and synergies with environmental health improvements. The study highlights the potential of ML to enhance precision in public health in resource-limited settings, contributing to Ethiopia's National Malaria Elimination Roadmap and global malaria eradication efforts.",

However, tissue dissociation presents a challenge for non-model organisms, as commercial kits are often incompatible, and current protocols rely on tissue enzymatic digestion for extended periods. Tissue digestion can alter cell transcription in response to temperature and the stress caused by enzymatic treatment. Here, we propose a protocol to stabilize RNA using a deep eutectic solvent (Vivophix, Rapid Labs) prior to tissue dissociation, thereby avoiding transcription changes induced by the process and preventing RNase activity during incubation. We validated this methodology for three medically important insect vectors: <i>Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Lutzomyia longipalpis.</i> Single-cell RNA sequencing using our insect midgut dissociation protocol yielded high-quality sequencing results, with a high number of cells recovered, a low percentage of mitochondrial reads, and a low percentage of ambient RNA-two hallmark standards of cell quality. Key features • This protocol stabilizes tissue RNA before dissociation, avoiding RNase-mediated RNA degradation and transcription changes during the dissociation process. • Current protocols for insect midgut dissociation use enzymatic digestion of live tissues at temperatures that are incompatible with insect physiology. • We validated this new stabilization-dissociation methodology for insect midgut, yielding high-quality single-cell RNA sequencing with high gene counts, low mitochondrial RNA, and minimal ambient RNA contamination.

        "abstract": "Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is an effective drug combination that is used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria worldwide including travellers. Although this treatment is regarded as highly effective, recrudescence of falciparum malaria may occur in the weeks after treatment with AL. The occurrence of recrudescence and its potential (risk) factors in travellers remain poorly investigated. This retrospective cohort study included falciparum malaria cases treated with AL at a tertiary referral hospital in the Netherlands, between January 1, 2010, and July 1, 2024. The primary outcome was the proportion of recrudescence cases among falciparum malaria cases who completed treatment with AL. Recrudescence was defined as a negative microscopy result for Plasmodium falciparum at least once after AL treatment, followed by a subsequent positive result without intercurrent travel to malaria-endemic areas. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of recrudescence cases that experienced secondary treatment failures (recrudescence after retreatment with AL or other malaria therapies) and factors associated with recrudescence. In addition to our cohort study, we performed a literature review on studies reporting on falciparum recrudescence cases after AL treatment among travellers. Of 391 falciparum malaria cases identified, 270 were treated with AL and thus included in this study. Among these, eight (3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-6%) recrudescence cases were identified. Diarrhoea was a risk factor for recrudescence in our cohort (unadjusted OR 4.9 95%; CI: 1.14-21.06). In the literature, 19 studies reported on 61 recrudescence cases amongst a total of 1,770 malaria cases (3%). No secondary treatment failures occurred in recrudescence cases treated with AL from our cohort or the literature (0/19), whereas secondary treatment with atovaquone-proguanil failed in 2/28 (7%) of cases. Recrudescence after AL treatment is rare among travellers, and was associated with diarrhoea, which might cause malabsorption. When recrudescence occurs, retreatment with AL is effective.",

        "title": "The case for optimal investment in combating HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria: a global modelling study.",
        "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include ending the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria by 2030. With 5 years remaining to meet this goal, and with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria seeking funding for programmes in 2027-29, establishing what can be achieved through continued investment in combatting these diseases is crucial. We aimed to estimate the potential for impact by analysing the funding landscape and epidemiological situations of these three diseases, the costs of key programmes, and the extent of possible future progress in the countries eligible for Global Fund support. In this modelling study, we developed estimates of the financial resources needed in Global Fund-supported countries to combat HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria from the global plans produced by UNAIDS, the Stop TB Partnership, and WHO. Estimates of available resources in the coming years were obtained by assuming that national expenditure on the three diseases would grow in line with general governmental expenditures, that the Global Fund would contribute an additional $18·0 billion, and that other developmental assistance would be at the same level in real terms as the average in the period 2020-22. Epidemiological and costing models for each of the three diseases were used to quantify the possible impact in Global Fund-eligible countries (including on aggregated mortality and incidence rates). The return on investment (ROI) was computed considering both the intrinsic value of health and the direct economic benefits of the reduced risk of morbidity and premature mortality. The analysis was completed at the end of 2024 with the latest available data, which pertained to the year 2023. The focus of the projection period was 2027-29, a period for which scale-up plans and funding have not yet been committed and the period when most of the resources raised by the eighth replenishment of the Global Fund would be used. The total resource needs for the three diseases were estimated to be US$140·6 billion in 2027-29. We calculated that $111·3 billion (79%) of this need could be met from domestic financing ($69·7 billion), the Global Fund ($18·0 billion), and other external donors ($23·6 billion). Optimal use of these available resources could save 23 million lives and avert 400 million cases and new infections during 2027-29. The trajectory of the combined mortality rate for all diseases was projected to approach that needed to reach the SDG for 2030 (with a difference between the target in 2030 and the projection at the end of 2029 of between 1·5% and 15·5% of the normalised aggregated mortality rate), inequality in life expectancy between countries would be 7% lower by 2029, and 189 million fewer hospital days and 572 million fewer outpatient visits would be needed in 2027-29, saving $1·1 billion. For every $1·00 invested, there could be up to $19·00 in intrinsic health value created or $3·50 in direct economic benefits. Continued investments to combat HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria could yield enormous health gains and a high return on investment. Realising these benefits will require continued growth in national expenditure and a broad maintenance of external financing for these diseases, including a successful replenishment of the Global Fund in 2025.

        "abstract": "The physiological response of mosquitoes to cold is poorly understood, particularly for Anopheles mosquitoes, where overwintering is rarer than in Aedes and Culex. The effect of cold selection was examined in two laboratory strains of the major malaria vector An. arabiensis that differ in insecticide resistant phenotypes. This is due to previous studies that demonstrated an increased tolerance for high temperatures in insecticide resistant An. arabiensis. The insecticide unselected SENN strain and the insecticide-resistant SENN-DDT strain were reared at decreasing fluctuating temperatures for three generations until adults emerged at 18°C. Adults from this generation was exposed to 18°C and 25°C and their longevity compared to unselected counterparts. Furthermore, their landing and biting behaviour at 20 and 25°C were assessed. Finally, the expression of the antimicrobial peptides Attacin, Cecropin, Defensin and Gambicin was assessed. The cold selection had variable effects on the two strains. Cold selection significantly increased adult female longevity at 18°C in SENN-DDT but not SENN. By contrast, cold selection increased landing at 20°C in SENN but not SENN-DDT. However, it decreased biting success at 20°C in both strains. Cold treatment increased Attacin and cecropin expression in both strains but had no effect on Defensin and Gambicin expression. This study suggests that winter survival in An. arabiensis is associated with increased longevity and reduced feeding success. Increased antimicrobial peptide activity was generally observed under cold conditions. These factors combined may contribute to reduced transmission of Plasmodium under winter conditions, over and above the low population density.",

        "title": "Initial community response to a novel spatial repellent for malaria prevention in Busia County, Kenya.",
        "abstract": "Malaria transmission in Africa significantly declined between 2005 and 2015 due to widespread distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). However, since 2015, transmission has increased due to insecticide resistance and biting at times when people are not using ITNs. Spatial repellents (SRs) may help address these challenges. A double-blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in Busia County, Kenya, reported that Mosquito Shield™, a transfluthrin-based SR, reduced malaria infections by 33.4% during interim analysis and 32.7% by the end of the study, among children aged 6 months to 10 years. Understanding community responses to SRs is critical for their successful deployment and long-term use. This paper reports the initial community response to MosquitoShield™ as part of the Advancing Evidence for the Global Implementation of Spatial Repellents (AEGIS) project. Longitudinal qualitative data were collected from 30 households participating in the cRCT, using modified trials of improved practices (TIPs) to assess participants' perceptions of MosquitoShield's utility, efficacy, appearance, and user experience with monthly product replacement. This analysis focuses on initial responses recorded one week and two months post-installation. The data were analysed using thematic coding, with researchers blinded to trial arm assignment. The participants reported a positive initial response to the SR, with a significant perceived reduction in mosquito density and activity. Some also reported concerns about the product's effectiveness over time and its comparison with existing mosquito control methods, particularly after first replacement. Participants highlighted their perception that the SR provided continuous protection in contrast with the situational protection offered by ITNs. Improvement suggestions included modified installation methods plus a longer-lasting product that protected more space. MosquitoShield™ shows potential as a promising malaria prevention tool among communities in Busia County, Kenya. Incorporating user feedback and addressing concerns about product installation, duration, and coverage are crucial for successful implementation. Future research exploring community perceptions, cultural factors and behavioural responses related to long-term acceptability and the impact of SRs on malaria transmission will be crucial to ensure effective SR implementation.",

        "abstract": "Imported malaria cases from endemic regions pose significant challenges for malaria-free countries, leading to diagnostic delays, high treatment costs, and the potential for secondary local transmissions. There is a lack of understanding regarding the cognitive decision-making processes that influence travelers' intentions to engage in protective behaviors against malaria. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the factors that impact the willingness of travelers from China to adopt protective measures against malaria. In a cross-sectional study conducted between March and October 2023, we utilized an online survey based on the malaria knowledge and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) scales in Nanjing and Suzhou of Jiangsu Province, China. The survey was distributed by staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Chinese international travelers after their returning from abroad. We analyzed the intentions to engage in malaria protective behaviors by multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling. In total, 252 international travelers from Jiangsu Province provided valid responses. Approximately 127 (50.4%) reported that their destination was a malaria-endemic area when they had traveled abroad. All seven PMT subconstructs were significantly affected by the malaria knowledge (all P < 0.05). Of all seven PMT subconstructs, two (severity and vulnerability) were strongly associated with intentions to engage in protective behavior. Notably, the level of malaria knowledge was insufficient for motivating protective behavior intention. The intention to engage in antimalarial behaviors is closely linked to travelers' evaluation of malaria-related risks and their perceived ability to manage these threats. It is essential to enhance general knowledge on the risk of malaria and to provide robust pre- and post-travel healthcare for international travelers heading to malaria-endemic regions. This approach will empower travelers to adopt protective measures and reduce the incidence of imported malaria cases.",

        "abstract": "Preventing malaria is crucial, especially given that vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and neonates bear a disproportionate malaria burden and such illness can have long-term consequences for their health. Zimbabwe faces a high burden of malaria, which falls heavily on pregnant women and their neonates, contributing towards maternal and neonatal mortality, maternal anaemia and low birthweight. We contribute to the existing literature by examining the correlation between malaria prophylaxis stock-outs and health outcomes in this vulnerable group in Zimbabwe. Women who do not receive malaria prophylaxis during pregnancy are at risk of malaria infections, which can lead to maternal anaemia and lower birthweight. Our data set combines the administrative data on malaria prophylaxis stock-outs from 2011 to 2015 accessed from the Ministry of Health and Child Care and the 2015 nationally representative Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey data. We estimate the correlation between malaria prophylaxis stock-outs and health outcomes using ordinary least squares and recentered influence functional unconditional quantile regressions analysis. We found that malaria prophylaxis stock-outs increase over time and have a significant association with birthweight for neonates at the 50th percentile. For neonates with an average birthweight we see a significant and negative association between stock-outs and birthweight (coefficient: -0.271, 95%CI: -0.496;-0.046). However, stock-outs were insignificantly associated with low birthweight ranges as well as above normal birthweight. Although SP stock-outs were not associated with neonates with low birth weight, they push foetus with average weight towards the lower end of normal birth weight. These neonates are prone to developmental disabilities. It is crucial to ensure the availability of Sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine drugs at the facility level. We recommend that policymakers invest in pharmaceutical information systems and stock ordering systems to prioritise malaria prevention and ensure frequent availability of malaria prophylaxis in Zimbabwe. On the demand-side, more frequent facility visits can also help to ensure adherence.",

        "abstract": "Anopheles mosquitoes serve as a significant vector for the transmission of malaria and arboviruses holding great medical importance, but their phylogenetic relationships have not yet been clearly elucidated. This study was the first to sequence and analyze the mitochondrial genomic features of An. hyrcanus and An. messeae, and to incorporate them into a phylogenetic analysis with 102 other species within the genus Anopheles. Both genomes contain 37 genes, including 22 tRNAs, 13 protein-coding genes and 2 rRNAs, as well as one control region. The genome characteristics, codon usage, and tRNA secondary structure of the two species align with those observed in mitochondrial genomes of other mosquito species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the relationship among six subgenera was Lophopodomyia + ((Kerteszia + Stethomyia) + ((Cellia + Anopheles) + Nyssorhynchus)), providing strong support for their monophyly. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic relationships within subgenus Cellia were inconsistent with previous findings. The findings of this study will enrich the biological information repository for Anopheles mosquitoes, lay the foundation for further research on systematic classification, and hold significant implications for guiding the research, prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how antimalarial regimens affect host metabolism could inform more effective Plasmodium vivax control strategies. This study investigated plasma metabolic alterations in P. vivax-infected patients treated with four antimalarial regimens using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Patients received: (T1) chloroquine (CQ) for 3 days + primaquine (PQ) for 14 days; (T2) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) for 3 days + PQ for 14 days; (T3) CQ + PQ42 (from day 42); or (T4) DHA-PPQ + PQ42 (from day 42). CQ-based regimens (T1, T3) caused broad metabolic perturbations involving arginine/proline, aspartate/asparagine, glutamate, nitrogen, pyrimidine, and vitamin B3 metabolism pathway. TI specifically affected alanine/aspartate, and methionine/cysteine metabolisms, while T3 influenced aminosugar, butanoate, glutathione metabolisms, glycine, serine, alanine, threonine metabolisms, tyrosine, and ubiquinone metabolisms. These disruptions have the potential to impair vascular function and immune responses, and affect redox balance and energy production, vital in parasite clearance and host recovery. Contrastingly, DHA-PPQ-based regimens (T2, T4) had distinct effects. T2 altered histidine metabolism, while T4 disrupted the carnitine shuttle, porphyrin metabolism, and plasma lipid levels; changes that may potentially impact energy homeostasis during infection, hemoglobin turnover and oxidative stress responses. Regimens lacking PQ (T3, T4) affected androgen/estrogen biosynthesis, implicating PQ to modulate hormone-related responses during treatment. These findings suggest antimalarial regimens exert regimen-specific metabolic effects, with CQ-based therapies broadly impacting amino acid and redox metabolism, and DHA-PPQ-based therapies affecting lipid and mitochondrial pathways. Mapping these metabolic signatures reveals the profound impact of these interventions on patients and support host-directed strategies for optimized vivax malaria management.",

These were the first autochthonous cases since 2003 when a cluster was identified in Florida. The aim of this study was to genetically characterize the implicated <i>P. vivax</i> isolates in order to complement epidemiologic investigations of these cases. A custom Illumina AmpliSeq sequencing panel capturing 495 amplicons was designed. This panel was used to ascertain whether these 2023 cases were related, and assess if they were associated with a single or separate introduction events. Sequence data were hierarchically clustered and a Naïve Bayes classification approach was used to assign genotypes to a probable geographic origin based on 113 'geo-informative' SNPs captured by the panel. Genotypes associated with the 2023 Arkansas, Texas, and Florida cases were clustered alongside those sequenced from archived blood samples from the 2003 Florida case-patients, a set of reference strains, and other travel-associated specimens. Microsatellite analysis was performed on a subset of samples from these autochthonous cases to complement the AmpliSeq analysis. The 2023 autochthonous Florida cases were genetically linked as were the 2003 Florida cases. The 2023 and 2003 Florida clusters were genetically distinct, and the two Florida clusters were distinct from the 2023 Texas and Arkansas cases, which were also distinct from each other. These genotypes classified to the Central or South American region using the Naïve Bayes classifier, including those from the 2003 cluster. These data support that at least three distinct <i>P. vivax</i> introduction events in the US in 2023, involving parasites possessing genetic signatures consistent with Central or South America.
