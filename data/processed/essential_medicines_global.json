        "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder that is commonly managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Although CPAP is clinically effective, issues related to device hygiene and contamination remain understudied. This study aims to present a practical protocol for CPAP disassembly and cleaning and to report the outcomes of its implementation over a 2-year period. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 359 OSA patients prescribed CPAP therapy between 2018 and 2025. Of these, 136 patients participated in a complimentary, comprehensive CPAP cleaning service. Contamination was assessed using a subjective visual analog scale (VAS) following photographic documentation of each device component. The relationship between contamination scores and device usage duration was analyzed. Patients who received the cleaning service did not differ significantly from the overall cohort in terms of age, sex, apnea-hypopnea index, or average daily usage time, except that they had a significantly shorter total duration of usage. Contamination was found on all device components, including internal parts that are not routinely inspected. Positive correlations between contamination levels and usage duration were statistically significant for every component. The cleaning process required approximately 2 days per device and was feasible for routine clinical implementation. CPAP devices accumulate visible contamination over time, emphasizing the need for standardized cleaning protocols. Our experience indicates that physician-led education, patient cooperation, and dedicated involvement of paramedical staff are essential in reducing contamination risks. Interdisciplinary collaboration is recommended to develop evidence-based guidelines for CPAP hygiene management.",

        "abstract": "Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common consequence following abdominal surgeries; however, its incidence and risk factors in non-abdominal procedures remain unknown. Identifying clinical indicators of POI in this population is essential for early detection and treatment. This study aims to assess the incidence and determinants of postoperative ileus (POI) in patients undergoing non-abdominal surgeries at Debre Tabor Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. A prospective cohort study was conducted between September 1, 2024, and January 30, 2025. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, surgical details, and perioperative parameters were recorded. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27, with continuous and categorical variables summarized using descriptive statistics. Independent predictors of postoperative ileus (POI) were identified through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Among the 400 patients who underwent elective non-abdominal surgery, 31 (7.75%) developed postoperative ileus (POI). Significant predictors included opioid use (OR = 3.28 [95% CI, 2.25-7.12], P < 0.01), neuromuscular blockers (OR = 2.33 [95% CI, 2.01-5.12], P < 0.01), poor postoperative functional status (OR = 5.67 [95% CI, 3.41-8.91], P < 0.01), and delayed postoperative mobility (OR = 4.45 [95% CI, 2.05-8.17], P < 0.01). POI occurs in a significant proportion of patients undergoing non-abdominal surgery. Implementing targeted perioperative strategies may reduce the incidence of POI and enhance postoperative outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent condition affecting a significant number of women globally. In Ethiopia, the intersection of cultural beliefs, limited health education, and resource availability may exacerbate challenges such as absenteeism and decreased academic performance among female students facing this condition. Understanding the lived experiences of these students and their coping mechanisms, as well as their impact on academic performance, is vital for developing targeted interventions and supporting them in improving their academic performance. To explore the lived experiences of female students in Ethiopian public universities regarding the impact of dysmenorrhea on their academic performance and to identify the coping strategies they employ to manage menstrual pain and its academic implications. This subnational phenomenological study was conducted with eighteen female student participants selected from public universities in southern Ethiopia, ensuring a diverse representation. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview guide, and interviews were conducted face-to-face with participants from nearby universities or by telephone with those from distant locations from March 27 to April 27, 2025. Thematic analyses were done using OpenCode software based on the seven-step approach of Colaizzi's framework of analysis. In this study, seven major themes and twenty-two subthemes were identified. The themes surrounding students' lived experiences of menstrual pain included physical, emotional, psychological, and socio-cultural aspects. Its impact on academic performance was classified into themes of academic engagement and performance, and students' coping mechanisms were categorized into personal strategies, use of campus medical resources, and reliance on social support networks. Female university students frequently encounter challenging lived experiences associated with dysmenorrhea, which significantly detract them from their academic performance. These students employ a range of coping strategies, such as personal techniques, seeking medical help like analgesics, and utilizing social support systems like peer interactions and communication with faculty to maintain their productivity in their studies. It is recommended that stakeholders provide the necessary resources and medical support to effectively address menstrual health concerns.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial use in animal husbandry is a common practice in developing countries as a response to the growing demand for animal-based foods. Veterinary antibiotics account for most of the antibiotics used worldwide. This review aims to provide an overview of the impact of antibiotic usage in livestock production on the environment and its consequences in the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The global estimate of antibiotic consumption in animals ranges from 63 000 to 106 000 tons annually. The most commonly used antibiotic classes include tetracyclines, sulfonamides, β-lactams, macrolides, and trimethoprim. Most of the antibiotics used in animal treatments are not fully metabolized within the animal's body; instead, they are excreted and can enter the environment. This review also provides a brief overview of the fate of antibiotic residues and their behavior in the environment. In developing countries, in addition to the lack of data on antibiotic use trends, there are limitations in implementing scientific and regulatory frameworks for antibiotic use in livestock. To reduce the projected loss of lives associated with antimicrobial resistant infections, it is recommended to lower antibiotic contamination in the environment by implementing affordable and critical actions related to antibiotic usage and residual waste management. Actions such as rational use of antibiotics in all circumstances, reducing environmental exposure to antibiotics, research, and environmental surveillance are important to tackle the problems of antibiotic resistance, especially in low-income countries.",

        "abstract": "Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm that is characterized by thrombocytosis and an elevated risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage. We aimed to ascertain the demographics, treatment patterns, and risk of recurrent thrombosis among patients with ET in Taiwan. To investigate the patient characteristics, proportion of treatment, age-specific treatment pattern, average daily dose, and risk of recurrence of thrombosis in patients with ET. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. This study utilized data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Patients with ET were identified based on ICD-10-CM codes, and their demographic, clinical, and treatment data were analyzed. Descriptive and statistical analyses were employed to compare patient characteristics, treatment modalities, and recurrence of thrombotic events. Among the 4503 patients with ET (prevalence: 19.3 cases per 100,000 population), the mean age was 58.1 years, with a female predominance (60.3%). Thrombosis occurred in 3.8% of patients during the study period, with a recurrence rate of 30.5% in patients with a history of thrombosis. Hydroxyurea (46.8%) and anagrelide (30.2%) were the most common treatments, with younger patients receiving higher therapeutic doses. Despite cytoreductive therapy, younger patients demonstrated higher recurrence rates of thrombosis. The cumulative incidences of secondary myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia were 2.6% and 0.6%, respectively, over 2 years. This study highlights the burden of ET in Taiwan and reveals significant unmet needs in thrombosis prevention, particularly among younger patients. Real-world treatment patterns diverge from recommendations in guidelines, and this finding emphasizes the need for individualized therapeutic strategies to optimize patient outcomes. Further research, such as a longitudinal study, is warranted to investigate the risk factors of thrombosis, disease progression, and mortality in this cohort.",

        "abstract": "Starting Active Materials for Synthesis (SAMS) represents a critical stage in drug manufacturing, directly influencing the microbiological quality and safety of the final product. The introduction of SAMS marks the point where Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) begin to apply, which are essential for ensuring sterility and preventing microbial contamination during the synthesis process. However, defining the exact point in the process that qualifies as the SAMS is subject to uncertainties, as earlier stages are not always governed by stringent GMP standards. The regulatory differences between various countries further contribute to this issue. This study explores the implications of SAMS selection and use in relation to sterility and infection control, analyzing the guidelines of major Regulatory Authorities and comparing their approaches to GMP. Regulations from several international regulatory agencies were examined, with a particular focus on microbiological control measures and infection protection in the SAMS manufacturing process. The analysis focused on the microbiological control requirements and safety measures applicable to the stages preceding the introduction of SAMS into the production of the final Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). Documents published between 2015 and 2025 were included based on predefined criteria regarding relevance, accessibility, and regulatory authority. The analysis revealed significant discrepancies between regulations regarding the definition and management of SAMS. In particular, the regulations in Mexico and India have notable gaps, failing to provide clear guidelines on SAMS sterility and protection against infectious contamination. Conversely, China has introduced risk-based approaches and early-stage microbiological controls, especially for sterile products, aligning with international standards. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S), and the World Health Organization (WHO) have well-established systems for microbiological quality control of SAMS, including rigorous measures for the validation of suppliers and risk management to ensure that SAMS does not compromise the microbiological safety of the final product. The regulations in Brazil and Canada introduce additional measures to protect the microbiological quality of SAMS, with specifications for contamination control and certification of critical stages. The lack of a harmonized language for the definition of SAMS, coupled with a fragmented regulatory framework, presents a challenge for infection protection in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Key issues include the absence of specific regulations for stages prior to the introduction of SAMS and the lack of standards for inspections related to these stages. A desirable solution would be the mandatory extension of GMPs to the stages before SAMS introduction, with centralized control to ensure sterility and protection against infection throughout the entire manufacturing process.",

        "abstract": "Rectal cancer management necessitates a rigorous multidisciplinary strategy, emphasizing precise staging and detailed risk stratification to inform optimal therapeutic decision-making. Obtaining an accurate histological diagnosis before initiating treatment is essential. Comprehensive staging integrates clinical evaluation, thorough medical history analysis, assessment of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and thorax. High-resolution pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing dedicated rectal protocols, is critical for identifying recurrence risks and delineating precise anatomical relationships. Endoscopic ultrasound further refines staging accuracy by determining the tumor infiltration depth in early-stage cancers, while preoperative colonoscopy effectively identifies synchronous colorectal lesions. In early-stage rectal cancers (T1-T2, N0, and M0), radical surgical resection remains the standard of care, although transanal local excision can be selectively indicated for certain T1N0 tumors. In contrast, locally advanced rectal cancers (T3, T4, and N+) characterized by microsatellite stability or proficient mismatch repair are optimally managed with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which combines chemoradiotherapy with oxaliplatin-based systemic chemotherapy. Additionally, tumors exhibiting high microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficiency respond favorably to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The evaluation of tumor response following neoadjuvant therapy, utilizing MRI and endoscopic assessments, facilitates individualized treatment planning, including non-operative approaches for patients with confirmed complete clinical responses who comply with rigorous follow-up. Recent advancements in molecular characterization, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy highlight a significant evolution towards personalized medicine. The effective integration of these innovations requires enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to improve patient prognosis and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Empathy is crucial in nursing, and recent studies show that virtual reality (VR) can effectively foster empathic concern in educational settings. However, individuals with lower technological orientation often view VR critically, which can hinder their learning experiences. It is essential to understand how to engage all nursing students with virtual reality, and how they experience empathy learning through virtual simulation games as well as to identify the barriers they may encounter in the process. To address this research gap, the aim of this study was to describe nursing students' experiences of learning empathy in the virtual reality simulation game. A descriptive qualitative design was employed. A convenience sample of twenty final-year undergraduate nursing students from three universities of applied sciences on the southern, western, and southwestern coasts of Finland was recruited to participate the study. The nursing students participated in virtual reality gaming prior to the interviews. Data were collected through interviews from May 2021 to January 2022. Inductive content analysis was used. Nursing students had opportunities to experience empathy in the virtual reality simulation game through student's self-reflection and by sensing the virtual patient's emotions by listening and observing and reasoning. In addition, realism of the virtual patient's situation was an opportunity to experience empathy. Students also experienced barriers to experience empathy, including focus on technique, limited dialogue with the virtual patient and awareness of the virtual patient's artificial nature. There are opportunities to experience empathy through virtual simulation games which can enhance empathy learning for nursing students. However, it is crucial to address the barriers that may hinder this process. Focused technique practice is essential before the simulation to facilitate empathetic interactions. Allowing for mutual discussions with the virtual patient should be prioritized in the design of VR simulations to deepen emotional connections. Ensuring that the simulation is perceived as meaningful and realistic can significantly enhance the learning experience. By addressing these elements, educators can create a more impactful learning experience that bridges the gap between technical skills and empathetic patient care.",

Secondary nephrotic syndrome, a feature of paraneoplastic syndrome, occurs in 11% of cases and is mainly caused by membranous glomerulopathy. The association between minimal change disease and prostate cancer is rare. Only one cause has been described in the available literature. We present the case of a 77-year-old patient who was admitted to our department with stage 3 acute kidney injury and with nephrotic syndrome with anasarca (creatinine: 168 µmol/L, eGFR: 33 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, albumin: 18.5 g/L, total cholesterol: 6.86 mmol/L, urine albumin creatinine ratio: 812.7 mg/mmol). In the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, looking for a secondary cause is essential, so the parainfectious causes of nephrotic syndrome were excluded. An elevated prostate-specific antigen (10.69 ng/L) was found when screening for oncological causes, and prostate adenocarcinoma was identified on biopsy. A renal biopsy was then performed with a finding of minimal change disease. Despite the generally accepted guidelines of prostate carcinoma in that stage and age of the patient being watchful waiting, antiandrogen therapy was started with the cooperation of a urologist. There was a significant improvement in renal parameters in the patient (creatinine: 87 µmol/L, eGFR: 73 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, albumin: 33.4 g/L, urine albumin creatinine ratio: 27.6 mg/mmol).

Education is essential for enhancing self-awareness and adherence to iron supplement pills. This literature review examines the influence of health education media on anemia prevention, particularly in improving self-awareness and adherence to Iron Supplement Tablet (IST) use among adolescent females. Studies were chosen according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search across various databases generated 2129 papers: Google Scholar= 2260, PubMed= 130, ScienceDirect= 236, and Scopus= 100. Of these, 597 were discarded for irrelevance, two were inaccessible, and 14 articles were included in the study following the eligibility assessment.

        "abstract": "Genomic score testing is increasingly being integrated into the management of prostate cancer (PCa) to overcome the limitations of traditional clinical and pathological parameters. Genomic tools will represent essential components of precision medicine, supporting risk stratification, therapeutic decision-making, and personalized screening strategies. Genomic score tests can be broadly classified into two main categories: polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and tumor-derived genomic classifiers (GCs). While not yet standard in routine practice, several international guidelines recommend their selective use when results are likely to impact clinical management. PRSs estimate an individual's susceptibility to PCa based on the cumulative effect of multiple low-penetrance germline genetic variants. These scores show promise in enhancing early detection strategies and identifying men at higher genetic risk who may benefit from tailored screening protocols. Tumor-based GCs assays provide prognostic information that complements conventional clinical and pathological parameters, and are used to guide treatment decisions, including eligibility for active surveillance (AS) or adjuvant therapy after treatment of the primary tumor. This review summarizes and analyzes the current evidence on genomic testing in PCa, with a focus on the available assays, their clinical applications, and their predictive and prognostic value across the disease spectrum.

        "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is causally related to neoplasia in multiple anogenital zones including anal, vulval, vaginal, and cervical areas in women. Care for anogenital neoplasia involves multiple specialist fields. Women with a history of cervical neoplasia are at increased risk of multiple anogenital neoplasias and second cancers occur in the anogenital zones. Results of a survey on current management practices across Europe are presented. A questionnaire was developed by iterative process and circulated amongst specialists in all fields associated with anogenital neoplasia. Data was recorded and analysed using Microsoft Excel/Stata. 316/430 (73.5%) respondents collaborated with colleagues to provide care, but only 27.0% were engaged in full multidisciplinary team meetings (MDT). Second cancers were observed both in the same anatomical zone (56.5%) as well as in different anatomical zones (45.3%) by the respondents. The survey identifies significant variability in clinician workload, experience and screening practices. Low utilisation of high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) by specialists (14.9%) indicate lack of standardisation of practices, though some (12.7%) expressed interest in training in HRA. 24.4% did not offer treatment for anogenital neoplasia, while those who treated utilised multiple modes of treatment. Recognition of multizonal anogenital neoplasia and the risk of second cancers, and new data on successful treatment of anal neoplasia have led to the assessment of expertise amongst Europe's specialists. Enhanced HRA training, improved guidelines and robust follow-up protocols are essential to optimising care. A concerted effort is needed to align professional development, workload standards and clinical practices across Europe.",

        "abstract": "To develop and evaluate a practical, low-cost ultrasound training simulator for teaching basic ultrasound physics and knobology, including probe orientation, tissue impedance, essential hand movements, and recognizing image artifacts while observing scanned objects. The simulator consists of (1) one complete lemon, (2) half a lemon, (3) half a kiwi fruit, and (4) an avocado pit. These objects were secured inside a plastic box using screws, nails and double-sided foam tape, after which the box was filled with water. The estimated total cost was less than 15 US dollars. The simulator was prospectively tested to teach basic ultrasound physics during the period of 4th January 2021 till 14th October 2021 on 59 undergraduate junior surgical clerkship students, who had no prior exposure to ultrasound. Quantitative feedback was collected through a Likert-scale questionnaire evaluating educational value, skill acquisition, and user satisfaction. Qualitative data were obtained from open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative responses, while inductive thematic analysis was applied to qualitative comments. 58 students filled the questionnaire (response rate of 98.3%), 57 of them (98.3%) recommended the simulator to peers, and all assessed items received the highest median rating (5 out of 5), including items assessing conceptual understanding, procedural skills, and enjoyment. Thematic analysis provided three major themes: Learning Enhancement, Engagement and Motivation, and Training Limitations. Students reported improved understanding of ultrasound physics, artifact recognition, and probe handling. The simulator was described as engaging and enjoyable, promoting self-directed learning. However, students noted limitations related to session duration, realism, and the need for additional practice opportunities. The proposed low-cost ultrasound simulator was highly rated for its educational value and engagement potential. Qualitative insights complemented these findings by revealing strong learner enthusiasm. Expanding session duration and increasing clinical fidelity may further enhance its utility.",

        "abstract": "Cancer rehabilitation guidelines emphasise the importance of providing individualised support to meet each patient's unique needs. Contact nurses have an essential role in providing such support. This study aims to explore contact nurses' experiences of supporting patients after cancer treatment. This descriptive qualitative study was undertaken between February 2022 and January 2024. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 12 contact nurses who were purposively recruited from seven hospitals in northern Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach. Three themes were revealed. Providing a sense of stability was achieved through creating order despite chaos, always being reachable and giving information to reassure patients. Creating trustful relationships involved being a confidant who assisted patients to cope and acknowledged their challenged existence. Navigating within limitations meant that contact nurses provided support while dealing with the unknown and facing their own inadequacy. The results highlight the ways that contact nurses support patients' self-management and well-being after curative cancer treatment. Contact nurses experienced that patients had multifaceted physical, psychosocial and relational needs following cancer treatment. They described their role as inherently solitary and struggled to uphold care ideals while lacking support themselves. It was challenging to provide person-centred support when patient needs were not clearly identified or expressed, or when the required support was beyond the contact nurses' scope of practice. The contact nurse role was extensive but lacked clarity regarding how it could be optimised to best support patients following cancer treatment.",

The integration of digital health in primary care, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has transformed nursing practices with a view to provide better support and services to patients. The World Health Organization defines \"digital health\" as the use of electronic technologies to improve health. Its 2020-2025 strategy seeks to integrate these technologies into health systems to facilitate communication between professionals, patients, and authorities. Tools such as telehealth, electronic records, artificial intelligence, and big data are transforming the role of nurses, who must become familiar with them for their performance. Qualitative studies on digital health in primary care nursing were reviewed following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) guidelines and using the Joanna Briggs Institute for Qualitative Research (JBI-QARI) criteria. Eleven articles were analyzed using thematic coding according to Thomas and Harden's approach, identifying three main themes: adaptation to digital health, nurses' perspective on digital health, and nurse-patient digital interaction. The integration of digital health has required nurses to adapt quickly. They have expressed both benefits and challenges, highlighting the importance of adequate training, personalization in the use of digital tools, information security, and optimization of technological infrastructure. It is essential to assess the current competencies of nurses in digital health in order to meet their needs. Health systems should incorporate new technologies into clinical practice guidelines and health programs to improve and update the continuity and quality of care in primary care. Health policies should support the continuing education of nurses and the effective integration of technology.",

Despite its transformative potential, the adoption of PGx in Indian clinical practice faces challenges, such as the lack of population-specific data, evidence-based guidelines, and complexities in interpreting genomic reports. Comprehensive datasets tailored to Indian patients are essential to facilitate the integration of PGx into clinical settings. The study collates pharmacogenomic data from multiple sources, including essential drugs listed by the World Health Organization (WHO), drugs used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), minimum sets of alleles recommended by the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and catalogs the allele frequencies from the IndiGenomes database to address gaps in actionable PGx for the Indian population. Curated datasets were used to identify pharmacogenomic variants relevant to clinical practice. Overall, 24 prime genes are essential for the outcomes of 57 drugs. In adults, 18 genes influence the metabolism of 44 drugs whereas, in pediatric populations, genotypes of 18 genes significantly impact the metabolism of 18 drugs. Two over-the-counter drugs with actionable PGx variants were identified: ibuprofen and omeprazole. These findings emphasize the clinical relevance of PGx for commonly used drugs, underscoring the need for population-specific data. As the data of several Indian human genome projects become available, an overarching need exists to establish and regulate the dynamic actionable PGx in Indian clinical practice. This will facilitate the integration of pharmacogenomic data into healthcare, enabling effective and personalized drug therapies.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Controlling blood pressure can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. The patients with hypertension are mainly treated with antihypertensive drugs. For the patients who can't achieve the target blood pressure with a single drug, comprehensive treatment strategies become particularly important. Chinese patent medicines are prepared by modern extraction and processing technology based on the basic theory of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Due to the stable antihypertensive effect, target organ protection, and synergistic effect with western medicine, Chinese patent medicines are becoming one of the effective options for the treatment of hypertension. At present, there are many systematic reviews on the treatment of hypertension with Chinese patent medicines, which makes it difficult for health policy makers and health service providers to choose the best evidence for the treatment. Umbrella review can integrate multiple systematic reviews to comprehensively assess the quality of evidence and potential bias, thereby providing high-quality evidence-based medicine basis for formulating clinical guidelines and optimizing treatment strategies. In this study, the systematic reviews/Meta-analysis of Chinese patent medicines in the treatment of essential hypertension were systematically searched. Sixty-nine articles were included for the umbrella review. Literature information was extracted, and the corrected covered area(CCA) was calculated to quantitatively evaluate the overlap degree of original studies in systematic reviews/Meta-analysis. The risk of bias in systematic reviews(ROBIS) tool and Cochrane RoB tool 2.0 were used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. A Measure Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2(AMSTAR 2) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of systematic reviews/Meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was evaluated based on the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation(GRADE). The results showed that the Chinese patent medicines in the categories of treating wind, resolving stasis, and reinforcing healthy Qi were effective in lowering blood pressure. The Chinese patent medicines for resolving stasis combined with conventional treatment can lower blood pressure and the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and total cholesterol in the treatment of hypertension complicated with coronary heart disease and hypertension complicated with left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, the combined therapy can recover the interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left ventricular mass index, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and left ventricular ejection fraction in the case of left ventricular hypertrophy. The Chinese patent medicines for resolving stasis and for replenishing Qi and restoring pulse can be used in combination with conventional treatment for hypertension complicated with arrhythmia, which can lower blood pressure while improving the outcome indicators such as the P-wave dispersion of arrhythmia, left atrial diameter, ejection fraction, heart rate, and recurrence time. Due to the heterogeneity, the efficacy evidence obtained by the umbrella review needs to be further verified through precise clinical studies and long-term follow-up.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory infections are a major cause of mortality among young children and adults, particularly the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. Many respiratory infections, including influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal disease, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have available vaccines and antiviral agents. However, vaccine coverage rates remain low. Experts representing a broad spectrum of medical specialties from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) made evidence-based recommendations on treating patients considered high risk for respiratory infections, highlighting gaps in current practices and suggesting strategies for improved communication between healthcare professionals and patients. To effectively manage respiratory infections, the experts emphasized the importance of adhering to guidelines, considering all vaccines and antiviral treatments, and strictly following vaccination schedules. Early testing upon recognition of symptoms was also encouraged. Improving vaccine uptake was considered crucial and could be achieved by educating patients about disease prevention through vaccines and the role of antiviral treatments for COVID-19. Addressing knowledge gaps and combating vaccine hesitancy among both patients and healthcare professionals were also essential steps. Recommendations for future initiatives include healthcare professionals educating the public on precautionary measures to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. Additionally, the experts agreed that clinical management guidelines for chronic diseases should be updated to include preventative strategies such as vaccines, prophylaxis, and counselling. Monitoring the performance of healthcare facilities using key performance indicators is also recommended to ensure effective management and continuous improvement of vaccination programs. Patient populations in the UAE who are considered at high risk of serious disease from respiratory infections have diverse medical needs and may access healthcare across a wide range of settings and specialisms. Therefore, it is vital that all healthcare professionals across specialisms who may engage with these individuals are able to provide appropriate advice on managing the risk through vaccination, prompt testing, and treatments as needed.",

Defining new clinical presentations of these disorders is essential for optimizing patient care. ERCC1-XPF is a multifunctional endonuclease involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. We sought to define a novel multisystem phenotype associated with biallelic ERCC1 variants and impaired DNA repair. Through international collaboration, we identified seven individuals from five families carrying biallelic ERCC1 variants, including p.Arg156Trp and p.Ala266Pro, who exhibited a distinct clinical phenotype. All individuals presented with growth restriction, photosensitivity, and kidney and liver dysfunction. Notably, three children required liver transplants. Hepatocellular carcinoma developed in four children, resulting in two deaths, including one following treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin. Older individuals exhibited additional features, including ataxia, basal cell carcinomas, pancreatic insufficiency, ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, and restrictive lung disease. Functional assays using patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated significant destabilization of the ERCC1-XPF complex and defects in NER and ICL repair. However, residual NER and ICL repair activity was observed, suggesting a hypomorphic effect of the missense variants, which were present either in the homozygous state or in trans with a predicted loss-of-function allele. We define ERCC1-hepatorenal syndrome as a severe, multisystem DNA repair disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality, including a significant risk of pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma.

Despite multiple guidelines in PCL management, a substantial proportion of patients still undergo major resections for benign cysts, and a majority of resected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) show only low-grade dysplasia, leading to significant clinical, financial, and psychological burdens. This review highlights emerging endoscopic approaches that enhance diagnostic accuracy and support organ-sparing, minimally invasive management of PCLs. Recent studies suggest that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and its accessory techniques, such as contrast-enhanced EUS and needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy, as well as next-generation sequencing analysis of cyst fluid, not only accurately characterize PCLs but are also well tolerated and cost-effective. Additionally, emerging therapeutics such as EUS-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and EUS-chemoablation are promising as minimally invasive treatments for high-risk mucinous PCLs in patients who are not candidates for surgery. Accurate diagnosis of PCLs remains challenging, leading to many patients undergoing unnecessary surgery. Emerging endoscopic imaging biomarkers, artificial intelligence analysis, and molecular biomarkers enhance diagnostic precision. Additionally, novel endoscopic ablative therapies offer safe, minimally invasive, organ-sparing treatment options, thereby reducing the healthcare resource burdens associated with overtreatment.",

This study aimed to (1) map the geographic distribution of PHN density across all 47 prefectures in Japan from 2019 to 2024, (2) investigate regional factors associated with PHN density at the prefectural level, and (3) analyze these associations at different quantile levels of PHN density. An ecological study was conducted using available public data from 47 prefectures in Japan, focusing on variables related to PHN density such as school density, educational capacity, percentage of graduates selecting PHN careers, percentage of graduates remaining within the prefecture, recruitment rate, and turnover rate. Choropleth maps were created to visually represent geographic distributions. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and quantile regression (QR) models were used to analyze the identified regional factors associated with PHN density. The mean prefectural-level PHN density was 378.0 per million population, with a 3.6-fold difference (range, 172.7-618.4). The results of OLS regression indicated positive associations between PHN density and educational capacity (regression coefficient B = 0.71, standardized regression coefficient β = 0.40, p = 0.016), the percentage of graduates selecting their first career as a PHN (B = 3.29, β = 0.34, p = 0.013), and those selecting their first PHN career within the prefecture (B = 2.15, β = 0.24, p = 0.032). The QR analysis showed that these associations varied across different quantiles. Education capacity was significant in lower (30th percentile) and higher quantiles (90th percentile). The proportion of graduates who started their career as PHNs and those who remained in the prefecture were significant across several quantiles. Fostering pathways that encourage graduates to pursue public health nursing as their first career choice and remain in their prefectures is essential to enhance prefectural-level PHN density. A balanced approach that addresses both the quantity and quality of PHNs is necessary to advance public health nursing in Japan.",

This study aims to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability of a breast cancer screening program in China to provide insights into developing an effective implementation strategy suitable for rural areas with limited health resources. This study employed the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability of a breast cancer screening program in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China. An explanatory mixed methods design was applied, in which qualitative data were used to explain unexpected quantitative findings. The quantitative study, conducted from 2016 to 2020, analyzed screening records and survey data from 177,107 women aged 35-64. The qualitative study, conducted in 2024, collected data through semi-structured interviews with nine health workers and analyzed the transcripts using thematic analysis. The qualitative themes and quantitative findings were matched within the RE-AIM framework. The screening program covered 52.24% of the women by the end of 2020, with a total of 177,107 women receiving screening. The cancer detection rate was 0.56/1000, ranging from 0.09/1000 in women aged 35-39 to 1.58/1000 in those aged 60-64. The Positive Prediction Value (PPV) for biopsy was over 64.9%, but few patients who were referred for further examinations (mammography and biopsy) completed the procedure. Key facilitators included strong patient-provider communication, staff involvement, adequate funding and training, and strict supervision, while barriers involved geographical distance, lack of multi-sector support, limited service capacity, and low health awareness. The \"rural outreach\" model (where MCHHs conduct screenings by visiting rural villages and setting up temporary clinics at local village health centers), along with routine hospital screening, was seen as the most effective solution for reaching dispersed populations with low health awareness and literacy. Increased awareness from prior screenings improved participation and compliance in subsequent programs. A key challenge in program maintenance was the reduction in quality control, supervision, and training efforts. To improve cancer detection in rural areas, it is essential to strengthen both the screening capacity of primary healthcare facilities and the patient referral system for timely diagnosis. \"Rural outreach\" is an effective way to reduce health inequity in marginalized women and increase their awareness at the same time. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes and develop customized implementation strategies for overcoming the identified barriers.",

The control group did not receive interventional therapy, whereas the SGT group received 10 sessions of sandplay therapy once a week, 40 min each. The clinical assessment instruments used were the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Junior (SIQ-JR), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC), Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS), and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25.0, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used. Sandplay group therapy significantly reduced depression and anxiety in the SGT group at risk of suicidal thoughts compared to the control group, and also significantly improved self-esteem. 10-week sandplay group therapy was effective in reducing depression and anxiety in children and improving self-esteem in children at risk of suicidal thoughts. The results of these interventions, first attempted in Korea, suggest that sandplay group therapy in schools can be an effective intervention for children and adolescents at risk of suicide.

The data was from the 2022 Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents. Stepwise logistic regression was employed to discern the correlates of SA. This study found a prevalence rate of 36.4% for SA among college students. Differences in risk factors for SA were observed among students of different genders. Majoring in social science, high conscientiousness, neuroticism and depression may be risk factors for SA among Chinese college students. Good family health and high health literacy may be protective factors for SA. The correlates of SA among Chinese college students of different genders differed to a certain extent.

        "abstract": "The development of Pharmacovigilance (P.V) systems in Palestine remains in its early stages, with limited national infrastructure and underreporting of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) posing ongoing challenges. Despite the growing global recognition of P.V as essential to ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, its integration into pharmacy education in Palestine is still insufficient. Bachelor's Degree of Pharmacy (BS Pharm) and Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm D) students in Palestine as future pharmacists involved in health care profession, play a pivotal role in P.V activities. However, current curricula often lack structured and comprehensive P.V training, leading to significant gaps in students' knowledge and preparedness. Also, researches concerning their knowledge and perceptions of P.V are still limited in Palestine. To assess the knowledge and perceptions regarding P.V activities among BS Pharm and Pharm D students in Palestine, and to evaluate influencing factors. Study design was cross-sectional; it was conducted from September to December 2024 across seven Palestinian universities. A structured, validated online questionnaire was administered among 412 final-year BS Pharm and Pharm D students. The questionnaire encompassed demographic data, assessment of knowledge regarding P.V and ADRs reporting, as well as perceptions of ADRs monitoring and reporting using a 5-point Likert scale. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS V. 28). Thus, descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression, and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed using odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess knowledge, perceptions, and associated demographic factors. A P. value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Two thirds (67.5%) exhibited poor knowledge regarding P.V, with a mean knowledge score of 4.0 ± 1.3. Female students (OR = 1.698; 95% CI: 1.096-2.629), those aged 21-24 years (OR = 2.874; 95% CI: 1.767-4.675), and students who had prior exposure to P.V concepts (OR = 1.984; 95% CI: 1.182-3.332) demonstrated significantly better knowledge (p < 0.05). While majority of students (80.8%) recognized the importance of ADRs reporting, substantial gaps were noted in understanding specific practices, such as reporting ADRs from herbal medicines and knowledge of national P.V guidelines. The study highlights the need for structured integration of P.V education into BS Pharm and Pharm D curricula in Palestine. Addressing identified knowledge gaps and demographic disparities through targeted training programs can enhance students' perceptions and professionalism in P.V activities, thus, improving medication efficacy, safety, and health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) has expanded due to their effectiveness in weight management, with increasing applications beyond diabetes care. Given the strong association between obesity and suboptimal total joint arthroplasty (TJA) outcomes, evaluating how GLP-1 RAs affect postoperative outcomes is essential. However, few studies have synthesized available evidence. A systematic review was conducted following the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies published until January 29, 2025, using terms related to GLP-1 RAs and arthroplasty. Studies analyzing postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing total knee (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) while taking GLP-1 RAs were included. Articles were screened, and data on study characteristics and key findings were extracted. There were seven studies, totaling 16,467 patients undergoing arthroplasty who were taking GLP-1 RAs, that met inclusion criteria, with six utilizing national databases and one based on institutional data. There were three that focused on diabetic GLP-1 users; four included both diabetic and non-diabetic GLP-1 RA users. Among the included studies, GLP-1 RA use was most commonly associated with reduced postoperative complications, including lower rates of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), readmissions, and wound complications following TKA or THA. Some studies reported no differences in outcomes or increased rates of adverse events such as myocardial infarction, hypoglycemia, or postoperative nausea. Overall, five studies reported primarily beneficial effects, while one showed mixed results and one reported predominantly negative findings. Current evidence suggests GLP-1 RAs may improve TJA outcomes, particularly by reducing infection risk and readmission. However, conflicting findings highlight the need for further research, particularly well-designed multicenter studies and randomized controlled trials, to clarify the effects of GLP-1 RAs on surgical outcomes.",

        "title": "Low protein content of plant-derived nutrition limits the protein transition in hospitalized patients: Results from an observational study.",
        "abstract": "To improve global- and environmental health, the Dutch Green Deal Sustainable Healthcare (DGD) guidelines recommend to replace at least 50 % of animal protein with plant-derived protein. This may be a challenge for hospitalized patients due to the low protein content and the lack of Essential Amino Acids (EAA) in individual plant-derived sources in combination with anabolic resistance during disease. Yet, there is little knowledge about the effect on protein- and amino acid intake among hospitalized patients as we shift to more plant-derived diets. Therefore, this observational study examines (plant- and animal) protein intake and Amino Acid Scores (AAS) of predominantly plant- and animal derived meals in a large university hospital. Food intake data were collected through direct observation in non-critically ill adult patients between October and November 2023. Protein requirements were set on 1.2 g/kg body weight, adjusted for BMI. For data analysis, patients were divided into three groups based on their total protein intake: low (<0.8 g/kg), moderate (0.8-1.1 g/kg) and adequate (≥1.2 g/kg). Meals were considered predominantly plant-derived if plant protein (in grams) accounted for over 50 % of its total protein content. AAS were determined per meal by assessing the amount of EAA per gram of protein relative to EAA requirements. In total, 234 patients were included. Protein intake was insufficient in 80 % of all patients. The overall animal-to plant protein ratio was 69:31. Among patients who consumed more than 50 % plant-derived protein per meal, lysine was the most common limiting amino acid (AAS <1). In contrast, no limiting AAS per gram of protein were found for patients consuming more than 50 % animal-derived protein per meal. Achieving sufficient protein intake (1.2 g/kg) is a key challenge especially in the shift towards more plant-derived nutrition. Although the predominantly plant-derived meals require careful attention to amino acid profiles, especially for lysine, the low total protein content of predominantly plant-derived meals poses the greatest challenge, thereby limiting the feasibility of the protein transition for hospitalized patients.",

        "abstract": "This study determined the clinic prevalence and compared the quality of care of allergic diseases in urban, rural, and remote primary care sites. This was a retrospective review of electronic health records of all adult patients who consulted in the 3 sites from May 2019 to April 2022. Data of adult patients with allergic diseases was extracted from the 3 EHR systems operating across the participating sites using standardized Structured Query Language queries across the 3 systems. We computed the prevalence of allergic diseases among adults who consulted in primary care health facilities by dividing the number of patients diagnosed to have an allergic disease over the total number of adult patients who consulted within the 3-year study period. We compared the quality of care of patients across the 3 sites based on clinical practice guidelines using Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or 1-way analysis of variance, as appropriate. The prevalence of allergic disease among adults who consulted in primary care health facilities was 1.3% for the urban site, 2.2% for the rural site, and 2.1% for the remote site. The most common allergic disease was asthma (59.0%). First-line medications based on recommendations in clinical practice guidelines were prescribed more often in the urban site, including inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting beta-agonists for asthma patients (<i>P</i> < .001) and topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (<i>P</i> < .001). In contrast, there was more frequent prescription of medications that were not recommended in clinical practice guidelines in the rural and remote sites. Health inequity was observed in this study, with results demonstrating that the rural and remote sites had greater allergic disease prevalence, greater underutilization of first-line medications, and more frequent overutilization of non-essential medications.",

This review summarizes current evidence on the role of OLT in managing NELM, with a focus on patient selection criteria and existing clinical guidelines. Appropriate selection is essential, as improved long-term survival has been consistently demonstrated in patients who meet established eligibility parameters. In conclusion, OLT offers meaningful survival benefits for carefully selected patients with NELM.

        "abstract": "Measles, despite being a vaccine-preventable disease, remains a significant global health concern. It is crucial that healthcare workers, who serve as the first line of contact with infected individuals, are properly immunized. This study aimed to investigate changes in measles seroprevalence among Ege University Faculty of Medicine students between 2010 and 2024. Medical faculty students who underwent anti-measles Immunoglobulin G screening at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of Ege University Faculty of Medicine Hospital, in İzmir, Turkey, between January 1, 2010, and January 31, 2024, were included in this study. The demographic data of the participants were recorded from the electronic patient files. The study included 1,448 medical students, of whom 51.9% (n = 751) were male, with a mean age of 21.28 ± 1.48 years. Measles seropositivity was observed in 46.1% of the participants (n = 668). Among those born between 1998 and 2004, seropositivity was 23.8%, whereas it was significantly higher, at 67.5%, in those born between 1986 and 1997 (p < 0.001). Pearson correlation analysisof measles seroprevalence by birth year revealed a strong negative and statistically significant relationship (r=-0.964, p < 0.001). When analyzed by place of birth, the lowest measles seroprevalence was observed in the Eastern Marmara region (34.5%). Our study emphasizes the substantial number of young healthcare workers who are still vulnerable to measles, posing a potential risk during outbreaks. Early screening and vaccination of medical students against vaccine-preventable diseases are essential during their education. This proactive strategy not only protects individuals but also strengthens herd immunity.",

        "abstract": "While dual sensory impairment (DSI) is known to reduce social participation (SP) in older adults, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain: (1) whether ADL mediates the relationship between DSI and SP, and (2) how depressive symptoms modify the mediation pathway - questions essential for developing targeted interventions. In the 2018 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), 8,270 older individuals (60 years of age or older) were enrolled. We examined a mediation model first, where ADL was a mediator between DSI and SP. Furthermore, depressive symptoms were integrated into the model as moderator in the correlation between DSI and ADL. The PROCESS macro was used to analyze the mediation and moderated mediation models. In older people, DSI correlated negatively with SP, and ADL partially mediated this association (B = -0.019, 95% CI = -0.025, -0.015) with an intermediary effect of 14.6%. Besides, the relationship between DSI and ADL was moderated by depressive symptoms (B = 0.092, 95% CI = 0.060, 0.123), and ADL was more affected by DSI in older adults who experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms moderated the mediation of ADL on an indirect, negative correlation between DSI and SP. The findings contribute to existing knowledge by illustrating the fundamental mechanisms connecting DSI and SP. These Findings highlight the need for integrated interventions targeting both sensory impairment and mental health to mitigate SP decline in aging populations.",

        "abstract": "In this review we sought to determine the clinical benefits and safety of a multiple micronutrient supplement/supplementation (MMS) throughout preconception, pregnancy, and lactation in the mother and their child. No guidelines for pregnancy specifically recommend supplementation with micronutrients other than folic acid and iron or continuing the use of MMS beyond the first trimester. Yet micronutrients are essential during all stages of pregnancy for healthy fetal growth and development and maternal health, with an increased intake of many micronutrients recommended during pregnancy and lactation. The MMS reviewed (Elevit, Bayer) is the most studied prenatal form of MMS, supported by 30 publications reporting studies conducted worldwide over 30 years and used by millions of women over a period of 40 years. Until now, the data have not yet been consolidated. We performed a literature search to identify published studies for trials that used MMS at any stage of the pregnancy journey. Outcomes reported in 30 trials suggested that MMS improves micronutrient status, leads to a healthier reproductive environment during preconception, and can significantly reduce neural tube defects and congenital abnormalities in early pregnancy above and beyond supplementation with folic acid alone. We also found that MMS can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes during the second and third trimesters, including miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anemia, preterm birth, and placental insufficiency, and improve docosahexaenoic acid status. In addition, MMS improves the quality of breastmilk and reduces postpartum depression. Using MMS containing 800 μg folic acid is more effective than supplementing with 400 μg folic acid alone. Very few adverse events were reported in infants, almost all of which were considered unrelated to MMS intake. In one cohort, periconceptual MMS in children was linked to higher rates of otitis media and atopic dermatitis than placebo, but these results may be partly attributed to multiple hypothesis testing and differences in family history, respectively. Improving micronutrient status with MMS in women who are trying to conceive, pregnant, or breastfeeding may have beneficial effects on fertility, the integrity of the embryonic environment, development of the embryonic brain and nervous system, and the growth, development, and long-term health of the child.",

        "abstract": "Childhood immunization is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite global efforts, Nigeria faces persistently low immunization uptake with significant regional and socioeconomic disparities. This study investigated the prevalence, regional disparities, and sociodemographic determinants of full immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Nigeria. This secondary analysis utilized data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), focusing on 2453 mothers with children aged 12-23 months. Full immunization coverage was defined per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of coverage. Only 26% of children were fully immunized nationwide. Marked regional disparities were observed, with the North West (13%) and North East (18%) exhibiting the lowest rates, while the South East (42%) and South South (41%) had the highest. Multivariable analysis revealed that maternal education, household wealth, and region of residence were significant predictors. Children of mothers with higher education were more likely to be fully immunized (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.10-3.18, p = 0.022), as were those from the richest households compared to the poorest (AOR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.95-5.25, p < 0.001). Children in the South East (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.16-3.46, p = 0.013) and South South (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 0.99-3.02, p = 0.052) also showed significantly higher odds of full immunization compared to the North West. Full immunization coverage in Nigeria remains critically low, driven by pronounced regional and socioeconomic inequities. Targeted interventions focusing on improving maternal education, expanding equitable healthcare access in underserved regions, and providing financial support to low-income families are essential. Policy efforts must prioritize these vulnerable groups to enhance child health outcomes and achieve universal immunization coverage in Nigeria.",

        "abstract": "Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures an individual's ability to function optimally in various aspects of life and their subjective sense of well-being across the physical, mental, and social dimensions of health. COVID-19-associated mucormycosis often necessitates aggressive surgical removal of infected tissues and restoration of the defect. Evaluating patient satisfaction and HRQOL following prosthodontic rehabilitation is essential for assessing the effectiveness of interventions on individuals dealing with their condition. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of prosthodontic rehabilitation on the HRQOL of individuals affected by COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. The research strictly adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO 2023CRD42023495778). Comprehensive searches across databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar were done to include studies after the year 2020, written in English language, regardless of geographic location, which presented data on prosthodontic interventions for individuals affected by COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. Independently, the three authors conducted a comprehensive quality assessment of the selected studies using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) study quality assessment tool to gauge the risk of bias specifically for before-after (pre-post) studies lacking a control group. A total of 116 records were screened, out of which 109 records were excluded. Eight studies were included in the study. HRQOL assessment after prosthodontic intervention included functional, physical, social, and psychological limitations. Questionnaires that were included in the studies were the Obturator Functioning Scale, Appearance Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire, auditory perception analysis, Oral Health Impact Profile, and the Liverpool Oral Rehabilitation Questionnaire. The HRQOL was reported compositely in 2 out of 8 studies. There was an improvement after prosthodontic rehabilitation in all the studies. HRQOL in patients with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis shows improvement after prosthodontic rehabilitation. Obturators and zygomatic implant-supported prostheses are preferred options for rehabilitation in patients who have undergone maxillectomy due to COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. Prosthodontic rehabilitation has a positive impact on the HRQOL of individuals affected by COVID-19-associated mucormycosis improving their functional, physical, social, and psychological well-being.",

        "abstract": "Accurate detection of Helicobacter pylori is essential for the diagnosis and management of gastritis and related gastrointestinal disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the rapid urease test (RUT) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using four antibodies (from BioGenex, Tokyo Medical and Dental University [TMDU], Cell Marque, and Dako), with a focus on bacterial localization (surface vs. subepithelial) and associated mucosal changes. Gastric biopsy specimens from patients who underwent upper endoscopy at Vajira Hospital between June and December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Histological evaluations included hematoxylin and eosin staining, RUT, and IHC. The sensitivity of each antibody for detecting H. pylori was compared, with special attention paid to subepithelial colonization and histopathological patterns. The BioGenex antibody exhibited the highest sensitivity in detecting H. pylori, followed by TMDU, Cell Marque, and Dako antibodies. RUT demonstrated the lowest sensitivity, particularly in cases of chronic nonactive gastritis or minimal mucosal changes. Among the IHC antibodies, BioGenex detected the greatest number of subepithelial H. pylori cases, many of which were missed by the other antibodies and RUT. Subepithelial colonization typically presented as dot-like signals suggestive of coccoid forms or bacterial remnants. The BioGenex antibody identified all subepithelial cases detected by the TMDU antibody, highlighting the former's superior sensitivity. Statistical analysis confirmed the significantly higher diagnostic accuracy of the BioGenex antibody across multiple histological subgroups (p<0.05). Subepithelial H. pylori colonization is clinically relevant and often undetected by RUT or less sensitive IHC antibodies. The BioGenex antibody was the most effective in identifying H. pylori in both surface and subepithelial regions. Patients with suspected subepithelial infection, particularly those without detectable surface bacteria, should undergo further evaluation using urea breath tests or stool antigen assays, in accordance with current clinical guidelines.",

        "title": "The Impact of a Public Awareness Campaign on Perceptions of Lung Cancer Risk Factors and Screening Guidelines.",
        "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality and is responsible for 1.8 million deaths annually. The early identification of risk factors, particularly smoking, is essential in improving outcomes. Public health campaigns play a crucial role in raising awareness, but misinformation and resource limitations hinder their effectiveness. This study evaluates the impact of a public awareness campaign on Saudi citizens' understanding of lung cancer (LC) risks and screening. <b>Methods:</b> An interventional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using pre- and post-campaign self-administered surveys. A total of 1,426 participants aged 18 or older were surveyed either before or after the campaign. A matching approach was used to control for confounding variables. Each participant may receive a maximum total score of 14 for their knowledge of lung cancer and a maximum total score of 10 for their awareness of lung cancer screening. <b>Results:</b> A total of 713 participants were surveyed pre-campaign, and 859 post-campaign). After matching, 308 participants remained for the analysis, with no significant demographic differences between those who were surveyed before and after the campaign. Post-campaign, awareness was significantly improved, which is reflected in an increase in accurate responses to key statements. The median knowledge scores increased from 11.0 to 23.0, indicating a substantial increase in understanding. <b>Conclusions:</b> The campaign effectively enhanced the awareness of LC risk factors and screening. However, new misconceptions regarding universal screening emerged, emphasizing the need for clear messaging. Future initiatives should address socioeconomic and gender disparities, promote collaborative decision-making, and implement long-term educational strategies. These findings align with previous research and highlight areas for improvement in public health outreach.",

        "abstract": "High sodium consumption increases the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Although food remains the primary source of intake, elevated sodium levels in drinking water can further contribute to excessive intake, particularly in populations already exceeding recommendations. This review examines the extent to which national drinking water standards account for sodium-related health risks and aims to inform discussion on the need for enforceable, health-based sodium limits. National standards for unbottled drinking water in 197 countries were searched for using the WHO 2021 review of drinking water guidelines, the FAOLEX database, and targeted internet and AI searches. For each country, data were extracted for the document name, year, regulatory body, regulation type, sodium limit (if stated), and rationale. Socio-geographic data were sourced from World Bank Open Data. A descriptive analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel. Standards were identified for 164 countries. Of these, 20% (<i>n</i> = 32), representing 30% of the global population, had no sodium limit. Among the 132 countries with a sodium limit, 92% (<i>n</i> = 121) adopted the WHO's palatability-based guideline of 200 mg/L. Upper limits ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L. Only twelve countries (9%) cited health as a rationale. Three countries-Australia, Canada, and the United States-provided a separate recommendation for at-risk populations to consume water with sodium levels below 20 mg/L. Globally, drinking water standards give inadequate attention to sodium's health risks. Most either lack sodium limits or rely on palatability thresholds that are too high to protect health. Updating national and international standards to reflect current evidence is essential to support sodium reduction efforts. Health-based sodium limits would empower communities to better advocate for safe water. Amid rising water salinity, such reforms must be part of a broader global strategy to ensure universal and equitable access to safe, affordable drinking water as a basic human right.",

        "title": "Functional Foods in Modern Nutrition Science: Mechanisms, Evidence, and Public Health Implications.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, functional foods have garnered increasing scientific and public health interest due to their potential to confer physiological benefits beyond basic nutritional value. International bodies such as EFSA, FDA, and WHO define functional foods as those containing bioactive components that may contribute to the prevention and management of chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. The evolving paradigm of \"food as medicine\" reflects a broader shift in nutritional science towards proactive, health-oriented dietary strategies. This article provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary overview of functional foods by examining their biological mechanisms, clinical evidence, public health significance, regulatory frameworks, and future prospects-particularly in the context of advances in personalized nutrition and nutrigenomics. A thorough literature review was conducted, drawing from recent peer-reviewed studies and guidelines from key health authorities. The review highlights the roles of specific compounds such as probiotics and prebiotics in modulating the gut microbiome, flavonoids and polyphenols in anti-inflammatory processes, omega-3 fatty acids in cardiometabolic regulation, and vitamins and minerals in supporting immune function. While an expanding body of clinical trials and meta-analyses supports the health benefits of these compounds-including reductions in LDL cholesterol, improved insulin sensitivity, and mitigation of oxidative stress-the integration of functional foods into everyday diets remains challenging. Socioeconomic disparities and limited health literacy often impede their accessibility and widespread adoption in public health practice. Functional foods represent a promising component of prevention-focused modern healthcare. To maximize their impact, a coordinated, evidence-based approach is essential, involving collaboration among healthcare professionals, nutrition scientists, policymakers, and the food industry. Looking forward, innovations in artificial intelligence, microbiome research, and genomic technologies may unlock novel opportunities for the targeted and effective application of functional foods in population health.",

        "abstract": "Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), predominantly basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), represents the most common malignancy among fair-skinned populations. While BCC is rarely fatal, SCC contributes significantly to NMSC-related mortality. This study aimed to investigate long-term trends in NMSC incidence and SCC mortality across 28 European countries from 1992 to 2021, focusing on regional, sex-specific, and age-related variations. A longitudinal ecological analysis was conducted using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) for NMSC and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) for SCC were calculated based on the 2013 European Standard Population. Temporal trends were evaluated using joinpoint regression, and age-period-cohort (APC) models were employed to disentangle independent effects on SCC mortality. Europe registered over 27 million NMSC cases between 1992 and 2021. Overall ASIRs slightly declined, although increasing incidence was observed in individuals under 45 in Central and Northern Europe. SCC accounted for more than 570,000 deaths, with overall ASMRs decreasing-particularly among women and younger men. However, mortality rose in men aged over 75, notably in Northern and Western Europe. APC analysis indicated elevated SCC mortality in cohorts born before 1940, with a notable reversal in Northern European males born after 1960, who exhibited increasing mortality. Period effects further confirmed a recent rise in SCC mortality among these populations. Although NMSC incidence appears to be stabilizing or declining in much of Europe, increasing trends in younger individuals and rising SCC mortality in older men-especially in Northern Europe-highlight the need for age- and region-specific prevention and screening strategies. Improved cancer registry harmonization remains essential for guiding effective public health interventions.",

        "abstract": "In ventilated critically ill patients, both overfeeding and underfeeding can be harmful. Determining energy expenditure is challenging due to various factors. Accurate estimation of nutritional requirements is essential for optimal care. This study compared resting energy expenditure in patients on full-dose high protein-to-energy tube feeding, using indirect calorimetry (IC) and the Roza & Shizgal (R&S) formula. It also examined the effects of sex, age, BMI, primary diagnoses, and non-intentional energy intake, and assessed adherence to European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism guidelines on protein intake. A retrospective cohort study included 178 ventilated ICU patients who received ≥7 days of full-dose high-protein enteral tube feeding between June 2019 and December 2022. IC was compared to the R&S formula, and 24-h nutritional intake data, including non-intentional sources, were analysed. Multivariate regression identified predictors of energy expenditure differences. A significant difference of -146.64 kcal (SD = 276.38) was found between measured and estimated resting energy expenditure, with severe or morbid obesity and COVID-19 pneumonia as significant predictors. This difference increased when non-intentional energy intake in the preceding 24 h was considered (M = -514.51; SD = 326.37). When excluding non-intentional energy intake, patients achieved the ESPEN daily protein target of ≥1.3 g/kg actual or adjusted body weight/day, with averages of 1.3-1.5 g/kg using both indirect calorimetry and the Roza & Shizgal formula. The Roza & Shizgal formula for estimating resting energy expenditure can overestimate or underestimate, so caution is needed, especially in severely to morbidly obese patients. Monitoring energy intake is important, particularly in tube feeding. Protein targets per international guidelines are generally met, except in patients with high non-intentional energy intake.",

        "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during pregnancy is a rare but life-threatening condition with unique pathophysiological mechanisms and management challenges. We present the case of a 28-year-old woman at 37 weeks of gestation who developed AMI due to spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). Initially admitted with retrosternal pain and transient electrocardiographic changes, she exhibited a significant rise in troponin levels, prompting a multidisciplinary reassessment. Conservative management was initially pursued, but recurrent chest pain and worsening electrocardiographic findings necessitated urgent coronary angiography. The procedure confirmed a long dissection of the left circumflex artery, successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention using a \"stent-in-stent\" technique. Given the high-risk nature of her pregnancy, anticoagulation therapy was carefully adjusted to minimize peripartum hemorrhagic complications. At 39 weeks, she underwent cesarean delivery of a healthy neonate. Follow-up evaluation one year post-intervention showed overall improvement, with only minor residual sequelae, including mildly reduced left ventricular function and subtle electrocardiographic changes. This case underscores the complexities of diagnosing and managing SCAD-related AMI in pregnancy, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment strategies that balance maternal cardiovascular risks with fetal safety. Given the rarity of SCAD in this population and the limitations of standardized guidelines, accumulating clinical experience is essential to refine management approaches in future cases.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) an 'infectious disease of poverty', caused by the Leishmania donovani complex, remains a significant public health threat in endemic regions of South Asia, East Africa, and Brazil. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to prevent the disease's potentially fatal outcomes. However, due to the nonspecific nature of clinical symptoms, diagnosis often relies on serological tests. This study aims to assess the diagnostic potential of the L. donovani activated C kinase (LACK), a highly conserved antigen essential for parasite survival and host establishment, in VL-endemic regions such as India and Brazil. We conducted a multi-center study with serum samples from India (n = 184) and Brazil (n = 59), along with non-invasive urine samples from India (n = 132). Clinical samples from India were collected from the endemic regions of Bihar and West Bengal between 2016-2024, while those from Teresina, Brazil, were collected between 2008 and 2009. Following preliminary immunoblot analysis, we validated the diagnostic utility of LACK through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and dipstick tests. Results were analyzed and area under a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values were calculated via the Mann-Whitney U test. Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, and confidence intervals were assessed to evaluate diagnostic performance. The ELISA results revealed that LACK antibodies exhibited 100% sensitivity in both Indian [95% confidence intervals (CI): 94.80-100%] and Brazilian (95% CI: 91.24-100%) patient samples, with specificity of 97.33% for Indian controls and 94.74% for Brazilian controls. Urine samples from Indian patients also demonstrated perfect sensitivity and specificity (100%). Notably, LACK showed minimal reactivity with follow-up patient samples. Dipstick assays confirmed these findings, offering a simple, rapid, and field-friendly diagnostic alternative. LACK is a promising diagnostic marker for VL, showing high sensitivity across regions and has potential to distinguish active infections from cured or relapsed cases, though larger studies are needed for confirmation.",

        "abstract": "In Palestine, breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent cancer among women. This study explored the relationship between eligibility for BC screening and the time taken for seeking medical advice for possible BC symptoms. It also identified the barriers hindering early presentation among screening-eligible and ineligible Palestinian women. Palestinian females from governmental hospitals, primary healthcare centers, and diverse public venues across 11 governorates within Palestine were recruited using convenience sampling. A modified, translated-into-Arabic version of the BC Awareness Measure was utilized for data collection. The questionnaire comprised three sections: sociodemographic information, duration for seeking medical advice upon recognizing each of 13 possible BC symptoms, and barriers impeding early presentation. The final analysis included 2796 participants, with 2168 (77.5%) ineligible for BC screening and 628 (22.5%) eligible. The proportion of participants who would seek medical advice immediately varied depending on the nature of BC symptoms. Approximately half of participants in both the screening-eligible (n = 1097, 50.6%) and ineligible (n = 293, 46.7%) groups indicated that they would seek immediate medical advice for 'lump or thickening in the breast.' Similarly, about half of participants in both groups reported an inclination to seek immediate medical advice for 'nipple discharge or bleeding' (screening-eligible: n = 954, 44.0%; screening-ineligible: n = 280, 44.6%). Less than half of participants would seek immediate medical advice for other BC symptoms. Screening-eligible women were more likely to seek advice within a week for six out of 13 possible BC symptoms than screening-ineligible women. Among screening-eligible participants, 9.9% (n = 62) acknowledged a delay in seeking medical attention upon recognizing a potential BC symptom. Emotional barriers were most frequently reported, with 'disliking the visit to healthcare facilities' identified as the leading barrier among screening-eligible participants (n = 38, 61.3%). No association was found between BC screening eligibility and the total or type-specific number of reported barriers. Differences in immediate medical advice seeking for various BC symptoms were observed between screening-eligible and ineligible groups. Emotional barriers were the most prevalent in both groups. Tailored interventions to enhance BC awareness and address barriers to early presentation are essential.",

        "abstract": "Affective disorders, particularly depression, are common among women of childbearing age, and pregnancy often exacerbates symptoms. Antidepressants are often required for treatment, but adherence during pregnancy is variable. Although some studies suggest potential risks to the foetus, many cannot rule out confounding by indication. In this context, understanding real-world patterns of antidepressant prescription and adherence during pregnancy is essential to inform clinical practice and ensure adequate mental healthcare. The aim of the present study was to characterise the use of antidepressants in a cohort of pregnant women using electronic health records. This observational cohort drug-utilisation study assessed antidepressant prescription patterns, adherence and persistence among pregnant women using data from the SIDIAP (Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care) database in Catalonia from January 2011 to June 2020. Among 99,605 pregnancies, 14.9% involved antidepressant prescriptions, but only 5.8% of these were collected from pharmacies. The median pregnancy duration was 38.4 weeks, and the median maternal age was 33.5 years. Anxiety was the most common health issue associated with an antidepressant prescription. Paroxetine was the most frequently prescribed antidepressant, although sertraline usage increased over time. Antidepressant prescriptions and adherence decreased during pregnancy, with an increase in the postpartum period. About 11.6% of pregnancies involved a concurrent prescription of another antidepressant, and 29.2% of women resumed antidepressant use after pregnancy. Women who initiated antidepressants during pregnancy were more likely to persist with treatment than those with pre-existing prescriptions. Our study describes antidepressant use during pregnancy in Catalonia. It is remarkable that there is a notable gap between antidepressant prescriptions and dispensations. Given the risks of untreated maternal depression, strengthening primary care with adequate resources and personalised support is essential for improving perinatal mental healthcare.",

This review evaluates differences in outcomes and patient experiences to support informed counseling and care. It updates a previous version published in 2008. To compare the benefits and harms of surgical and medical methods of induced abortion in the second trimester (i.e. at or after 13 weeks' gestation). We identified trials using CENTRAL (Ovid EBM Reviews), MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase.com, LILACS, Scopus, and Google Scholar on 29 November 2023. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies, relevant review articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings for additional, previously unidentified studies. We contacted experts in the field for information on other published or unpublished research. Randomized trials comparing surgical abortion by vacuum aspiration or dilation and evacuation (D&E) to medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol in the second trimester of pregnancy. We assessed the validity of each study using Cochrane methods. We contacted investigators for additional information regarding trial conduct or outcomes as required. Some outcomes were consistently reported across multiple studies and could be combined for meta-analysis. The primary outcome of interest was abortion completed with the intended method (defined as fetal expulsion). We included three studies (281 participants). The studies were conducted in Nepal (n randomized = 141), England (n randomized = 122), and the United States (n randomized = 18) and included participants with pregnancy durations ranging from 12 weeks to 19 weeks and 6 days. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Abortion completed with the intended method (defined as fetal expulsion) occurred for nearly all trial participants. There may be no difference between surgical and medical methods, although the evidence for this outcome is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.02; 3 trials; 269 participants). Incomplete abortion requiring an additional procedure or intervention (immediate or delayed) may occur less often with surgical abortion (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.53; 3 trials; 269 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. Hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion may occur less often with surgical abortion, but the evidence is very uncertain as the outcome occurred infrequently (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.12; 3 trials; 269 participants). There may be less bleeding with surgical abortion than with medical abortion based on a measure of total blood loss (difference in mean estimated blood loss (mL) -59.80, 95% CI -65.21 to -54.39; 1 trial; 141 participants; low certainty evidence). At two weeks post-abortion, medical abortion may be associated with more bleeding reported by participants as heavier than a menstrual period than surgical abortion (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.76; 1 trial; 56 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. One cervical laceration was reported in the surgical abortion group across the three studies, therefore the evidence for the effect of surgical versus medical abortion on the risk of injury to the cervix, vagina, or uterus is very uncertain. Patient-reported pain scores may be lower with surgical abortion compared with medical abortion, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference in pain score on visual analogue scale -2.20, 95% CI -3.81 to -0.59; 1 trial; 56 participants). Patient satisfaction (overall) with the assigned method appeared similar (2 trials; 83 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain, and the data could not be pooled due to inconsistent outcome measures. Comparative evidence on second-trimester surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration or D&E) versus medical abortion (mifepristone and misoprostol) was limited, drawn from three studies with varying practices and reported outcomes. While allocation to interventions was robust, none of the studies were blinded. Additionally, concerns about enrollment and incomplete outcome reporting may have influenced the results. While both methods resulted in expulsion of the fetus in nearly all cases, there is very low certainty evidence that medical abortion may increase the risk of incomplete abortion and interventions to remove the placenta. The uncertainty was due to variations in clinical protocols and interventions conducted during the abortion process for placental removal with medical abortion. Low certainty evidence suggests that medical abortion results in a slightly increased risk of bleeding, defined as mean estimated blood loss (mL). Serious hemorrhage that required transfusion was rare, and differences between groups may have little to no effect on the outcome, but the evidence is very uncertain. More studies using consistent protocols and measures (such as the STAR and MARE guidelines) are needed. Additionally, research that focuses on the patient's experience and to inform counseling should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient with potent antioxidant properties, may modulate cardiometabolic health through multiple physiological pathways, including redox regulation and the modulation of inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between serum Se levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as early indicators of endothelial dysfunction in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). A total of 191 patients aged 20 to 50 years, diagnosed with MetS, were included in the study. In addition to glucolipid metabolic parameters, serum levels of Se, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were assessed. Ultrasonography was applied to measure the CIMT among the participants. The mean serum levels of TNF-α (p-trend = 0.037), MCP-1 (p-trend = 0.005), and VCAM-1 (p-trend = 0.002) revealed decreasing trends with increasing quartiles of serum Se. Similarly, a significant decrease in the mean CIMT was observed in the participants with increasing quartiles of serum Se (p-trend < 0.001). Serum Se levels were inversely correlated with TNF-α (r = -0.24, p < 0.001), MCP-1 (r = -0.30, p < 0.001), VCAM-1 (r = -0.34, p < 0.001), and CIMT (r = -0.47, p < 0.001). In conclusion, we observed significant inverse relationships between serum Se levels and pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, as well as the mean CIMT, in patients with MetS. Se supplementation may represent a targeted nutritional strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with MetS who have low serum Se levels.",

        "abstract": "Although some studies have assessed the correlation between clinicopathological features and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in patients with non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC), few studies have focused on computed tomography (CT) signs. The results of some previous studies are inconsistent and contradictory. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the clinicopathological and CT features of NSCLC patients with different PD-L1 expression levels. This retrospective analysis included 911 NSCLC patients who undergone pulmonary resection, and most of them were early-stage. PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry with the Dako PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit. Clinicopathological features and CT signs were investigated according to different PD-L1 expression levels. The prevalence of PD-L1 expression in the resected NSCLC patients was 46.9% (427/911), with 381 patients low expression (41.8%) and 46 patients high expression (5%). Male sex, current smoking status, higher positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) SUVmax, and elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels were more frequently observed in patients with high PD-L1 expression. The frequencies of squamous cell carcinoma type, spread through air space (STAS), TP53 mutations, advanced pathological stages, and micropapillary/solid subtype were significantly higher in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (TPS ≥ 1%) than in those with PD-L1 negative tumors (TPS < 1%). ALK rearrangement was higher in patients with low-expression, and PD-L1-positive patients had bigger tumor diameter. The proportion of solid nodules and consolidation to tumor were higher in high-expression than those in the low- or negative expression PD-L1 patients. Regarding structural characteristic features, there were no differences in the frequency of irregular borders, pleural retraction, air bronchograms, bubble-like lucency or cavities, and vascular convergence among the three groups. The frequency of lobulated margins and spiculation was significantly higher in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors than in those with PD-L1 negative tumors. Patients with PD-L1 expression in NSCLC often exhibit certain clinicopathological characteristics. CT features may not reliably correlate with PD-L1 expression across different stages of lung cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), using relevant kits, remains essential for further evaluation of PD-L1 expression levels.",

        "title": "Decompressive craniectomy after endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is a safe and efficacious treatment of choice for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation. Despite these achievements, some patients still require decompressive craniectomy (DC) even after undergoing a timely EVT. Identifying patients requiring post-EVT DC is crucial to improve the clinical outcome, even though signs and symptoms at that period may not be reliable. In this study, we aimed to investigate risk factors for DC after EVT. A systematic review was conducted from inception to 24 August 2024 in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles published in English investigating AIS patients undergoing DC after EVT were selected. Our initial search resulted in 6776 articles. After removing duplicates, 141 articles were fully screened. Eleven studies with 2243 patients were included. Multiple risk factors were associated with DC after EVT, including higher baseline NIHSS score (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.32; p < 0.001), heavier thrombus burden (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02-1.79; p < 0.001), baseline ASPECTS ≤ 8 (OR 7.41, 95% CI 2.43-22.66; p < 0.001), unsuccessful recanalization (OR 7.49, 95% CI 2.13-26.36; p < 0.001), larger diffusion-weighted imaging infarct volume, longer time to thrombectomy, higher admission blood glucose levels, poor collaterals on computed tomography angiography, higher number of EVT passes, and preadmission antiplatelet use. DC is essential for some AIS patients undergoing EVT who have cerebral edema and/or hemorrhagic transformation caused by large ischemic infarction. Multiple risk factors, such as higher baseline NIHSS scores, heavier thrombus burden, baseline ASPECTS ≤ 8, and unsuccessful recanalization were found to be associated with DC after EVT.",

        "title": "Unraveling cutaneous histiocytosis: insights into histology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment pitfalls.",
        "abstract": "Histiocytoses represent a group of diverse rare disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of cells derived from the mononuclear phagocyte system in various tissues and organs. The mononuclear phagocyte system includes monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and specialized tissue-resident phagocytes. These cells are essential for both innate and adaptive immunity and preserving tissue homeostasis. Several classifications of histiocytoses by the Histiocyte Society (1987, 1997, 2016) and WHO (2018, 2022) and an International Consensus Classification (2022) are generally acknowledged. The WHO 2022 classification clarifies these heterogeneous disorders by dividing them into three major groups. Cutaneous involvement in histiocytosis is often polymorphous, making clinical decision more challenging. Cutaneous histiocytoses can occur either as primary cases or as a manifestation of a multisystemic disease. In support of the standard pathology report, immunohistochemical staining is warranted. The exact etiopathogenesis of histiocytoses remains poorly understood, and various associations with malignancies, including visceral and hematologic cancers, as well as autoimmune diseases and infections (Borrelia burgdorferi) are still under review. One of the most recent advancements in this field is the discovery of somatic mutations in the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, particularly BRAF mutations. Oncogene-induced senescence-associated BRAF mutations have been described in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease. Targeted therapies with BRAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib and vemurafenib have shown promising results. MEK inhibitors, like trametinib and cobimetinib, have demonstrated efficiency regardless of the BRAF mutation status. Local treatments of cutaneous histiocytosis include topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, alkylating agents, phototherapy, steroid injections, and laser therapies. Despite the current advances in pathogenesis and treatments, cutaneous histiocytosis stands as a challenging and heterogeneous group of disorders, and treatment guidelines are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) is essential for preventing surgical site infections (SSI) but is often improperly administered. This study assessed SAP adequacy and its association with SSI and other nosocomial infections (NI) to identify areas for improvement. This cross-sectional and retrospective cohort study included adults undergoing elective cardiovascular, orthopaedic, colorectal surgeries and cystectomy in 2022 at a teaching hospital. SAP was considered adequate if it met all local guideline criteria: indication, drug, dose, timing of administration, redosing and duration. Associations between SAP adequacy and SSI were analyzed using generalized mixed models. Among 723 patients included (median age 68 years; 57.7% male), 714 (98.8%) received SAP. Overall multidomain adherence to SAP guidelines was 34.6%, with high compliance for regimen (92.8%), dose (97.5%), and timing (98.3%), but lower compliance for redosing (63.4%) and duration (53.9%). Regimen adequacy was significantly lower in patients with beta-lactam allergies (55.6% vs. 94.8%, p < 0.001) and in cystectomy cases compared to other procedures (41.2% vs. 94.1%, p < 0.001). Non-compliant regimens were independently associated with a higher SSI rate (adjusted OR 3.4; 95% CI: 1.8-8.3; p = 0.003), but not with non-SSI NIs. Inadequate SAP was also associated with a length of stay (LOS) exceeding 10 days (RR 4.61; p < 0.001) and higher 90-day mortality (RR 3.37; p = 0.007). Patients who developed an SSI were significantly more likely to develop additional non-SSI NIs (adjusted OR 6.1; 95% CI: 2.8-13.4; p < 0.001). Median LOS was longer in patients with SSI (16.5 vs. 7 days, p < 0.001), and SSI was also associated with increased 90-day mortality (14.7% vs. 2.7%; RR 5.42; p < 0.001). Non-adherence to SAP guidelines was associated with an increased risk of SSI, prolonged LOS, and greater crude mortality. Key areas for improvement include regimen selection, appropriate redosing, and limiting SAP duration. Patients with beta-lactam allergies were specially at risk of receiving inadequate SAP. Although SAP non-compliance was not independently associated with other NIs, SSIs significantly increased their occurrence.",

        "title": "Barriers to physical activity in women from ethnic minority groups: a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is essential for preventing chronic diseases and improving mental health, yet global PA levels remain suboptimal, with women generally engaging in less PA than men. This gender disparity is especially concerning for women from ethnic minority groups, who face a higher risk of chronic diseases and encounter unique barriers to PA participation. Understanding these obstacles is crucial for developing targeted interventions to promote PA and reduce health disparities among ethnic minority women. This systematic review aimed to identify, categorize, and synthesize existing research on the barriers to PA among these women. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Six databases were searched (from inception to December 2024) to identify primary studies of any methodological design (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods) that examined barriers to PA among adult women from ethnic minority groups, excluding African American and Indigenous populations. Studies were included regardless of country, as long as they met the eligibility criteria. Thematic analysis, guided by the social-ecological model, was used to synthesize the findings. Sixty-four studies involving 5,555 women and conducted in 12 countries met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis identified 16 barriers categorized within the social-ecological framework. At the individual level, common barriers included time constraints, lack of motivation, poor physical health, and disinterest in PA. Interpersonal barriers, such as family responsibilities, cultural expectations, language barriers, and lack of social support, were prevalent. Environmental barriers included unsafe neighborhoods, limited access to PA resources, and inadequate infrastructure. Regional differences were observed, with cultural barriers and family obligations most common in the Americas, and misconceptions about PA and environmental factors more prevalent in the Eastern Mediterranean. Socioeconomic status and immigration status exacerbated these challenges. This review highlights the complex, multi-level barriers that ethnic minority women face in engaging in PA. Addressing these challenges requires multifaceted interventions that consider individual, interpersonal, and environmental factors. Future research should explore strategies that reduce these barriers and promote equitable access to PA opportunities for women from ethnic minority groups.",

        "title": "Reducing Lung Cancer Mortality by Providing Smoking Cessation Support in the Lung Cancer Screening Setting: Missed Opportunities and Lessons Learned on Both Sides of the Atlantic.",
        "abstract": "National guidelines for the implementation of lung cancer screening (LCS) for high-risk older adults have been issued by several countries, largely in Europe, North America, and Australia. Typically, these guidelines recommend but do not specify how smoking cessation support (SCS) should be provided to patients undergoing LCS who currently smoke. As LCS implementation progresses, delivering screening to the millions of eligible individuals around the world, the lack of best practice guidelines for SCS in the LCS setting is resulting in a growing missed opportunity to reduce persistent tobacco and lung cancer-related disparities in incidence and mortality. Quitting smoking at older ages reduces lung cancer risk and increases life expectancy. Compelling evidence from clinical trials and modeling studies has shown that, even with modest cessation rates, SCS delivered in the LCS setting can considerably reduce lung cancer mortality, with the potential to reduce global, racial, economic, and geographic disparities in lung cancer. Moreover, SCS interventions are cost-effective and can lead to significant cost savings for the health system. On the basis of the evidence and lessons learned in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, we propose a set of priorities for health systems to consider when developing or expanding SCS programs in the LCS setting. We argue that the system and policy changes needed to maintain SCS as a standard component of LCS are essential to capitalize on this important opportunity to integrate disease prevention with early detection, thereby maximizing the mortality benefit of LCS worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been developed to give guidance for referring physicians to make appropriate decisions at the point of care. The MIDAS study, a multicenter cluster randomized trial at four German university hospitals, was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a CDSS for imaging referral (ESR iGuide) in routine clinical care. Based on our experience within the MIDAS study, we aim to describe the hurdles and difficulties, as well as the various insights gained, in the process of implementing a CDSS in a clinical and research setting. To successfully implement a CDSS for imaging requests, it is essential to monitor and address technical issues, adapt local workflows, define the scope and content, and prioritize user experience and acceptance. By identifying and addressing the various technical, content-related, and workflow challenges, this article gives valuable insights to facilitate future implementations of the ESR iGuide and similar clinical decision support systems CDSSs for imaging orders. Approval from the Medical Ethics Review Committee was obtained under protocol numbers 20-069 (Augsburg), B 238/21 (Kiel), 20-318 (Lübeck) and 2020-15125 (Mainz).

        "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies, predominantly affecting young adults who form the backbone of the workforce. While its diagnosis and treatment are well-studied, limited research exists on the perioperative factors affecting post-operative outcomes and health-related quality of life in resource-limited settings like Palestine. Understanding these factors is essential to enhance patient care and recovery. This prospective, single-center observational study was conducted at Secondary Surgical Hospital, Nablus, Palestine, from April 2021 to February 2022. Patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with acute appendicitis and treated surgically were included. Data were collected using structured forms covering preoperative (sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, imaging, and laboratory findings), intraoperative (timing, technique, and surgical findings), and postoperative (pain using Visual Analogue Scale), complications, and Health-Related Quality of Life using European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-3 Levels variables. Follow-ups were conducted at discharge, one week, and two weeks post-surgery. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Ninety-three patients participated, with a mean age of 31.14 years (63.4% ≤ 31 years, 65.6% male). Sociodemographic factors, including smoking (41.9%), educational level (76.4% grade 12 or less), and COVID-19 history (18.3%), were significantly associated with post-operative outcomes. Complicated appendicitis was observed in 43.3% of cases, particularly in older patients and those with delayed presentation (> 48 h, 16.3%). Pain was assessed postoperatively with scores that were significantly higher in females (VAS > 7, p < 0.001) and showed gradual improvement within 24 h post-surgery. Health-Related Quality of Life improved significantly over two weeks, with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-3 Levels index rising from 0.569 at discharge to 0.827 at two weeks. Gender, age, and delayed presentation were strongly associated with worse outcomes, including increased anxiety, reduced mobility, and prolonged recovery. Perioperative factors such as age, gender, smoking, educational level, and pre-hospital delay significantly impact pain and HRQoL after appendectomy. Females and older patients experienced worse outcomes, highlighting the need for tailored care. These findings underscore the importance of addressing sociodemographic disparities and optimizing perioperative management. Tailored surgical planning should prioritize early intervention in high-risk groups such as females, older adults, and patients with delayed presentation to reduce complications and improve recovery. Furthermore, the significant role of anxiety and depression in post-operative outcomes suggests that stress-reduction strategies and mental health support should be integrated into patient care. Future research should aim for longer follow-up and broader populations to establish more comprehensive post-appendectomy care guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Interest in using digital interventions to provide pre-operative total knee replacement (TKR) education and prehabilitation (health/wellbeing optimization) support is growing. Patient engagement with digital interventions tends to be poor; therefore, exploring the intended users' perspectives during digital intervention development is vital. This study was part of a project focused on developing a pre-operative TKR education and prehabilitation digital intervention, the 'Virtual Knee School' (VKS), and aimed to explore patients' perspectives of potential barriers/facilitators to engagement with the VKS to inform its development. This United Kingdom-based, qualitative descriptive study involved 14 purposively selected patients who were awaiting/had undergone TKR. Three online focus groups were conducted to explore patients' perspectives of barriers and facilitators to engagement with the behaviors targeted by the VKS and digital features that could address the barriers/facilitators. The focus groups were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and analyzed inductively using reflexive thematic analysis. Three Patient and Public Involvement representatives were involved in aspects such as reviewing the recruitment materials and/or plain English summary of the study findings. Two intersecting themes were developed. Theme 1, 'Accounting for individual differences', suggests pre-operative TKR digital interventions should account for the impact of individual differences on engagement with digital technologies, pre-operative education and prehabilitation. Most participants felt a pre-operative TKR digital intervention would be valuable; however, a couple of older participants appeared reluctant to use digital technologies. Participants' perspectives of specific digital features and pre-operative TKR education and prehabilitation also varied widely. Theme 2, 'Tailoring to the pre-operative context' highlights the importance of tailoring pre-operative TKR digital interventions to pre-operative contextual features, including physiological/psychological factors, social/occupational factors and limitations in pre-operative TKR care provision. Various digital features that could address these factors were identified. This study's findings suggest pre-operative TKR digital interventions should account for individual differences and be tailored to the pre-operative TKR context. Given that some patients are reluctant to use digital technologies, also offering pre-operative TKR support in non-digital formats is essential. The findings have been used to inform a VKS prototype and could also be used to inform the development of other pre-operative TKR digital interventions.",

        "abstract": "The growing emphasis on low-carbon, sustainable health care systems is driving the integration of environmental sustainability into clinical practice and research. This shift necessitates clinician literacy in health care sustainability, particularly in methodologies for assessing environmental impacts. To introduce health care professionals to life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool for evaluating environmental impacts in clinical contexts and to illustrate its application through a case study on hemodialysis therapies. A qualitative assessment of LCA methodology, including its fundamental principles, stages, and applications in health care. Hemodialysis materials were collected from In-Centre and Home Dialysis units at Vancouver General Hospital. No patients are directly involved in this work; samples of unused hemodialysis materials were collected for process assessment. The target audience is health care professionals, particularly those involved in kidney care, who need to interpret LCA results for informed decision-making. Overview of LCA, an internationally standardized methodology that evaluates the environmental impacts of products and processes over their entire life cycle, is presented. The 4 stages of LCA, the key environmental impact categories it assesses, and guidelines for appropriate interpretation and use are explored. Life cycle assessment provides numerous midpoint data, mechanisms by which damages occur to endpoints, including human health and environments. The case study comparing home versus in-center hemodialysis demonstrates how LCA findings can inform decision-making in kidney care. The interpretation of LCA results requires an understanding of its methodology and limitations. The accuracy of LCA outcomes depends on the quality and scope of data used in the assessment. As LCA is increasingly applied in clinical settings, health care professionals must develop the skills to critically evaluate and apply its findings. This primer equips kidney care professionals with essential knowledge of LCA methodology, supporting the integration of environmental sustainability into clinical practice. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "Duplicated gallbladders are a rare congenital anomaly. Most cases are asymptomatic, but duplicated gallbladders can present significant diagnostic and surgical challenges, particularly due to the risk of bile duct injury or retained stones if not recognized preoperatively. Advanced imaging modalities such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and intraoperative cholangiography are often required for accurate diagnosis, though variability in anatomical presentation complicates preoperative identification. Clinical vigilance is therefore essential, especially in atypical biliary presentations. We present the case of a 56-year-old male patient with a duplicated gallbladder who successfully underwent robotic-assisted cholecystectomy. The case report adheres to the CARE (CAse REport) guidelines to ensure transparency and completeness, detailing the clinical history, diagnostic approach, surgical management, and outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) allocate a disproportionately small fraction of their healthcare budgets to mental health, leading to a treatment gap exceeding 75%. To address this disparity, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), aiming to integrate mental healthcare into primary and community care settings. Central to this initiative is task-sharing: empowering non-specialist healthcare providers to detect and treat mental disorders. Adaptation and modification of mhGAP to the national and local contexts is an integral aspect of the guidelines. This systematic review of reviews employs the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded (FRAME) to document and characterize modifications to mhGAP implementation in LMICs. The databases searched included Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Reviews selected in stage 1 were used to find empirical studies from which relevant data was extracted. Narrative synthesis suggests that modifications primarily focus on content, delivery, and training methods, with limited attention to scaling up. Modifications adopt top down, yet consultative and participatory approaches. There is a notable lack of reporting on challenges, processes, and outcomes. Recommendations have been made to expand FRAME, namely, sources of knowledge, financial and temporal resources employed during the process of modification. Modifications are essential for adapting interventions to diverse settings, yet they are often researcher-led with limited stakeholder involvement. Better documentation-particularly on challenges and outcomes-is needed. Strengthening frameworks like FRAME can improve reporting, optimize resources, and enhance implementation and scale-up in similar contexts.",

        "abstract": "<i>Salmonella</i> is one of the most common causes of foodborne diseases and is frequently reported to exacerbate the increase in multidrug resistance worldwide. Poor hygienic practices along the food chain and the cultural habits of consuming raw animal products contribute to the spread of infection and increased antibiotic resistance, especially in developing nations like Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2022 to June 2023. The study aimed to detect and determine the antibiotic susceptibility of <i>Salmonella</i> from cow milk and beef in the Hawassa, Yirgalem and Wondo Genet districts of the Sidama Regional State. A total of 216 samples (121 milk, 31 yogurt and 64 beef samples) were collected and analyzed using standard bacteriological procedures for the isolation and identification of <i>Salmonella</i>. Positive <i>Salmonella</i> isolates were further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). <i>Salmonella</i> was tested for antibiotic susceptibility using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. <i>Salmonella</i> was isolated from 6.5% to 4.17% of the total samples by culture and PCR-based methods, respectively. Prevalence at the sampling sites was 5.38% in Hawassa, 3.23% in Yirgalem, and 2.38% in Wondo Genet. There was no significant variation in prevalence among the districts (<i>p</i> = 0.18) or between milk (3.9%) and beef (4.7%) samples (<i>p</i> = 0.73). Likewise, there was no significant variation (<i>p</i> = 0.66) in <i>Salmonella</i> isolation rate among retailers (4.84%), households (5.56%) and farms (1.85%), or between yogurt (6.45%) and raw milk (3.31%) (<i>p</i> = 0.10). Antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that all <i>Salmonella</i> isolates were 100% resistant to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, clindamycin and cephalothin, while showing varying sensitivity to ceftriaxone (88.9%), chloramphenicol (55.6%) and gentamycin (66.7%). All isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR). This study reveals that <i>Salmonella</i> is prevalent in cow’s milk and beef produced and consumed in the study area, and has developed MDR, which poses a public health threat. Therefore, it is essential for dairy farmers, and milk and beef retailers to take necessary measures to minimize <i>Salmonella</i> contamination in their products. Furthermore, dedicated engagement from district level animal health departments in educating dairy farmers about proper use of antibiotics at farm level would play a pivotal role in mitigating the increasing antibiotic resistance in <i>Salmonella</i> spp.",

        "abstract": "A nosocomial outbreak of <i>carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (CRKP) occurred in the 20-bed Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2022-February 2023). The outbreak was ultimately mitigated through multimodal infection control interventions aligned with WHO multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) management guidelines. Following index case identification on 10 December 2022, a multidisciplinary outbreak response team implemented comprehensive control measures: Immediate geographic cohorting of CRKP-positive patients with dedicated staff; Enhanced contact precautions including daily chlorhexidine bathing; Tri-daily environmental decontamination using sporicidal agents; Mandatory hand hygiene audits with real-time feedback; Active surveillance through weekly rectal swabs for all RICU admissions. Environmental monitoring encompassed 120 high-touch surfaces sampled weekly. Among 42 laboratory-confirmed CRKP cases, 85.7% (<i>n</i> = 36) were identified through clinical specimens and 14.3% (<i>n</i> = 6) via active surveillance. Post-outbreak surveillance revealed two imported CRKP cases detected through admission screening during the three-month follow-up period, both contained without secondary transmission. The increasing patient volume, prolonged use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and influx of new healthcare workers heightened the risk of CRKP transmission. Effective administrative guidance on nosocomial infections, behavioral control, active surveillance culture, environmental cleanliness and antimicrobial management are essential to prevent outbreak. This outbreak demonstrates the viability of containing CRKP transmission in resource-constrained pandemic settings through: rigorous adherence to contact precautions; prospective CRE active surveillance cultures. It is also need to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs in order to reduce the occurrence of microbial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Heart failure poses a significant global health challenge, with a considerable burden in Africa, where the annual mortality rate stands at 34%, twice the global average. Patients suffering from acute heart failure occupy numerous beds at the district level, and only a limited number can be referred for further evaluation and imaging at secondary or tertiary care facilities. Patients rely on their primary care physicians for the diagnosis and management of heart failure, as well as for identifying those who would benefit from referral to cardiology and formal echocardiography. This article discusses the significance of the new heart failure guidelines within the South African primary care public setting. It emphasises the importance of identifying risk factors and considers the value of access to family physicians, outreach clinic doctors, training on available adult primary care guidelines and telemedicine-supported cardiac ultrasound. Optimal medical therapy, which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers and spironolactone, has been shown to reduce readmissions and mortality rates. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a potent addition to conventional therapy and are currently being considered for inclusion in the National Essential Medicines List. Patients admitted to the hospital should not be discharged while experiencing persistent congestion, as this is associated with an increased risk of rehospitalisation, mortality and higher healthcare costs. Comprehensive patient education regarding medications, thorough follow-up during the six weeks post-discharge and linkage to primary healthcare are associated with decreased hospitalisation rates and improved outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Sudden influxes of displaced populations can strain health systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Iran hosts one of the world's largest migrant and refugee populations -predominantly from Afghanistan - and provides inclusive access to public health and education services. In August 2021, the crisis in Afghanistan triggered a sharp increase in Afghan arrivals to Iran, raising healthcare demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines how one of the largest public health networks in Tehran responded to this surge and the resulting impact on equitable service coverage and system resilience. We retrospectively analyzed monthly healthcare utilization data over a 13-month period (February 2021-February 2022) from the largest public health network in western Tehran, which serves approximately 5.5 million residents, including nearly 1 million migrants and refugees. Patients were categorized into six demographic subgroups: children, women of childbearing age, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, and the elderly. Changes in the number and proportion of patients receiving the full Essential Health Service Package (EHSP) were assessed using six-month pre-/post-event comparisons, with statistical significance determined via chi-square tests (p < 0.05). The total number of patients served increased eight-fold, from 88,091 in February 2021 to 717,382 in February 2022. In the six-month period following the crisis, the number of Afghan patients receiving full EHSP coverage rose by 84,522; however, the proportion of full-service coverage declined by 3.2%. Children were the most affected subgroup: despite 2,739 additional patients receiving full services, their coverage rate fell by 10.6%. In contrast, young Afghan adults experienced an increase in both number and proportion of patients receiving full services (+ 25,421, + 1.2%). All subgroup changes were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Although the public health network rapidly expanded service delivery, maintaining proportional coverage for full services proved challenging, particularly for vulnerable groups. Even established health systems with decades of experience in serving displaced populations may face transient coverage shortfalls amid demand surges compounded by pandemic-related strain. Strengthening public health emergency management through targeted resource allocation, surge capacity, and real-time monitoring of coverage indicators is essential to sustaining health equity and system resilience during future crises.",

        "abstract": "Although questionnaire-based surveys enable pharmacists to systematically assess patient needs, healthcare practices, and medication outcomes, it is essential to minimize various biases to ensure that the data obtained from surveys are both reliable and valid. The present study aimed to elucidate whether a workshop on questionnaire-based surveys could enhance research awareness and motivation among community and hospital pharmacists in Mie prefecture. The workshop comprised three parts: lecture (15 min), group work (90 min), and presentation (60 min). The participants' awareness and motivation for questionnaire-based survey was assessed through a questionnaire before and after the workshop, focusing on three questions. A customer satisfaction analysis was also conducted to identify areas for improvement in workshops on questionnaire-based surveys for future workshops. Response rate of the questionnaire was 100% (16/16 participants). In the question 1 \"I think that it would be beneficial to conduct a questionnaire-based survey on daily tasks and present the findings at conferences or publish them in academic journals\", no respondents answered \"Disagree\" when asked after workshop. In the question 2 \"I would like to conduct a questionnaire-based survey if there is a specific theme\", the proportions of respondents selecting \"Neutral\" (p = 0.027) and \"Somewhat disagree\" (p = 0.001) also decreased after workshop, and all participants responded with either \"Agree\" or \"Somewhat agree.\" In the question 3 \"I think that I can independently design a research project about questionnaire-based survey.\", the proportion of respondents who selected \"Agree\" significantly increased from 6.3% before-workshop to 25% after-workshop (p = 0.003). The customer satisfaction graph revealed that only \"Understanding of the lecture\" was located in the priority maintenance area. On the other hand, \"Time allocation of the presentation\" and \"Usefulness of the mentor\" were located in the priority improvement area. The present study revealed that a workshop for questionnaire-based surveys enhanced research awareness and motivation among community and hospital pharmacists. Increasing the time allocated for discussions among participants was suggested to enhance participant satisfaction and potentially influence their understanding and skills in questionnaire-based surveys.",

This study explored barriers and facilitators to patient utilization of NCD services at primary healthcare facilities in Nepal. We conducted a qualitative study with a 35 purposive sample of patients living with one or more NCDs (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD/ asthma) who sought healthcare at primary healthcare facilities in 14 randomly selected districts in seven provinces in Nepal that implemented PEN. Trained qualitative researchers conducted in-depth interviews in person in a private setting using a semi-structured interview guide developed based on the Health Belief Model in the local language. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded inductively and deductively, and analyzed by a framework approach using Dedoose software. From the perspectives of patients, key facilitators of service utilization encompassed free medicines, low-cost services, geographical and financial accessibility, less waiting time, positive interactions with health service providers, experiencing improvements in their health conditions, and support from family and peers. Barriers to utilizing services included inadequate health services (e.g., lack of medications and equipment), inaccessibility and affordability, inadequate health-related information from health service providers, low knowledge of NCD care, and lack of reminders or follow-ups. Enhancing NCD service utilization is potentially attainable through interventions that address patients’ knowledge, self-motivation, and misconceptions. Furthermore, strengthening the availability and accessibility of crucial services such as laboratory investigations, medications, equipment, and the patient-provider relationship is crucial for the sustainable implementation of PEN.

Identifying risk factors for HT and developing accurate predictive models are essential for improving patient management and prognosis. A retrospective analysis was performed on 159 patients with acute ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolytic therapy at Hubei Third People's Hospital Affiliated to Jianghan University School of Medicine from March 2019 to July 2022. Boruta algorithm and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify independent factors associated with bleeding transformation. A nomogram was built based on these factors and internally verified using the bootstrap resampling method. Our analysis showed that the independent factors affecting HT were Hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS), pre-thrombolytic glucose, pre-thrombolytic neutrophil count and construct a nomogram based on these predictors. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the line graph was 0.885 (95%CI = 0.816 ~ 0.953), and the calibration curve showed that the probability predicted by the line graph was in good agreement with the actual observed values. The ROC curve and decision curve analysis (DCA), which assesses clinical usefulness, showed that the nomogram provided greater net benefit than the three individual predictors. In this study, a static and dynamic online nomogram with good differentiation, calibration and accuracy was constructed to help identify high-risk patients before thrombolysis, help physicians make decisions and improve patient outcomes.",

Our study aims to describe the process of integrating consumer-prioritised topics and outcomes in guidelines on kidney stones to ensure patient relevance. Two workshops were convened in Aotearoa New Zealand with people with kidney stones invited to identify topics and outcomes for inclusion in the guidelines. Flipcharts and transcripts were analysed thematically to identify the reasons for participants' choices. The topics identified by the twenty-eight participants included education on nutrition, better diagnosis, and individualised nutritional and pharmacological management. Pain, equity of access, anxiety about recurrence, and life participation were identified as important outcomes to be included. Four themes (and subthemes) underpinning priorities were: unresolvable debilitating pain (complexity of exctruciating acute episodic pain, inadequacy of pain relief medication, frustrated by stigma associated with opioids), dissatisfied at delayed access to care (prolonged difficulties in diagnosis, struggling to obtain individualised care), inadequate knowledge to enable self-management (insufficient information on kidney stones, conflicting nutrition advice, cultural deficit), and limiting life participation (restricting life choices, psychological burden of kidney stones). Participants identified topics that would support symptom management to improve quality of life and reduce the burden on families. Guidelines should provide essential, consistent and clear guidance, particularly on nutrition, to support self-management. Incoporating consumer priorities in guidelines can help to support decision-making and patient-centred care in kidney stones.",

        "title": "A systematic review on natural products with antimicrobial potential against WHO's priority pathogens.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global issue, with bacteria increasingly resistant to traditional antibiotics, resulting in more treatment failures and higher mortality rates. Resistance can be defined microbiologically or clinically and arises through genetic mutations or acquired traits. In response to this growing threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 2016 to guide the research and development of new antimicrobial agents. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated AMR, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Natural products continue to be a valuable source of antibacterial compounds and play a significant role in developing new antimicrobial treatments. This study employed a systematic review methodology, conducting comprehensive searches across PUBMED/MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, and SCOPUS databases, adhering to modified PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. A research librarian assisted in developing the search strategy, with searches executed on May 5, 2024, without restrictions on publication dates. Titles and abstracts were screened using Rayyan and Endnote. Inclusion criteria focused on original studies examining the antimicrobial effects of natural products against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals. The review identified significant effects of natural products on 12 families of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). These findings underscore the potential of natural compounds as therapeutic agents in combating antimicrobial resistance. A total of 4371 articles published between 2014 and 2024 were initially identified, from which 290 articles were selected for detailed review based on their relevance to the study period. All included studies were clinical trials. The analysis indicated that most of the research on dietary plants was conducted in countries within the Middle East, South America, and Africa. Among the pathogens investigated, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as the most frequently studied due to their involvement in a wide range of infectious diseases. The findings revealed that alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, tannins, and terpenoids were the principal classes of plant-derived compounds exhibiting antioxidant activity against bacterial strains. These bioactive compounds were extracted using a variety of solvents, including ethanol, methanol, aqueous solutions, benzoate, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and methanolic preparations obtained from different plant parts such as leaves, bark, flowers, and roots. Notably, flavonoids represented 24.8% of the antioxidant product derivatives examined. The overall results underscore the significant therapeutic potential of regional medicinal plants in combating pathogens resistant to chemical drugs. Their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties may enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotic classes and contribute to reversing antimicrobial resistance. Based on the findings of this review, the diverse effects and therapeutic efficacy of herbal compounds in managing antibiotic resistance were extensively examined. Consequently, in light of the demonstrated antimicrobial activities of these plant-derived compounds, further investigation into their potential as alternative agents to counteract antibiotic resistance has become increasingly essential.",

        "title": "Exploring pediatric palliative care in Luxembourg: a mixed-methods study.",
        "abstract": "An estimated 170,000 children in the WHO European Region have no access to palliative care annually. In Luxembourg, there is a lack of data on children needing palliative care, and the existing structure appears limited. This study aims to assess the current state of pediatric palliative care in Luxembourg. We used a parallel convergent mixed-methods approach, collecting qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously and analyzing them independently. Snowball and purposive sampling methods were employed. The qualitative data, including documents, email correspondence, and open-ended interviews with participants caring for children with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions, followed the COREQ guidelines and were analyzed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The analysis highlights a significant gap in the provision of care at all levels of pediatric palliative care in Luxembourg. Approximately 500 to 600 children up to 19 years old require palliative care each year, which exceeds previous estimates. Existing legal frameworks are predominantly designed for adults and end-of-life care, and do not sufficiently address the holistic needs of children requiring palliative care and their families. Homecare services are in the early development phase, and specialized pediatric palliative care options are limited across all levels. A pediatric palliative care course, set to be introduced in 2025 for university pediatric nursing students as outlined in the national plan, aims to address some of these gaps by developing competencies. However, until sufficient specialized care is established, many children are transferred to neighboring countries where there are better resources and expertise or remain at home, receiving limited services. This study presents, for the first time, data on pediatric palliative care in Luxembourg, with a focus on service availability, the legal framework, and the estimated number of children requiring care. The findings highlight the urgent need for a structured pediatric palliative care service to address this country's growing demand and unmet needs. In addition, it is essential to support the implementation of the \"National Plan for End of Life and Palliative Care\" from 2023 to 2026, which includes a dedicated focus on children.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasmosis could potentially be transmitted via blood transfusions from asymptomatic donors to patients with beta-thalassemia major (BTM) who regularly receive transfusions. Nevertheless, screening for toxoplasmosis prior to blood donation has not been implemented, representing a significant gap in transfusion safety protocols. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of anti-<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> antibodies in BTM patients undergoing blood transfusion. The current case-control study was conducted among 270 patients and 90 controls in Southeastern Iran, from September to December 2024. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to detect anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples. A binomial logistic regression model was employed to analyze the association between toxoplasmosis and its determinants. The seropositivity rate for anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgG antibodies was 9.3% (25/270) in the patients and 8.9% (8/90) in the controls. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.45–2.41; <i>p</i> = 0.916). Anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgM antibodies were detected in the patients with a seropositivity rate of 1.5% (4/270). In the controls, the seropositivity rate for anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgM antibodies was 0.0% (0/90). None of the participants’ characteristics were found to be associated with the infection. Anti-<i>T. gondii</i> antibodies were detected at relatively low seroprevalence rates in both patients and controls. The presence of toxoplasmosis in these patients highlights the critical need for appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of infection, as the population appears to be mostly non-immune. It is essential to implement routine screening of blood for specific antibodies against <i>T. gondii</i> before transfusions in these patients to mitigate the risk of infection. This is the first study assessing the seroprevalence of <i>T. gondii</i> antibodies among patients with BTM in Southeastern Iran.

        "abstract": "Commonly used clinical tools like the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) are essential for assessing balance impairments in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), but their clinical relevance depends on understanding the Minimal Important Difference (MID) and Minimal Detectable Change (MDC). To assess the responsiveness of the Mini-BESTest, DGI, BBS, and POMA in PwPD. This prospective cohort study included 130 PwPD who were recruited. Participants underwent baseline and post-intervention assessments using the Mini-BESTest, DGI, BBS, and POMA. The intervention consisted of task-oriented exercises focused on motor re-learning to improve functional balance. Anchor and distribution methods were used to determine the MID (the receiver-operating characteristic(ROC)-based (MID<sub>ROC</sub>), the predictive modeling method (MID<sub>pred</sub>), and the MIDpred-based method adjusted by the rate of improvement (MID<sub>adj</sub>)) and MDC. ROC-derived MID(MID<sub>ROC</sub>) exceeded 1 point for all scales, but improvement-rate-adjusted MID (MID<sub>adj</sub>) provided more conservative estimates: Mini-BESTest (2.96 points), DGI (2.29), BBS (1.97), and POMA (0.83). Predictive modeling (MID<sub>pred</sub>) yielded higher thresholds (e.g., 4.0 for Mini-BESTest), likely reflecting baseline variability. The MDCs was 1.9, 2.0, 1.0, and 2.8 points for the Mini-BESTest, DGI, BBS, and POMA, respectively. The findings suggest that the Mini-BESTest, DGI, BBS, and POMA are responsive outcome measures for PD.

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contribute to two-thirds of Nepal's total deaths. In 2016, Nepal adopted the World Health Organization's Package of Essential Non-Communicable Disease Interventions (WHO-PEN) to curb the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study evaluated the primary healthcare system's readiness for the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), and investigated factors associated with NCD-specific service readiness. We employed a convergent parallel mixed-methods study design. We adapted the WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool and assessed 105 primary healthcare facilities, which were selected using a multistage stratified random sampling approach. We performed a weighted descriptive analysis and fitted survey-weighted multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with NCD-specific service readiness. Simultaneously, we conducted 23 key informant interviews with health authorities and 47 in-depth interviews with health service providers involved in the PEN implementation. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic approach. The overall NCD service readiness score for primary healthcare facilities was highest for CVDs at 48.4 (95% CI: 43.2-53.6), followed by DM at 40.8 (95% CI: 34.5-47.2), and CRDs at 34.8 (95% CI: 29.2-40.5). Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCCs) had higher NCD service readiness than health posts. In regression analysis, we found that primary healthcare facilities located in hilly regions and imposing user fees for some NCD services had significantly higher NCD-specific service readiness compared to those in the mountainous areas and those not imposing user fees, respectively. Qualitative findings revealed that higher NCD service readiness in PHCCs and certain regions was due to better infrastructure, training opportunities, accessibility to medicines and equipment, and social health insurance schemes. High staff turnover and limited supply of NCD drugs and equipment hindered NCD service delivery, particularly in health posts and remote regions. Primary healthcare facilities in Nepal lack equipment, medicines, trained staff, and guidelines for NCD management. The government of Nepal could enhance NCD-specific service readiness by equipping health service providers with medical supplies and building their capacity through regular PEN training and peer coaching sessions.",

We assessed the prevalence of PA in participants being treated as essential hypertension (EHTN). In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 492 participants with diagnosis of EHTN were evaluated. The screening for PA was conducted by measuring plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and direct renin concentration (DRC), from which the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) was calculated. Based on Endocrine Society guidelines, screening test was followed by a confirmatory recumbent saline infusion test (SIT). Participants who showed a post-SIT PAC greater than 5 ng/dL were diagnosed with PA. Of 492 EHTN participants, 91 (18.49%) had positive screening test. Out of 91 participants, 59 agreed for SIT and PA was confirmed in 37 participants (8.04%) (Excluding 32 screened positive participants who were non-compliant to SIT).

        "abstract": "The CDC recommends initiating opioids for pain treatment at the lowest effective dose and duration. We examine how interactions between dose, duration, and other medication factors (e.g., drug type) influence opioid use disorder (OUD) risk-a gap not considered by CDC guidelines. Using Medicaid claims data (2016-2019) from 25 states, we analyzed opioid-naïve adults, newly diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain who initiated opioids within three months of diagnosis. A 6-month washout confirmed no prior opioid exposure or musculoskeletal diagnosis. Initial opioids were categorized by \"dose-days supplied\" (low [>0-20 mg MME] to very high [>90 mg MME] dose, and short [1-7 days] to moderate [>7-30 days] supply), and by opioid type; physical therapy (PT) sessions were also recorded. Using Poisson regression models, we estimated the OUD risk associated with dose-days categories, adjusting for baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, and medications. We separately examined opioid dose-days and PT, and assessed PT's moderating effect on dose-days' impact. Among 30,536 patients, half initiated opioids at 20-50 MME for 1-7 days, and 20% received PT. OUD risk was 2-3 times higher for opioids initiated for >7-30 days compared to 1-7 days across doses, and 5.5 times higher for opioids initiated for >7-30 days at > 90 MME versus 1-7 days at < 20 MME. PT alone, neither affected OUD risk nor mitigated the increased risk from longer or higher-dose opioids. Our findings support the need for careful opioid prescribing and alternative pain management strategies, as the observed associations between initial prescription characteristics and OUD were not mitigated by adjunctive PT. This study demonstrated that initial opioid prescriptions of 7-30 days, especially above 90 MME/day, increased OUD risk in opioid-naïve patients with musculoskeletal pain; physical therapy did not mitigate the risk. Different opioids posed varied risks, even at the same dose and duration. Careful prescribing and alternative pain management are essential.",

This guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the multidisciplinary management of these tumors, focusing on diagnosis, initial treatment, reirradiation, and health disparities, while acknowledging that present literature primarily represents historical histologic grade 4 glioblastoma. The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 4 key questions focused on indications for radiation therapy (RT) and/or adjunctive therapies (eg, systemic therapy, alternating electric field therapy), appropriate regimens for external beam RT after initial biopsy/resection including variables such as pretreatment characteristics, target volumes, technique, dose, reirradiation indications and techniques, and health disparities. Recommendations are based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. Following maximum safe resection, molecular and pathologic diagnosis, and prognostic stratification of WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma, concurrent RT with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide is recommended for eligible patients and incorporation of alternating electric field therapy is conditionally recommended. In elderly patients, hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is conditionally recommended. In frail patients, supportive and palliative care is conditionally recommended following multidisciplinary, patient-centered discussion. Appropriate reirradiation techniques, with or without additional systemic therapies, can be considered and are conditionally recommended in patients following pathologic or advanced imaging confirmation of WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma recurrence. Health disparities exist in patients with WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma and attention is necessary to improve outcomes and increase clinical trial enrollment for underserved populations. These evidence-based recommendations and current practice adoption patterns inform best clinical practices on the management of WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma. Future advancements in personalized medicine, biomarker discovery, and novel therapies are essential to improving outcomes. The integration of multidisciplinary care and participation in future clinical trials, especially in underserved populations, is crucial in addressing the poor outcomes among WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma.",

We report a rare case of right knee synovial sarcoma with metastasis to the left breast occurring five years after initial diagnosis. This work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2023 criteria [20]. We present the case of a 36-year-old female who developed metastatic left breast sarcoma five years after her initial diagnosis of right knee synovial sarcoma, which was treated with wide local excision. She underwent a left partial mastectomy. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful. A PET-CT scan performed during her 16-month follow-up period showed no evidence of metastasis or recurrence. This case describes a rare instance of synovial sarcoma metastasizing to the breast, highlighting the importance of including metastatic disease in the differential diagnosis of breast masses, especially in patients with a history of malignancy. The case was initially misdiagnosed as epithelioid leiomyoma, underscoring the diagnostic challenge due to overlapping features. Diagnosis was confirmed through cytological comparison with the primary knee tumor and immunohistochemistry. With only seven similar cases reported in the literature, there are no established guidelines for diagnosis or treatment of metastasis breast sarcoma. Due to the lack of standardized guidelines for managing breast metastases of synovial sarcoma, a multidisciplinary approach incorporating systemic therapy, surgery, and close surveillance is essential for personalized treatment.",

        "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, with a significant societal and economic burden. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) increase VTE risk by 2- to 6-fold, resulting in approximately 22,925 cases annually in the European Economic Area (EEA). Despite the high associated healthcare costs, which may reach 2.5 billion EUR annually, current international guidelines, including those from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), discourage routine thrombophilia screening prior to COC prescription, citing low cost-effectiveness, low prevalence of thrombophilia, and potential unintended consequences, such as reduced contraceptive use. Recent advancements in screening technology challenge these guidelines. The normalized Activated Protein C sensitivity ratio (nAPCsr) assay, a low-cost tool capable of detecting both inherited thrombophilia and acquired COC-induced activated protein C (APC) resistance, offers a promising strategy for targeted screening. Economic models estimate that implementing nAPCsr-based screening could prevent up to 13,500 VTE cases annually, leading to 1.5 billion EUR in annual healthcare savings. Additionally, nAPCsr-guided contraceptive counseling enables personalized decision-making, directing high-risk women toward safer contraceptive options, such as progestin-only pills or COCs containing natural estrogens (estradiol or estetrol), which present a lower thrombotic risk. This manuscript emphasizes the necessity of updating current prevention strategies by integrating innovative screening tools like the nAPCsr assay. By addressing both direct healthcare costs and indirect costs related to productivity loss and long-term complications, such a strategy could improve patient safety, reduce the financial burden on healthcare systems, and promote equitable access to safer contraceptive methods. Furthermore, targeted screening could alleviate the underrepresentation of high-risk women in current cost estimates and significantly mitigate the societal impact of COC-associated VTE. In light of these findings, reconsidering current policy recommendations appears essential to facilitate evidence-based, cost-effective prevention of COC-related thrombotic events, ultimately enhancing public health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is an important component of comprehensive HIV prevention, yet its uptake has been suboptimal globally. In July 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its global guidance on PEP to include two new recommendations intended to increase timely access to and delivery of PEP. These recommendations specifically aim to expand both where PEP can be delivered, to include community settings, and who can provide PEP, to include community health workers and task-sharing. The practical realities of adopting new public health guidelines to achieve the intended benefits in most contexts are complex. Articulating these realities is important for identifying what will be required to ensure the feasibility of expanded PEP access in community settings. We provide stakeholder perspectives from five African countries-Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe-on both barriers to and strategies for implementing the new WHO PEP recommendations. These perspectives are informed by experiences in these countries that were shared at a recent workshop and highlight key themes related to PEP uptake and use: awareness and acceptability; administration and monitoring; policy alignment, including regulatory considerations; logistics; integration of services; stakeholder involvement and capacity building; and linking PEP and PrEP more directly. Running across these themes are the roles of socio-cultural norms and the need for increased resources to pay for implementing the recommendations, including capacity strengthening and monitoring in communities. While significant challenges exist to expanding PEP access in community settings and through task-sharing, there are examples from our countries of successful efforts to mitigate them by leveraging existing community resources and capacities in innovative ways. Additional efforts will require engagement across multiple stakeholders to address remaining awareness gaps, logistical and regulatory obstacles, and political will. As countries work to update their guidelines and align with the new WHO recommendations, continued collaboration and innovation within and across countries will be essential to realize the full potential of PEP in comprehensive HIV prevention efforts.",

Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in nine databases (Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, etc.) up to January 2025. Empirical qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies published in English were included, with 46 studies selected after screening. Study quality was assessed using a 14-criteria scoring system. Data extraction was performed by the first author and validated by co-authors. A total of 46 studies with 22,859 participants (ages 6-21) were included. Findings revealed that individuals who are DHH or moderate to profound hearing loss experience higher rates of internalizing disorders, such as anxiety and depression, compared to hearing peers. Social exclusion, communication barriers, and stigma were significant risk factors. Mainstream schools exacerbated mental health challenges, whereas specialized schools provided a supportive environment. Early diagnosis and intervention, especially cochlear implants, improved psychosocial development. Communication proficiency, especially sign language, positively impacted quality of life and mental health. Parental involvement and targeted interventions helped mitigate behavioral challenges and executive functioning deficits. This review highlights the key factors affecting the mental health of DHH youth, including communication methods, educational setting, early intervention, and social relationships. Tailored interventions addressing these factors are essential for improving psychosocial development. Future research should focus on developing and testing interventions to enhance the mental health and well-being of individuals who are DHH or have moderate to profound hearing loss.",

The samples for this case-control study included, randomly selected, 25 women with PCOS who were treated at the Research and Clinical Center for Infertility, Yazd, Iran. The diagnosis of PCOS was made based on the criteria defined in the Rotterdam guidelines. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction determined the expression level of <i>FZD3</i> and miR-378.

High levels of <i>FZD3</i> and miR-378 in cumulus cells of immature oocytes can inhibit their maturation. <i>FZD3</i>, a component of the WNT signaling pathway, is overexpressed in immature oocytes and may negatively affect the maturation process. Additionally, miR-378 inhibits oocyte development by targeting and repressing essential genes. Currently, various aspects of microRNA function remain unknown. MiR-378 may exert its regulatory role by directly targeting the <i>FZD3</i> gene or by targeting other genes and mediators that interact with <i>FZD3</i> or the protein it encodes.

        "abstract": "The current management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia, is supported by small retrospective studies or expert consensus documents. Moreover, people with hemophilia are less likely to receive invasive treatments like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for ACS compared to those without hemophilia, which could affect their cardiovascular outcomes. A multidisciplinary team with an expert hematologist is essential to properly define the therapeutic strategy, which should balance both the thrombotic and bleeding risks. We report a clinical case that illustrates an alternative revascularization strategy for hemophilic patients presenting with ACS and with a pattern of diffuse coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD), encompassing drug-coated balloons (DCBs) in combination with spot stenting. The proposed approach might avoid a full-length drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation and also allow a short dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimen that is desirable in patients at a very high bleeding risk (HBR) like hemophiliacs. Furthermore, we have provided a review of the available literature on this topic and a focus on the main recommendations for managing ACS, in response to the presented clinical case. Finally, this article aims to share information and develop more confidence in the current guidelines on the treatment of hemophiliacs who need myocardial revascularization.",

        "abstract": "There has been notable progress in pharmacovigilance (PV) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in the last decade. However, only a few of these PV systems are fully functional, unlike in high-income countries where stringent legislation, regulations and operational guidelines have enabled the establishment of effective PV systems. The key challenges faced in LMIC include organisational inefficiencies; weak infrastructure; inconsistent and poorly enforced regulations; and inadequate financing and shortage of trained personnel. Furthermore, low adverse event volume and poor data quality hinder the capacity for safety data generation and utilisation. With the increasing availability of essential and innovative medicines in LMIC, establishing robust PV systems is crucial for effective safety surveillance. This research aims to analyse the development of PV systems across high-, middle- and low-income countries and to carve out essential elements for functionality and sustainability of PV systems in LMIC. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative and quantitative research consisted of semi-structured interviews and an online survey, respectively. Twelve key informants from 10 countries were interviewed and 52 respondents from 36 countries completed the online survey. From the qualitative and quantitative data, we identified nine essential elements for sustainable PV development in LMIC: understanding the drivers of PV development; adequately resolving core system challenges; implementing an efficient organisational structure and good governance; establishing procedures for PV activities; ensuring availability of qualified and trained staff; identifying alternate sources of financing; having a strategic development plan; adequately leveraging the health system; and effectively integrating the pharmaceutical sector in the national PV system. Findings from this research indicate that significant efforts are still needed to upgrade PV systems in LMIC to meet global standards despite the progress achieved in recent years. Developing the different areas emerging from this research, within the framework of a holistic, fit-for-purpose PV system strengthening, would enable a comprehensive progression from basic to functional and thus sustainable PV systems in LMIC.",

        "title": "Women's health and maternal care services: seizing missed opportunities to prevent and manage preterm birth.",
        "abstract": "The past ten years have seen uneven developments in women's and adolescents' health and reproductive rights. Globally, reductions of maternal and neonatal mortality rates and adolescent birth rates have been achieved along with improvements in coverage of key reproductive and maternal health services. However, preterm birth rates have not changed significantly. There is still large variation in these rates across the world, with the highest rates occurring in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Effective interventions based on current clinical guidelines are available that can prevent preterm birth or reduce its negative impacts on newborns. These recommended interventions can be delivered as part of essential health service packages during the preconception, antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal phases. They encompass comprehensive family planning services that enable women and adolescent girls to determine the timing and number of children they have, and the provision of prevention and treatment-related interventions during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period that improve maternal and newborn health including reducing preterm births as well as stillbirths. Health system improvements are needed so that all women are reached with these services and that they are provided respectfully and according to standards. To better prevent and manage preterm births as part of broader goals of improving maternal and newborn health, health systems need to be strengthened so that all women are reached with essential packages of care before, during, and after pregnancy and childbirth. Achieving this and integrating these service packages into universal health coverage strategies requires collaboration across government leaders, civil society members, private sector actors, and development partners. Increasing coverage of antenatal care, institutional delivery, and postnatal care represents an opportunity to improve the quality of care provided during those service contacts including through the provision of interventions that address modifiable risk factors for preterm birth such as prevention and treatment of infections, poor nutritional status, and substance use. Other pivots to enhance the quality of care include using existing tools to optimize the management of preterm birth, such as appropriate use of antenatal corticosteroids, and providing respectful person-centred care for women, adolescents, and families.",

        "title": "Born Too Soon: Progress and priorities for respectful and rights-based preterm birth care.",
        "abstract": "Human rights related to preterm birth encompass access to respectful, evidence-based care; informed consent; protection from discrimination, detention, and unnecessary separation of mother and newborn; and broader social entitlements, such as parental leave and early disability support. Since the 2012 Born Too Soon report, global recognition of these rights has expanded through international treaties, global guidelines, national legal reforms, and social movements. Demand for respectful care, including respectful maternity care and family centred care, has led to its incorporation into global guidelines and policies and a greater evidence-base. However, persistent challenges, such as workforce shortages, discriminatory policies, and the erosion of sexual and reproductive rights, continue to threaten progress. Ensuring respectful and rights-based preterm birth care requires coordinated action across the continuum of care and across sectors, with the mother-baby dyad at the centre. Programmatic priorities at the individual level include implementing respectful maternity care and family-centred care. Ensuring high-quality, respectful care demands that providers themselves are supported, protected, and empowered to deliver such care. Their well-being is a critical enabler of the rights of patients and an essential component of effective, compassionate service delivery. At the facility-level, health systems must be purposefully designed to safeguard the fundamental human rights of the individuals with them, both care seekers and care providers. Implementing respectful, rights-based care relating to preterm birth requires structural and social changes, as well as robust data systems for accountability. Multi-stakeholder action requires strengthening accountability mechanisms at all levels and partnering with those affected by preterm birth-particularly women, families and healthcare providers-in policy processes, and the design, implementation and monitoring of care. At national-level, action requires the adoption, implementation and monitoring of international and regional human rights instruments, with multisectoral collaboration and social mobilization where violations continue. To operationalize respectful and rights-based care for preterm birth, four primary shifts are needed: scale up respectful care; empower and partner with women and families; address the shortage of healthcare providers and protect their rights; and strengthen policy action and accountability.",

        "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an essential role in cancer progression through intercellular communication. Therefore, the use of EV formation inhibitors could be a profitable therapeutic strategy in various types of cancer, including leukemia. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, can block EV formation by inhibiting acid sphingomyelinase. Additionally, other crucial players in cancer progression are microRNAs, which regulate molecular mechanisms at the post-transcriptional level. Here, to potentiate the therapeutic effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), we investigated the effect of imipramine as a microvesicle inhibitor in combination with ATRA for the treatment of APL-derived NB4 cells. Our results declared that imipramine reduced the viability and metabolic activity of ATRA-treated NB4 cells after 48 h. In addition, flow cytometry results highlighted that imipramine induced cytotoxicity through G2/M phase arrest followed by apoptosis. Moreover, we discovered that the antileukemic effects of imipramine were associated with inhibiting microvesicle release and miRNA alteration. Based on bioinformatics methods, we predicted two miRNAs, including hsa-miR-4498 and hsa-miR-3156-5p, which target PML. Additionally, we selected miR-23a-5p, miR-19a-3p, and miR-181b-5p based on relevant studies and subsequently predicted their target genes. The real-time PCR results revealed that the expression level of these miRNAs increased after treatment with imipramine. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of target genes demonstrated that these genes are involved in cancer-related pathways, including MAPK, FOXO, AMPK, and cellular senescence. Given the significant efficacy of imipramine in potentiating the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, it can be considered as a potential treatment agent for APL.",

        "abstract": "Mental health literacy is essential for the recognition, management, and prevention of mental disorders among school-aged children. However, few studies have examined the implementation status of school-based mental health literacy in Asian countries. This study aims to compare the approaches taken by the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan in managing school-based mental health literacy through curriculum-related policies. The collected documents of this study analyzed both policies (formulated from 2000 to 2023) and curricula (from grade 1 to grade 12) that were adapted to the deductive content analysis methods. Policies were analyzed using the policy triangle framework (Walt and Gilson in Health Policy Plan 9:353-370, 1994) and mapped using the review points (Margaretha et al. in Front Psychiatry 14:1126767, 2023). Curricula were analyzed using the definition of mental health literacy (Jorm in Am Psychol 67:231-243, 2012). This study focused on mental health laws and policies in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan, highlighting their success in addressing the needs of adults and school-aged children. By considering each country's unique socio-cultural contexts and basic educational approaches, this study identified diverse strategies and methodologies in addressing mental health challenges. Using a common analytic framework, this study collected and analyzed policies and curricula on mental health literacy from the three countries (Philippines, 22; Indonesia, 9; and Japan, 6). The basic education curricula developed by their respective Ministries of Education were used. This study highlights two key findings on school-based mental health literacy. First, mental health literacy is incorporated into health and physical education in Japan, health, values education and homeroom guidance in the Philippines, and religious education in Indonesia. Second, while the Philippines and Indonesia implement mental health education based on established policies, Japan lacks a core mental health literacy policy but has developed and implemented related curricula through its course of study guidelines. The curriculum analysis identified a specific challenge: a lack of \"first aid skills to support others who are developing a mental disorder or are in a mental health crisis\". This study revealed the partial implementation of mental health literacy education in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan. The Philippines offers a nearly comprehensive curriculum on mental health literacy (grades 1-12), Japan incorporates it into health education (grades 5-10), and Indonesia integrates it into religious education (grades 1-12). While the Philippines and Indonesia align with mental health policies, Japan relies on its national curriculum without a core policy. A key challenge was indicated involving teachers, guidance counselors, or school health personnel as key actors to support students with mental disorders or those potentially at risk, as well as to handle emergency cases of mental disorders in schools. Recommendations include systematic monitoring of the implementation of school-based mental health policies, collaboration with UN agencies to align with international standards while incorporating culturally tailored strategies for each country.",

        "abstract": "Patient safety incidents during healthcare cause a high burden and mortality, but many go unreported. Involving patients and caregivers in the identification and reporting of safety incidents would add value to the current incident reporting systems used by health professionals. Identifying and analysing patient safety incidents is essential to prevent future events, allowing organisations to apply a learning-from-error approach and to implement improvement plans. Patient-Reported Incident Measures are tools for patients and caregivers to report safety issues related to their healthcare. In accordance with WHO's patient safety taxonomy, the term patient safety incidents is used throughout this protocol to encompass events that do and do not reach the patient, including what are commonly referred to as near misses and adverse events. We aim to identify and describe the published literature about tools for patients or caregivers to report patient safety incidents in healthcare. We will conduct a scoping review. We have developed inclusion criteria using the PCC (population, concept and context) format, where population includes adult patients or caregivers; concept refers to documents describing formal tools used to report patient safety incidents; and context includes any healthcare setting, such as hospitals or mental health centres, during or immediately after care. The scoping review will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Evidence sources include primary research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, conference abstracts, letters, guidelines, as well as policy documents, reports, blogs and websites, without language restriction. An initial database search in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from database inception up to June 2023 identified 4500 initial citations, of which 4103 were selected for evaluation after duplicates were removed. We will supplement the search by checking the reference lists of included studies for additional sources of evidence and an additional search in Google to identify non-peer-reviewed documents. This initial search will be updated before completing the review. We will use a self-created data collection form for data extraction and perform a narrative synthesis to integrate and summarise the review findings. We will describe the general characteristics of the tool: setting, scope, format, content, type of patient safety incident and severity, the moment of notification, relation to patient safety incident reporting and learning systems, development process, testing, validation, or piloting, among other characteristics. As a result of this scoping review, we intend to provide an index of patient/caregiver-reported safety notification tools and a list of descriptive or evaluation studies. We will only use published data. Approval from the human research ethics committee is not required. The results of this scoping review will be submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal and scientific meetings. Findings will also be disseminated through digital science platforms and academic social media.",

        "abstract": "Medical innovations and advancements, such as orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) allow thousands of patients worldwide to live comfortably, despite previously life-threatening conditions. Procreation, one of the most powerful human instincts, drives the force behind the increasing popularity of pregnancies after OLT, with their numbers rising since the first documented case in 1976. Pregnancy post OLT remains a high-risk event, requiring careful management by a multidisciplinary team of hepatologists, obstetricians, transplant surgeons, and neonatologists. This review aims to synthesize current evidence on family planning, pregnancy management, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in women who have undergone OLT, based on studies indexed in PubMed up to December 2024. Due to ethical constraints, international registries of pregnancies after OLTs play a critical role in collecting observational data and establishing comprehensive guidelines for clinical practice. As the data indicated, OLT can help restore hormonal balance and menstrual cycle, enabling many women to conceive after OLT. However, adequate family planning is crucial, as women must be aware of the potential risks. Preconception counseling is essential to choose the right timing for pregnancy, assess graft function, and optimize immunosuppressive therapy, as some medications must be discontinued due to teratogenic risks. The risks associated with pregnancy in OLT recipients include gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Neonates are significantly more likely to experience prematurity and low birth weight. Post-partum management focuses on monitoring graft function, managing complications, and guiding breastfeeding. Available literature and observational studies consistently demonstrate that women post-OLT can achieve successful pregnancies and deliver healthy infants. However, due to the inherent risks described in this population, such patients require specialized care from a multidisciplinary team. Further research is essential to optimize birth control methods and clarify the mechanisms behind the higher prevalence of pregnancy complications. Establishing the long-term safety data for immunosuppressive therapies, particularly regarding breastfeeding, is also needed.",

        "abstract": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and its combination therapy are essential supportive treatments for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF). Hyperkalemia (HK) is the major safety concern associated with the treatments, which often leads to RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, thereby compromising cardiovascular protective effects. Although novel potassium binders (NPBs) are recommended by current guidelines for the treatment of HK, systematic evidence is needed to guide their use in RAASi optimization and HK management. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the incidence of HK in patients with CKD or HF who received RAASi and the efficacy of NPBs in RAASi optimization. PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2023. Any studies of adult patients with CKD or HF who received RAASi were included in systematic review of HK incidence and risk factors (part 1). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NPBs in patients with CKD or HF were included in meta-analysis on the efficacy of novel potassium binders (NPBs) (part 2). The primary outcome was optimization of RAASi therapy with NPBs. A pooled analysis was conducted in part 1. Network meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed in part 2. A total of 83 studies (24 with CKD, 54 with HF, and 5 with CKD and HF) were included in part 1 and 8 RCTs (2 with CKD, 4 with HF, and 2 with CKD and HF) were included in part 2. The pooled HK incidence was 10.7% overall at any criteria and in all patients who received RAASi. The highest incidence of HK was observed with the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin ii receptor blockers (ARBs)/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi)+ mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (24.4%), followed by the triple therapy ACEi/ARB/ARNi+ sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i)+MRA (10.9%), and ACEi/ARB/ARNi + SGLT2i (2.2%). Novel potassium binders improved RAASi optimization by 38% compared with placebo (risk ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.16-1.65). Additionally, NPBs decreased the incidence of HK by 28% and reduced the level of potassium by 0.71 mEq/L. The CKD population showed a higher optimization rate than the HF population (84% vs 29%). The RAASi treatment was associated with high prevalence of HK, especially in bigeminal and triple therapy. The NPBs were effective in RAASi optimization and HK management, especially among the CKD population.",

Improved characterisation of transmitted integrase resistance, its detection, and its clinical impact will guide future recommendations for clinical decision making. Balancing the need to protect this important drug class against concerns about resource allocation and care complexity presents a substantial challenge. Shifting the responsibility to providers to decide whether and when to test for integrase resistance before ART initiation can be problematic, particularly given the uncertainty around the need to reassess related available recommendations. As our understanding of integrase resistance evolves, prioritising this discussion is essential, and providers, researchers, and policy makers should engage in addressing this important issue.",

This article describes the preparedness of public and private health facilities for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension management. Methods A cross-sectional survey of the health facilities was conducted in 19 districts of seven States in India, which included an assessment of both public and private health facilities. We used the Indian Public Health Standards and other relevant guidelines for assessment. The service domain score for four domains: equipment, medicine, diagnostics capacity, staff, including the availability of guidelines, and overall readiness score, was calculated following the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual of the World Health Organisation. The study considered a readiness score of ≥70 per cent to classify a facility as prepared for providing hypertension and diabetes services. Results Out of 415 health facilities covered in the survey, 75.7 per cent were public facilities. Most were primary care facilities (57.6%) and were located in rural areas (53.3%). The overall readiness score for providing hypertension and diabetes services was lowest for Sub-Centres (SCs; 61%) and Community Health Centres (CHCs; 59%), compared to other facilities. The readiness score for public Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and private primary care facilities (level 2) was 73 and 57 per cent, respectively. The readiness score of district hospitals, government private medical colleges, and other private tertiary care facilities was above 70 per cent, and they were considered prepared for services. Interpretations & conclusions PHCs were better prepared for diabetes and hypertension care than SCs, CHCs, and SDHs. By ensuring adequate human resources availability and uninterrupted supply of essential medicines, programme managers can further improve the preparedness of all public health facilities.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis (NNS) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO's recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX's full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya's goal of Universal Health Coverage.",

        "title": "Performance of direct-from-blood-culture disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing and its impact on antibiotic adjustment in bloodstream infections at a Malaysian tertiary center.",
        "abstract": "Delayed antibiotics increase mortality in bloodstream infection (BSI). Direct-from-blood-culture disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing (dAST) forecasts susceptibility earlier than conventional susceptibility testing (cAST). The study aimed to evaluate dAST performance and its impact on antibiotic adjustment in BSI. In this Malaysian single-center prospective study, dAST was performed and interpreted according to breakpoints by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The turnaround time (TAT), categorical agreements (CA), and predictive values of dAST for susceptibility by cAST were determined among positive blood cultures (PBC) between November 2022 and November 2023. The active and WHO AWaRe antibiotics administered before and after dAST results were compared. Of the 318 PBCs, the median of TAT was earlier than cAST by 35 hours. The CA for 3,561 organism-antibiotics combinations was 91.5%, with 3.6% very major errors (VME), 3.3% major errors (ME), and 5.2% minor errors (mE). The dAST achieved CA above 90% for <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> with cefoxitin (98.5%), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> with ceftazidime (100%), and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with ampicillin/sulbactam (100%). For Enterobacterales, most combinations were above 90%, including ampicillin (95.1%), ceftriaxone (95.7%), and meropenem (95.7%), though those of the aminopenicillin/inhibitor combinations were above 80%. Most errors were attributed to mEs. Among 159 BSI, the prescribing of active antibiotics improved significantly following dAST (73.0% versus 89.3%, <i>P</i> < 0.001) but not WHO Access antibiotics (35.8% versus 35.2%, <i>P</i> = 0.188). dAST had good CAs for most antibiotics, allowing earlier improvement in active antibiotics. The modest change in WHO Access antibiotics prescribing reveals practice gaps in need of antimicrobial stewardship. Global deaths attributable to antimicrobial resistance are rising. Hence, rapid susceptibility testing is essential for timely antibiotic de-escalation to mitigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development from exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Compared to the costly advanced technology, direct disk diffusion from blood culture (diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing [dAST]) is an affordable method that can be quickly adopted. However, the reliability of dAST in informing susceptibility was mainly reported from Western countries and scarcely from other regions, including Southeast Asia, where the AMR burden is high. This study from Malaysia adds insights into the performance of dAST and the potential to apply it in similar resource-limited settings from the same region. Furthermore, assessing the dAST's influence on antibiotic prescribing identifies the gap in implementation to guide areas of improvement for optimizing clinical utility.",

        "title": "Providers' perceptions of implementing standardized postpartum family planning: a qualitative study of midwives and nurses in Ghana.",
        "abstract": "The World Health Organization publishes and maintains evidence-based guidance for the delivery of essential family planning services in the postpartum period<b>.</b> Despite significant time and effort in the development of these guidelines in the past decades, a significant unmet need for postpartum family planning persists, exposing an implementation gap. Implementation strategies involving education and infrastructure support can improve family planning uptake and mobile health interventions are a feasible adjunct in improvement of health outcomes. We sought to understand provider perceptions of feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of implementation of the Postpartum Family Planning Package, which involved provider use of the World Health Organization Medical Eligibility for Contraceptive Use Mobile Application with a one-on-one counseling strategy. We implemented the Postpartum Family Planning Package at three hospitals in Greater Accra and Eastern Regions, Ghana. We conducted in-depth interviews with 23 providers who used the Postpartum Family Planning Package for at least three months. Study design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We interpreted data using thematic analysis. Providers indicated that use of one-on-one counseling and the mobile application in hospital-based postpartum care delivery was acceptable, feasible, and appropriate. Respondents described the resultant increased perceived trust between patients and providers as well as more effective and efficient information exchange. Endorsement for the use of the World Health Organization Medical Eligibility for Contraceptive Use Mobile Application by the facility leadership motivated providers to use it. The primary barrier to incorporation of one-on-one counseling was lack of privacy on the postnatal wards. Providers perceived the implementation of the Postpartum Family Planning Package as feasible, acceptable, and appropriate. Creation of private spaces on the postnatal ward for counseling and continued buy-in by the facility leadership would likely enhance the impact of the strategy. Given the widespread use of mobile technology and the continued unmet need for postpartum contraception, we recommend evaluating this strategy in a broad range of settings internationally, including in lower-resource settings.",
