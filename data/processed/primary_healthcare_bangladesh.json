        "title": "Quantification of regional variation in ultra-processed food consumption and its sociodemographic correlates across Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka: insights from the South Asia Biobank.",
        "abstract": "Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan. UPF consumption varied across South Asia by sociodemographic factors including age, gender, and education. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial when designing interventions aimed at reducing UPF consumption. Our findings of regional variations in the types of UPFs consumed provide valuable insights for targeted interventions. The South Asia Biobank is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",

        "title": "Planetary Health Consequences of Telecoupled Shrimp Farming.",
        "abstract": "The international demand for shrimp from Bangladesh exhibits a Telecoupled system. Semi-intensive to intensive shrimp farming has changed vast coastal areas into saline zones by altering land use and land cover. While shrimp cultivation significantly contributes to foreign exchange earnings, it also leads to various social and environmental impacts that affect planetary health. This study sees shrimp farming as a result of these Telecoupled dynamics. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining both primary and secondary data to examine its effects on planetary health in Bangladesh's southwestern coastal areas. The findings reveal several important health and social issues associated with shrimp farming. These include (i) scarcity of drinking and household water, (ii) infectious diseases, (iii) non-infectious diseases, (iv) food and nutritional insecurity, (v) antimicrobial resistance and chemical contamination, (vi) mental pressure, (vii) disaster-related health vulnerability, (viii) social conflict, (ix) healthcare inequality, and (x) rural-urban migration. This analysis enhances our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and nature in shrimp farming systems and their evolving impacts on planetary health in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. The study stresses the urgent need for integrated, ecosystem-based agricultural practices to find a balance between economic benefits and sustainable health and environmental outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Asia, home to nearly 60% of the world's population, bears a substantial portion of the global cancer burden, making effective control strategies crucial. The 2017 WHO resolution on cancer prevention and control highlighted the importance of developing and implementing National Cancer Control Plans (NCCPs). We reviewed the current landscape of NCCPs in 21 countries of the Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance. We found marked variation in plan status across Asia, with frameworks ranging from comprehensive NCCPs to non-communicable disease plans that include cancer to no plans. Over 90% of plans included components for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention or cancer treatment. Air pollution, a critical and growing cancer risk factor in the region, was addressed in only 43% of plans, with most concentrated in middle-income countries. Treatment protocols were included in 91% of plans, but end-of-life care appeared in only 48%. Stakeholder involvement appeared in 86% of plans, but legal and evaluation mechanisms were less common (57% each). Locally adapted, comprehensive strategies addressing the continuum of care, from prevention to survivorship, supported by strong legal and financial governance structures and enhanced regional collaboration are essential for equitable cancer control.",

        "abstract": "Current strategies to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes focus primary prevention in high-risk groups and secondary prevention in people with known cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine the proportion of events occurring in lower-risk groups globally. We included people aged 40 years to younger than 75 years who were enrolled in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which is an ongoing, international, prospective, population-based cohort study that started recruiting adults from households selected to be broadly representative of the sociodemographic composition of their communities. We prospectively documented fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or any other fatal cardiovascular event stratified by history of cardiovascular disease and by the 10-year predicted disease risk scores based on WHO 2019 laboratory risk tables (<10% [low], 10% to <20% [intermediate], and ≥20% [high]) in people without previous cardiovascular disease from 26 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Outcome event rates were standardised for the cohort's age and sex distribution. Between July 11, 2000, and May 6, 2019, 128 973 participants were included from 26 countries (mean age 53·6 years [SD 8·2]; 75 858 [58·8%] were female and 53 115 [41·2%] were male). We observed 11 483 outcome events affecting 8·9% of the cohort during a median follow-up of 12·3 years (IQR 9·8-14·6). Among participants, 89 508 (69·4%) had a low cardiovascular disease risk, 22 363 (17·3%) had an intermediate cardiovascular disease risk, and 5529 (4·3%) had a high cardiovascular disease risk, while 11 573 (9·0%) had known cardiovascular disease. The age-standardised and sex-standardised cardiovascular disease incidence rates per 1000 person-years was 4·1 (95% CI 4·0-4·2) in the low-risk group, 17·7 (15·2-20·2) in the intermediate-risk group, and 40·8 (25·1-56·4) in the high-risk group. Overall, 41% of outcome events occurred in cardiovascular disease-naive participants at low risk. The proportion of adverse cardiovascular outcomes occurring in this low-risk group was inversely related to country income level (32% in high-income, 38% in middle-income, and 54% in low-income countries) and was higher in women (51%) than in men (32%). To achieve a substantial population-level reduction in cardiovascular disease, a fundamental change is needed, so that preventive strategies for cardiovascular disease extend beyond those at high or even intermediate predicted risk to include those at considered to be at low risk.

        "abstract": "<b>Aims/Background</b> Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and safety of thrice-weekly insulin degludec (IDeg 3TW) versus once-daily insulin glargine (IGlar OD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are scarce and not uniform. Moreover, no systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) is available for such a comparison. This SRM aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of IDeg 3TW versus IGlar OD in the available RCTs in T2DM. <b>Methods</b> Electronic databases and registers, which include MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane Central Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov, were searched for RCTs conducted among T2DM subjects with IDeg 3TW as intervention and IGlar OD as control from inception to 30 July 2024. The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction from baseline; secondary outcomes were the changes in other glycemic parameters and adverse events (AEs). RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR), or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). <b>Results</b> Three RCTs (N = 1171) with study durations ranging from 16-26 weeks and minimal risk of bias were included. IDeg 3TW was less effective than IGlar OD in HbA1c reduction (MD 0.27%, 95% CI [0.14, 0.39], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), reduction in mean nine-point self-monitored capillary blood glucose profile (MD 0.45 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.22, 0.67], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and HbA1c reduction <7% (OR 0.69, 95% [0.53, 0.89], <i>p</i> = 0.005). IDeg 3TW outperformed IGlar OD regarding the mean daily insulin dose (MD -0.07 U, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.01], <i>p</i> = 0.02). However, both groups achieved comparable fasting plasma glucose reduction (MD 0.37 mmol/L, 95% [-0.19, 0.93], <i>p =</i> 0.19), changes in body weight (MD 0.04 kg, 95% CI [-0.46, 0.55], <i>p =</i> 0.86), and overall physical (MD 0.21, 95% CI [-0.62, 1.04], <i>p</i> = 0.62) and mental health scores (MD -0.02, 95% CI [-1.05, 1.01], <i>p</i> = 0.97). The risks for confirmed hypoglycemia (RR 1.16, 95% CI [0.83, 1.62], <i>p</i> = 0.38), nocturnal hypoglycemia (RR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49, 2.84], <i>p</i> = 0.71), any AEs (RR 1.04, 95% CI [0.84, 1.30], <i>p</i> = 0.71), serious AEs (RR 1.43, 95% CI [0.77, 2.65], <i>p</i> = 0.25), and injection-site reactions (RR 1.29, 95% CI [0.56, 2.96], <i>p</i> = 0.55) were identical in the two groups. <b>Conclusion</b> In short-term follow-up, IDeg 3TW was less effective than IGlar OD in glycaemic control; however, their safety profile was comparable. Larger multicenter RCTs comparing the overall benefit-risk ratio are necessary for appropriate clinical practice decisions. <b>Systematic Review Registeration</b> PROSPERO: CRD42024593493.",

        "title": "Key Stakeholders' Perspectives on Acute Malnutrition Management Programs for Children Under Five in Bangladesh: Qualitative Insights.",
        "abstract": "Acute malnutrition (AM) in children under five is a significant global health concern. Community-based management of AM (CMAM) with provision of specially formulated foods (SFFs) is recommended for treating moderate (MAM) and uncomplicated severe (SAM) cases in outpatient settings. Integrating nutrition counseling and cooking demonstrations (NC&CD) into CMAM programs can improve caregiver knowledge and practices. In our parent trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of enhanced NC&CD without SFFs on MAM management. This study examines perceptions and understanding of CMAM among parents, healthcare providers (HCPs), and policymakers in both CMAM and no-CMAM areas. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants who were reflective and willing to share their experiences with the research team. Data collection involved 30 focus group discussions (FGDs), 34 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with parents, 28 key informant interviews (KIIs) with HCPs in Cox's Bazar, and 16 KIIs with policymakers in Dhaka. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo, guided by the concepts of the theoretical framework. Parents and HCPs generally valued CMAM for its SFFs, while parents in the MAM trial's intervention arm preferred NC&CD with incentives. Policymakers largely supported combining SFFs with NC&CD, though some advocated for NC&CD alone as a feasible approach. Challenges identified included workforce shortages, policy gaps, and insufficient prioritization. One-third of HCPs in CMAM areas and most HCPs and parents in no-CMAM areas favored NC&CD. The study highlights the need to continue NC&CD-based CMAM programs with incentives and recommends integrating NC&CD into CMAM guidelines to enhance caregiver awareness. Additionally, increased manpower, policy advocacy, strong government leadership, and preventive nutrition initiatives are warranted to ensure the sustainable effect of CMAM in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are effective medications for people with opioid use disorder; however, interruptions in daily dosing are common and diminish the benefits of these medications. While clinical guidelines in most North American jurisdictions, including British Columbia (BC), recommend dose adjustment after treatment interruptions to varying levels of specificity, the evidence to support these recommendations is limited. We aim to estimate the comparative effectiveness of alternative dose adjustment strategies on subsequent overdose-related acute care visits and discontinuation of opioid agonist treatment in BC, Canada. Using a linkage of nine health administrative databases, we propose a population-level retrospective cohort study of adults aged 18 years or older in BC who initiated methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2022. We will specify parallel hypothetical trials, known as target trials, for methadone interruptions of 1-3 days, 4 days and 5-14 days, and buprenorphine/naloxone interruptions of 1-5 days and 6-14 days. Following the index interruption, the primary outcomes are the time to overdose-related acute care visits and treatment discontinuation (interruptions lasting >14 days), with time to all-cause acute care visits as a secondary outcome. The intention-to-treat effect will be estimated using both propensity score and instrumental variable approaches. A range of sensitivity analyses will assess the robustness of our results, including cohort and timeline restriction, alternative definitions of exposure and outcome and alternative estimation strategies. The protocol, cohort creation and analysis plan have been classified and approved as a quality improvement initiative by Providence Health Care Research Institute and the Simon Fraser University Office of Research Ethics. All data are deidentified, securely stored and accessed in accordance with provincial privacy regulations. Results will be disseminated to local advocacy groups and decision-makers, national and international clinical guideline developers, presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals electronically and in print.",

This systematic review assesses AIVT's impact on care quality in primary care and outpatient settings, focusing on seven components: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, patient-centredness, timeliness, equity, and integration. A systematic search of five databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINHAL, Scopus) was conducted for studies published up to September 20, 2024. Studies were included if they assessed the use of AIVT for medical documentation in primary care or outpatient settings, compared to manual or non-AI documentation methods, and reported outcomes relevant to the seven quality components. A narrative synthesis was conducted; meta-analysis was unfeasible due to study heterogeneity. Of 1924 papers, nine studies were included (n = 524 healthcare professionals, n = 616 patients, 1069 consultations). Most (n = 7) were from the USA, with others in Bangladesh and the Philippines. All studies assessing effectiveness, patient-centredness, and efficiency (n = 9, 6, and 5, respectively) reported improvements, including faster documentation, reduced administrative burden, and enhanced patient-provider interaction. Safety findings were inconclusive; three of six studies raised concerns. Four studies highlighted seamless AIVT integration with Electronic Health Records, improving service timeliness. Three studies identified equity issues, referring to limited diversity and controlled simulation settings. AIVT tools enhance documentation efficiency and patient-centred care, but concerns over transcription errors and generalisability warrant further testing in large-scale, diverse real-world settings.

        "abstract": "People with disabilities experience significant health inequalities and barriers to healthcare access globally. While poverty alleviation interventions show promise for improving health outcomes, evidence specifically for people with disabilities remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a disability-inclusive graduation (DIG) programme on health outcomes among ultra-poor people with disabilities in Uganda. We conducted a two-arm, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial in four districts of Northern Uganda. Clusters were randomly assigned to either the DIG intervention (96 clusters) or control group (89 clusters). This analysis focused on households with people with disabilities, as identified by the Washington Group Short Set questions and verified by BRAC programme managers. Households in treatment clusters received up to 18 months DIG intervention between December 2020 and June 2022, combining asset transfers, cash support, skills training, financial inclusion activities, and disability-specific services including rehabilitation and assistive devices. The primary outcome was experience of illness/injury in the past 3 months, assessed at both first follow-up (immediately post-intervention) and second follow-up (about 16 months post-intervention), with secondary outcomes including unmet health needs, mental health status, unmet assistive product needs, and healthcare expenditure. Effects were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression or generalized estimating equations, reporting minimally-adjusted and fully-adjusted mean differences (FAMD) or odds ratios (FAOR) with 95% CIs. The trial was registered with RIDIE (RIDIE-STUDY-ID-626008898983a) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN-78592382). At baseline, 691 participants (370 intervention, 321 control) were included. The DIG intervention did not significantly impact overall illness/injury prevalence at either first follow-up (41.18% vs 45.86%, FAOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58-1.22) or second follow-up (55.65% vs 53.98%, FAOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74-1.56). However, the intervention demonstrated a progressively strengthening effect on reducing unmet health needs, from marginal improvement immediately post-intervention (FAOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.02, p = 0.06) to significant reduction at 16 months post-intervention (FAOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22-0.71, p = 0.002). Notably, the intervention produced temporal potential shifts in disease patterns, with malaria showing contrasting trends between follow-up periods. Sex-differentiated effects emerged by second follow-up, with females in the intervention group experiencing fewer injuries (FAOR for interaction 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.74, p = 0.02) but more pain-related conditions compared to males (FAOR for interaction 2.43, 95% CI 1.05-5.59, p = 0.04), though these subgroup findings require replication in future studies. No significant differences were observed in mental health outcomes or health expenditure. This first randomized evaluation of a disability-inclusive graduation programme demonstrates that while economic empowerment alone may not reduce overall illness prevalence among people with disabilities, it can progressively improve healthcare access over time. The temporal evolution of effects and emerging sex-differentiated impacts highlight the need for sustained support and gender-sensitive approaches in future disability-inclusive poverty reduction programmes, with additional health-specific components to achieve broader improvements in health outcomes.

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

        "abstract": "A novel ready-to-use microbiome-directed food (MDF) has been developed for the management of acute malnutrition using ingredients that promote repair of the gut microbiota of undernourished children. This study aims to assess the acceptability of MDF compared with standard nutritional care among children with acute malnutrition. Two randomized crossover trials consisting of 2 14-d periods of at-home consumption were conducted. Children aged 6 to <24 mo with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) or moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) were individually randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the sequence of receiving MDF then standard nutritional care, or vice versa. Standard nutritional care consisted of ready-to-use therapeutic food for SAM and ready-to-use supplementary food for MAM. The primary outcome was at-home acceptability, defined as the return of ≥75% of sachets empty after the 14-d at-home consumption period. The primary analysis was a noninferiority analysis, in which MDF was considered noninferior if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in at-home acceptability comparing MDF with standard nutritional care was within -20 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included caregiver's perception of the child's liking, as well as caregiver willingness to use in the future and preference between the 2 foods. In all, 128 children with SAM and 146 children with MAM were randomized. MDF was noninferior to standard nutritional care in terms of at-home acceptability among children with SAM (risk difference: -7.0; 95% CI lower bound: -11.6%) and among children with MAM (risk difference: -2.3%; 95% CI lower bound: -6.1%). There were no differences in caregiver willingness to use either food in future. MDF is acceptable for the management of acute malnutrition in children aged 6 to <24 mo in Niger and should be further tested in other populations with a high prevalence of acute malnutrition. Effectiveness of the novel food will be assessed in forthcoming trials. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05551819.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneity in definitions of severe infection, sepsis and serious bacterial infection (SBI) in infants limits the comparability of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of infection prevention interventions. To inform the design of infection prevention RCTs for infants in low-resource settings, we estimated the incidence of severe infection and death among Bangladeshi infants aged 0-60 days using variations in case definitions. Among 1939 infants born generally healthy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, severe infection was identified through up to 12 scheduled community health worker home visits from 0 to 60 days of age or through caregiver self-referral. The primary severe infection case definition combined physician documentation of standardised clinical signs and/or diagnosis of sepsis/SBI, plus either a positive blood culture or parenteral antibiotic treatment for ≥5 days. Incidence rates were estimated for the primary severe infection definition, the WHO definition of possible SBI, blood culture-confirmed infection and five alternative definitions including non-injury death. Severe infection incidence per 1000 infant-days was 1.2 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.4) using the primary definition, 0.84 (0.69 to 1.0) using the WHO definition of possible SBI, 0.026 (0.0085 to 0.081) using blood culture-confirmed infection and 0.061 (0.029 to 0.13) for death. One-third of cases met criteria for the primary severe infection definition through physician diagnosis of sepsis/SBI rather than the standardised clinical signs, and 85% of cases were identified following caregiver self-referral despite frequent scheduled visits. Severe infection incidence in infants varied considerably by case definition. Using a clinical sign-based definition may miss a substantial proportion of cases identified by physician diagnosis of sepsis/SBI. A consensus definition of severe infection in infants that balances permissiveness and stringency and can be operationalised in low-resource countries would improve the comparability of RCTs. If health facilities are accessible and caregivers readily seek care for infant illness, frequently scheduled home assessments may not be necessary.",

Therefore, this study aimed to isolate and characterize the multidrug-resistant E. coli harboring β-lactam resistance genes from raw Sonali chicken meat samples collected from retail poultry shops across six upazilas of the Narsingdi district in Bangladesh. A total of 390 meat swab samples were collected and analyzed between July and December 2023. E. coli was detected in 68.21% of the isolates, with 7.89% classified as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and 92.11% as non-EPEC. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion method revealed complete resistance to ampicillin (100%), with high resistance to erythromycin (87.59%) and third-generation cephalosporins. Furthermore, the lowest resistance was observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate (3.01%). ESBL production was identified in 41.73% of the isolates. On the other hand, non-EPEC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of ESBL production (p < 0.05). Genotypic analysis of β-lactamase genes in ESBL-positive isolates demonstrated that blaTEM (63.06%) and blaCTX-M-2a (60.36%) were the most prevalent. Additionally, co-occurrence of multiple β-lactamase genes was observed in 54.95% of isolates, with blaTEM, blaCTX-M-2a, and blaOXA-1 being the most common combination. Furthermore, resistance genes for AmpC (blaCMY, 27.07%) and metallo-β-lactamase (blaNDM-1, 9.02%) were exclusively detected in non-EPEC isolates. Significant positive correlations were observed among β-lactamase genes, highlighting the complexity of resistance mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the necessity of judiciously using antibiotics in Sonali chickens to prevent the emergence of resistant bacterial strains.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis, posing a critical challenge to healthcare systems, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), where multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) threaten patient survival. This study offers a unique, real-world perspective on AMR dynamics by analyzing 96 metagenomic samples from three key sources: oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of deceased ICU patients (both postadmission and antemortem), healthcare workers, and high-touch ICU surfaces. Findings revealed the ICU environment as a major AMR reservoir, with oropharyngeal swabs carrying the highest AMR burden. While healthcare staff facilitated MDRO spread, they were not primary sources. Staff microbiomes' MDRO pattern closely resembled environmental samples. Key AMR species included B. fragilis, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, with P. aeruginosa persisting on high-touch surfaces. Tetracycline resistance was the most prevalent, with common resistances comprising 36.1% of all detected AMR markers. Staff microbial community exhibited higher resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, and cephamycins. A 10-day survival threshold distinguished early (EM) and late mortality (LM) groups. EM patients exhibited unique AMR species in the oropharynx, suggesting respiratory-driven infections, while LM patients showed greater gut-associated resistance. Higher rectal AMR counts correlated with prolonged survival. Notably, four key MDROs (L. monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis, S. haemolyticus, and S. agalactiae) were enriched in sepsis patients, suggesting early risk markers. Fewer new resistances emerged in rectal than oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to antibiotic selection pressure. Vancomycin and levofloxacin, frequently co-administered, exerted stronger selective pressure in the oropharynx, possibly explaining the high MRSA prevalence in patient and environmental samples.",

        "abstract": "Maternity care satisfaction for pregnant women and recently delivered mothers is linked to both short- and long-term complications. For health care providers, dissatisfaction can lead to high turnover, reduced efficiency, and decreased service quality. Increased midwifery care coverage enhances satisfaction; however, the Government of Bangladesh-sanctioned midwife positions are limited to the primary health care level only, not extending to secondary or tertiary health tiers. We aimed to evaluate the impact of introducing midwifery care at secondary-level health care facilities in Bangladesh by comparing the satisfaction levels of both providers and patients with those receiving regular care. We conducted a quasi-experimental study from September 2021 to December 2023 at two secondary-level health facilities - Sunamganj District Hospital (DH) (intervention) and Khagrachari DH (control). The primary outcome was the mean (x̄) percentage score of maternal satisfaction with antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) services, along with providers' satisfaction regarding their working environment, training, logistical support, and overall patient and service satisfaction at both facilities. We screened for eligibility a total of 200 pregnant women or recently delivered mothers who visited the facility for ANC, delivery, or PNC services. The satisfaction scores were significantly higher among women who received midwifery care compared to those who received regular care. The scores were for ANC x̄ = 97.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 96.6-99.0) vs. x̄ = 71.0 (95% CI = 68.7-73.4), for delivery x̄ = 97.9 (95% CI = 97.4-98.3) vs. x̄ = 83.3 (95% CI = 80.2-86.3), and for PNC x̄ = 97.5 (95% CI = 96.5-98.4) vs. x̄ = 77.7 (95% CI = 73.8-81.6). Similarly, the satisfaction score among midwives was significantly higher than among providers in regular care facilities (x̄ = 88.7; 95% CI = 82.9-94.5 vs. x̄ = 77.7; 95% CI = 73.0-82.3).

        "abstract": "Stateless Rohingya children in Bangladesh's refugee camps, lacking citizenship or legal safeguards, face heightened risks of human rights abuses like child labor and early marriage. This qualitative study explored these challenges, comparing Rohingya and host community children, specifically regarding child labor and well-being. Conducted from February 23 to March 18, 2022, the research employed 20 in-depth interviews with children (aged 11-17) and 20 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) with stakeholders and leaders. Due to restrictions, child interviews relied on note-taking, while KIIs were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. A combination of convenience and purposive sampling methods was used to select participants. Findings revealed that child labor significantly harms well-being in both communities. Children's vulnerability makes them easy targets for exploitation through low wages and intimidation. Economic necessity frequently compels families to send children to work, severely impacting their education and development. Older boys (15-17 years) were more commonly engaged in paid work than girls. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation, increasing child labor in sectors like shop/restaurant assistance and driving three-wheelers. The KIIs identify specific types of labor, such as carrying goods, farming, and construction work, that were prevalent among children. Key drivers included illness of primary earners, lack of access to education, and children needing income for personal expenses. Hazardous tasks like handling gas cylinders or carrying heavy loads pose serious health risks, causing physical pain, injuries, and mental strain. KIIs further highlighted rampant camp issues like child marriage, trafficking, and other violence, disproportionately affecting girls. Urgent, comprehensive interventions are critical. Breaking this cycle requires collaborative stakeholder efforts to establish robust support systems encompassing education, healthcare, and legal protections. Without immediate action, these children's futures remain perilously at risk, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exploitation.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate TBS in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and clarify its role, considering gender and other confounders. Relevant studies were systematically searched until October 2024 using related terms across multiple databases. RevMan Web and R software were employed to conduct statistical analyses. Meta-analyses utilized random-effects models and the inverse variance statistical method; results were expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95 % confidence intervals. The primary outcome of interest was the MD in TBS (unadjusted or adjusted) between the T2DM and non-diabetes groups. Data from 27 studies with 16,354 subjects were analyzed. Compared to controls without diabetes, subjects with T2DM exhibited lower unadjusted TBS in the combined sex group (MD -0.10 [-0.18, -0.02], P = 0.01), as well as in men (MD -0.02 [-0.04, -0.00], P = 0.02) and women (MD -0.05 [-0.07, -0.03], P < 0.0001). Individuals with T2DM also had a lower adjusted TBS in the combined sex group (MD -0.16 [-0.24, -0.08], P < 0.0001), men (MD -0.02 [-0.04, -0.00], P = 0.02), and women (MD -0.04 [-0.06, -0.02], P = 0.0005). While lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was higher in individuals with T2DM than in those without across all three groups, total hip BMD was higher in women and the combined sex group; femoral neck BMD was higher only in the combined sex group. According to the data analyzed in this updated meta-analysis, T2DM appears to adversely affect TBS, despite having a positive effect on BMD; however, the evidence level is very low.

However, limited evidence is available on the effectiveness and practicality of gender and protection mainstreaming interventions in health response in humanitarian crises. The overall objective of the research was to explore practices, gaps, and challenges and generate recommendations regarding gender and protection mainstreaming in health response to the Rohingya refugee crisis in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The research employed a qualitative case study design to explore the practice of gender and protection mainstreaming in health response in Cox's Bazar. Data collection methods include an extensive literature review and in-depth interviews with professionals. The professionals interviewed from the area of health and protection, specifically gender, child protection, emergency health intervention, and primary health activities. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis related to gender and protection mainstreaming. Limitations were assessed as to researcher bias because the researcher did all the coding; however, an open recording process, inter-literature cross-potentiation, and ethical considerations of research helped add to the reliability of the research. Exclusion criteria were defined to ensure data consistency, removing insufficiently detailed responses not pertinent to the research objectives. The study found a range of good practices on gender and protection mainstreaming in health response, e.g., placement of a gender action plan, monitoring system for gender and disability inclusion, emergency preparedness and response system, availability of sex-segregated toilets and waiting spaces, availability of gender-based violence service and engagement of female community health workers. The study also revealed some best practices which have the potential to scale up, e,g. psychosocial spaces at health facilities for children, palliative care for terminally ill patients, integrated medical and protection services, and facilitation of community health facility support groups. Critical gaps were found in the areas of women's leadership, coordination, capacity building, targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, infrastructural adaptation and consultation with the community on their concerns. We urge policymakers, sector coordinators, health program management, healthcare workers, and global stakeholders to address the gaps and challenges, learn and scale up the best practices, and take action to implement the study's recommendations to maximise gender and protection mainstreaming in health response.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluates the current state of andrology practice worldwide, identifies challenges faced by clinicians, and explores training, certification, and research opportunities. It also seeks to redefine the qualifications necessary to be recognized as an andrologist and to propose areas for standardization and improvement. A global, cross-sectional survey was conducted using a 48-question online questionnaire designed by international experts. The survey, distributed in English, covered various domains of modern andrology practice. Responses from 405 participants across 59 countries were analyzed using R version 4.1.2, with categorical variables reported as frequencies and percentages. Among respondents, 47.3% held medical doctor (MD) degrees, with urologists (31.1%) and clinical andrologists (25.3%) being the most represented specialties. Formal, board-certified andrological training was reported as available in only 48.1% of countries. While half of the respondents identified as andrologists based on experience, only one-third did so through certification, obtained from diverse, nationally recognized organizations. The primary areas of practice included male infertility (36.7%), male sexual dysfunction (27.2%), and sexually transmitted infections (14.5%). Many participants were actively engaged in assisted reproductive technologies, imaging, and andrological surgical emergencies. Despite strong interest in clinical, basic, and translational research, respondents highlighted significant challenges, including inconsistent training pathways, insufficient certification standards, and the complexity of managing diverse andrological conditions. Andrology is an evolving multidisciplinary specialty where board-certified urologists, clinical andrologists, and reproductive medicine specialists collaborate to address male reproductive and sexual health challenges. Despite their advanced competencies in medical, surgical, and laboratory interventions, specialists face significant global disparities in training and certification. This survey highlights the urgent need for standardized training, evidence-based guidelines, and unified certification to ensure consistency, enhance patient care, and advance andrology's academic and clinical excellence worldwide.",

        "abstract": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the relationship between varicocele and sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) alongside conventional semen parameters. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted to identify articles on SDF in men with varicocele published in the Scopus and PubMed databases. This included observational studies investigating levels of SDF as a primary outcome and conventional semen parameters as secondary outcomes in men with varicocele compared to men without varicocele. Out of 476 retrieved articles, 40 met our inclusion criteria, with 35 included in our quantitative synthesis. Our analysis revealed that men with varicocele showed significantly higher SDF than men without varicocele (mean difference [MD] 15.34, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 9.74-20.9; p<0.001). The evaluation of SDF using different assays did not affect the results (p=0.7). Our results indicated a significant effect of varicocele on sperm concentration (MD -29 million/mL, 95% CI: -37, -21; p<0.001), total sperm count (MD -188 million/ejaculate, 95% CI: -325, -52; p=0.007), sperm vitality (MD -5.7%, 95% CI: -8.6, -2.8; p<0.001), total sperm motility (MD -17%, 95% CI: -29.0, -5.3; p=0.004), progressive sperm motility (MD -17%, 95% CI: -23,-11, p<0.001), normal sperm forms (MD -3.1%, 95% CI: -4.3, -1.8, p<0.001) and abnormal sperm forms (MD 2.25%, 95% CI: 0.77, 3.73; p=0.003). However, semen volume and the total motile sperm count were not significantly different between both groups (MD -113 million/ejaculate, 95% CI: -244.0, 18.1; p=0.09). Varicocele negatively impacts male fertility by increasing SDF. Our study supports using SDF analysis in patients with varicocele to aid clinicians in deciding on varicocele repair.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining an appropriate gap between childbirths is essential for promoting the health of both the mother and the child. This practice lowers the risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Inadequate birth spacing is a multifaceted issue linked to increase infant mortality and has the potential to impact the health and demographic landscape of the nation. This study aims to assess the prevalence of short birth spacing (SBS) in association with demographic and socio-economic factors in India with special reference to maternal and child health. This study investigated SBS in India using a cross-sectional design and data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The analysis included data from 636,699 households, encompassing 724,115 women and 139,660 birth intervals. The primary outcome was SBS, and secondary outcomes included maternal undernutrition, full antenatal care (ANC), low birth weight (LBW), infant mortality, and child mortality. The analysis incorporated demographic and socio-economic variables as explanatory factors for SBS. Data analysis was conducted after checking its normality. The data characteristics were summarised and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In India, SBS is more prevalent (50.8%) with a median of 32 months. Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have shortest spacing (27 months), while Lakshadweep has longest (63.9 months). The Central zone has highest SBS prevalence (53.8%), especially in rural areas (55.9%). SBS is significantly associated with lack of maternal education, younger maternal age, unwanted pregnancies, larger families, and poor wealth index. Additionally, it is found that the explanatory variables have a significant impact on SBS, with area under the curve (AUC) covering 68% to 71% (p < 0.001). Furthermore, SBS has a detrimental effect on maternal and child health as secondary outcomes. This study emphasizes the substantial influence of socio-demographic factors on the practice of SBS. It is crucial to provide educational programs for mothers that focus on the importance of birth spacing and using family planning services. The study highlights the need to implement economic development initiatives within families to address the factors contributing to inadequate birth spacing. These measures enhance maternal and child health and align with the SDGs in India.",

        "abstract": "The rate of caesarean sections (C-sections) is increasing globally, with many procedures being performed without clinical indication. We aimed to explore whether implementing the eight antenatal care visits that include health education and four ultrasonographic examinations (intervention group (IG)) recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) would reduce unnecessary C-sections among Bangladeshi pregnant women in comparison to the usual four antenatal care and two ultrasonogram exams (comparison group (CG)) currently in use within the country's healthcare system. We designed a randomised controlled trial that included two tertiary and two non-tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. The randomisation was done at the hospital level, whereby we randomly allocated the hospitals to the IG or CG, with one tertiary and one non-tertiary hospital in each arm. We conducted this trial between November 2021 and December 2022. Pregnant women of all ages without any complications requiring C-sections were enrolled in the allocated IG and CG hospitals. The primary outcome was the reduction in the number of unnecessary C-sections. We considered unnecessary C-sections when there was no proper indication for caesarean delivery. Alongside descriptive analysis, we used adjusted log-linear regression models to investigate the relationship between unnecessary C-sections and various contributing factors. We enrolled 288 pregnant women from two intervention and two comparison hospitals, with 144 assigned to the IG and 144 to the CG (72 from each hospital). There were 183 complete, successful deliveries in total (50.27% in IG vs. 49.73% in CG; P = 0.903). Of these, 106 resulted in C-sections (39.62% in IG and 60.38% in CG; P = 0.001), with 70 assessed as being necessary (47.14% in IG and 52.86% in CG; P = 0.027) and 36 as being unnecessary (25% in IG and 75% in CG). There were significantly fewer unnecessary C-sections among the women in the IG (P = 0.027), who also had a significantly lower risk ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence interval = 0.54-0.77, P < 0.001) compared to the CG. Our findings indicate that the WHO-recommended antenatal visits and their interventions were effective in reducing unnecessary C-sections by 50%. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05135026.",

        "abstract": "Despite the global burden of stunting, data regarding the determinants of stunting observed on follow-up after discharge from health care facilities among children treated for severe diarrhoea are limited. We investigated factors influencing stunting during post-discharge follow-up among under-2 children treated for severe diarrhoea. We developed a predictive model to estimate stunting prevalence and identify risk factors without post-discharge anthropometry. We analysed data from two sites in Bangladesh participating in the multi-country, double-blind, randomised clinical trial on Antibiotics for Children with Severe Diarrhoea among children aged 2-23 months, from 2017 to 2019. Severe diarrhoea was defined as a child who had acute diarrhoea with severe/some dehydration, or moderate wasting, or severe stunting on admission. Multiple linear regression was constructed to predict the independent factors associated with stunting among the enrolled children who were followed for 180 days after hospital discharge. We developed a predictive model for stunting using 75% of the available data for training, with the remaining 25% reserved as a test set to evaluate model performance. We then applied this predictive model to the children not enrolled in the trial but admitted to the hospital for diarrhoea to estimate the predictive prevalence and determinants of post-discharge stunting at 180 days. Of the 1431 enrolled children, 589 (41.2%) were stunted at enrolment. By day 180, stunting increased to 698 (49.3%). Linear growth of diarrhoeal children over this follow-up period was positively associated with enrolment length-for-age z score (LAZ), maternal body mass index (BMI), maternal education, duration of diarrhoea, and breastfeeding. We applied the predictive model developed on the enrolled patients' data to the 33 341 children admitted for diarrhoea but not enrolled in the trial. The model estimated that 6142 children (18.4%) in this non-follow-up group would have been stunted at 180 days. Persistent stunting at 180 days for these not-followed children was predicted to be positively associated with dehydration on admission and a higher number of children in the household, while a negative association was predicted with formal parental education and increased maternal BMI. Our study highlights the need for targeted interventions to mitigate persistent stunting in this vulnerable group recovering from diarrhoea.",

        "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown beneficial effects on clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or minimally reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to consolidate evidence from RCTs assessing the effects of GLP-1 RAs in HFpEF and HF with reduced ejection fraction. Several databases were searched comprehensively for relevant RCTs. A Bayesian NMA was conducted using R, and meta-regression was employed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Statistical significance was evaluated using 95% credible intervals (CrIs) and surface under the cumulative ranking curve to rank treatment effectiveness. The primary outcome was hospitalization for HF (HHF). Eight reports from 6 Phase 3 RCTs (N = 24 099), mostly with low risks of bias, were included. Compared to placebo, semaglutide reduced the risk of HHF (HR 0.52, 95% CrI [0.25, 0.87]), while tirzepatide (HR 0.51, 95% CrI [0.16, 1.24]) and exenatide (HR 0.82, 95% CrI [0.33, 1.73]) demonstrated no effect. Semaglutide and exenatide, but not tirzepatide, reduced the risk of all-cause mortality. None affected cardiovascular mortality. Semaglutide decreased the risk of worsening of HF events; tirzepatide did not. Tirzepatide and semaglutide enabled weight loss; however, only semaglutide notably enhanced the 6-minute walk distance. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values, tirzepatide ranked highest for reducing HHF and body weight, semaglutide for decreasing cardiovascular mortality and worsening of HF events and improving the 6-minute walk distance, and exenatide for reducing all-cause mortality. GLP-1 RAs provide significant benefits for patients with HFpEF or HFmrEF, with semaglutide offering more advantages than tirzepatide and exenatide.",

        "abstract": "The Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) Framework has been instrumental in helping countries plan and monitor maternal health services for over 20 years. Given evolving health systems, the changing expectations of both patients and health providers, and the expanded evidence base, the \"Re-Visioning EmONC\" project was initiated to update this framework to better meet countries' needs. To understand the needs of its primary intended users, the project used human-centered design (HCD) to conduct in-depth studies in three countries with extensive experience using the EmONC Framework: Bangladesh, Malawi, and Senegal. The study employed HCD methods to conduct interviews, focus groups, and consultative workshops with 337 participants (e.g., health managers, health providers, and service users) across the three countries. Each country team developed their own themes to explore within the boundaries of the overall Re-Visioning EmONC project's global objectives and developed unique generative activities based on the primary research questions and the category of participants. Multi-stage data analysis was conducted using affinity diagrams and either atlas.ti or Nvivo. Seven key cross-country insights emerged that together can be summarized as follows: when health systems fail, the burden of accessing and providing EmONC shifts to individuals - women, families, and health providers - who must improvise solutions, leading not only to poor quality of care, but also to huge out of pocket expenses, poor wellbeing and a profound mistrust in each other and in the system. The insights informed revisions to the EmONC Framework, including enhanced guidance on context-specific planning, new indicators for facility readiness, incorporation of workforce wellbeing, and increased focus on integrated maternal-newborn care. The HCD approach enabled meaningful integration of user perspectives into the revised EmONC Framework. The revised framework provides a roadmap for strengthening health systems and improving outcomes for women with obstetric complications and small and sick newborns.",

        "abstract": "Evidence regarding the impact of the private health sector on healthcare outcomes is often fragmented. Knowledge gaps remain around the impact of private sector care on health outcomes. This systematic review examines the quality of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care delivery by private sector providers. The review aims to systematically assess the evidence from studies reporting outcome data on morbidity and mortality among mothers, newborns, and children. Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, EconLit, Excerpta Medica Database, International Bibliography of the Social Science, Popline, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) and two websites and supplemented with hand-searches and expert recommendations. We conducted the searches and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA method. For inclusion, studies in low- and middle-income countries must have examined at least one of the following primary outcomes: maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, newborn morbidity, newborn mortality, child morbidity, or child mortality. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 46 studies included, most studies were conducted in India, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Kenya. Thirty-six studies were quantitative, and over one-third implemented a specific intervention that went beyond the broad delivery of quality care in the private sector. Studies indicated that the outcomes of private sector delivery of MNCH care across health systems were mixed. Studies frequently reported on the utilization of health facilities for the treatment of morbidities. Interventions to improve MNCH care included improved coverage and contracting services, community-based training, and public-private partnerships. Studies often did not provide greater contextual detail, including the complexities and realities of people seeking care across provider types. Future research should disaggregate data on quality of care, as well as describe the methods and specific facility details in their sample.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide, hypertension is more prevalent among men aged 30 and older, but a national survey from Bangladesh shows a different trend. This paper explores the differences in hypertension by sex and age among the Bangladeshi adult population throughout their life span. We conducted the secondary analysis using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. This nationally representative survey involved a two-stage stratified sample of 675 households in urban (250) and rural (425) enumeration areas (EAs). The analytical sample comprised 12 476 individuals aged 18 or older (6955 women and 5521 men). We performed univariate and bivariate tests to investigate variations in hypertension across sex, age, and other factors. We applied multivariable logistic regression models and logit-based marginal probabilities to explore age and sex differences as well as their interactions in hypertension while estimating the marginal effects of sex for each age group to assess the significance of sex differentials in hypertension throughout the life course. Our study revealed a noteworthy trend: Women have a hypertension prevalence that is five percentage points lower than that of men in their early twenties. However, this trend reverses in their early thirties, with women exhibiting a five-percentage point higher prevalence than men. After adjusting for confounders and age-sex interactions in women, the odds of hypertension were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.6) in the 35-39-year-old age group, which may contribute to a combined burden of chronic and reproductive morbidity. With rising hypertension and stagnant maternal health in Bangladesh, women of reproductive age face higher risks of chronic and reproductive complications. The complex health system in Bangladesh, which starts at the community level, primarily focuses on maternal and child health; however, some recent initiatives show a shift in focus to address significant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through public health facilities. Considering that more women seek health care from public facilities, recognising common factors contributing to early hypertension in Bangladeshi women enables targeted interventions, model testing, and strategic adjustments to the primary health care-focused national non-communicable disease management pathway.",

Peace Winds Japan and Dhaka Community Hospital Trust have jointly operated a primary health center (PHC) at Camp 14 in this region since 2018. Our objective was to determine the effect of Ramadan on clinical visits at this PHC during 2020. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient data, including diagnoses and use of medications, by review of medical records from January to December 2020. We compared the percentage of visits for five health events (acute respiratory infection [ARI], non-communicable disease [NCD], gastritis, female related issues, and injury) for three consecutive 31-day periods: before Ramadan period (BR-period), Ramadan period, and after Ramadan period (AR-period). There were 11,286 PHC visits during 2020. The rate of new patient visits was significantly lower during Ramadan than during the BR-period (aOR: 0.447; 95%CI: 0.356, 0.561; P < 0.001). The three periods had no significant differences in mean patient age, patient sex, or surgical procedures. The most noteworthy differences were fewer visits for NCD during Ramadan than during the BR-period (OR: 0.461; 95%CI: 0.307, 0.693; P < 0.0004); more visits for gastritis during Ramadan than during the BR-period (OR: 1.246; 95%CI: 1.106,1.404; P = 0.0019); and more visits for ARI during Ramadan than during the AR-period (aOR: 1.842; 95%CI: 1.567, 2.164, P < 0.0001). The overall decrease in PHC visits during Ramadan relative to the BR-period may be because these refugees devoted more time to prayer and associated religious practices during Ramadan, and therefore had less time available for visiting the PHC. The sharp decline in PHC visits for NCD and several other health events during Ramadan relative to the BR-period highlights the need to provide improved care for refugees during this period.",

Despite the increasing emphasis on PHC investment, securing sustainable public financing remains a significant challenge in the countries of the South-East Asia (SEA) Region. This study provides an overview of PHC financing arrangements in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Maldives, and Nepal, highlighting key challenges in these four countries. Data sources included the document review (87 documents included across the four countries) and key informant interviews (21 in total). Findings highlight the diverse approaches to PHC financing across the four countries, bringing out common and country-specific challenges. Our findings suggest that while PHC has been receiving more attention in policy agendas, underlying PHC financing functions still face many challenges.

        "abstract": "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), a significant cause of female infertility, involves premature ovarian dysfunction before the age of 40 and is influenced by genetic predispositions, autoimmune disorders, environmental factors, and metabolic changes. In this study, we employed Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to explore genetic variations linked to POI in Bangladeshi women. This study encompassed 30 Bangladeshi women aged 16 to 40 diagnosed with POI. The diagnosis was based on clinical criteria, including elevated Follicle-Stimulating Hormone levels and a history of at least four months of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. WES was performed on POI cases and used population specific internal cohort to filter out and identify genes impacting ovarian function. Subsequently, Sanger Sequencing was used to validate pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. We detected seven pathogenic variants in 23% of all POI cases (7/30) across six genes: Thyroglobulin (TG), Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Receptor (TSHR), tubulin beta 8 class viii (TUBB8), PR/SET domain 9 (PRDM9), required for meiotic nuclear division 1 homolog (RMND1), and homologous recombination factor with OB-fold (HROB). Two novel likely pathogenic variants were identified, including a heterozygous frameshift variant in TG (p.H209Pfs11) and a heterozygous missense variant in TSHR (p.T1904C). Additionally, variants of uncertain significance were found in 63% (19/30) of the cases, with seven being novel. Incidental findings of pathogenic variants were observed in several genes, with Hemoglobin subunit Beta (HBB) being the most common. This study highlights the utility of whole exome sequencing in identifying genetic risk factors for POI, suggesting that incorporating genetic screening into routine clinical practice could improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, particularly in regions lacking genomic data on this condition.",

        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses through effective pain management with opioids. Despite its global importance, opioid use in palliative care faces significant challenges, particularly in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, opioid use is notably low, with disparities between urban and rural areas. Cultural stigmas, strict regulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training further obstruct effective pain management. This study aims to explore the challenges healthcare providers face regarding opioid use in both hospital and home-based palliative care settings. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using face-to-face semistructured interviews with 135 licensed healthcare providers from August to September 2022. The respondents, predominantly young (57% aged 20-39) and female (68.9%), primarily manage late-stage cancer patients (98.5%), with pain (100%) being the primary symptom treated. Morphine syrup is commonly used (68.1%), whereas oxycodone and buprenorphine are unavailable. Side effects such as deep sedation (43.7%) and addiction (34.1%) highlight the need for careful monitoring. Limited awareness (10.4%) of national opioid policies results in inconsistent practices (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Prescribing restrictions (60.7%) and dispensing rights issues contribute to operational challenges, affecting patient access to pain management. Misconceptions about palliative care (32.6%) and inter-departmental non-cooperation (38.5%) hinder patient referrals (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and continuity of care. Inconsistent awareness of opioid policies causes varied practices and attitudes. Addressing referral challenges and prescribing restrictions requires interdisciplinary solutions, enhanced education, better policy dissemination, and standardized guidelines for effective palliative care opioid management.",

        "title": "Awareness about cervical cancer and its socio-economic determinants among adults in Bangladesh: Results from a nationwide cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health issue now and is the second leading cancer among women in Bangladesh, caused primarily by Human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite effective vaccination and screening methods, awareness and access to preventive methods are limited in developing regions. This nationwide study aims to explore socio-economic and cultural factors affecting cervical cancer awareness in Bangladesh and generate evidence-based recommendations for tailoring suitable health promotion strategies for the country. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to evaluate cervical cancer awareness among adults aged 18 years and above. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed for this research, keeping in mind the local sociocultural contexts. Face-to-face interviews were conducted after getting the participants' consent and making sure they understood all the questions. After checking for data quality and consistency, responses of 2,151 participants were finally retained. The collected data was analyzed using STATA (Version 17) statistical software. The majority (80.15%) of the participants were aware of cervical cancer, with healthcare workers being the primary source of information. Higher awareness rates were noted among married individuals (80.88%), urban dwellers (83.24%), those with more education (average 11.96 ± 4.36 years), individuals with higher income (88.17%), and those belonging to nuclear families (82.86%). Healthcare professionals had significantly greater awareness (98.91%) compared to other occupations. Participants undergoing regular health checkups were more informed and the association was statistically significant (87.03%, p < 0.001). Univariate and multiple logistic regression models revealed that each additional year of education increased the probability of being aware by 16-20%. Men had significantly lower odds of being aware compared to women (Adjusted Odds Ratio AOR = 0.41, β = -0.895, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.70, p = 0.001 in the multiple logistic regression analysis). Similarly, respondents not cohabitating with their spouse were less aware than those who were living with partners (AOR = 0.47, β = -0.750, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.81, p = 0.006). Income levels conversely influenced awareness level, participants from the highest income group (earning 35,001-50,000 BDT) had 47% lower odds (AOR = 0.53, β = -0.629, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.80, p = 0.002) of awareness compared to the lowest income group (earning ≤20,000 BDT). Despite the widespread awareness of cervical cancer among most Bangladeshi adults, there remains a notable gap, particularly among certain demographics. Since the study identified healthcare workers, social media, and mass media as major sources of information, targeted educational campaigns through media channels and outreach activities by healthcare workers might effectively enhance nationwide awareness of cervical cancer.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the demographic, temporal, and spatial characteristics of animal bite (AB) cases in humans across 12 Upazilas within Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Retrospective hospital-based data from individual AB cases for 2022 and 2023 were collected from S.K Hospital. The dataset included information on victim demographics, bite details, vaccination information, and Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) administration. Additionally, monthly case counts from 2016 to 2024 were sourced and analyzed to identify trends. Descriptive statistics and time series analysis using the seasonal decomposition technique were conducted. Risk maps for animal bites in 2022 and 2023 were generated using a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) approach. An almost two-fold increase in the proportion of category 3 bites receiving RIG from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% in 2023 was noted. Only 9.7% (2022) and 16.9% (2023) of bite victims received PEP on the day of exposure, whereas 76.5% (2022) and 84.6% (2023) received PEP within 24 hours. Moreover, significant seasonal patterns and annual increasing trends in AB cases were observed. Males and children under 14 years old had a higher risk of being bitten. Dogs (48.2% in 2022) and cats (52.6% in 2023) were identified as the primary animals responsible for the bites. Notably, the legs were the body part most frequently bitten. The bites risk map identified four high risk Upazilas. Despite improvements in PEP coverage achieved within 24 hours, a critical gap remains in same-day PEP coverage in both years. The study results also suggest other potential improvements in healthcare practices or treatment protocols, and the need for a veterinary surveillance system. Increasing AB cases highlight the need to enhance surveillance and control measures. Targeted awareness campaigns tailored to high-risk groups such as males and children under 14 years of age, along with preventive programs focused on dogs are imperative. Coordinated One Health efforts among healthcare professionals, veterinarians, policymakers, and community stakeholders are crucial to effectively mitigate the incidence of AB cases, safeguarding public health and eliminate dog mediated rabies by 2030 in the region.",

        "abstract": "Beinaglutide, a short-acting glucagon-like polypeptide-1 receptor agonist, has shown variable efficacy in weight reduction and metabolic control in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To summarize the therapeutic effects of beinaglutide in patients with overweight/obesity with/without type 2 diabetes. RCTs involving patients receiving beinaglutide in the intervention arm and placebo or active comparator in the control arm were searched through multiple electronic databases. The change from baseline in body weight was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, glycemic parameters, lipids, and adverse events (AEs). RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as mean differences (MDs), odds ratios (ORs), or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Six RCTs (<i>n</i> = 800) with mostly some concerns about the risk of bias were included. Over 12-24 weeks, beinaglutide 0.1-0.2 mg thrice daily was superior to the control group in reducing total (MD = -3.25 kg, 95%CI: -4.52 to -1.98, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 84%, <i>P</i> < 0.00001) and percent (MD = -4.13%, 95%CI: -4.87 to -3.39, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 54%, <i>P</i> < 0.00001) body weight reduction. Beinaglutide also outperformed the control group in achieving weight loss by 5% (OR 4.61) and 10% (OR = 5.34). The superiority of beinaglutide <i>vs</i> the control group was also found in reducing BMI (MD = -1.22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95%CI: -1.67 to -0.77) and WC (MD = -2.47 cm, 95%CI: -3.74 to -1.19]). Beinaglutide and the control group had comparable impacts on blood pressure, glycemic parameters, insulin resistance, hepatic transaminases, and lipid profile. Beinaglutide posed higher risks of treatment discontinuation due to AEs (RR = 3.15), nausea (RR = 4.51), vomiting (RR = 8.19), palpitation (RR = 3.95), headache (RR = 2.87), and dizziness (RR = 6.07) than the control. However, the two groups had identical risks of total and serious AEs, diarrhea, fatigue, and hypoglycemia. Short-term data from RCTs suggested that beinaglutide causes modest benefits in reducing body weight, BMI, and WC, with no significant difference in glycemic and other metabolic endpoints compared to the control arm. Safety data were consistent with those of the other drugs in the glucagon-like polypeptide-1 receptor agonist class. Larger RCTs are warranted to prove the longer-term metabolic benefits of beinaglutide.",

We undertook this meta-analysis, as, to date, no meta-analysis has holistically analysed the potential benefits and safety of SGLT2i in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with MI who received SGLT2i in the intervention arm (initiated within 2 weeks of the index event) and placebo/active comparator in the control arm. The primary outcome was to evaluate the impact on cardiovascular death, all-cause death and HHF.

However, global health researchers often face structural and operational barriers that limit meaningful stakeholder engagement. We present a practical model developed by a global respiratory health research programme implemented in four low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) - Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan. The model centred on designating in-country stakeholder engagement champions - locally based professionals with strong communication skills and contextual understanding of the health system and stakeholders. These champions were supported through mentorship, peer exchange, and capacity-building activities delivered by a central community and stakeholder engagement platform comprising experts and researchers. The champions had autonomy to design context-specific engagement strategies, allocate resources, and lead interactions with stakeholders throughout the research lifecycle. This decentralised approach enabled tailored engagement, fostered south-south learning, and created leadership opportunities for LMIC researchers. Despite successes, challenges included managing power imbalances, limited institutional capacity, and increased workloads. The model offers a promising approach for advancing equitable partnerships and local leadership in global health research, aligning with broader efforts to decolonise global health and promote meaningful, context-driven stakeholder engagement.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains high in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, driven by preventable causes such as inadequate health care access and delays in receiving care in health facilities, highlighting the need for improved support in health facilities. This study aimed to explore the opportunities and difficulties of introducing 'Welcome Persons', a hospital navigation and support cadre for pregnant women, from the perspectives of recipients, patients' attendance, health care providers, and facility managers. This qualitative study was conducted from 15 March to 30 April 2023, in the District Hospital of Gaibandha, Bangladesh. Data were collected through purposive sampling from health care providers, facility managers, 'Welcome Persons', pregnant and delivered women, and their attendants, utilising observations, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews, and analytical approaches to ensure scientific rigour. Thematic analysis was performed. The study revealed the positive influence of 'Welcome Person' in maternal health care provision by ensuring timely services, preventing outsiders' interference, as well as contributing to prompt emergency management, specifically for educationally disadvantaged patients. The triangulated perspectives of the participants highlighted the overall acceptance and usefulness of the 'Welcome Persons' but also discovered challenges such as a lack of human resources on the night shift, logistical constraints, and potential gender insensitivity by the recipients. The study findings provided an explicit understanding of the 'Welcome Persons' intervention for facilitating maternal health care services and navigation among pregnant women. While they were well-received, addressing identified barriers is crucial for a sustainable positive impact on maternal health care in secondary health facility settings in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Inequities in pediatric health care services persist in Bangladesh, with critical disparities between public and private hospitals, particularly for children younger than 5 years. These disparities hinder progress toward equitable health care access and quality outcomes. To evaluate the availability and quality of health care workforce and service coverage for children younger than 5 years in public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to identify gaps in infrastructure, workforce distribution, and adherence to pediatric care standards. This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 13, 2023, to May 24, 2024. Data collection included facility assessments, structured questionnaires, and direct observations using World Health Organization (WHO)-adapted tools. The study covered both private and public hospitals across 6 subdistricts in Bangladesh, representing a mix of urban and rural populations. Senior hospital staff and administrators were surveyed. Inclusion criteria were general inpatient and outpatient pediatric care delivered in hospitals. Diagnostic centers and specialized facilities were excluded. Availability of pediatric infrastructure, workforce, essential medications, and adherence to clinical guidelines assessed against WHO standards. The primary outcomes included the presence of pediatric-specific departments, neonatal care facilities, and trained personnel and adherence to WHO care standards. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests to highlight disparities. The study sample included 102 private and 7 public hospitals. A significantly higher proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals had pediatric inpatient departments (100% vs 39.2%), newborn wards (100% vs 12.8%), and trained nurses (100% vs 32.4%). Only private hospitals in the sample had neonatal intensive care units (6.9% vs 0%). Pediatricians were available for extended consultations at a greater proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals (71.4% vs 26.5%). These findings show substantial disparities in the availability of pediatric health care services between public and private hospitals in Bangladesh. Addressing these disparities through workforce investment and infrastructure improvements is crucial for equitable child health care and better health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The gastrointestinal (GI) system is fundamental to human health, supporting digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. Disruptions in GI function, such as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and gastrointestinal polyps, can lead to significant health complications if not diagnosed and managed early. However, manual interpretation of endoscopic images is time-consuming and prone to human error, highlighting the need for automated diagnostic tools. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive dataset of 24,036 high-quality endoscopic images, categorized into four classes: GERD, GERD Normal, Polyp, and Polyp Normal. This dataset is designed to facilitate research in automated detection and classification of these conditions through machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of 4006 primary images collected following endoscopic procedures, which were augmented using six distinct techniques, expanding the total number of images to 24,036. It includes 5844 images of GERD cases (974primary images), 6618 images of GERD Normal (1103 primary images), 4674 images of Polyps (779 primary images), and 6900 images of Polyp Normal (1150 primary images). These images, pre-processed and resized to a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels, were obtained from Zainul Haque Sikder Women's Medical College & Hospital (Pvt.) Ltd. and saved in JPG format. This dataset addresses a critical gap in the availability of large, diverse, and well-labelled medical image datasets for training AI-driven healthcare solutions. It provides an invaluable resource for developing machine learning models aimed at the automatic diagnosis, classification, and detection of GERD and polyps, potentially improving the speed and accuracy of clinical decision-making. By leveraging this dataset, researchers can contribute to enhanced diagnostic tools that could significantly improve healthcare outcomes and patient quality of life in the field of gastroenterology.",

        "abstract": "Floods exacerbate the vulnerability of rural communities with limited resources, while their impacts extend to nearby urban centres through interconnected socio-economic and infrastructural systems. Understanding these vulnerabilities is critical for mitigating disaster risks. Previous studies often overlooked the essential connections between rural and urban regions. This research examines how rural-urban connections change following a flood event, what factors influence these interactions, and how they contribute to the vulnerability of rural areas after a flood in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The study employed convenience and snowball sampling techniques to select 35 respondents with relevant disaster management and recovery expertise. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and personal observations to ensure a diverse range of participants' responses. The thematic data analysis method was chosen to highlight the significance of participants' experiences. The study findings revealed that the rural population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province heavily depends on nearby cities for essential resources and services (food, healthcare, and employment opportunities) significantly when local resources are depleted due to flooding. Floods caused serious repercussions to the rural-urban linkages through people (e.g., human mobility patterns, evacuation and displacement, and migration), information (early warning signals, post-disaster information support, financial aid coordination and technical assistance for reconstruction, health and sanitation management, logistics and supply chain restoration), Finance (resources inflow, and insurance coverage), and goods and relief services (urban areas as coordination hubs for disaster response, service delivery and specialized support systems, long-term recovery and resilience building, and economic interdependence and systemic vulnerabilities). However, this dependence diminishes when villages become self-reliant in accessing information, credit, goods, and market services. Rural areas are more vulnerable due to their weaker infrastructure, limited institutional capacity, and dependence on natural resources. In contrast, urban areas encounter challenges such as overcrowding, resource allocation, and maintaining service continuity when accommodating displaced populations. This study also identifies the primary attributes, including social (demography-population size, age, gender, health status, education, and social networks), economic (income levels and rural-urban connectivity, occupational sector and interaction patterns, income inequality and migration dynamics, occupation-specific vulnerability profiles), Institutional (strengthening rural-urban resilience to floods, local governance and flood risk management initiatives, enhancing emergency response and community preparedness, institutional coordination and disaster risk reduction strategies, leveraging technology and early warning systems) and environmental dimensions (river bodies, soil quality, erosion level, and water availability) which also affected the influence of rural-urban connections and their vulnerability to flood events across the selected districts. The current study findings offer important insights for policymakers to create integrated flood risk management strategies that strengthen rural infrastructure, improve early warning systems, and expand financial inclusion, stressing the significance of coordinated rural-urban disaster planning to direct displacement, guarantee fair resource allocation, and foster long-lasting resilience.",

As mothers are considered to be the primary caregivers, they bear the responsibility of administering medications to their children. We aimed to evaluate maternal perceptions along with the barriers and facilitators in play that are affecting ORS administration among children in Bangladesh. The study was conducted at Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh through a qualitative approach. In-depth Interviews (IDIs) were conducted on thirty-one mothers of under-5 children reporting to the hospital from February to April 2024. Qualitative content analysis method was used to describe and analyse the transcribed data. The mothers held several misconceptions regarding the administration of ORS. Majority of the participants thought their child could receive ORS through their breastmilk, which was an interesting finding. Along with this, mothers also lacked proper understanding regarding ORS preparation, storage, and use. Some of the key barriers were the lack of proper knowledge, motivation, and compliance, along with misdirection from the elders and pharmacy drug sellers. Additional key facilitators to ORS use were trust towards doctors, positive attitude towards learning about ORS, community education, instructions written on the packet, and support from the healthcare providers. A focused approach should be implemented to educate mothers on the correct preparation and administration of ORS for children, while also addressing and dispelling any misconceptions.",

However, no validated stigma scales exist for use across outbreaks, and outbreak-specific scales are developed too slowly to guide timely interventions. To enable more real-time monitoring and mitigation of stigma across outbreak contexts, we developed and validated the (Re)-emerging and ePidemic Infectious Diseases (RAPID) Stigma Scales. Field testing and psychometric validation were conducted in communities affected by Ebola disease in Uganda, mpox in the UK, and Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh. Content validity was established through cognitive interviews and expert Delphi scoring. 1008 respondents were included across the three countries. The final RAPID Community Stigma Scale (12 items) captures initial social stigma, provider or authority-related stigma, structural stigma, and enduring social stigma. The RAPID Self Stigma Scale (4 items) is unidimensional. Both scales were found to have robust psychometric properties, including content validity, structural validity (factor loadings ≥0·6), and reliability (ordinal alphas 0·79-0·92). High scores on both scales predicted an increased hesitancy to report symptoms and seek care. The RAPID Stigma Scales are validated tools for real-time assessment of stigma across outbreak settings, enabling responders to design targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and promote equitable care.",

        "abstract": "Multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) in pregnancy reduces risk of infant low birthweight (LBW) and improves other maternal and infant outcomes compared with iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements alone. However, the impact of timing of initiation and adherence on the MMS effectiveness in real-world programs remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a 2-stage individual participant data meta-analysis that included 15 randomized trials (61,204 pregnant women) and assessed whether the relative effect of MMS differed by the following: adherence alone; adherence in combination with gestational age at initiation; and the total number of tablets taken. We also evaluated the observational association of these factors with outcomes among participants who received MMS. Compared with IFA supplements, the relative effect of MMS on the primary outcome of continuous birthweight was greater with higher adherence (P-interaction < 0.05). Among women who took ≥90% of supplements, MMS increased birthweight by 56 g (95% CI: 45, 67 g), whereas among women who took <60% of supplements, there was no difference in birthweight between MMS and IFA supplements [mean difference (MD): 9 g; 95% CI: -17, 35 g). Higher adherence was also associated with greater effect of MMS on LBW and birthweight-for-gestational age centile and women who took more supplements experienced a greater relative impact of MMS on birthweight-for-gestational age centile and small-for-gestational age births (SGA) as compared with IFA supplements. Observational analyses among participants who received MMS showed that ≥90% adherence was associated with increased birthweight (MD: 44 g; 95% CI: 31, 56 g) and lower risk of LBW [relative risk (RR): 0.93 g; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 g] and small-for-gestational age (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), whereas <75% adherence was associated with greater risk of stillbirth (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.83) and maternal anemia (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43) than 75%-90% adherence.

The Specific Treatment of Problems of the Spine (STOPS) approach offers individualised, biopsychosocial-based physiotherapy shown to be effective in Australia. This trial aims to evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the STOPS approach to individualised physiotherapy compared to usual physiotherapy care in Bangladesh. A three-phase prospective sequential comparison trial will be conducted with eligible participants aged 18-65 years presenting for physiotherapy with CLBP at two centres in Bangladesh. Phase 1 will evaluate the usual physiotherapy care, and Phase 3 will evaluate individualised physiotherapy according to the STOPS approach. Phase 2 involves training physiotherapists and assistants in STOPS. Patients in Phases 1 & 3 will undergo 10 sessions of physiotherapy over 10 weeks, with an 11th booster session at 6 months. Primary outcomes are activity limitation (Oswestry Disability Index) and pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scales for back and leg pain) at 5, 10, 26 and 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes include global effect, patient satisfaction, work interference, psychosocial risk factors, quality of life, mental health, sleep, catastrophizing and self-efficacy. Qualitative interviews will explore patient and therapist experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be analysed to assess implementation feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and treatment outcomes.

        "abstract": "The optimal time and target for postprandial glucose (PPG) measurement in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether targeting 1-hour PPG (1 hPG) vs 2-hour PPG (2 hPG) altered fetomaternal outcomes in GDM. Studies that compared pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing 1 hPG vs 2 hPG monitoring in GDM were identified through comprehensive search of electronic databases. Primary outcomes analyzed were large-for-gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia. Secondary outcomes included low birthweight (LBW), neonatal intensive-care unit admission, neonatal hypoglycemia, cesarean section (CS), pre-eclampsia, gestational age at delivery, and preterm delivery. Six articles that compared 1 hPG<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) vs 2 hPG <120 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) were analyzed. Additionally, 3 articles that assessed 1 hPG<120 mg/dL vs1 hPG<140 mg/dL were also examined. Targeting 1 hPG<140 mg/dL vs 2 hPG<120 mg/dL significantly lowered the risk of LGA [odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.93; P = .03] but not macrosomia [OR 0.45; 95%CI:0.19-1.06; P = .07]. There was no difference in other parameters such as birthweight [mean difference -61.77g; 95%CI:-152.16-28.62; P = .018], LBW [OR 0.90; 95%CI:0.30-2.68;P = .85], neonatal hypoglycemia [OR 0.60; 95%CI:0.28-1.26; P = .18], gestational age at delivery [mean difference 0.20 weeks; 95%CI:-0.29-0.68; P = .43], CS [OR 0.99; 95%CI:0.46-2.12;P = .97], pre-eclampsia [OR 0.66;95% CI:.22-1.96; P = .46], or need for insulin therapy [OR 1.39; 95%CI:.79-2.43; P = .25]. More intensive 1 hPG target <120 mg/dL vs <140 mg/dl increased the risk of preterm delivery [OR 1.62; 95% CI:1.00-2.62; P = .05], without affecting birthweight, LGA, macrosomia, LBW, and CS. Our findings suggest that targeting 1 hPG <140 mg/dL vs 2 hPG<120 mg/dL lowers the risk of LGA, but does not affect other parameters. A stricter target of 1 hPG<120 mg/dL can increase the risk of preterm delivery. Further studies to corroborate these findings are necessary.",

        "abstract": "Administering antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) to pregnant women at risk of imminent preterm labour improves newborn survival. However, ACS remains substantially underused in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where most preterm births occur globally. Providing ACS in inadequately equipped settings can be harmful. Health facilities must demonstrate readiness to ensure safe and effective ACS use. We aimed to assess ACS utilisation and facility readiness to administer ACS based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. We used data from Service Provision Assessments in nine LMICs. The primary outcome was ACS utilisation, which was defined as having ever provided ACS in a health facility. We assessed the availability of injectable corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) and facility readiness to administer ACS appropriately. To measure readiness, we developed an overall readiness index based on 35 indicators, grouped into four categories based on WHO recommendations. The results were stratified by facility level. Across eight countries with comparable sampling strategies, only a median of 10.7% (range = 6.7-35.2%) of facilities had provided ACS, one-fourth (median = 25.3%; range = 4.6-61.5%) had injectable corticosteroids available at the time of the survey. Significant gaps were observed between corticosteroid availability and ACS use. We found low overall readiness indices, ranging from 8.1% for Bangladesh to 32.9% for Senegal. Across four readiness categories, the readiness index was the lowest for criterion one (i.e. ability to assess gestational age accurately) (7.3%), followed by criterion two (i.e. ability to identify maternal infections) (24.8%), criterion four (i.e. ability to provide adequate preterm newborn care) (31.3%), and criterion three (i.e. ability to provide adequate childbirth care) (32.9%). We proposed a strategy for measuring facility readiness to implement one of the most effective interventions to improve neonatal survival. Countries should operationalise readiness measurement, improve facility readiness to provide ACS appropriately, and encourage ACS uptake in well-equipped facilities.",

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%).

Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of random capillary blood glucose as a diagnostic tool for type 2 diabetes and determine optimal cut-off values for adults in Bangladesh. Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. 16 diabetes centres were selected randomly from all eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. A total of 3200 adults aged 18 years and older were recruited using systematic random sampling between May and September 2022. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of random capillary blood glucose compared to fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-gram glucose load and glycated haemoglobin. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and agreement with the other diagnostic tests. Random capillary blood glucose showed a strong positive correlation and high concordance with fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin. A cut-off value of ≥8.7 mmol/L demonstrated improved diagnostic performance compared with the currently used cut-off of ≥11.1 mmol/L. This new threshold yielded higher sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and agreement with other standard diagnostic tests. Notably, hyperglycaemic symptoms were not required for diagnosis. The number needed to screen to identify one case of type 2 diabetes using the ≥8.7 mmol/L cut-off was 2.74, lower than that for fasting plasma glucose (2.86) and random capillary blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (4.68). Random capillary blood glucose may be an effective and affordable diagnostic tool for type 2 diabetes in resource-limited settings. The proposed cut-off of ≥8.7 mmol/L offers improved diagnostic accuracy and reflects the population's glucose distribution pattern.",

The study investigated the antibiotic-seeking behaviour of Bangladeshi university students and the views of medical and public health experts on the harmful effects of antibiotic overuse on students. Forty in-depth students' interviews and 10 key informant interviews with medical and public health professionals were used to collect data using a qualitative study design and descriptive phenomenology research approach. Thematic analysis technique was conducted to analyse the collected data. The study found university students frequently seek, ask for and consume antibiotics from pharmacies to recover quickly and reduce the time-cost-visit of treatment. In certain instances, medical practitioners recommend antibiotics as a general treatment approach to enhance their popularity among patients and expedite their recovery from illness. However, they are being led into protracted illness due to poor knowledge and excessive usage of antibiotics. Students risk serious health issues by taking unnecessary antibiotics to recuperate quickly, which increases the nation's health burden. The study stresses the need for stricter restrictions and limiting antibiotic availability and intervention in educational, community and policy settings.",

        "abstract": "The double burden of malnutrition (DBM), defined by the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition within households, poses significant public health challenges in South and Southeast Asia. While previous studies have examined the individual effects of maternal education and household wealth on DBM, findings remain inconsistent, and little is known about how these factors interact across different contexts. To address this gap, we used nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Bangladesh (2017-2018), Cambodia (2022), Nepal (2022) and Timor-Leste (2016) to analyse the interaction between maternal education and household wealth in shaping DBM risk. These countries were selected due to their ongoing nutritional transition, which has contributed to the increasing prevalence of DBM. For the analysis, we used DHS data, which employs a standardised multistage cluster sampling method and probabilistic methods to ensure representativeness. In this study, we selected mother-child pairs from the DHS survey, focusing on children aged 0-59 months and nonpregnant mothers at the time of the survey. We included those pairs for which both the mother and child had valid weight and height measurements. Maternal education and household wealth were identified as the primary exposures. To examine their interaction and the impact of other covariates on DBM, we employed multivariable logistic regression models. Our study found that DBM prevalence was higher in urban and wealthier households, with the highest rates observed in Timor-Leste and Cambodia. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lower maternal education increased DBM risk, especially in affluent households (OR 2.07-3.29). Conversely, higher maternal education was associated with lower DBM prevalence. Additionally, breastfeeding and antenatal care visits emerged as protective factors. These findings indicate the necessity for specific interventions aimed at enhancing maternal education and promoting healthy dietary practices, particularly in rich households. Additionally, reinforcing breastfeeding practices and increasing antenatal care visits are essential strategies to mitigate the risks associated with DBM.",

These protective devices may pose certain health hazards, such as headaches. This study aims to find out the association between new-onset headaches (de novo) or exacerbation of preexisting headaches in military healthcare professionals using PPE. A total of 209 healthcare professionals participated in this cross-sectional observational study. Data were collected on headaches before and after using PPE through a self-administered questionnaire. Most participants were young with a mean age of 26.7 ± 5.6 years. The number of male participants was almost twice that of females (64.6%). de novo headache occurred in 88 participants (47.6%). Previous primary headaches were present in 24 patients, of whom 83.3% experienced exacerbation of primary headaches after using PPE. Doctors and nurses suffered from headaches significantly more than the other healthcare workers (P < 0.001). N95 mask usage was significantly associated with headaches (P < 0.001). In addition, the combination of masks, specifically surgical and N95 combination, was also associated with headaches (P = 0.019 and P < 0.001, respectively). Use of eye protection, irrespective of type was found to be associated with headaches (P < 0.05). Additional PPE, such as the protective jumpsuits, was also associated with headaches (P < 0.001). Our study did not find any significant association between headaches and the duration of hours of usage of masks or protective eyewear (P > 0.05). Masks, eye protective gear, and additional protective gown use are associated with new-onset headaches or exacerbation of previous headaches.

        "abstract": "Psittacosis is a zoonotic disease that mostly affects birds and can infect people. It causes respiratory ailments that can be minor or severe. The disease's importance to public health is shown by the fact that it has been connected to isolated outbreaks in several parts of the world. Comprehending the hazards linked to psittacosis is crucial, given that epidemics may have extensive consequences for public health, especially in environments where people and birds interact closely. Therefore, examining the risks, challenges, and methods for overcoming psittacosis infections is the primary focus of the study. Psittacosis' principal dangers include severe respiratory problems, which are especially dangerous for vulnerable groups. Inadequate diagnostic goods and services, public ignorance, and variances in hospital infrastructure all pose challenges to effective management. Strategies for combating psittacosis must include improved monitoring and reporting systems, better access to diagnosis and treatment, and expanded public awareness on protection. Incorporating biosecurity strategies in flocks and agricultural operations is also critical to lowering transmission risk. Prioritizing psittacosis control is imperative for global health regulatory organizations to prevent future outbreaks. To promote research, allocate funds, and support public health initiatives aimed at enhancing disease management, quick action is needed. By promoting international cooperation and enhancing healthcare systems, we can effectively address the problems caused by psittacosis and better safeguard populations everywhere from this preventable disease.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood development (ECD) in low to middle-income nations has been a pressing concern for the last two to three decades. It is estimated that approximately 250 million children under the age of five are not reaching their full developmental potential due to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and insufficient home stimulation. It is estimated that in Bangladesh, 44% of the children under 5 years live in poverty and 31% are stunted, and both factors are risks for poor childhood development. We aim to develop a sustainable, scaled ECD programme using an evidence-based curriculum of psychosocial stimulation for disadvantaged Bangladeshi children. Approximately 10,000 malnourished children aged 6-24 months will be identified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 13.5 cm, assessed by government health staff in over 500 community clinics (CCs) in 21 sub-districts of Hobiganj, Brahmanbaria, Laxmipur and Narsingdi districts. The children and their mothers will participate in the psychosocial stimulation programme that will be delivered fortnightly for one year to small groups at the CCs by health workers. We will train approximately 1,500 health staff in rural CCs to deliver the ECD sessions. We will follow a cascade training model to train personnel at all levels of the primary health care system. A subsample will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 48 CCs (24 intervention and 24 control). From each CC, 10 children aged 6-24 months will be tested before and after the programme. The primary outcome is children's cognitive development and we will also measure language composite scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Secondary outcomes are children's growth, maternal knowledge and depressive symptoms, and stimulation in the home. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention effects. There are no existing ECD services for the children under three years delivered by the health care system in Bangladesh. This study will help policy makers to consider incorporating ECD activities into the treatment of malnourished children in rural CCs, under the government's primary health care system, thereby developing a sustainable structure for improving disadvantaged children's development. The findings will also provide information to facilitate scaling ECD in the primary health care systems in other low and middle-income countries.

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "The 'Developing and evaluating an adapted behavioural activation intervention for depression and diabetes in South Asia (DiaDeM)' trial investigates a psychological intervention, behavioural activation (BA), on people with both diabetes and depression in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study aimed to aid the intervention and trial design. This was a modelling study using microsimulation to assess the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Diabetes was modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study model based on Pakistani patients and depression was modelled using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) trajectories allowing for multiple depressive episodes. It was assumed that diabetes-related adverse events increased depression recurrence, while depression impacted haemoglobin A1c, increasing diabetes-related events. The model estimated (1) maximum cost of BA which would be cost-effective (headroom analysis) to inform intervention design, and (2) value of reducing uncertainty around different measures (value of information analysis) to prioritise data collection in the DiaDeM study. Analysis was conducted from a Pakistani healthcare perspective over a lifetime with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. BA plus usual care was compared against usual care. BA involved six sessions by a trained (non-mental health) facilitator. The usual care comparator was the prevailing mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used in Pakistan. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Secondary outcomes included life years, healthcare costs and the rate of depression and diabetes-related events. Over their lifetime, individuals receiving BA plus usual care avoid 3.2 (95% credible interval: 2.7 to 3.8) years of mild depression and experience fewer diabetes-related events. BA plus usual care resulted in an additional 0.27 (0.03 to 0.52) life years, 0.98 (0.45 to 1.86) DALYs averted and had incremental healthcare costs of -US$97 (-US$517 to US$142), excluding BA costs. The maximum cost per BA course at which was cost-effective is US$83 (US$9 to US$214). Value of information analysis found the most important measures to include in the trial are the impact of depression on diabetes and PHQ-9 over time. This is the first model to jointly model depression and diabetes for South Asia and uses novel methods to reflect the diseases and inform intervention and trial design. This evidence has helped to inform the design of the DiaDeM intervention and the trial to evaluate it.

        "abstract": "People with disabilities have the same need for contraception as the general population. However, their access to modern contraceptive methods is largely underexplored in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of modern contraception use among reproductive-aged (15-49 years) persons with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries and identify the key determinants. In June 2024, we conducted a systematic search across six databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, Medline and Scopus to identify studies on disability and modern contraception in low- and middle-income countries. The search terms included a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to disability, modern contraception and low- and middle-income countries integrated using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). All studies published between January 2015 and June 2024, in English, and conducted in low- and middle-income countries were included. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of modern contraception use and its determinants among persons with any disability. Summary estimates were calculated using meta-analysis with a fixed effects model for lower heterogeneity. Random effects meta-analysis was used for mid-level heterogeneity (50%-74%) and high-level heterogeneity (75%-100%). A total of 18 studies from low- and middle-income countries were included, with 11 included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of modern contraception use among persons with disabilities was 31.4% (95% CI: 26.5, 36.2). Significant heterogeneity was observed across respondent characteristics (I<sup>2</sup> = 94.55%). Five factors were significantly associated with higher contraception use: being aged over 25 years, having some level of education, being in a higher wealth quintile, having adequate knowledge of family planning and being in a formal marital relationship. This study reveals a significantly lower prevalence of modern contraception use among persons with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries compared to the general population. Improving access to education, addressing social norms and strengthening healthcare systems may contribute to increasing access to contraception and uptake among persons with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries.",

Thus, this study co-designed an integrated care pathway for depression case finding and treatment in TB services, that can be delivered by non-mental health specialists within a low resourced settings. We conducted a total of 10 'co-design' workshops with people with TB, carers, tuberculosis and mental health healthcare providers between June and August 2021 in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Peshawar, Pakistan. We adapted the 'Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University' for our codesign process. Information gathered during the workshop, through recordings and contemporaneous notes taking, was collated, and analysed to develop the integrated care pathways and materials for impmenting the carepathway. We co-designed and developed a culturally adaptable care pathway that integrates depression screening into tuberculosis (TB) care, working closely with people affected by TB and healthcare workers in primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings in Bangladesh and Pakistan. We used PHQ-9 only to identify and screen for depression among people with TB in Bangladesh, whereas both PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 were used for depression screening among the Pakistani population. A trained paramedic or laboratory technologist (Bangladesh) and DOTS Facilitator (Pakistan), working within the TB facilities were identified and agreed to deliver the integrated depression screening services. Stakeholders valued the opportunity to jointly design a care pathway. Iterative and coordinated working with these stakeholders enabled the researchers to understand better, explore and refine the co-design process. This approach assisted in mobilising knowledge about depression and integrating screening for depression within the existing usual TB care pathway, using the lived experience of people with TB and health workers' expertise.",

Despite the critical need for tailored mental health care in health facilities, studies on these symptoms in this demographic remain lacking. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the levels, distribution, and associated factors of depressive and anxiety symptoms and their co-occurrence among women seeking antenatal care at a public healthcare facility in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study between May 2024, and June 2024, among women seeking antenatal care (ANC) care in Durgapur Upazila Health Complex, a primary-level public health facility in Bangladesh. Among 640 women who received ANC care, 638 participated in the study. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and anxiety symptoms were assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to determine factors contributing to depressive and anxiety symptoms. About 39% of participants had depressive symptoms and 50% had anxiety symptoms, with 26% experiencing both simultaneously. No participants had severe overall depressive or anxiety symptoms. PHQ-9 data indicated half experienced daily fatigue, while GAD-7 data showed over half experienced daily nervousness and two-fifths had daily fears. Women in the second and third trimesters had 43% (aOR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.89) and 58% (aOR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.71) lower odds of depressive symptoms compared to those in the first trimester respectively. Women with 11 years or more education had 40% (aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94) lower odds of anxiety. Additionally, women in the second and third trimesters had 40% (aOR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37-0.97) and 49% (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.29-0.91) lower likelihood of co-occurrence compared to those in the first trimester and women with 6-10 years of education had 48% (aOR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.79) and those with 11 or more years had 52% (aOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.81) lower likelihood of co-occurring depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to women with 5 years or less education. Our study found a high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms among antenatal care seekers, with notable co-occurrence of these conditions. Given these findings, there is an urgent need for targeted mental health support for these women, especially those in their first trimester and those with limited education.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is indispensable for supervising and enhancing the health of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. It helps to reduce the risks of complications and ensures better pregnancy outcomes. This study investigates the aspects that influence antenatal care (ANC) visits in Bangladesh, focusing on sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. The study used nationally representative data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted for bivariate analysis. The Boruta algorithm was utilized for variable selection. After employing various regression models, including Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-inflated Poisson Regression, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB), we evaluated their performance and selected Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) for parameter estimation and interpretation. Our results reveal that less than 50% of women meet the WHO-recommended minimum of four ANC visits. Rural women were 12% less likely than urban women to receive antenatal care (ANC) visits, indicating an urban-rural discrepancy. Women with secondary and higher education levels were significantly more likely to have frequent visits, with incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.51), respectively. Similarly, women from households with rich wealth status (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) and those exposed to media coverage (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14-1.25) were more likely to attend frequent ANC visits. Conversely, women with higher birth order (IRR: 0.95 & 0.84, 95% CI: 0.90-1.00 & 0.76-0.92), unintentional pregnancy (IRR: 0.91 & 0.83, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96 & 0.77-0.91) were less likely to have ANC visits. This study underscores a critical gap in ANC access, particularly among rural women, which poses challenges to achieving national and global maternal health targets. Addressing these disparities and making relevant policy implications such as expanding community-based ANC programs, integrating services into primary healthcare, and increasing awareness through mass media are required to enhance ANC accessibility and utilization in underserved populations.",

        "abstract": "Tobacco-related disease and death remain high in many low- and middle-income countries, and most people start using tobacco during adolescence. This study evaluated the effectiveness of school-based interventions in preventing and reducing tobacco use among adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. Seven databases were searched until 20 April 2024. The primary outcome was tobacco use prevalence (ever or point prevalence) at the longest follow-up. Risk of bias was assessed, and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, exploring heterogeneity via meta-regression (PROSPERO registration CRD42022330329). Twenty-seven studies (N=57,292) were summarized descriptively, and 20 were meta-analyzed. Most studies were from Brazil (n=5, 18.5%), India (n=5, 18.5%), China (n=3, 11.1%), and Pakistan (n=2, 7.4%); 12 (44.4%) assessed newly developed and 15 (55.6%) culturally adapted existing interventions; and over half (n=14, 51.9%) focused solely on preventing and reducing tobacco use while the rest addressed multiple behaviors. Overall, interventions reduced adolescent tobacco use (OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.64, 0.91; I²=47%; n=20; 50,056 participants). Stratification by outcome measure showed significant reductions in point prevalence (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.57, 0.85; I²=32.4%). After adjusting for study duration, interventions with higher contact time had lower effectiveness than shorter interventions (AOR=1.36, 95% CI=1.01, 1.84; p=0.045; I²=22%). Low risk of bias studies demonstrated lower odds of tobacco use among participants (OR=0.66, 95% CI=0.50, 0.87; I²=14%; n=6). School-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries effectively reduce the proportion of adolescents who use tobacco. Shorter interventions appeared to be effective, suggesting that brief yet engaging interventions may offer practical advantages and could contribute to addressing the tobacco epidemic in low- and middle-income countries. Further research is needed to determine optimal intervention duration and intensity for sustained effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Formalised public-private-partnerships (PPPs) for primary care have proliferated in the mixed health systems of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, managed and funded by the state. This perspective provides a process-based understanding of pathways adopted by home-grown PPPs and underlying drivers to identify lessons for advancement under Universal Health Coverage (UHC). PPPs have been deployed to respond to local primary care needs ranging from diagnostic screening, maternity services, management of government health centres, mobile clinics to urban primary care systems. Partnerships have evolved to include a diverse range of private partners and more purposeful arrangements, with increase in service volumes, innovations albeit less standardised quality of care. The pathway of PPP instigation, rollout and sustaining in South Asia is based on local starting points by sub-national governments, diffusion of practice across states, common interests and shared bureaucratic coalitions. Success drivers include administrative support beyond the health sector, simplified contractual and payment systems providing operational ease and decision space, and the use of relational management and digital monitoring for resolving issues. However, PPPs are constrained by either too little accountability or excessive accountability in contract design, trust deficits between private and government, and fire-walled PPP implementation creates disconnects from national primary care planning and regulation. Donor supported projectized PPP funding and accompanying rules of business makes PPPs implementation more cumbersome. We conclude that future attention must centrally focus on pathways and drivers to impactfully introduce, scale-up and sustain PPPs in South Asia. Emphasis must be on pathways that build on local simplified ideation, progressive adaptation and allowing contextual diversity under a larger UHC planning architecture, as opposed to centralised one-fit and heavily technocratic initiatives. Success drivers must feature in design of PPP initiatives. Furthermore, we contend that international donor assistance should shift from projectized support for PPPs to building public sector competencies for stewardship, private sector engagement skills as well as the more traditional performance management capacity.",

In Malaysia, high prevalence of oral diseases including dental caries among individuals with disabilities (IWDs) has been reported, indicating a possible gap in the current system. This study aimed to analyze caries experience using DMFT index of IWDs in community-based rehabilitation (CBR) centers across Selangor, Malaysia. A CBR centers-based cross-sectional study was conducted on IWDs or CBR trainees in the period between August 2022 and December 2023. Recruitments of the study participants were done via census sampling method, involving all the trainees within the specific centers. Data collection was done using the World Health Organization oral health survey tool (WHO, 2013) and analyzed using SPSS 24. Two hundred and twenty-six students with the age range of 2-47 years old were included in the study. Clinical examination of CBR trainees revealed (1) the mean DMFT scores were low for primary dentition (2.02), moderate for both mixed (3.86), and permanent dentitions (4.17); (2) prevalence of caries among those with primary, mixed, and permanent dentitions as 44.44%, 74.4%, and 74.80%, respectively. Trainees with primary dentition had a low prevalence of dental caries and mean DMFT score, while those with mixed and permanent dentition exhibited moderate levels. A statistically significant association was observed between the total DMFT scores for participants with primary dentition with both gender and disability types.",

        "abstract": "The global burden of chronic diseases is increasing and becoming a public health issue throughout the world. The use of telenursing is increasing significantly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to treat and prevent chronic diseases. Telenursing is growing in many countries to reduce health care costs, increase the number of aging and chronically ill populations, and increase health care coverage to distant, rural, small, or sporadically populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help to solve increasing shortages of nurses, reduce distances, save travel time, and keep patients out of the hospital. The objective of this study is to apply the self-management telenursing program and telenursing system developed by the researchers to Bangladesh and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy (improved diabetes control in participants). This is a pilot, quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study. Diabetes patients who will attend the Grameen Primary Health Centers (PHCs) in Bangladesh will be enrolled between September 2024 and August 2025. We include patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, both sexes, ages 18-75 years old, all types of treatment, willing to participate and give us consent. We exclude patients who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, diabetes as a secondary cause, complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is less than 7% for the past 1 year with CKD stage 1 or 2, no complications or complications with good control, having enough knowledge (had education before) and implemented good practice regarding diabetes management assessed by the research nurses, and disabled persons who need other person's support for daily living. The sample size was calculated and found 70. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The study protocol got approval from the National Research Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC/NREC/2022-2025/336) on September 08, 2024. The outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of telenursing intervention by controlling HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The project was funded in 2024. The enrollment of the participants started on October 26, 2024, and the required sample (n=70) enrollment was completed in February 2025. Data analysis will be started after completion of data collection and results will be expected to be submitted for publication in 2026. Diabetic patients will acquire disease-specific management skills. Setting and monitoring goals ensures the continuation of the desired behavior and gives the patients control over their lifestyle. After developing self-management skills, patients assess their lab data and lifestyles including diet, and understand their condition so that they can work with their physiological data by acquiring knowledge of both the disease and self-care. By making self-supported decisions, the patients will be able to manage their diet, exercise, and medication. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06632652; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06632652.

        "abstract": "Childhood severe pneumonia is the leading cause of under-five deaths in Bangladesh. A new day-care management approach (DCA) was implemented in primary-level healthcare facilities in urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. Reliable cost estimates are important to determine the economic viability of the new management approach. The objective of this study were to estimate the mean societal cost per patient for a new Day-care approach (DCA) in managing childhood severe pneumonia, to assess cost variation in urban and rural healthcare settings, and to determine important cost predictors. This study was conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh Children diagnosed with severe pneumonia were enrolled between November 2015 and March 2019. Employing a bottom-up micro-costing approach from a societal perspective, detailed household and provider cost data were collected from sixteen intervention facilities (n = 16). Data collection involved structured questionnaires administered face-to-face with facility staff, interviews with parents/caregivers, and patient record reviews. Analysis measured mean cost and cost variation across socio-economic groups, facility location, clinical variables, and determined cost-sensitive parameters. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant level. 1,745 children were enrolled, 63% were male, and 57% were less than a year old. The mean societal cost per patient was US$94.2 (95% CI: US$92.2, US$96.3) with a mean length-of-stay (LoS) of 4.1 days (SD ± 3.0). Costs of medical personnel (US$32.6), caregiver's productivity loss (US$26) and medicines (US$22) were the major cost contributors. Mean cost was significantly higher for urban-located facilities compared to rural (difference US$17, 95% CI: US$12.6, US$20.8). No cost variation was found by age, sex, and clinical variables. Findings suggest that this novel DCA management approach is a low-cost management option, and particularly beneficial for rural residences and therefore has the potential to reduce the overall cost burden for childhood severe pneumonia management. These findings have implications for policy-making decisions in resource-poor settings for childhood pneumonia management.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), in comparison to iron and folic acid supplementation (IFA), improves pregnancy outcomes, but less is known about their effect on infant growth. We conducted a systematic review of trials comparing maternal MMS to IFA and assessed the effect on infants' anthropometric outcomes at birth, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo of age. We included trials from a Cochrane review and new studies identified through systematic literature searches in 3 databases. We calculated the pooled effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a generic inverse variance method, with fixed (primary analysis) and random-effects, and assessed subgroup differences. The 19 included trials showed that MMS, compared to IFA, led to significantly greater length and weight from birth to 6 mo, head circumference (HC) from birth to 12 mo, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) through 3 mo. Infants born to pregnant women consuming MMS were longer at birth (mean difference: 0.05 cm; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.08 cm) and had higher length-for-age z-score at birth (0.09; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), 3 mo (0.09; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), and 6 mo (0.04; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07) of age but not thereafter. MMS resulted in significantly higher weight-for-age z-score and HC-for-age z-score until 6 mo and higher weight-for-length z-score and MUAC-for-age z-score until 3 mo. MMS reduced risk of stunting (risk ratio [RR]: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.91), underweight (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.90), small HC (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90), and low MUAC (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.99) at 3 mo and wasting (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96) at birth. For some outcomes, effects were greater when MMS was continued postpartum and in settings with higher prevalence of low birthweight. Prenatal MMS improves size at birth and subsequent infant growth through 6 mo of age but not thereafter. These results strengthen the evidence on MMS benefits beyond birth outcomes.

The mean age of hypertension diagnosis was 45.84 years. The mean age of hypertension diagnosis of male participants was higher than female (48.1 vs 44.4 years). Our study found that males and individuals with primary education are more likely to receive a later hypertension diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-3.10 and odds ratio = 5.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.09-11.48 respectively) for those aged ≥65. The poorest and those lacking physical exercise faced higher odds of later diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.20; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.15 and odds ratio = 2.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.78-3.17 respectively). Conversely, a family history of hypertension reduces the odds (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.55). Increased knowledge of healthy lifestyle factors and engagement with health-related media correlate with later diagnosis, highlighting the influence of education and awareness on hypertension detection age. Our study reveals that knowledge of a healthy lifestyle is associated with the age of hypertension diagnosis. Targeting specific age groups based on health education programs may reduce hypertension-related complications.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the association between the establishment of primary healthcare providers- community clinics (CCs)- and healthcare-seeking behavior in Bangladesh. Initiated in 1998, CCs aim to provide accessible healthcare services to remote households, particularly focusing on women and children. Using cluster-level data on healthcare provider availability alongside individual-level data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) for 2011, 2014, and 2017-18, the respective sample sizes are 17842, 17886, and 20127 ever-married women, the study offers robust estimates that address endogeneity concerns present in individual-level analyses. Lagged health indicators are utilized to consider contextual factors influencing CC establishment in specific regions. Results indicate positive associations between CC presence and various healthcare-seeking behaviors, such as increased contraceptive use, higher attendance at antenatal care visits, and improved treatment-seeking for children's illnesses. Notably, rural-urban disparities in healthcare-seeking behavior highlight existing access inequalities. To mitigate this divide, the study recommends expanding CCs nationwide, demonstrating that low-cost healthcare interventions can enhance healthcare-seeking behaviors and suggest potential scalability in similar contexts.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality is a critical public health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Maternal healthcare services (MHS), including antenatal care (ANC) visits, skilled birth attendants (SBA), institutional delivery (ID), and postnatal care (PNC), are crucial policy priorities to address maternal mortality and improve pregnancy outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of MHS utilization among women in LMICs. We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and SocINDEX to gather relevant studies on the utilization of MHS in LMICs conducted between January 2015 and December 2024. These were then synthesized both quantitatively and qualitatively and random-effect models were employed to obtain pooled estimates. A total of 145 studies included in this review. Coverage of at least one ANC visit (ANC1), at least four ANC visits (ANC4), SBA, ID and PNC were reported in 66, 108, 42, 63, and 37 studies respectively and for these studies pooled prevalences of ANC1, ANC4, SBA, ID, and PNC were found 85.0% (95% CI 81.2-88.1%), 50.8% (95% CI 46.4-55.2%), 65.6% (95% CI 58.7-71.9%), 66.9% (95% CI 60.3-72.9%), and 48.9% (95% CI 41.7-56.2%), respectively, with high heterogeneity among the studies (I<sup>2</sup> > 99.0%). Results obtained from the sub-group analysis revealed that the prevalence of MHS indicators was higher in the South and Southeast Asia (SSEA) region compared to Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), except for ID, e.g., SBA prevalence in SSEA was 70.1% (95% CI 60.4-78.3%) whereas for SSA it was 64.0% (95% CI 53.3-73.6%). The prevalence of all MHS indicators was higher for studies with primary data than those with secondary data, except for ANC4 and PNC. Overall, associations were reported between MHS utilization and women's age, education level, household socioeconomic status, place of residence, decision-making power, and exposure to mass media. High heterogeneity among studies infer possible disparities in MHS utilization at both global and national levels. Hence, it is crucial for policies to prioritize enhancing effective coverage, narrowing disparities, and improving care quality in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals.

        "abstract": "While combustible tobacco has been the subject of a very large amount of research, smokeless tobacco products receive less attention. Most smokeless tobacco products are very harmful and cause global health inequality. It is therefore important to identify evidence-based cessation aids. To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacological interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation. We searched the following databases from inception to 16 February 2024: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; ClinicalTrials.gov (through CENTRAL); World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (through CENTRAL). We also searched references of eligible studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting people of any age using smokeless tobacco, regardless of tobacco smoking status. Eligible studies could test any intervention designed to support people to quit smokeless tobacco use, and had to measure abstinence from either all tobacco use or smokeless tobacco use at six months or longer. The outcome of interest was abstinence from all tobacco use or from smokeless tobacco use at six months or longer. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in included studies. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We grouped studies by comparisons of eligible interventions and comparators, reporting individual study and pooled effects as appropriate. We used a random-effects Mantel-Haenszel model for analyses of behavioural interventions and a fixed effect Mantel-Haenszel model for analyses of pharmacotherapies to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We included 43 trials of 20,346 people. Thirty-three trials were conducted in North America, five in India, two in Scandinavia, one in Pakistan and one in Turkey. One study was conducted across multiple sites in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Studies tested behavioural interventions (e.g. cessation counselling and brief advice) and pharmacotherapies (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion). We judged five studies to be at low risk of bias overall, 22 at high risk of bias, and the remaining 16 at unclear risk of bias. We found moderate-certainty evidence of increased quit rates from counselling compared with minimal support (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.16; I<sup>2</sup> = 69%; 21 studies, n = 7417; downgraded because of heterogeneity), brief advice compared with no support (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 49%; 7 studies, n = 6271; downgraded because of imprecision), and varenicline compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.68; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, n = 508; downgraded because of imprecision). We found low-certainty evidence (downgraded because of imprecision and risk of bias) of increased quit rates from NRT compared with placebo or no medication (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 39%; 11 studies, n = 2826). Low-certainty evidence (downgraded because of imprecision) did not show benefit from bupropion compared with placebo (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; 2 studies, n = 293). We planned subgroup analyses to explore whether smokeless tobacco type affects intervention efficacy, but found insufficient data. Cessation counselling, brief advice, and varenicline each probably help more people to quit smokeless tobacco use than minimal or no support, or placebo. NRT may help more people to quit smokeless tobacco use than placebo or no medication. Low-certainty evidence does not currently support bupropion as a smokeless tobacco cessation intervention. Despite the majority of smokeless tobacco users living in South and Southeast Asia, only a minority of trials are conducted in those regions. Future trials should address this imbalance.

        "abstract": "This study presents results of a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of two parenting interventions (group-based and pairs) integrated into primary health care centers in rural Bangladesh. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for two trials of parenting interventions aiming to support child development through play and interactions. Eligible participants for both trials were underweight children aged 5-24 months. Participants in the control arms in both trials received standard health services. Intervention costs were estimated rom the provider perspective over the time horizon of each study (21 months for the group-based intervention; 24 months for the pair-based intervention). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were estimated for all primary child development outcomes and presented in terms of cost per standard deviation improvements in the outcomes. A series of cost scenario analyses were conducted to assess the effect of changing cost assumptions on the cost and cost-effectiveness results. All results are presented in 2022 USD. The studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02208531). Total provider costs in the within-trial analysis were US$ 67,668 for the group-based intervention and US$ 117,028 for the pair intervention. Estimated cost per child covered by the interventions was US$ 156 for the group intervention and US$ 136 for the pair intervention, reflecting likely economies of scale in delivery of the pair intervention. An additional US$ 100 expenditure on the group intervention is estimated to lead to a 0.55 SD improvement in cognition, 0.44 SD in language development and 0.33 SD in motor development. For the pair intervention, the corresponding estimates are improvements of 0.95 SD, 0.81 SD, and 0.88 SD, respectively. Under potential scale up scenarios, the economic cost per child could reduce substantially to US$ 61 and US$ 77 for group and pair interventions, respectively. The findings indicates that cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness results for both interventions are comparable with the results from limited similar interventions in LMICs. However, implementation costs of the interventions will be substantially lower at scale due to lower monitoring costs, economies of scale, and full integration into the public health system.

        "abstract": "Hard-to-reach riverine communities of northern Bangladesh face unique challenges in healthcare services. Friendship, an international social purpose organization, implemented a 3-tier healthcare model addressing these unique challenges over the past 20 years. This study evaluated Friendship's 3-tier healthcare model in the northern riverine area, assessing service-seeking practices, experiences, stakeholders' perceptions, and cost benefits for beneficiaries. A concurrent mixed-method approach was employed, including desk reviews, a cross-sectional quantitative survey, facility mapping, and qualitative interviews with service recipients, community representatives, healthcare providers, and health managers. Data were collected from five hard-to-reach riverine sub-districts across the Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogura, Sirajganj, and Jamalpur districts of Bangladesh between April 2022 and July 2023. Data analysis followed major thematic domains for a comprehensive and complementary understanding. A significant proportion (43.0%) of survey participants had no formal education, were aged 18-35 (57.5%), and earned less than 1,620 USD yearly (66.6%). Friendship's healthcare services at the doorstep through satellite clinics and Female Community Medic Aides were widely accepted and preferred within the community for convenience, affordability (0.05-0.09 USD service charges), and superior quality, particularly the specialized treatments available on the hospital ships. Friendship's 3-tier healthcare model made the accessibility and affordability of primary healthcare. Upon implementing a robust referral mechanism, continuing collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh, and expanding community awareness sessions to include topics such as mental health and disaster response, this model has the potential to be effective in similar settings in Bangladesh and other developing countries, as well as during emergency responses.",

Addressing this data gap is crucial to understanding and improving the nutritional condition of the third-gender community. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate their nutritional status, dietary protein intake, lifestyle, social behavior, nutritional knowledge, and prevalence of diseases. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Fifty participants from the third-gender community were selected. Study subjects were individually interviewed through a structured questionnaire to gather specific data. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Logistic Regression, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Chi-square tests were carried out to measure the associations among the variables. The average age of the participants was 32.74 ± 9.30 years, with 26% lacking formal education and 72% engaged in money collection as a primary occupation. 36% earned less than BDT 5,000 monthly, with only 2% exceeding BDT 20,000. The mean height and mean body weights were 163 ± 5.21 cm and 60.64 ± 13.61 kg (mean ± SD) respectively. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.02 ± 5.04 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, among whom 14% were underweight, 56% were normal, 20% were overweight, and 10% were obese. 48% of the participants had poor nutritional knowledge, and 46% had average. 50% of the participants had smoking habits and 34% of the participants consumed alcohol. Nutritional intake was skewed towards plant proteins (72%), with inadequate access to healthcare reported by 56% of subjects. Two-thirds (66%) of the respondents had no illness, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affected 34% of participants, with diabetes (12%) and low pressure (8%) prevalent. Smoking significantly correlated with lower normal BMI (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07-0.84, p < 0.05). Unhealthy food intake was significantly associated with underweight risks (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.92, p < 0.05). When compared with male and female Bangladeshi populations, third-gender individuals had higher overweight prevalence, moderate normal BMI rates, and lower malnutrition than males.

        "abstract": "Scabies is a dermatological parasitic infestation prevalent in many regions worldwide. Classified as a neglected disease by World Health Organization (WHO) since 2017, it is often associated with poor living conditions and overcrowding. Towards the end of 2021, unusual high numbers of scabies cases in outpatient consultations were observed in two Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF) Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Here, we aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with scabies consulting the clinics from July 2022-November 2023. A cross-sectional study using routinely collected data from scabies' consultations at two MSF clinics located in camp 14 and 15 (total population 91,241 in 2023) was conducted. We retrospectively analyzed programmatic data of patients of all ages attending outpatient consultations and clinically diagnosed as scabies. Data were extracted from MSF clinical routine monitoring databases and descriptive statistics were reported. During the 16-month period, a total of 178,922 scabies consultations were recorded, amongst whom 57.7% were women and 42.3% men. Children <5 years constituted 20.5% of the cases, age-groups 6-14, 36.6%, and ≥15 years, 42.9%. Camp 15 had the highest number of cases (39.4%), followed by other camps (29.7%), and then camp 14 (24.4%). Most cases were simple scabies (79.5%); one in five were scabies with secondary infection cases. Patients were mainly treated with oral ivermectin (71.2%) and topical permethrin (24.3%); 19.5% of patients also received antibiotics. Our findings indicate that scabies is a significant health concern in the Cox's Bazar refugee camp. This study recorded over 178000 cases in the above period. The scale of this outbreak warrants further actions, including a prevalence survey, quality implementation of mass drug administration, and multidisciplinary interventions related to camps' living conditions such as water and sanitation.",

        "abstract": "Acute Malnutrition affects 45 million children under five globally, with Bangladesh contributing more than 1.7 million cases. While community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines in Bangladesh exist, they primarily emphasise nutritional counselling and face challenges in coverage and implementations. It is important to understand barriers to CMAM uptake and implementation. This study aims to explore the perceptions of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences among parents, healthcare providers, and policymakers, alongside parents' care-seeking behaviours for under-five children with acute malnutrition. Conducted in areas with and without CMAM programs, the research follows a phenomenological design with thematic analysis of focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Thirty FGDs with parents, 28 KIIs with healthcare providers, and 16 KIIs with policymakers were conducted. Identified causes of acute malnutrition included infections, diseases, lack of awareness about nutritious foods, supernatural beliefs, poverty, and inadequate care and feeding practices. Consequences included stunted growth, impaired mental development, and increased illness risk. Although parents acknowledged the urgency of treating acute malnutrition, they sought care at healthcare facilities regardless of illness. Factors influencing care-seeking behaviour were inability in problem prioritisation, transportation cost and availability, healthcare access, wage loss, and out-of-pocket expenses. Despite awareness of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences, parental care-seeking remains limited. The study recommends integrating acute malnutrition guidelines with communicable disease programs, implementing targeted social and behavioural change programs, addressing superstitions, fostering collaboration with traditional healers strengthening social safety nets, and empowering women in healthcare decision-making.",

Tracking + CDSS + TCC Providers' adherence to recommendations Probably increases guideline adherence for antenatal screening and management of anaemia (1 study, 10,502 participants; OR 1.88 [1.52, 2.32]), diabetes (1 study, 8669 participants; OR 1.45 [1.14, 1.84}), hypertension (1 study, 15,555 participants; OR 1.62 [1.29, 2.04]) and probably leads to lower adherence for abnormal foetal growth (1 study, 1165 participants; OR 0.59 [0.37, 0.95]). May slightly increase nevirapine prophylaxis in infants of HIV+ve mothers (1 study, 609 participants; OR 1.75 [0.73, 4.19]) Data quality In pregnant women (1 study, 6367 participants), tracking + CDSS + TCC: Probably slightly reduces missing data for haemoglobin (RR 0.77 [0.71, 0.84]) but slightly more for BP at delivery (RR 1.16 [1.08, 1.24]) May have little or no effect on missing data on gestational age (RR 0.96 [0.81, 1.14]) or birthweight (RR 0.90 [0.77, 1.04]) Clients' health behaviour May have little or no effect on being on anti-retroviral therapy at delivery (1 study, 438 participants; OR 1.41 [0.81, 2.45]) or exclusive breastfeeding for six months (1 study, 695 participants; OR 1.74 [0.95, 3.17]) in HIV+ve mothers Uncertain effects on physical activity in high cardiovascular-risk adults Clients' health status May reduce the number of deaths in patients with hypertension and diabetes (1 study, 3698 participants; OR 0.61 [0.35, 1.06]) May reduce new cardiovascular events in high-cardiovascular risk adults over 6-18 months (1 study, 8642 participants; OR 0.58 [0.42, 0.80}) May slightly decrease in antenatal women severe hypertension, but the confidence interval includes both a decrease and increase (1 study, 6367 participants; OR 0.61 [0.27, 1.37]) In women receiving antenatal care (1 study, 6367 participants), tracking + CDSS + TCC maymake little or no difference to adverse pregnancy outcomes (OR 0.99 [0.87, 1.12]), moderate or severe anaemia (OR 0.82 [0.51, 1.31]), or large-for-gestational-age babies (OR 1.06 [0.90, 1.25]). In adults with hypertension or diabetes (1 study, 3324 participants), tracking + CDSS + TCC maymake little or no difference to HbA1c (MD 0.08 [-0.27, 0.43]), total cholesterol (MD -2.50 [-7.10, 2.10]), 10-year cardiovascular risk (MD -0.40 [-2.30, 1.50]), tobacco use (MD-0.05 [-0.47, 0.37]), alcohol use (MD 0.70 [-3.70, 5.10]), or PHQ-9 (MD -1.60 [-4.40, 1.20]). Uncertain effects on maternal or infant mortality before the baby reaches 18 months in HIV-positive mothers, patients who achieve optimal BP, BP controlled at five years, diastolic or systolic BP, body mass index, fasting glucose and quality of life in adults with hypertension or diabetes Client service utilisation May have little or no effect on missed early infant diagnosis visits (1 study, 1183 participants; OR 0.92 [0.63, 1.35]). Uncertain effects on linkage to care Client satisfaction Probably increases slightly the number of adults with hypertension or diabetes reporting \"slightly/much better\" change in the quality of care (1 study, 3324 participants; RR 1.02 [1.00, 1.03]). No studies evaluated time between presentation and appropriate management, timeliness of receiving/accessing care, provider acceptability/satisfaction, resource use, or unintended consequences. Digital tracking may improve primary care workers' ability to follow recommended antenatal and chronic disease practices, quality of patient records, patient health outcomes and service use. However, these interventions led to small or no outcome differences in most studies.",

        "title": "Sustainable Model of Early Intervention and Telerehabilitation for Children With Cerebral Palsy in Rural Bangladesh: The SMART-CP Randomized Clinical Trial.",
        "abstract": "Access to early intervention and rehabilitation services among children with cerebral palsy (CP) remains limited in Bangladesh, which demands an innovative and sustainable service delivery model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Sustainable Model of Early Intervention and Telerehabilitation for Children With CP (SMART-CP) model compared with usual care in improving access to and utilization of early diagnosis, early intervention, and rehabilitation services in rural Bangladesh. This was a 2-arm cluster randomized clinical trial, with 8 clusters (ie, subdistricts) randomly allocated to the intervention (SMART-CP model) or control arm. The setting was in Sirajganj, Bangladesh, and included children with CP 18 years or younger. Outcomes were measured at 0 and 12 months, and an intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to May 2024. The SMART-CP model comprised (1) a rural referral network involving key informants and caregiver peer groups (called mPower or mothers' power), (2) subdistrict level SMART-CP centers, and (3) telerehabilitation services. Children in the intervention arm received weekly goal-directed therapy, mPower group meetings every 2 weeks, and monthly telerehabilitation sessions. The primary outcome was whether a child with CP accessed any form of rehabilitation services, with secondary outcomes analyzed as hypothesis generating. Overall, 968 children with CP (mean [SD] age, 7.9 [4.9] years; 581 male [60.0%]) were enrolled, with 500 in the intervention arm and 468 in the control arm. Between baseline and endline, rehabilitation services uptake significantly increased in the intervention arm (70.2% [351 of 500] vs 99.4% [497 of 500]), compared with the control arm (63.9% [299 of 468] vs 68.2% [319 of 468]; P <.001). Children in the intervention arm were 1.5 times more likely to access rehabilitation than the control arm. Secondary analyses suggested that the intervention arm also facilitated early CP diagnosis (mean [SD] diagnosis time, 2.0 [2.0] years vs 3.8 [3.3] years; Cohen d = -0.7) and initiation of rehabilitation (mean [SD] rehabilitation time, 1.8 [1.8] years vs 3.6 [2.4] years; Cohen d = -0.9). Additionally, higher therapy session counts (mean [SD] session counts, 23.4 [31.7] vs 4.3 [20.8]; Cohen d = 0.7), increased assistive device utilization (20.8% [104 of 500] vs 3.0% [14 of 468]; risk ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.86; P < .001), and lower out-of-pocket expenditure per month (mean [SD] expenditure, $1.5 [$1.6] vs $2.9 [$5.1]; Cohen d = -0.4) were found in the intervention arm. No significant difference in clinical outcomes and mortality rates was observed between the intervention and control groups. Results of this cluster randomized clinical trial reveal that the SMART-CP model improved access to and utilization of early diagnosis and intervention services for children with CP in rural Bangladesh. This model holds promise for global scalability. ANZCTR Trial Identifier: ACTRN12622000396729.",

This study explores the associations between education and ideal cardiovascular health score (CVHS), as well as seven CVH metrics. This cross-sectional study extracted data from the STEPwise approach to surveillance surveys in 36 LMICs between 2010 and 2020. We assessed CVHS using the sum score in seven metrics defined by American Heart Association: (1) ≥ 150 min/week of moderate, or 75 min/week of vigorous activity, or an equivalent combination; (2) BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for non-Asians (< 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for Asians); (3) fruit and vegetable intake ≥ 4.5 servings per day; (4) nonsmoking; (5) blood pressure < 120/80 mmHg (untreated); (6) total cholesterol < 200 mg/dL (untreated); and (7) fasting blood glucose < 100 mg/dL (untreated). The ideal CVHS score ranged from 5 to 7. We disaggregated prevalence of ideal CVHS and seven metrics by education, and constructed Poisson regression models to adjust for other socioeconomic factors. Among 81,327 adult participants, the overall ideal CVHS prevalence for the studied countries was highest among individuals with primary education (52.9%, 95% CI: 51.0-54.9), surpassing those of other education levels - 48.0% (95% CI: 44.6-51.3, P = 0.003) for those with no education and 39.1% (95% CI: 36.5-41.8, P < 0.001) for those with tertiary education. Five (ideal physical activity, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and blood glucose) in seven CVH metrics peaked among participants with primary or secondary education. For instance, the prevalence of ideal blood pressure among individuals with primary education was 34.4% (95% CI: 32.7-36.1), higher than the prevalence in other education levels, ranging from 28.6% to 32.3%. These patterns were concentrated in low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries, while in upper-middle-income countries, the prevalence of ideal CVHS increased with higher education levels, ranging from 15.4% for individuals with no education to 33.1% for those with tertiary education. In LMICs, the association between education and ideal CVHS, along with several CVH metrics, exhibited un inverted U-shape, which may be closely related to the different stages of epidemiologic transition.",

        "abstract": "The exponential increase in obesity is responsible for the increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Weight loss is critical to improvement in OSA. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonism-based therapies (GLP1RA-BT) have been associated with significant weight loss. Several randomized controlled trials have been published evaluating the use of GLP1RA-BT on OSA. However, the literature review revealed that no systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) has been published evaluating the efficacy and safety of GLP1RA-BT in OSA. Electronic databases were searched for studies documenting the use of GLP1RA-BT in OSA. The primary outcome was to evaluate the impact on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the impact on percent change in AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Score, body weight, blood pressure, and side-effect profile. From initially screened 59 articles, data from 4 articles having 5 different randomized cohorts (937 patients) were analysed in this SRM. Use of GLP1RA-BT was associated with a significant reduction in AHI [MD-12.50 events/ hour (95% CI:-17.33 - -7.67); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup>=95%], percent-reduction in AHI [MD-52.17% (95% CI: -64.49 - -39.85); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], percent-reduction in body-weight [MD-12.46% (95% CI:-22.54 - -2.39); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 99%] and systolic blood-pressure [MD -4.59 mm of Hg (95% CI:-6.61 - -2.58); P < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 67%]. The considerable heterogeneity was because of greater improvement in outcomes withtirzepatide compared to liraglutide. The occurrence of nausea [RR4.23 (95% CI: 2.73-6.55); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], vomiting [RR4.22 (95% CI: 2.12-8.41); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], diarrhoea [RR2.81 (95% CI: 1.84-4.31); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], and constipation [RR4.51 (95% CI: 2.47-8.26); <i>P</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%] were significantly higher with GLP1RA-BT compared to placebo.

The history of mental disorders was used as a proxy for diagnosis. The data came from the COMET-G study (40 countries; 54,826 subjects, 64.73 % females, 35.45±13.51 years old). The analysis included descriptive statistics, Risk Ratios, t-tests, and ANCOVA's. <sup>24</sup>.14 % reported a history of any mental disorder (depression >12 %, non-affective psychosis and Bipolar disorder 1 % each, >20 % self-injury, >10 % had attempted suicide, 7.17 % illegal substance abuse). Most patients were not under any kind of treatment (59.44 %) and most were not receiving treatment as recommended (e.g. 90 % of Bipolar and 2/3 of psychotic patients). No treatment at all and psychotherapy as monotherapy were consistently related to poorer outcomes. In anxiety or depression, only antidepressant monotherapy and benzodiazepines, in Bipolar disorder only antipsychotic monotherapy in males and antidepressant monotherapy in females and in non-affective psychosis antipsychotics and psychotherapy in females only, were related to good outcomes. No treatment modality was related to a good outcome in those with a history of self-harm, suicidal attempts, or illegal substance use. Only depression and treatment with antidepressants were related to metabolic syndrome. In the community, the overwhelming majority of mental patients do not receive appropriate treatment or, even worse, no treatment at all. The outcome is unfavourable for the majority and only a few selective treatment options seem to make a difference.",

Little is known about their effectiveness in improving hypertension outcomes. We conducted a narrative literature review to document features of select supply-side (pay-for-performance, capitation) and demand-side [conditional cash transfers (CCT), vouchers] financing interventions focused on improving hypertension outcomes in primary care settings. Our review confirmed the paucity of studies, especially from LMICs. Pay-for-performance and capitation had small effects on screening, prescription practices, and blood pressure (BP) control. CCTs had mixed effects on screening and modest effects on BP control. Information on causal pathways, unintended consequences, and the use of vouchers was sparse. We then developed a conceptual model identifying pathways through which financing interventions influence hypertension outcomes. Based on this model, simulations in the context of Bangladesh indicated that pay-for-performance demands substantial financial resources but could become more favorable with increased treatment coverage.",

        "abstract": "To sustain positive progress toward sustainable development goals as envisioned in goal 3 and beyond, safe and affordable care during pregnancy and birth for women, their families, and health facilities and professionals is essential. In this systematic review, we report the best available evidence regarding the cost and cost-effectiveness of birth in various settings, including hospitals, birth centres, and homes for women at low risk of complications from high-, middle-, and low-income countries. We conducted a systematic review of cost and economic evaluation papers, following the comprehensive search of online databases, including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and grey literature, using predetermined search strategies. Both partial and full economic evaluation studies were included, and we appraised them using Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) critical appraisal checklists for economic evaluation studies. Although we attempted to pool total incremental net benefit, the results were synthesised narratively without a meta-analysis due to the high heterogeneity between primary studies. From 2307 identified studies, 11 studies (13 country level records from 11 countries) were included. Both direct and indirect costs of childbirth at home, midwife-led birth units (MLBUs), and hospitals were reported. Ten studies showed that births in MLBUs were less costly than hospital births, while home births were also reported to be less costly than hospital births in seven studies. Regarding cost-effectiveness, in Bangladesh, MLBUs generally showed better outcomes at lower costs than hospital births, while one site had higher costs. In Pakistan and Uganda, MLBUs displayed mixed results, with some being cost-effective and others more costly with poorer outcomes. In the Netherlands, MLBUs were less costly but had poorer outcomes, whereas home births were less costly and more effective. In Belgium, MLBUs were less costly but less effective in reducing caesarean and instrumental births, though they did reduce epidural analgesia use cost-effectively. Most studies found that births in MLBUs and at home were less costly than births in hospital. There is the potential for these settings to provide a cost-effective option for women through reduced intervention rates and favourable outcomes in high-income countries and could offer birthing options to women in low- and middle-income countries that includes care by skilled maternity practitioners in potentially more affordable settings.",

The review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023476119). Our search identified 12,853 citations, from which we included 11 studies conducted in 10 countries. Most studies (n = 7) were cross-sectional. Gender analysis of antibiotic prescribing in the included studies did not show a consistent pattern in the likelihood of antibiotic prescription based on gender. The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were azithromycin, amoxicillin, cephalexins, penicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole, primarily for respiratory infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, COVID-19, skin, and musculoskeletal diseases. Most studies did not report dose compliance. Our systematic review identifies gender as a factor in antibiotic prescribing that remains insufficiently explored.

This study examines the influence of cardiorenal risk factors, socioeconomic status, and ethnic and cardiovascular comorbidities on ESKD outcomes in the general population. This cross-sectional study analysed data from 502,408 UK Biobank study participants recruited between 2006 and 2010. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to assess risk factors for ESKD, with results presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 1191 (0.2%) of the study participants reported ESKD. Diabetes increased ESKD risk by 62% [1.62 (1.36-1.93)], with early-onset diabetes (before age 40) conferring higher odds compared to later-onset (after age 40) [2.26 (1.57-3.24)]. Similarly, early-onset hypertension (before age 40), compared to later onset (after age 40), increased ESKD odds by 73% [1.73 (1.21-2.44)]. Cardiovascular comorbidities, including stroke, hypertension, myocardial infarction and angina, were strongly associated with ESKD [5.97 (3.99-8.72), 5.35 (4.38-6.56), 4.94 (3.56-6.78), and 4.89 (3.47-6.81)], respectively. Males were at 22% higher risk of ESKD than females [1.22 (1.04-1.43)]. Each additional year of diabetes duration increased ESKD odds by 2% [1.02 (1.01-1.03)]. Non-white ethnicity, compared to white and socioeconomically most deprived, compared to the least deprived quintiles, were at 70% and 83% higher odds of ESKD. Each unit of HbA1c rise increased the odds of ESKD by 2%. Compared to microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria increased the odds of ESKD by almost 10-fold [9.47 (7.95-11.27)] while normoalbuminuria reduced the odds by 73% [0.27 (0.22-0.32)]. Early onset of diabetes and hypertension, male sex, non-white ethnicity, deprivation, poor glycaemic control, and prolonged hyperglycaemia are significant risk factors for ESKD. These findings highlight the complexity of ESKD and the need for multifactorial targeted interventions in high-risk populations. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "Most child deaths can be averted through prompt and appropriate treatment of child illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malaria. However, research has suggested that increases in care seeking do not necessarily mean that quality care is being received. We assessed the service readiness and process quality of curative healthcare during childhood and determined whether children are receiving health services with sufficient quality across countries. We linked data from household surveys including the standard Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey to data from facility surveys including the Service Provision Assessment and Health Facility Assessment in Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania to estimate the effective coverage of child illness treatment. We assessed the gaps in service availability and coverage, lack of service readiness, missed care opportunities, and inadequate service process, where service readiness and process quality were defined according to global standards with country-specific adaptations. We analysed the service readiness, quality of care, and effective coverage by individual illness and combined illnesses accounting for equity dimensions. Seven to 42% of children experienced at least one illness. An integrated management of child illnesses (IMCI) service was available in 58-85% of facilities. We found that 55-66% of health facilities in the countries were ready to deliver treatment to sick children. However, the readiness-adjusted contact suggested that child healthcare was mostly sought in facilities with low readiness score, ranging from 15% (Nepal) to 46.0% (Malawi). Health facilities had low diagnostics, supervision, and trained personnel capacity to manage child illnesses. Concerning the quality of care, only 51-60% of the procedures during clinical encounters were in line with standards. Counselling of caretakers had the lowest score, while treatment components had the highest process quality score. Hospitals had higher readiness and process quality scores compared to primary facilities and the private sector. There were, however, large gaps in service readiness and significant inadequate service processes in all countries; 35% (Haiti) to 79% (Bangladesh) of sick children sought care from a health facility, with only 7% (Nepal) to 29% (Malawi) of them actually receiving appropriate treatment. We found large inequalities in care seeking, quality of care, and effective coverage across levels of education and poverty, and places of residence. A large proportion of facilities did not meet the required capacity to provide IMCI services. The provision of health services has major quality gaps, highlighting the need for strengthening health service access, capacity and quality of care to reach universal child health coverage.",

        "title": "A group psychological intervention for postnatal depression in British mothers of South Asian origin - the ROSHNI-2 RCT.",
        "abstract": "Postnatal depression is more common in British South Asian women than white women in the United Kingdom. Despite empirical evidence suggesting the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy as a first line of treatment, little evidence is available regarding its applicability to different minority ethnic groups. Determining the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a culturally adapted group psychological intervention (Positive Health Programme) in primary care for British South Asian women with postnatal depression compared with treatment as usual. General practices and children's centres in the North West, East Midlands, Yorkshire, Glasgow and London. British South Asian women meeting the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (Fifth Edition) depression criteria, aged 16 years or above, with infants up to 12 months. A multicentre randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot and partially nested design to compare treatment as usual plus the Positive Health Programme with treatment as usual in British South Asian women with postnatal depression, with a qualitative study to examine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. The Positive Health Programme, a culturally adapted group intervention based on the principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy delivered by facilitators over 12 sessions. The primary outcome was recovery from depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ≤ 7) at end of intervention (approximately 4-6 months). Analysis of the primary outcome and the long-term follow-up (at 12 months) used a logistic random-effects model to estimate the odds ratio of caseness between treatments, adjusting for centre, severity of depression and education at baseline. Cost data were collected using an Economic Patient Questionnaire. Seven hundred and thirty-two participants across four study centres were randomised by the Manchester Clinical Trials Unit. At 4 months, almost half of patients in the treatment (Positive Health Programme) group were recovered (138 or 49%), whereas 105 (37%) were recovered in the control (treatment as usual) group. By 12 months, the control (treatment as usual) and treatment (Positive Health Programme) group had over 50% recovery at 140 (54%) and 141 (54%), respectively. For the primary outcome, recovery from postnatal depression at end of intervention, we found a significant effect such that the odds of achieving recovery in the treatment group were almost twice as high compared to the treatment as usual group (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 3.10). Between the two groups, there was no significant difference in the odds of recovery at 12 months (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.66), highlighting a need for more intensive therapies and/or longer-term care plans for this group of patients. The intervention was considered feasible and acceptable from the perspectives of Positive Health Programme participants, facilitators, and general practitioners. The findings suggest improved emotional and social support and an enhanced sense of well-being. Positive Health Programme implementation was estimated to cost an average of £408 per participant. The intention-to-treat analysis shows that the Positive Health Programme intervention costs £22,198 per quality-adjusted life-year gain. Positive Health Programme was cost-effective on average but with a substantial uncertainty: the probability that Positive Health Programme was cost-effective was 44% (65%) at the willingness to pay £20,000 (£30,000) per quality-adjusted life-year. The Positive Health Programme was highly cost-effective for those who attended 5-8 sessions, costing £9040 per quality-adjusted life-year. The study sample limits generalisability with other ethnic minority groups, and the cost-effectiveness analysis did not explore recall bias. The results of this study provide robust evidence that the culturally adapted psychological intervention for postnatal depression in South Asian women is effective at the primary end point and acceptable to women. Further development of the Positive Health Programme intervention and evaluation, with longer-term outcome follow-ups and exploration of cost-effectiveness of remote delivery of the Positive Health Programme.

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasing threat for health-care systems in the world. Primary causes of CKD are diabetes and vascular diseases. So, optimal management of CKD includes cardiovascular risk reduction, treatment of albuminuria, avoidance of potential nephrotoxins and adjustments to drug dosing. Patients also require monitoring for complications of CKD, such as hypocalcemia, hyper-kalemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic acidosis, hyper-phosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyper-parathyroidism and anaemia. This cross-sectional study was executed in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College, in collaboration with the Department of Nephrology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2022 to June 2023. The subjects were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria by purposive non-random sampling. A sum of 120 subjects was included in this study. Out of them, 60 were selected as case of CKD patients and another 60 apparently normal healthy persons were selected as control. In this study, serum lipid profile was measured for analytical study. All the values were showed as mean±SD and these were serum TC were 149.85±38.84 in Group I and 178.92±41.85mg/dl in Group II; Serum TG were 122.77±36.88 in Group I and 175.93±63.50mg/dl in Group II; Serum LDL-C were 95.13±24.43 in Group I and 115.60±45.62 mg/dl in Group II and Serum HDL-C were 48.62±8.70 and 41.55±2.79mg/dl in Group I and Group II respectively. Statistical analysis was done by using statistical package for social science (SPSS), windows package version 26.0. The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control was evaluated using Student's unpaired 't' test. After careful evaluation, the present study found that mean serum total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG) and Low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) level were significantly increased and High density lipoprotein (HDL-C) level were significantly decreased in CKD patients.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the status of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and associated factors among children aged 0-23 months in the low-income regions of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. A community-based cross-sectional study. Low-income regions of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. 530 children aged 0-23 months and their mothers. Prevailing IYCF practices were assessed against the 17 indicators of IYCF recommended by the WHO/UNICEF in 2021. Modified Poisson regression models were built to explore the relation between socio-demographic variables and each of the selected IYCF indicators (early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF), exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF) and minimum acceptable diet (MAD)). More than two-thirds of the children were reported to follow appropriate breastfeeding practices (EIBF, 70.4% and EBF, 60.9%). Among the complementary feeding indicators, almost half of the children (48.8%) were reported to meet MMF; however, only about 26% of the children reportedly met the MDD with a consequent low prevalence (22.9%) of the composite indicator MAD. More than half (55%) of the children were reported to consume egg and/or flesh food consumption; still, inappropriate dietary practices were observed among 60% had unhealthy food consumption, and 56% had zero vegetable or fruit consumption). Child age was a significant determinant of IYCF practices. The children of mothers with no pregnancy complications exhibited a greater chance of having EIBF (estimate: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.42, p=0.02), MDD (Estimate: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.55, p=0.02), and MAD (estimate: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.77, p=0.03) compared with the children of mothers with pregnancy complications. The children with a mother having secondary or higher education had a higher chance of having MDD (estimate: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.76, p=0.003) and MMF (estimate: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.56, p=0.02) than the children of mothers having primary or no education. Similarly, children from higher-income households had a higher chance of getting MDD (estimate: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.03, p=0.02), and MAD (estimate: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.64, p=0.01) compared with children from lower-income households. IYCF practices among a considerable proportion of children aged 0-23 months in the low-income regions of Dhaka City were found to be suboptimal and predicted by children's age, maternal education and pregnancy complications, and household income.",

This was an observational, retrospective cohort study using patient-level data from Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Italy, Malawi, Nigeria, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey from patients with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or sepsis, regardless of COVID-19 positivity, who were admitted to critical care units or COVID-19 specialized wards. The changes of antimicrobial prescription between pre-pandemic and pandemic were estimated using logistic or linear regression. Pandemic effects on month-wise antimicrobial usage were evaluated using interrupted time series analyses (ITSAs). Antimicrobials for which prescriptions significantly increased during the pandemic were as follows: meropenem in Bangladesh (95% CI: 1.94-4.07) with increased prescribed daily dose (PDD) (95% CI: 1.17-1.58) and Turkey (95% CI: 1.09-1.58), moxifloxacin in Bangladesh (95% CI: 4.11-11.87) with increased days of therapy (DOT) (95% CI: 1.14-2.56), piperacillin/tazobactam in Italy (95% CI: 1.07-1.48) with increased DOT (95% CI: 1.01-1.25) and PDD (95% CI: 1.05-1.21) and azithromycin in Bangladesh (95% CI: 3.36-21.77) and Brazil (95% CI: 2.33-8.42). ITSA showed a significant drop in azithromycin usage in India (95% CI: -8.38 to -3.49 g/100 patients) and South Korea (95% CI: -2.83 to -1.89 g/100 patients) after WHO guidelines v1 release and increased meropenem usage (95% CI: 93.40-126.48 g/100 patients) and moxifloxacin (95% CI: 5.40-13.98 g/100 patients) in Bangladesh and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in India (95% CI: 0.92-9.32 g/100 patients) following the Delta variant emergence.

        "abstract": "This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the preoperative prevalence of primary esophageal motility disorders and gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients with morbid obesity before bariatric surgery. The use of esophageal manometry ± 24-hour pH study before bariatric surgery was explored. Articles on preoperative conventional or high-resolution manometry ± 24-hours pH-study or both before bariatric surgery between 1999 and 2023 were identified using the Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Systematic Reviews, and Science Citation Index. The search terms were selected for each search engine to optimize the published literature and meet the inclusion criteria. The modified AXIS was used as a critical appraisal tool to assess the quality of studies. Thirty-three studies performing preoperative esophageal manometry ± pH studies or both were identified. Various manometric abnormalities have been described by the authors depending on the type of technique used. Twenty-two studies undertook a 24-hour ambulatory pH study to identify abnormal acid exposure. Twenty studies performed preoperative gastroscopy. The incidence of hiatal hernia varied from 5.4% to 52.6%, and reflux esophagitis from 4.4% to 42%. The preoperative prevalence of PEMD and GERD was significant in patients with morbid obesity. This implies that the selection of the most appropriate bariatric procedure needs to be tailored not only for weight reduction but also for the prevention of further deterioration in esophageal motor function and GERD and its future consequences, such as Barrett's esophagus, erosive esophagitis, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, in both the short and long term.",

        "abstract": "Swift and safe transport of road traffic injury patients for life-saving interventions requires a functioning ambulance system which is largely lacking in the low- and middle-income countries. This study explored the current situation of ambulance-based prehospital care services in Bangladesh to inform the development of an evidence-based national ambulance system. A cross-sectional study conducted in five selected districts of Bangladesh, employing qualitative and quantitative approaches, elicited data on the 29 ambulances and the knowledge and skills of their operators. Findings were validated through 32 key informant interviews with relevant stakeholders on their experiences and insights towards developing a national ambulance system in the country. Most of the ambulances were 'makeshift ambulances' (converted microbus) and commonly lacked the necessary supplies and equipment, including a Global Positioning System tracker or location identifier system. Around 20 drivers had 10+years of work experience, but none were trained in first-aid. Some drivers developed a few life-saving skills like removing foreign bodies from the airway or immobilising fractured limbs, etc from work experiences. The public sector ambulances were mostly used for transporting referral patients and, quite frequently, for transporting staff. Public ambulances had government-determined fixed rates, whereas private ambulances did not. The responsible authority/operator for the public sector ambulances was ambiguous and not coordinated by any local/central authority. The 'ambulance' service in the country is rudimentary, fragmented and poorly resourced, lacking any central/regional level coordination. A recommendation is made to develop a national ambulance service, integrating public and private sectors and operating under a central/regional authority.",
