        "abstract": "The Mediterranean form of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic in some regions of Iran and is often seen in children under 10 years old. There is a 90% mortality in patients, if diagnosis and treatment are not done on time. Canids, as reservoirs, play an important role in the spread of the disease. Bushehr Province, southern Iran is always mentioned as one of the endemic areas for VL, so for this purpose, as the first study in the region, 112 sheltered dogs in Bushehr City were evaluated for canine leishmaniasis (CanL) using serological Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) as well as detailed clinical examinations. Out of 112 samples collected, 71.4% of cases had anti-<i>L. infantum</i> IgG antibody titers of 1:80 and higher and therefore considered as seropositive. Furthermore, from the 70 seropositive dogs with antibody titer of 1:320 and higher, 47 (42%) had at least one of the clinical symptoms associated with VL and considered as cases with CanL. The current seroprevalence situation of dogs in this region, is very noticeable and can be an important alarm for policymakers and health system practitioners. More comprehensive and complementary parasitological studies should be carried out on a number of reservoirs in the region for diagnosis and treatment and to accurately determine the statistics of the disease compared to the obtained seroprevalence status.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of cutaneous leishmaniasis's (CL) clinical polymorphism by examining the relationship between clinical forms, duration of illness, and their spatiotemporal distribution. A retrospective study at University of Gondar Hospital analyzed cutaneous leishmaniasis patients treated from 2022 to 2024. Demographic and epidemiologic data were collected, with parasite detection via microscopic and clinical examination. Overall, 454 CL cases from 49 districts were diagnosed, predominantly affecting males aged ≤30, with a mean age of 25.31 yr (SD ±18.3). Significant differences were noted in age and sex (<i>P</i><0.05). Approximately 70% had lesions ≥4 cm. Most CL cases had 2+ parasite loads. Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) remained the primary treatment choice for patients. The spatial distribution of CL cases covered a larger geographical area, although the cases (>20) were concentrated in Central Gondar. The mucosal CL shared a similar geographical pattern with the recurrent CL type. Notably, 48% had chronic presentations and lived with the disease for ≥12 months. In diffuse CL (DCL) a longer delay was seen and its clinical presentation was associated with longitudinal time series. Acute patients exhibited a higher parasitic load than chronic ones (38% vs. 24%), respectively. CL significantly affected school-aged children. The symmetrical distribution of cases in districts studied could increase the attention of clinicians and enhance management strategies. Extended disease durations necessitated specialized treatments for clinical transitions.",

        "abstract": "<i>Leishmania major</i> is an obligate and intracellular pathogen and the macrophages are the cell hosts for <i>L. major</i>. Imiquimod stimulates macrophages to secrete different cytokines via the expression of TLRs. This study was carried out in the Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, in 2018. The effect of imiquimod was investigated on non-infected and infected macrophages with <i>L. major</i> on the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inflammatory cytokines. TLRs play an important role in enhancing the proceeding of phagocytosis and killing parasites. Moreover, the cytokines such as TNFα, IL6, and IL1, are often identified in inflammatory conditions as interfering targets in treatment. Healthy macrophages and macrophages infected with <i>Leishmania major</i> parasites were affected by different concentrations of imiquimod, after that the expression of TLR genes (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9) and cytokines were evaluated by real time RT-PCR. For experiments in laboratory animals, infected BALB/c mice were exposed to imiquimod and then isolated peritoneal macrophages. The expression of TLR2 decreased in non-infected macrophages were affected by the imiquimod. The expression level of TLR7 in healthy macrophages, decreased and the difference with control group was significant. Imiquimod increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines and IL12 in mouse macrophages and also decrease the expression of IL10. This suggests that imiquimod may improve the therapeutic effects in infected mice with <i>Leishmania major</i>. Imiquimod causes that TLR2 decreased expression but TLR7 and TLR9 increased expression. Imiquimod as TLR7 agonist, enhance the recovery of leishmaniasis.",

This study investigates the therapeutic potential of oral tolerance (OT) induced by a genetically modified strain of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) producing heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) from Mycobacterium leprae in a murine model of CL. BALB/c mice were infected with L. braziliensis and treated orally with HSP65-producing L. lactis or control L. lactis (empty vector) for four consecutive days, starting at 4 weeks post-infection. Mice receiving HSP65-producing L. lactis showed reduced lesion size and parasite burden. Cytokine analysis in draining lymph nodes revealed a shift from a pro-inflammatory IFN-γ response to an increased IL-10 production, correlating with milder inflammation and less tissue damage. Additionally, the treatment promoted an increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs), including CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>LAP<sup>+</sup> (membrane-associated TGF-β) cells in the draining lymph nodes. This therapeutic effect was not observed in a more severe model of CL using Leishmania major. This study underscores the potential of oral tolerance induction using HSP65-producing L. lactis as a promising immunoregulatory therapeutic approach for some chronic inflammatory infections, mainly those that display a primed balance in immune response.",

        "abstract": "Zoonotic canine leishmaniosis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is a fatal disease worldwide in both humans and the reservoir host, dogs. The primary route of transmission is via sand fly bite. Vertical, transplacental, transmission of L. infantum to offspring has been shown to be critical for maintenance of infection in both endemic and non-endemic areas. In the United States, canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is enzootic within hunting dog populations. Previous work with US hunting dogs found that transplacental transmission of L. infantum occurs frequently with high infectivity. Dogs born to CanL infected mothers were almost fourteen times more likely to become positive for L. infantum over their lifetime. Globally, public health agencies control CanL through canine and human case detection and treatment, and in some cases dog culling and reducing vector populations. There is no specific strategy to control vertical transmission of CanL. A previous randomized field trial in US hunting dogs found that a Leishmania A2 protein, saponin-adjuvanted, vaccine (LeishTec) used as an immunotherapy, significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically overt leishmaniasis by 30% in asymptomatic dogs. It is unknown whether maternal vaccination could inhibit infection risk in her offspring. We hypothesized that dogs born to infected and vaccinated dams would be less likely to test diagnostically positive via L. infantum specific kqPCR or serology compared to dogs born to infected unvaccinated mothers. A population of dogs born to L. infantum infected dams were evaluated to assess LeishTec vaccination to prevent transmission to offspring. Dogs born to unvaccinated, L. infantum infected, dams had higher mortality (12.50% vs 0.00%), higher likelihood of clinical disease (94.12% vs 59.00%) and were more likely to be diagnostically positive for CanL (22.22% vs 4.55%). Vaccination of dams already infected prior to pregnancy greatly reduced the risk of transplacental transmission of L. infantum. Incorporating vertical transmission prevention as a public health intervention in countries where Leishmania is endemic could aid in infection control.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis continues to pose a significant global health challenge, exacerbated by the increasing resistance to current therapeutic agents such as miltefosine and amphotericin B. This growing resistance highlights the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies. In this context, phytomedicine has emerged as a promising avenue for novel antileishmanial therapies. In our previous study, the crude extract derived from neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves exhibited notable antileishmanial activity. Subsequent analysis using LC-MS/MS enabled the identification of bioactive constituents within the active fraction, including azadiradione (AZD), a drug with potential therapeutic effects unexplored against leishmaniasis. AZD exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition along with structural disruption and DNA fragmentation in promastigotes with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 17.09 μM. In silico docking and simulation with AZD identified Leishmania peroxidases (e.g., ascorbate peroxidase and tryparedoxin peroxidase) as probable molecular targets, with subsequent downregulation of their expression confirmed in vitro. The CC<sub>50</sub> on human macrophages (MФs) and EC<sub>50</sub> on intracellular amastigotes were determined as 56.32 μM and 11.67 μM for AZD, respectively. The dose-dependent reduction in MФs' infectivity demonstrates the drug potential of AZD against the pathogenic stage of Leishmania. However, the selectivity index (SI) of AZD was calculated as 4.83, indicating a moderate Leishmania-specific drug potential of AZD. The decrease in IL-10, IL-1β, and arginase expression and the increase in IL-12 and iNOS expression reinforce the immunoregulatory potential of AZD in favour of the host. Further investigations are required to optimize the dosage and improve the selectivity of AZD before proposing it for the treatment of Leishmania infection. This study demonstrated the novel findings related to the drug potential of AZD with defined Leishmania targets and host protective cytokine response. Studies on animal models may deliver further insights into its therapeutic potential.",

        "abstract": "In 2023, Brazil accounted for 93.5% of the reported cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Latin America. This study, employing a One Health approach aims: i) to analyse the spatial distribution of VL using integrated geospatial methods, ii) the temporal trend of VL to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence of cases, and iii) identify spatial clusters of municipalities with heightened environmental vulnerability to prioritise surveillance and control efforts for VL in São Paulo state, Brazil. Archival databases from 1999 to 2022 were analysed. High-risk clusters of human VL (HVL) were identified using the Local Moran Index. Incidence and mortality rates were modelled with the Generalized Additive Model. Data on the distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis vectors were obtained from São Paulo's Supervision in Control of Endemics, while the spatial distribution of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was based on survey data from the Adolfo Lutz Institute. Environmental factors, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and geomorphology, were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and Environmental Information Database (BDiA) platform. Lutzomyia longipalpis was detected in 32.4% of municipalities, CVL in 29.0%, and HVL in 18.0%. The western region, characterised by plateau geomorphology, elevated deforestation, and higher temperatures, accounted for 30.6% of high-risk clusters, underscoring its priority status for control and surveillance. While VL cases remain stable during the COVID-19 pandemic, lethality rates increased. Addressing VL and reducing lethality rates will pose a significant challenge for public health authorities in São Paulo in the coming years.",

        "abstract": "To systematically review and analyze reported cases of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO)-related optic neuritis (ON) without retinal involvement, a potentially sight-threatening complication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). A PRISMA-guided search of online databases from inception to January 31, 2025, identified case reports and series describing HZO-related ON without retinal involvement. Study quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Data on demographics, clinical features, diagnostics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed using SPSS. Thirty-two studies (1919-2025) comprising 38 patients were included. The mean patient age was 52.6 years (ranging from 6 to 82), with a near-equal gender distribution. Comorbid conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders were noted in one-third of cases. ON most commonly presented unilaterally and ipsilateral to the dermatome of HZO. The mean interval from HZO onset to ON was approximately 22 days (ranging from 10 days prior to 150 days afterward). Blurred vision and eye pain were the most frequent symptoms. Common signs include visual field defect, congestion, mydriasis, and ophthalmoplegia. Keratitis was the most common observation in slit-lamp examination (62.8% (22 of 35 cases)). Corticosteroid therapy, including high-dose and pulse regimens, was administered in a third-fourth (28 of 38) of patients. In outcome assessment, 52.8% (19 of 36) achieved mild or no impairment, while 36.3% (12 of 36) experienced clinical blindness. HZO-related ON is an uncommon but significant sight-threatening complication in HZO. Timely diagnosis and appropriate antiviral treatment along with corticosteroid therapy may improve the visual prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia has typically been linked to high-altitude regions but has recently emerged at an unusually low altitude of 500 meters in the Somali Region, raising public health concerns. Cutaneous leishmaniasis has not been previously identified in the region. There is a conflict in the starting area and only militias have been infected with very serious lesions. Routine clinical and socio-demographic information was extracted from the patient chart using a case report form. Additionally, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from 30 patients suspected for CL. Skin scraping and fine needle aspirates were collected from the raised edges, nodular and centre of the lesions followed by DNA extraction using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. There were a total of 1050 CL patients recruited, all of them were male militia members, immunologically naïve and displaced into a conflict area with a likely sylvatic transmission cycle. We identified Leishmania tropica as the causative species, challenging the previous assumption that L. aethiopica was the primary agent of CL in Ethiopia. Notably, over 77% of patients had more than 10 lesions, a presentation atypical for L. tropica elsewhere. Phlebotomus orientalis and P. sergenti, vectors for visceral leishmaniasis and CL in North Africa respectively, were found in the outbreak area. Further research is needed to explore the eco-epidemiology of the outbreak and patient's treatment responses. Insights will help develop management strategies to control this newly emerging form of CL, prevent its spread to other regions and hybridization with Leishmania strains causing VL endemic in the area.",

        "abstract": "Current treatment available for leishmaniasis is fraught with numerous problems, so the search for new treatment alternatives for leishmaniasis is urgent and necessary. The proteasome has been selected as a promising target. Marizomib is a proteasome inhibitor and has shown antitumor effects, with ongoing clinical tests. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> effects of Marizomib on <i>Leishmania amazonensis</i> and <i>Leishmania infantum</i>. Interestingly, Marizomib was not effective against promastigote forms of <i>L. amazonensis</i> and <i>L. infantum in vitro</i> but showed a significant effect against intracellular amastigotes of <i>L. amazonensis</i> and <i>L. infantum</i>, showing selectivity for the parasite when compared to the host cell. Furthermore, through transmission electron microscopy, it was possible to show that Marizomib induces extensive ultrastructural changes in amastigotes of <i>L. amazonensis</i> and <i>L. infantum</i>, such as the appearance of many vacuoles in the parasite cytoplasm and mitochondrial swelling. Marizomib was also shown to be effective in a murine model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, with a reduction in the size of lesions and parasite load in the footpads and draining lymph nodes of animals infected with <i>L. amazonensis</i>. It is also effective in a model of visceral leishmaniasis, with a reduction in parasite load in the spleen and liver of animals infected with <i>L. infantum</i>. Importantly, Marizomib, in the treatment regimens used, did not cause renal and hepatic acute toxicity to infected animals. These results highlight the antileishmanial potential of Marizomib, encouraging us to conduct preclinical tests in other animal models, as well as clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The interest in nanotechnology applications in medicine, particularly for combating microbial infections, has surged in recent years. This study investigated the in vitro and in vivo antileishmanial effects of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) that were green synthesised using Capparis spinosa fruit extract, both on their own and in conjunction with paromomycin (PM). CuNPs were synthesised from a methanolic extract of C. spinosa. We assessed the in vitro antileishmanial activity of CuNPs (10-200 μg/mL) as well as the same concentrations of CuNPs (10-200 μg/mL) combined with PM (10-200 μg/mL), targeting the promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania major. Additionally, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects of CuNPs on THP1 cells. Subsequently, we tested these formulations on female BALB/c mice infected with L. major. The study measured footpad swelling, quantified parasite load through real-time PCR, and assessed levels of cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and gamma interferon (IFN-ɤ), nitric oxide (NO), and arginase (ARG). The results demonstrated that CuNPs, particularly when combined with PM, significantly inhibited (p < 0.001) the growth of L. major promastigotes and amastigotes and stimulated IFN-ɤ, NO production and reduced IL-4 and ARG levels (p < 0.05). Importantly, CuNPs exhibited minimal cytotoxicity towards THP1 cells. In infected mice, the treatment with CuNPs, notably in combination with PM, resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the mean number of parasites. Treatment with CuNPs at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/mL led to a decrease in lesion diameter. The results of this study highlight the potent antileishmanial activity and synergistic effects of CuNPs, both alone and in combination with PM, against L. major promastigotes and amastigote forms, as well as their potential in treating cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in BALB/c mice.",

        "abstract": "Protozoal infections remain a significant global health burden despite significant progress in understanding these infections in recent years due to the continuing emergence of multidrug resistance among protozoal parasites. This review focuses on recent innovations in protozoal disease treatment aimed at combating this growing challenge of drug resistance. The escalating prevalence of multidrug resistance among protozoal parasites, especially those responsible for widespread diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis, is rapidly emerging as a grave threat to human health worldwide. This resistance undermines the efficacy of existing treatments, making it imperative to develop and explore novel therapeutic approaches. Diverse strategies, including the concept of hybrid drugs, the development of advanced analogs of existing drugs, and drug repurposing, have been employed to counter drug resistance by outmaneuvering the evolution of resistant parasites and restoring the effectiveness of treatments. In this review, we delve into the significant findings reported between 2020 and 2024, with the aim of providing an overview of the state of protozoal disease treatment, highlighting the progress made, exploring promising avenues for tackling these devastating diseases, and offering insights into future directions for overcoming the persistent challenge of drug resistance. Given that the emergence of drug resistance calls for a multifaceted approach to address protozoal infections, long-term success depends on interdisciplinary research collaborations, equitable access to treatment, and appropriate drug resistance surveillance, in addition to the advancement of research and the development of therapeutic strategies described in this review.",

Here, we present a patient with a venous ulcer that mimics cutaneous leishmaniasis and mycetoma lesions. A 50-year-old female patient presented with a nonhealing venous ulcer in her right lower leg, which was suspected to be cutaneous leishmaniasis, ulcerated mycetoma lesions, and misdiagnosed as cutaneous leishmaniasis. She was referred to Rufa'a teaching hospital, Al-Gezira State, Sudan, where color Doppler sonography results revealed several findings that are consistent with chronic venous insufficiency, including incompetent superficial femoral junction (SFJ) with short reflux among the great saphenous vein (GSV) and incompetent saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) with short reflux along the small saphenous vein (SSV). Additionally, the examination showed patency and compressibility of both GSV and SSV, as well as the presence of superficial varicose veins. Surgical closure of the fistula was done. This case report highlights the challenges in distinguishing venous ulcers from mycetoma and cutaneous leishmaniasis. The current case emphasizes the importance of considering a comprehensive assessment of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and potentially other diagnostic tests. Collaborating with experienced healthcare providers, such as dermatologists or wound care specialists, may also be beneficial in confirming the diagnosis and developing an appropriate treatment plan.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis, an infectious disease transmitted via sand flies is caused by the protozoan parasite of Leishmania spp. The treatment of this disease is quite challenging due to the high cost, resistance, and toxicity of conventional drugs. Various research studies have demonstrated that plant based drug possess least toxicity, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Here, evaluation of anti-leishmanial activity of methanolic Prunus amygdalus var. amara seed extract was conducted and found that it inhibited L. donovani proliferation and cause apoptosis. Moreover, its combinations with miltefosine enhanced antileishmanial effects. GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of various phytochemicals in the extract that contributed pharmacological efficacy. These findings highlighted the potential of herbal products as a valuable source of new treatments for leishmaniasis. The antileishmanial effect was determined by promastigote and amastigote assays. Parasite load was evaluated by staining L. donovani-infected macrophages with modified Giemsa stain. Cytotoxicity of seed extract was estimated by MTT (3-(4, 5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. In addition, Pro-apoptotic events were inferred using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Further characterization of phytoconstituents was evaluated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The extract promoted a dose-dependent reduction in growth of promastigotes (IC50 = 43.12 ± 3.03 μg/ml) and amastigotes (IC50 = 49.65 ± 3.34 μg/ml). Further, extract in combination with miltefosine showed enhanced antileishmanial activity against both forms of the L. donovani, promastigotes (IC50 = 4.547 ± 1.2 μg/ml) as well as amastigotes (IC50 = 19.54 ± 2.4 μg/ml). Early-stage apoptotic events were also observed in promastigote forms by determining the increased expression of LdMetacaspase and PARP1. The cytotoxic potential on THP-1 differentiated macrophages was assessed and indicated insignificant cytotoxicity of different doses of the extract (CC50 = 799.19 ± 134.59 μg/ml) and in combination with miltefosine (CC50 = 384.16 ± 177.47 μg/ml). Furthermore, the presence of phytocompounds like chaulmoogric acid and hydnocarpic acid was described, for the first time, in Prunus amygdalus var. amara seed extract. The findings indicated that EPA plays a significant role in combating leishmaniasis and holds promise as a potential treatment for this disease. Moreover, when combined with miltefosine, EPA demonstrated increased effectiveness against leishmaniasis. Therefore, the combination of EPA and miltefosine presents a more promising outlook as a potential therapy for leishmaniasis.",

We tested if an mRNA vaccine, encoding a protective leishmanial antigen, induced dTrm cells. The mRNA vaccine induced robust systemic T-cell responses, but few Trm cells were found in the skin. Since IL-12 promotes Th1 responses, we tested whether IL-12 mRNA combined with the mRNA vaccine could enhance dTrm cell development. This combination significantly expanded Leishmania-specific Th1 cells expressing skin-homing molecules and memory T cell markers in the draining lymph node. Additionally, higher numbers of dTrm cells were maintained in the skin, and mice exhibited functional immunity indicated by a delayed hypersensitivity response and protection upon challenge with Leishmania.

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe human vector-borne CD4-immunosuppressive disease that can be lethal if untreated soon after symptoms arise. No vaccine is available against human VL, and its chemotherapy is highly toxic and requires hospitalization. VL patients show substantially decreased CD4<sub>+</sub> total and <i>Leishmania</i>-specific CD4+ T cell counts. <i>Leishmania (L.) donovani</i> nucleoside hydrolase (NH36) is a DNA metabolism enzyme and a conserved marker of the <i>Leishmania</i> genus. It has been considered, among other <i>Leishmania</i> antigens, a vaccine candidate. In mice vaccinated with NH36, protection against VL is mediated by a CD4<sub>+</sub> T cell response to the NH36 C-terminal domain (F3), and against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), by a CD4+ response against F3 and a CD8+ response against the NH36 N-terminal (F1). Vaccination with a recombinant chimera containing the F1 and F3 domains expressed in tandem (F1F3) protected mice against the heterologous CL infection by <i>L. (L.) amazonensis</i> and <i>L. (V.) braziliensis</i>. In this investigation, BALB/c mice were immunized with either F1, F3, a mixture of both, or with the F1F3 chimera, plus saponin and challenged with amastigotes of <i>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</i>, the agent of VL in America. Before and after infection, the F1F3 chimera and the F3 vaccines promoted the highest IgA, IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 antibody responses. The F1F3 chimera promoted the strongest intradermal response against the leishmanial antigen, the highest body weight gain, and the most potent reduction of the spleen and liver relative weights. In addition, the F1F3 chimera vaccine increased the secretion of IFN-γ, and, together with the F3 vaccine, the secretion of TNF-α by splenocytes. The F1F3 chimera and the F1 vaccine also promoted the strongest secretion of IL-10, which was very low in mice immunized with F3. Thus, the IFN-γ/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-10 ratios, characteristic of a Th1 response, were increased in mice vaccinated with F3. The F1F3 chimera and the F3 vaccine reduced the parasite load in the liver. The F1F3 chimera, as described for the heterologous CL infections, also optimizes protection against the homologous visceral leishmaniasis infection by <i>L. (L.) infantum chagasi</i>, by a Th1 contribution from the F3 peptide and a regulatory response from the F1 peptide.

Evidence of the molecular epidemiology of CL in communities in endemic areas of Ethiopia is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology, distribution, and determinants of CL. This community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2022 and 2023 on 356 suspected CL cases. DNA was extracted from the skin-scraped samples, and Leishmania parasite detection and species identification were performed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Variable and multivariate binary logistic regressions with AORs and p values ≤ 0.05 were used to identify determinants and determine the strength of the associations. Among the 384 suspected cases, 356 were included in the study, resulting in a response rate of 92.7%. Among the 356 suspected cases, 253 (71.1%) were positive for the Leishmania parasite according to PCR. Leishmania aethiopica was the only causative agent of CL in this study area. More confirmed CL cases were recorded among those living in poor housing conditions.

In southern Europe, the main etiological agent is <i>Leishmania infantum,</i> transmitted by sandflies of the subfamily Phlebotominae, which is the most common cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in these regions, where dogs are considered the primary domestic reservoir of the parasite. A 7-year-old male non-sterilized Boxer named Ettore underwent pre-vaccination blood tests and Leishmania indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) test, which confirmed the presence of antibodies against the protozoan <i>Leishmania infantum</i> (antibody titer, 1:1280), supporting the diagnosis of CL. The dog underwent a therapeutic protocol consisting of miltefosine (Milteforan™ - Virbac®) (2 mg/Kg b.w. per os) for 28 days and allopurinol 300 mg (10 mg/Kg b.w. po) for 6 months. However, at the end of the treatment period, the appearance of a suspicious skin lesion on the left tarsus was reported, which appeared inflamed and infected. The subsequent antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy based on amoxicillin+clavulanic acid (12.5 mg/kg b.w. po for 15 days), metronidazole (75000UI + 12.5 mg po for 15 days), and prednisone (0.5 mg/kg b.w. po for 10 days) failed to be effective; thus, the lesion worsened and also spread to the dorsal femoral surface of both hind limbs, presenting as blackish, swollen, painful, alopecic and oozing bloody and purulent material. Mild renal microlithiasis and splenopathy were reported by abdominal ultrasound and were associated with a possible leishmania pattern. Finally, skin lesions were experimentally treated with subcutaneous injections of Glucantime® (200 mg/lesion - 0.5 mL/lesion) once a month for 5 months, followed by complete healing. Interestingly, the experimental localized treatment with Glucantime® proved to be crucial in counteracting Leishmania skin lesions. The results obtained suggest that, through an appropriate diagnosis, it is possible to define targeted and effective therapeutic protocols useful in the management of canine leishmaniasis.",

        "title": "Diagnostic Accuracy of Various Genetic Markers (tpi, gdh, and bg) for Prevalence and Genotyping of Giardia duodenalis in Human Samples: A Comparative Global Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
        "abstract": "Giardia duodenalis is a widespread intestinal protozoan causing giardiasis in humans and animals. Precise detection and genotyping of this parasite are vital for understanding its epidemiology, implementing appropriate treatments, and mitigating transmission. Molecular techniques, particularly multilocus genotyping (MLG) targeting the beta-giardin (bg), triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes, have improved diagnostic precision. However, variations in sensitivity and diagnostic performance among these genes can influence prevalence rates and genotyping results, particularly for assemblages A and B, the most common in humans. This study evaluated the pooled prevalence of G. duodenalis in human samples confirmed positive by microscopy and/or small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA), using bg, tpi, and gdh genes. A comprehensive literature search identified 32 studies with MLG design published up to January 13, 2025, encompassing 96 datasets from 21 countries on four continents. Data extraction and quality assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses employed a random-effects model using CMA software, with heterogeneity assessed via the I² statistic. Pooled prevalence and diagnostic accuracy were highest using the tpi gene (64.3%; 95% CI: 56.1-71.8%), followed by gdh (59.7%; 95% CI: 51.8-67.1%) and bg (58.3%; 95% CI: 49.8-66.3%). Nonetheless, a notable fraction of microscopy- and/or SSU rRNA-confirmed samples were undetected by these loci. Assemblage B was more prevalent than A across all genetic markers. The gdh gene showed superior sensitivity for assemblage B (59.5%), whereas bg had a slightly higher detection rate for assemblage A (41.6%). These findings underscore the importance of using multiple genetic markers for precise detection and genotyping. The tpi gene offers the highest sensitivity for overall prevalence among Giardia-positive samples, while gdh and bg contribute critical assemblage-specific insights. The higher prevalence of assemblage B underlines the need for targeted public health strategies, especially given its association with more severe or recurrent infections. Overall, integrating MLG with SSU rRNA analysis is essential for improving diagnostics, surveillance, and control strategies for giardiasis globally.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a tropical disease of public health concern, resulting from infection with Leishmania parasites and transmitted through the bite of infected female sandflies. Community awareness is an essential component of disease control and prevention. This study aimed to synthesize evidence on knowledge, attitudes, and practices about CL among the general population. A comprehensive literature search was performed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Springer, and ProQuest for studies published in English up to January 2025. Search terms included both MeSH and free-text keywords related to KAP toward CL. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data were extracted, and a random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was applied for pooling of studies. Heterogeneity was explored through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Knowledge was assessed by 47 studies (n = 21,930), while attitude was assessed by 32 studies (n = 13,171), and practice was evaluated by 30 studies (n = 13,729) for CL. Overall, the general population had an estimated 54.5%(95% CI: 47.8 to 61.1) good knowledge of CL, with positive attitudes at 56.2% (95% CI: 48.5 to 63.8), and practically 49.5% (95% CI: 40.3-53.8). A substantial heterogeneity was observed between studies (I2 > 98% in all cases). The European region had the highest level of knowledge (75.3%), while the Southeast Asia region had a positive attitude (65.6%) and good practice in the Eastern Mediterranean region (45.9%). Meta-regression analyses indicated that the year of publication was significantly associated with heterogeneity in knowledge and attitude outcomes. In contrast, the WHO region was significantly associated with heterogeneity in practice outcomes (p < 0.05). According to the GRADE approach, the overall certainty of evidence was moderate for both knowledge and attitude outcomes, and high for practice outcomes. The level of knowledge, attitude, and practice of the general population regarding CL is not at the desired level in many regions, especially in endemic countries. These results emphasize the need to design and implement educational interventions and targeted awareness programs to promote public KAP about CL, especially in areas with high prevalence and low practice.",

This case demonstrates that clinicians should recognize the importance of systemic therapy for treating complex CL, as well as the importance of identification of species type for tailoring treatments. Furthermore, while miltefosine has proven efficacious for CL in many New World locales, it has demonstrated lower cure rates for CL in Guatemala, and thus identification of the region of origin of the CL infection is imperative for further guiding treatment, which may vary according to the differences in drug potency or region-specific resistance rates.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector borne disease that is endemic to tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world disproportionately affecting those of low socioeconomic status. The combined role of the parasite and the host's immune response in determining disease severity has made it challenging to discover new anti-leishmanial treatments. Previous work from our lab has established that the dermal lymphatic network is necessary for wound resolution in a model of healing CL with <i>Leishmania major</i> parasites. In CL, lymphatic remodeling allows for accumulated fluid to drain from the lesional site, thereby reducing disease severity. In this report, we present a new mechanism of immunopathology during non-healing CL brought about by <i>L. amazonensis</i> infection. We show non-healing CL develops alongside an accumulation of cells and fluid in the skin, resulting in chronic inflammation. Lymphatic remodeling is attenuated during the chronic phase of <i>L. amazonensis</i> infection. Moreover, the percentage of proliferating lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) decreases from 6 to 12 weeks post infection (wpi), leading to a decrease over time in lymphatic vessel (LV) density. To induce lymphangiogenesis, exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) was administered by adenoviral delivery. VEGF-C increased LV dilation leading to reduced lesion sizes without altering parasite burdens, arguing targeting the lymphatics can alleviate immunopathology. Taken together, these results show impaired lymphatic function contributes to non-healing disease due to <i>L. amazonensis</i> infection and the lymphatics can be targeted to decrease inflammation in the skin during infection.",

        "abstract": "<i>Phlebotomus papatasi</i> is a vector of <i>Leishmania major</i>, the etiologic agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disfiguring and debilitating disease. In this study, we identified fatty acids found on the exterior of eggs laid by female <i>P. papatasi</i> that could be potential oviposition pheromones. We tested the effect of different treatments on 1) the number of eggs laid and 2) the spatial distribution of eggs laid. The treatments included three quantities of eggs (80, 160 and 320), hexane extracts of 160 eggs, 160 eggs after being washed with hexane to remove any pheromones, and three concentrations (1ng, 10ng and 100ng) of synthetic versions of three fatty acids that we identified as being present on egg exteriors. The saturated fatty acids dodecanoic (C12) and tetradecanoic (C14) acid, identified by GC/MS analysis, were abundant in hexane extracts of both eggs and gravid females but were present in only trace amounts in males. Hexadecanoic and hexadecenoic (C16) acids were abundant on eggs, gravid females and males. A negative binomial GLM found that significantly more eggs were oviposited by gravid females in response to 80 eggs (<i>P</i>=0.0255), 160 eggs (<i>P</i><0.001), 320 eggs (<i>P</i><0.001) and the hexane extract of 160 eggs (<i>P</i><0.001). Eggs washed in hexane were not more attractive than a control (<i>P</i>=0.591). The number of eggs laid was increased by all three concentrations of hexadecanoic acid (<i>P</i><0.001), 10ng and 100ng of tetradecanoic acid (<i>P</i><0.001), and 1ng and 10ng of dodecanoic acid (<i>P</i><0.001). The spatial response of oviposition (the proportion of eggs laid on the test vs. control side of the oviposition pot) was weaker than the response of total eggs laid. A beta GLM found that gravid females laid a significantly higher proportion of eggs near 160 eggs (<i>P</i>=0.004) and significantly lower proportion of eggs near 100ng of dodecanoic acid (<i>P</i>=0.016). Bootstrapping and permutation tests also suggested significant attractive effects of 320 eggs, egg extract, and 1ng and 10 ng of hexadecenoic acid. These results suggest that hexadecanoic acid is the oviposition pheromone, of <i>P. papatasi</i> from Tunisia because its presence increases both the number of eggs laid and attracts oviposition over the small spatial scales of the assay. Studies by others have shown that dodecanoic acid is the oviposition pheromone of <i>P. papatasi</i> from Turkey. In this study, dodecanoic acid increased the number of eggs laid but either did not change their spatial distribution or was repulsive at the highest concentration. The observed difference may be related to the different geographical origins of the sand flies used in this study.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is a fast-growing health issue in low- and middle-income countries, with ~80% of diabetics living in the tropics and sub-tropics. It is a deadly condition claiming the lives of millions of individuals annually, with no therapeutic treatment available to date. The management of diabetes is thus limited to symptomatic relief by glycemic control. Furthermore, the geographical overlap of diabetes and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is of concern, as diabetes is known to increase infection susceptibility and severity. In contrast, diabetes-infection comorbidity can negatively affect treatment responses. Leishmaniasis ranks among the top 10 NTDs. Its current therapeutic treatment relies on a handful of drugs that are marred with two main shortcomings: toxicity and reduced efficacy due to pathogenic resistance. Hence, there is a pressing need for new, effective antileishmanial therapeutics. There is evidence of rising cases of leishmaniasis-diabetes co-infection, which may require the use of dual-active therapeutics to curb them. In search of new effective antileishmanial agents with potential for dual use, we evaluated in vitro the antileishmanial and antidiabetic activities of a series of arylidenes derived from hydantoin, glitazone, and rhodanine scaffolds using phenotypic assays, some of which had previously been investigated for antidiabetic potential. Additionally, the antitrypanosomal potential of these compounds was also considered due to the taxonomic relation between Leishmania and Trypanosoma spp. and reported concerns of Chagas disease and human African trypanosomiasis-diabetes comorbidities. Three leishmanicidal early leads with submicromolar activity were uncovered, but no antitrypanosomal or dual leishmaniasis-diabetes active hits were identified.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a devastating and complex parasitic disease caused by different species of protozoan members of the genus <i>Leishmania</i>. Unfortunately, available drugs are far from ideal and no vaccines are available. Under these circumstances, new effective antileishmanial drugs with reduced host toxicity and improved dosing protocols are urgently needed. The sterol biosynthesis pathway (SBP) is a promising focus for combating <i>Leishmania</i> infections. Thus, various strategies have been documented, such as drug repurposing, combined therapy, rational drug design, and the use of synergistic effects to develop the metallodrugs that can act on essential parasite targets. This article reviews the critical enzymes participating in the ergostane-based sterol biosynthesis pathway (SBP) of <i>Leishmania</i> species, as well as recent progress in rational drug design, repurposing drugs, combined therapies, and the development of metallodrugs for use as antileishmanial agents. This review is based on literature searchers using SciFinder, Lens.org, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Pub Med, and DrugBank. The limited focus on human leishmaniasis has resulted in a shortfall in effective treatments for this parasitic disease. The post-squalene segment of the sterol biosynthetic pathway is a promising target for treating <i>Leishmania</i> infections, particularly effective drugs or metallodrugs that inhibit the CYP51 or 24-SMT enzymes.",

The search for safe and effective alternative treatments, particularly oral medications, has led to the development of second-line treatments, such as azole antifungals, including itraconazole. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the therapeutic effectiveness of itraconazole alone and in combination with pentamidine in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania Viannia guyanensis. A randomised clinical trial was conducted at the leishmaniasis outpatient clinic of the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado in Manaus, Amazonas. Ninety eligible patients diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis were selected and randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Control group-Group 1 (G1) received pentamidine isethionate; experimental group-Group 2 (G2) received itraconazole monotherapy; and experimental group-Group 3 (G3) received a combination of itraconazole and one dose of pentamidine isethionate, in standardised doses. Patients were monitored at 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after the completion of treatment. Leishmania species were identified using biomolecular methods. The patients were predominantly males (84.4%), with a mean age of 40.5 ± 12.9 years. 93% of cases originated from the peripheral areas of Manaus, Amazonas. The average duration of skin lesion evolution was 30 days, with 84% presenting as ulcerated lesions. A single lesion was observed in 57% of cases, 41% measured 2 to 3 cm<sup>2</sup>, and were predominantly on the lower limbs. Four species of Leishmania were identified, with L. guyanensis causing 90% of cases, L. brasiliensis causing 6% of cases, L. amazonensis causing 2.5% of cases and L. naiffi causing 1.2% of cases. Among 72 cases of L. (V.) guyanensis, cure rates were 96% with itraconazole + pentamidine, 83% with itraconazole alone and 58% with pentamidine alone. No serious adverse events were observed in terms of toxicity and tolerability. Injection site pain or induration was the most common adverse effect in G1. In terms of efficacy, patients in G2 and G3 experienced more favourable outcomes, with 90-day cure rates of 56% (G1), 73% (G2) and 90% (G3). After 90 days, the itraconazole-pentamidine combination therapy was more effective (90%) than either itraconazole or pentamidine alone against cutaneous leishmaniasis in Amazonas state caused by L. guyanensis.",

This pilot implementation study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of synchronous telemedicine consultations for patients with Chagas disease (CD) and American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in a national reference hospital in Brazil. We conducted a mixed-methods implementation study using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM). The context analysis involved structured surveys with 31 health professionals and semi-structured interviews with two local managers. Patients diagnosed with CD or ACL were recruited from August to October 2024. Teleconsultations were performed via WhatsApp video calls by four specialists. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using structured questionnaires. Of the 46 patients recruited, 38 (82.6%) completed teleconsultations. Most were older adults and had no prior telehealth experience. Despite low digital literacy and education levels, 63.2% (24/38) completed the teleconsultation without assistance. High levels of satisfaction were reported: 97.4% (37/38) were satisfied and would attend future virtual visits. Participants reported the reduced travel burden and improved access to care. No major technical issues were observed. Synchronous telemedicine via a low-cost, widely available platform was feasible and well-accepted for clinical follow-up of CD and ACL in a Brazilian public hospital. This approach may help reduce access barriers to specialized care for NTDs. Further research should evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in LMIC settings.",

        "abstract": "Kala-azar, or visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania spp., characterised by fever, weight loss, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and anaemia. This study evaluated the relationship between hepcidin, inflammation, iron metabolism, and hypersplenism in VL-associated anaemia. In this cross-sectional study, confirmed VL patients without recent transfusions were assessed. Haematological and inflammatory parameters were analysed using correlation and multivariate regression tests. Anaemia was present in 95.2% of the sample, predominantly normocytic (59.5%) and normochromic (76.2%), or microcytic (40.5%) and hypochromic (23.8%). Inflammatory markers were markedly elevated in most patients, particularly hepcidin, which was increased in 97.6% of cases (median: 351.46 ng/mL), suggesting persistent inflammation and impaired iron bioavailability. However, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin showed weak to moderate negative correlations with hepcidin (ρ = -0.33, ρ = -0.66, and ρ = -0.30, respectively). These findings highlight the complex interplay between anaemia and inflammation in kala-azar, with elevated hepcidin levels and paradoxical correlations with inflammatory markers. They underscore the central role of splenomegaly in VL-related anaemia and suggest potential contributions from other factors affecting iron metabolism, such as erythropoietin and erythroferrone. Understanding the dynamics of these markers throughout disease progression and treatment may further elucidate the pathophysiology of VL and support the development of targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania spp. and presents a wide spectrum of manifestations. Researchers are currently unable to control and treat the different forms of leishmaniasis, and effective vaccines and treatments are not yet available. This study aimed to assess the pathological aspects and drug susceptibility of L. major treated with antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting the HSP-70 and HIS-1 genes. This study investigates the anti-leishmanial properties of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) directed against the HSP-70 and HIS-1 genes, which play critical roles in stage differentiation and resistance to anti-leishmanial drugs. The experiments were conducted using L. major promastigotes and amastigotes in vitro and a mouse model for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Our results indicated that the expression of the HSP-70 and HIS-1 genes was significantly reduced in the group receiving antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). In the group treated with HSP-70 ASO, the amastigote count in macrophages was significantly reduced compared to the other groups. The findings from the in vivo experiments revealed that in the group receiving HIS-1 ASO, the size of the CL lesion was significantly reduced, and susceptibility to glucantime was significantly increased compared to the other groups. The results of the current study demonstrated that HIS-1 and HSP-70 ASOs successfully inhibit the pathogenicity of the L. major and decrease the lesion size of CL. ASO as a novel technique in genetic manipulation also revealed that it can aid in the control and prevention of various diseases.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a debilitating neglected tropical disease characterized by lesions that can range from self-healing to permanent disfigurations. A predominant Th1 response, which stimulates IFN-γ production, is crucial for parasite control during self-healing CL. While IFN-γ primarily activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leading to parasite control, IFN-γ also activates other downstream pathways involved in cell autonomous immunity. One such pathway is the activation of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), a class of interferon inducible GTPases. However, the role of GBPs during CL has been minimally explored. Utilizing RNA-Seq we found that <i>Leishmania major</i> infection leads to the upregulation of several GBPs in C57Bl/6 mice. In vitro studies using GBPChr3 knockout (KO), and C57Bl/6 control mice reveal that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from KO mice exhibit higher parasite burdens following IFN-γ treatment, independent of GBP localization to the parasite. Single-cell RNA-Seq identifies macrophages as the primary expressers of GBPs during <i>L. major</i> infection <i>in vivo</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, GBPChr3 KO mice display increased disease severity and parasite load. GBPChr3 KO macrophages and monocytes show elevated ARG-1 and reduced iNOS expression, indicating a shift toward a parasite-permissive environment that supports parasite growth. These findings highlight a critical role for GBPs in immune-mediated control of CL.",

        "abstract": "The drug discovery pipeline for neglected kinetoplastid diseases remains sparse. In particular, the field of leishmaniasis drug discovery has had limited success in translating potential drug candidates into viable therapies. Here, we describe the development of two lead compounds, BZ-1 and BZ1-I, which have potent in vitro anti-leishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani DD8 intracellular amastigotes (0.59 ± 0.13 µM and 0.40 ± 0.38 µM) with corresponding selectivity ( > 33.89 and > 49.12) for differentiated THP-1 cells (Human monocytic cell line), respectively. Further characterization and biological profiling identified that in addition to the activity against L. donovani DD8 (Old World - Indian strain), compounds were active against intracellular parasites from other species and strains of the Old and New World, namely L. donovani (Old World - Sudanese strain) and L. infantum chagasi (New World-South American strain). In vivo evaluation using the hamster model illustrated that the activity observed in vitro was translated in vivo, with outstanding results.

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis, transmitted by sandflies, causes a severe health threat in East African refugee camps. High mobility, poor conditions and limited healthcare access heighten the risk of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) among refugees. Though, data on infection prevalence is remains limited. This study aims to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection in refugee camps in Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella regions to improve VL detection and guide effective control strategies in humanitarian settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August 2023 in four refugee camps to determine Leishmania infection using DAT and rtPCR on blood samples. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using structured questionnaires. Ethical approval was granted, and informed consent was obtained. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23, with associations assessed using logistic regression and Chi-square tests at a 0.05 significance level. Continuous variables summarized by median and interquartile range (IQR). The study included 1,223 participants (440 from Tsore camp and 220 from Sherkole in Benishangul Gumuz Region; 288 from Kule camp and 275 from Terkidi in Gambella Region), most of whom were from South Sudan (66.7%) and the majority were females (56.5%). 17.8% of the participants reported fever, with no spleen or liver enlargement and 0.2% lymph node swelling. Real-time PCR positivity was significantly higher in Tsore (14.6%, χ² = 21.4, p < 0.001), no significant difference in DAT positivity was observed across refugee camps (χ² = 6.6, p = 0.084). Leishmania DAT positivity rates were 6.0%, 4.6% and 4.7% in those with fever, chills and headache, respectively. Leishmania kDNA based rtPCR positivity rate were 11.7%, 8.8%, 7.3% and 6.2% in those with fever, chills, headache and weakness, respectively. Participants from Benishangul Gumuz region [AOR: 3.67 (95%CI: 1.57-8.59); p = 0.003]; South Sudanese [AOR: 2.87 (95%CI: 1.26-6.50); p = 0.012 and those with fever [AOR: 2.08 (95%CI: 1.01-4.28); p = 0.047] had a higher odds of DAT positivity. On the other hand, lower rtPCR positivity rates were seen in the Sherkole refugee camp compared to Tsore camps in Benishangul Gumuz region [AOR: 0.19 (95%CI: 0.08-0.45); p < 0.0001]. Leishmania infection was prevalent in refugee camps in Gambella and Benishangul Gumuz regions.

        "abstract": "Eugenol is an aromatic compound that belongs to the phenol group found in various natural sources, such as clove oil. This study aimed to investigate eugenol's leishmanicidal activity and its mechanism of action using molecular docking to predict potential biochemical targets of eugenol in Leishmania major. The interaction between eugenol and TNF-α/IL-12p40 was evaluated using docking methods. The leishmanicidal activities of eugenol, MA (Glucantime<sup>®</sup>; MA), and their combination were assessed against both promastigote and amastigote stages of Leishmania major. Additionally, real-time PCR was used to measure cytokine gene expression levels in murine macrophages treated with the studied drugs. IC<sub>50</sub> values for eugenol, MA, and their combination against L. major promastigotes were determined as 235.22 µg/mL, 298.93 µg/mL, and 159.02 µg/mL, respectively. Regarding anti-amastigote activity, the combination of eugenol with MA exhibited the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> value at 41.7 µg/mL, compared to 73.1 µg/mL for eugenol alone. The combination IC<sub>50</sub> has been located on the line that showed the additivity role. Docking studies suggest that residues within the active site of eugenol are capable of interacting with TNF-α and IL-12p40. Specifically, Leu57, Leu120, Gly120, and Gly122 were identified as common amino acids involved in binding with eugenol and TNF-α, whereas Glu12, Asn200, and His83 were associated with eugenol's interaction with IL-12p40 Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of Th1 cytokines (IL-12P40, iNOS, IFN-γ) and downregulation of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) in the combined treatment relative to individual treatments. The superior efficacy of the combined treatment of eugenol and MA on L. major necessitates further research on the clinical potential of this combination in the treatment of leishmaniasis.",

Existing treatments for VL face limitations such as toxicity, high costs, and suboptimal efficacy in specific patient groups. Given the lack of a vaccine, chemotherapy remains the only option, emphasizing the urgent need for safer and more effective treatments. Nanotechnology offers promising avenues to overcome these challenges. This study introduces a novel approach involving amine-functionalized graphene quantum dots (fGQDs) conjugated with Amphotericin B (fGQDAmB) to enhance targeted drug delivery to -infected macrophages. This novel approach, which could lead to a safer and more effective treatment for VL, is a significant contribution to the field. Structural characterization by XRD and FTIR confirmed successful GQD synthesis and functionalization, while cellular assays demonstrated significantly higher macrophage uptake and enhanced antileishmanial efficacy. fGQDAmB demonstrated approximately 4.2-fold greater potency against intracellular amastigotes and 2-fold higher efficacy against promastigotes, while also exhibiting reduced cytotoxicity compared to conventional AmB. The safety and effectiveness of fGQDAmB were further validated through hemolysis assay, providing reassurance and confidence about its potential use and instilling confidence in the potential of Quantum Dot-based Nanomedicine formulations.",

        "abstract": "The primary pharmaceutical treatments for the cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are linked to a range of negative complications. The development of innovative pharmacological agents aimed at enhancing cellular immune responses could denote a promising therapeutic approach for CL therapy. Here, the present study investigated the impact of phellandrene (PR), a cyclic monoterpene found in various plant species, on Leishmania tropica, focusing on its antileishmanial properties, immunomodulatory effects, antioxidant activity, and capacity to induce apoptosis. The antileishmaial and synergistic properties effects of PR alone and in conjunction with glucantime (GCT) on L. tropica promastigote and amastigote forms were investigated. As well, the influence of PR on the immunomodulatory-associated genes, antioxidant-associated genes, plasma membrane integrity, ROS generation, apoptosis induction, and nitric oxide (NO) production was assessed. We found that PR principally in conjunction with GCT notably reduced by the number of promastigote and amastigote forms within macrophages a dose-dependent reduction (p%lt;0.001). We found a significant upregulation in the expression of the iNOS, interferon gamma (IFN-g), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) genes in infected macrophages subsequent to treatment with RP, particularly in conjunction with GCT. Conversely, there was a notable downregulation in the expression of interleukin 10 (IL-10), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) genes; whereas, results in a substantial rise in NO release in macrophage cells (p<0.001). PR, GCT, PR+GCT resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of caspase-3 activity, increase in plasma membrane integrity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (p<0.001). The findings indicate that the PR mainly along with GCT has a substantial effect on the inhibition and elimination of Leishmania parasites in controlled laboratory environments. Although certain cellular mechanisms of action have been recognized, including immune modulation cellular immunity response, the induction of apoptosis, ROS and NO production, reducing the antioxidant activity, and affecting membrane integrity in response to Leishmania, additional research is required to interpret its effectiveness in both animal models and human participants.",

        "abstract": "Canine and human leishmaniasis are prevalent around the Mediterranean Basin, where dogs are considered to be the main peridomestic reservoir for human disease. Canine leishmaniosis was initially diagnosed in central Israel in 1994. Since then, it has been routinely detected in the canine population of Israel, while only a very small number of human cases are reported annually. This retrospective analysis of dogs diagnosed with Leishmania infection at the Hebrew University from 1994 to December 2023 included 658 dogs. Although infected dogs were reported in all 16 subdistricts of Israel, the geographic distribution and locations of infected dogs focused mainly on central and northern Israel. From 2020, isolated cases have also been detected in southern Israel, suggesting a southward spread of disease. A majority of infected dogs (n = 341, 51.8%) were residents of rural localities, with the remainder (n = 267, 40.6%) present in urban areas. The highest number of cases was found in the Jerusalem Subdistrict, but the highest density of infected dogs, cases per square km, was present in the Tel Aviv Subdistrict. The incidence rate of clinical leishmaniosis for the years 2007-2023, based on the Israeli dog registry, ranged from 0.03 to 0.09 per 1000 registered dogs. Of the 353 dogs diagnosed from 2013 onward, age ranged from 3 months to 14.5 years with a median of 4.5 years. Of the 38 dogs who were also tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Leishmania spp. since 2010, 32 (84%) were infected by L. infantum, 4 (11%) with L. tropica, and 2 (5%) with L. major. The epidemiology of canine leishmaniosis caused mostly by L. infantum presents a contrary picture to that of human leishmaniasis in Israel, in which more than 99% of patients are reported to have cutaneous leishmaniasis caused mostly by L. major and L. tropica, and less than 1% have visceral disease due to L. infantum. The widespread presence of canine L. infantum infection in central and northern Israel constitutes a zoonotic reservoir for disease for humans, wildlife, cats, and other dogs.",

Here, we examined the efficacy of ivermectin, moxidectin (MOX), afoxolaner, and permethrin against all stages of Leishmania tropica and THP-1 cells. We also assessed the potential for resistance acquisition after 15 rounds of artificial selection. To elucidate the mode of action of MOX, we employed RNA sequencing, molecular dynamics simulation, and chloride flux assays. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic index of MOX using the Galleria mellonella infection model. MOX demonstrated the highest selectivity index against leishmaniasis (promastigotes: 0.58 μM; amastigotes: 0.96 μM; host cells: 60.29 μM). Moreover, MOX exhibited the lowest resistance acquisition in both promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes after 15 rounds of artificial selection, with resistance ratios of 17.23 and 4.59, respectively. Post-exposure to MOX, differential gene expression profiles showed both stage-specific and stage-unspecific enrichment of gene families involved in crucial biological processes. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations revealed a potential neutralizing effect of MOX on the chloride channel of L. tropica. Specifically, MOX binds to the selectivity filter, potentially disrupting the osmotic equilibrium and thereby killing the parasite. The in vivo introduction of MOX significantly inhibited the growth of L. tropica in G. mellonella larvae, resulting in decreased rates of mortality and melanization. These findings indicate that MOX is a promising candidate for the treatment of L. tropica infections, warranting further investigation and potential consideration for clinical use.",

        "abstract": "In Syria, during the 14 years after the outbreak of civil war, 16.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes, of which 7.2 million remain internally displaced in 2025. Breakdown in waste management caused by aerial bombardment has created ideal conditions for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) transmission, vectored by phlebotomine sandflies. Displaced populations reside in flimsy shelters where conventional vector control tools are operationally unfeasible. A small, lightweight, portable transfluthrin-based spatial repellent (Mosquito Shield™) has been developed which may circumvent some of these logistical issues and provide improved protection from vector-borne diseases in harsh environments. A two-arm, non-randomised cluster trial was undertaken in Ar-Raqqa governorate, North-East Syria, to evaluate the efficacy of Mosquito Shield™ in reducing CL case incidence and sandfly densities in shelters. Weekly epidemiological monitoring was performed by MENTOR Initiative mobile clinics and supported health facilities. Entomological monitoring was performed fortnightly using indoor US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps in 40 randomly selected households per study arm. Phlebotomine sandflies were morphologically identified; a subset were analysed for molecular species confirmation, blood-meal preferences and pyrethroid resistance. Household surveys and focus group discussions were used to assess intervention feasibility, acceptability and uptake. Assuming a 2-month diagnosis cut-off, the CL incidence rate was 9.9 and 5.2 per 1000 in the control and intervention arms, respectively; Mosquito Shield™ demonstrated a significant impact on rate of CL infection in all ages (incidence rate ratio; IRR: 0.52 [95% CI: 0.37-0.74]; p < 0.0001). Mosquito Shield™ demonstrated a significant impact on all female sandfly density (IRR: 0.22 [95% CI: 0.14-0.33]; p < 0.0001) and blood-fed female sandfly density (IRR: 0.21 [95% CI: 0.11-0.40]; p < 0.0001). Mosquito Shield™ was received positively and perceived to be easy to use, to protect from CL, sandflies and other insect bites and required minimal behaviour change. Trial findings provide the first demonstrable impact of spatial repellents on CL transmission, strengthening the growing evidence basis for the effectiveness of this intervention against multiple vector species and their associated pathogens. Study results strongly support the deployment of spatial repellents to control CL in humanitarian crises. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06917040.",

        "abstract": "High-throughput screening (HTS) is one of the critical strategies that can accelerate the process of drug discovery by exploring small drug-like molecule libraries. HTS noticeably contributes to the identification of potential hits using various automation tools and biological assays. Leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease, is one of the most deadly protozoan parasitic infections causing significant global burden in certain poverty-stricken countries. Given the paucity of effective chemotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of this life-threatening infection, the discovery of novel leishmanicidal scaffolds through innovative strategies is pivotal to combating this parasitic disease. In the present study, we have employed the HTS strategy to scrutinize 10,000 drug-like molecules from the in-house ChemDiv library to identify potent hits against Leishmania donovani. Noticeably, 99 molecules showed > 80% inhibitory effect against the L. donovani parasites at 50 µM concentration, and among them, four molecules displayed a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value < 10 µM along with a favorable selectivity index (> 10). Scanning electron microscopy analysis suggests that these potent hits cause considerable morphological alterations. The predicted ADME or pharmacokinetics study of these potent hit molecules indicates that all the hits have considerable drug-likeness properties and showed a low risk of adverse effects, along with a predicted high level of oral bioavailability. Thus, these promising hits identified by the HTS strategy can serve as an initial basis for consequent medicinal chemistry endeavors aimed at unraveling a new series of anti-leishmanial agents.",

The present study investigated the modulatory effects of B. bifidum on the expression of miR-196a, miR-196b, and NF-κBIα genes in a DSS-induced IBD mice model. Thirty male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to five experimental groups (G1-G5). The induction of colitis used 3% DSS in drinking water for 8 days. The Disease Activity Index (DAI) was monitored, and mice were euthanized for further analysis on the 22nd day. The mice were gavaged with 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/ml of B. bifidum per day. Histological grading of the colon tissues was done, and the levels of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were measured using ELISA. At the gene level, the expression of miR-196a, miR-196b, and NF-κBIα was analyzed by RT-PCR. Weight gain from days 11 to 17 in G3 and G4 with B. bifidum treatment pointed out its therapeutic benefits. Colon length, weight, and spleen weight were significantly decreased in G2 compared to G1 (P ≥ 0.0001). Histopathological examination revealed severe mucosal damage in G2, reduced inflammation in G3, fewer deep wounds in G4, and significant healing in G5. B. bifidum, especially in G5, significantly reduced IL-6 and TNF-α levels (P ≥ 0.0002). Gene expression analysis showed decreases in miR-196a and NF-κBIα and an increase in miR-196b, with G5 showing the most changes (P ≥ 0.0001). In conclusion, B. bifidum demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects in the DSS-induced IBD model by modulating miRNA expression and reducing key inflammatory cytokines.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoa of the <i>Leishmania</i> genus, transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the parasite's species and the host's immune system, ranging from self-healing skin lesions to lethal visceral diseases. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), mainly caused by <i>L. infantum</i> and <i>L. donovani</i>, is a serious public health issue. Conventional treatment is challenging due to toxicity, long duration, and resistance, highlighting the need for alternative therapies. Oregano essential oil (OEO) has biological effects, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant actions, making it a potential leishmanicidal agent. To evaluate its activity, promastigotes of two <i>L. infantum</i> strains were tested: MS (from naturally infected dogs in Brazil) and a reference strain (MCAN/BR/97/p142). The IC50 values were 12.53 µg/mL and 43.61 µg/mL, respectively, while amphotericin B (AmB) showed lower IC50 values (0.1453 µg/mL and 0.2126 µg/mL). OEO treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial damage, lipid droplet accumulation, and autophagic vacuoles, indicating intense cellular stress. Additionally, apoptosis markers such as phosphatidylserine exposure and membrane permeabilization were detected. Fluorescence, scanning (SEM), and transmission (TEM) microscopy revealed morphological and ultrastructural alterations, including membrane blebbing, flagellar damage, intracellular content leakage, and mitochondrial swelling. To assess its anti-amastigote effect, THP-1 cells infected with <i>L. infantum</i> strains were treated with OEO. The MS strain showed a lower infection rate but a higher parasite load per macrophage. All tested concentrations (25, 50, and 75 μg/mL) reduced both the number of infected macrophages and intracellular amastigotes. Thus, OEO exhibits leishmanicidal activity in both promastigote and amastigote forms of <i>L. infantum</i>, inducing metabolic disruption and cell death, even in strains from naturally infected dogs. These findings highlight OEO's potential as an alternative treatment for VL.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a major public health and veterinary challenge in Mediterranean countries. Preventing infection is the most critical measure, and educational interventions can be utilized to modify preventive behaviors against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of an educational intervention on preventive behaviors against CL in employees of Shiraz Special Economic Zone subsidiary companies. This experimental study was conducted on 280 employees of Shiraz Special Economic Zone subsidiary companies, Iran, during 2023-2024 (140 participants in the control group and 140 in the intervention group). Data were collected using a questionnaire that included demographic information, awareness assessment, constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM), and preventive behaviors against CL. The questionnaire was completed by both groups before and three months after the intervention. The intervention group attended eight educational sessions, held weekly, lasting 50-60 min each. The mean age of the intervention group was 40.38 ± 6.78 years, and the control group was 38.92 ± 7.16 years. Results showed a significant change in the mean scores of all Health Belief Model constructs in the intervention group after the educational sessions (P < 0.05). Additionally, significant changes were observed in the mean scores of perceived susceptibility (P < 0.001), perceived barriers (P < 0.001), self-efficacy (P < 0.001), and cues to action (P < 0.001) between the intervention and control groups after the intervention (P < 0.05). The results demonstrated that applying the Health Belief Model was beneficial and effective in enhancing preventive behaviors against CL. This approach can be practical in promoting the health of individuals at risk.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis-human immunodeficiency virus (VL-HIV) co-infection has emerged as a serious concern, which could adversely affect the VL elimination efforts of the country. These patients have a poor VL therapeutic success rate, more drug-related toxicity, and relapses resulting in high mortality. Despite the emerging pattern of VL-HIV co-infection, there have been limited studies analyzing the presentation of VL-HIV co-infection in Bihar, India. The present study investigated the clinico-epidemiological features, predictors of mortality, and quality of life for people living with VL-HIV co-infection. A cross-sectional study was conducted, using retrospective data on VL-HIV cases from 2018 to 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data analysis was done, using the IBM SPSS statistics v22. Our study included a large sample of 222 VL-HIV cases, of these one-fifth of the patients (47; 21%) had died. A highly statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001) in mortality was observed between males (38; 80.9%) and females (9; 19.1%). The death occurred rapidly within a mean duration of 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.4-8.1) after VL diagnosis. A highly statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001) was observed between individuals who had stopped anti-retroviral therapy (ART) (36; 76.6%) and those who were taking ART regularly (11; 23.4%) in terms of mortality. The primary predisposing factor observed was heterosexual behavior, which accounted for 113 cases (88.3%). In most of the cases (95.3%), the diagnosis was done at tertiary care centers and not in their home district. The majority of VL cases (101; 78.9%) were treated with multiple doses of liposomal amphotericin B. Out of 128 VL-HIV cases, 120 (93.7%) were declared cured of VL after completing treatment. Approximately 47 cases (36.7%) experienced more than two VL relapses. A significant difference was observed for gender and income per month in the environmental health domain specifically. The present study documents a time gap between the initiation and cessation of ART, as well as the duration from VL treatment to death. It suggests that regular adherence to ART may have a significant impact on reducing mortality and relapses. Therefore, a comprehensive people-centric approach for specific groups must be adopted for VL-HIV patients. Additional epidemiological studies on VL-HIV co-infection are warranted.",

The lesion was clinically suggestive of infectious or neoplastic etiologies, including tinea capitis, squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, and leishmaniasis. Empirical antifungal treatment was ineffective, and mycological studies were negative. Dermoscopy revealed yellow crusts, serpentine vessels, and perifollicular whitish halos. The patient later developed painful oral ulcers, which led to histopathological and immunofluorescence studies confirming PV. Systemic corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil were initiated with marked clinical improvement.

Only a few studies reported the use of molecular diagnostic methods for CL in the region, whereas reports of therapeutic outcomes are scarce. An international consortium was established between local teams in the Zinder region of Niger and a referral centre for leishmaniasis in French Guiana. Specific training on CL diagnostic was provided by the Guianese team to Nigerien health workers. All consenting patients with clinically suspected CL lesions were enrolled. Samples were made for parasitological smear and PCR on cotton swabs. Then, participants were treated as per local protocol with oral metronidazole for 14 days and were followed for 4 months. In total, 59 clinically suspected CL cases were included, among whom 33 (56%) were confirmed by PCR and/or by microscopy, including 21 men and 22 women, 23 minors and 10 adults. 32 (97%) of them presented with ulcers (including 12 with ulcers and nodules). The median number of lesions was 2 [IQR 1-3]. The most frequent location of lesions was the lower limbs (21/33, 63.6%), followed by the upper limbs (14/33, 42.4%). One mucosal involvement was reported but unconfirmed with PCR. The efficacy of oral metronidazole was 90.9% (30/33) among confirmed cases and 76.3% (45/59) in the overall study population. The documented species was Leishmania major. This is the first report of PCR-proven human CL in Niger, and the first report of a human CL case in the Zinder area for more than a century. Molecular techniques confirmed the circulation of L. major in this area, which until now had only been determined by isoenzymes analysis. Presenting CL patients were very young. Treatment outcomes with metronidazole were encouraging. This prompts for a formal evaluation of the efficacy of this drug, ideally in a randomized controlled trial.",

        "abstract": "In September 2023, fifty cases of chronic limb ulcers of unknown origin were reported in six Health Districts (HDs) in Northern Cameroon. This disease, locally called \"Ladde\", was described as of mystical origin, transmitted by insect bites. We aimed to describe the cases, identify the cause and socio-anthropological considerations. We conducted a mixed descriptive cross-sectional study in November 2023. A case was any person that had presented a skin ulcer on any of the four limbs for at least 4 weeks any time during the study period, suspected of infectious cause or contamination, associated or not to other conditions and residing in the study area from January 2018 to October 2023. After active case-finding in health facilities and within the community, we featured sociodemographic (sex, age, occupation), clinical (location, signs/symptoms, ulcer occurrence), and therapeutic data (itinerary, treatment and outcome). We collected blood samples, ulcer swabs and skin biopsies to test for pathogens (Haemophilus ducreyi, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium leprae, Leishmania), performed an entomological survey to search for potential vectors and conducted a socio-anthropological survey (individual interviews and focus group discussions) to explore community perceptions. We identified 153 cases in total: 119 (77.8%) were men. The median age was 38.5 years (9 months to 94 years). Farmers (n = 63, 41.2%), followed by housewives (n = 24, 15.7%) were the most affected. The lower limbs (n = 138, 90.2%) were the preferred location. Pain (n = 130, 85.0%), swelling (n = 113, 73.9%), ulceration (n = 43, 28.1%) and fever (n = 42, 27.5%) were the most frequent signs/symptoms at the beginning. In 79 (51.6%) cases, the ulcers occurred spontaneously and 67 (43.8%) after trauma (road injuries, blunt objects ulcers). For treatment, 129 (84.3%) cases visited a traditional healer who ordered decoctions (n = 98, 64.1%) and poultices (n = 95, 62.1%) using powder; 81 (52.9%) cases visited a health facility and received Cloxacillin (n = 78, 51%) and diclofenac (n = 70, 45.8%). Ten (6.5%) cases were completely cured. Six out of ninety-four (6.4%) cases tested were HIV positive, 8 (8.5%) were syphilis positive, all referred for appropriate care. Dermohypodermatitis (n = 14 out of 28, 50%) and pyogenic granuloma (n = 12 out of 28, 43%) were the main anatomopathological findings. No patient was positive for Mycobacterium ulcerans, Haemophilus ducreyi or Treponema pallidum pertenue. The entomological investigation did not reveal any potential insect vectors for leishmaniasis. Socio-anthropological survey mostly reported that \"Ladde\" is a disease of diabolic origin caused by a spirit which comes from a demon-possessed animal or tree. Posttraumatic leg ulcers and dermohypodermatitis were the predominant clinical and anatomopathological patterns. Traditional practitioners were the main point of care. Strengthening the capacity of health and laboratory personnel in the diagnosis and management of chronic skin ulcers pathogens is recommended to improve the outcome of chronic ulcers.",

        "abstract": "Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala-Azar, poses a significant global public health challenge and is a neglected disease, with relapses and treatment failures leading to increased morbidity and mortality. This study introduces an explainable machine learning approach to predict VL relapse and identify critical risk factors, thereby aiding patient monitoring and treatment strategies. Leveraging data from a follow-up study of 571 patients, the survival machine learning models are applied, including Random Survival Forest (RSF), Survival Support Vector Machine (SSVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), for relapse prediction. The results demonstrated that RSF, with a C-index of 0.85, outperformed the conventional Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model (C-index 0.8), offering improved prediction capabilities by capturing non-linear relationships and variable interactions. To address the lack of transparency (in terms of feature importance) in Machine Learning (ML) models, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method is employed, which enhances model interpretability (feature importance) through visual insights. SHAP dependence plots allowed the healthcare professionals to evaluate which factors encourage the occurrence of the relapse. A statistically significant relationship between HIV co-infection (HR=3.92, 95% CI=2.03-7.58) and VL relapse was identified through -2 log-likelihood ratio and chi-square tests. These results indicate the promise of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for making clinical decisions and remedying recurrences in VL.",

        "abstract": "Treatment against leishmaniasis is associated with severe side effects, high costs, and parasitic resistance. Preclinical models such as humanised mice would aid therapeutic improvement or the development of a vaccine. We developed a model in which human skin transplants on immunodeficient mice are infected with Leishmania major. Parasite inoculation of the skin transplant led to a robust infection with increasing numbers of parasites in the skin and visceral organs. In addition, intraperitoneally co-administered allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were strongly recruited to skin lesions, with ≥ 65% of the cells being positive for anti-human CD45; we identified ~20% CD4<sup>+</sup> and ~50% CD8<sup>+</sup> human T cells. The number of skin-resident macrophages or dendritic cells was unaltered compared to healthy skin prior to transplantation, and PBMC administration did not alter their numbers. Together, we show that parasitic infection provides a strong inflammatory signal that leads to recruitment of T cells into skin transplants. The presence of antigen-presenting cells in the transplants-as an important prerequisite for proper APC-T-cell interaction-recreates a fully human skin microenvironment that allows for stroma/immune cell interactions upon infection. This model may be of high interest to researchers interested in translating skin research questions into the human system in vivo.",

The purpose is to identify the characteristics, distribution of the clinical parameters and treatment outcomes of VL among affected children younger than five years old. A retrospective cohort study design was used by involving all patients admitted with the rk-39 serology diagnosed patients in the VL treatment center from 15th December 2021 until 7th February 2023 in Massawa. It evaluated a patients' hospital stay, progressive changes and finally assessing treatment outcome as favorable and unfavorable. Our study found 97 rk-39 confirmed VL cases. Out of these, most cases were males 53.6%, median age with IQR of 32 (15-66) months, and most were from Ghelalo (62%) and Foro (35.1%) of the Northern Red Sea region of Eritrea. The mortality rate was 14.4% which is 14 out of 97 cases. The younger cases were found to have higher mortality rate. Children who recovered or those with favorable outcome were found to have better baseline hematologic parameters, without concomitant infection and few blood products given. Pre and post treatment anthropometric and hematologic comparisons showed a significant positive shift with p < 0.001 paired sample <i>T</i>-test. Finally, a time-to-event analysis revealed a 1729 days of follow-up period with overall mortality of 6.3 per 1000 child-days. Along with the implementation of updated diagnostic and treatment guidelines, our study discovered the need for region-specific approach of the disease, a holistic treatment approach including their nutritional status and focusing on specific socio-demographic factors, which strongly affect the outcome of the patients.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the prevention of parasitic diseases including leishmaniasis, particularly cutaneous leishmaniasis as the smost common type of the disease, has increased health concerns around the world. Although some drugs such as Glucantim and Amphotericin B are approved, they have side effects. Therefore, treatment without side effects is a priority. In this study, the recombinant lentiviral vaccine containing a novel multi-epitope of KMP11 and HASPB of Leishmania major (L. major) was synthesized. The multi-epitope construct was previously designed in silico, subcloned into the pCDH513 lentiviral vector, and the recombinant lentiviral multi-epitope vaccine (rLV-multi-epitope) was synthesized in HEK293T cells using the packaging vectors. The Western Blotting method was used to confirm the gene expression. Then, the rLV-multi-epitope vaccine was injected twice, along with two control groups: phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and rLV-empty to immunize the BALB/c mice. Twenty-one days after the second injection, the splenocytes of the mice were isolated and stimulated with the L. major lysate. Also, the serum level of IgG1 and IgG2a, and gamma interfron (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were assessed using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test. The results of the enzyme-linked immunoassay ELISA showed that the titer of IFN-γ and IL-4 were increased in the immunized group. Also, the level of IFN-γ was higher significantly and as compared to IL-4, and as a result, the Th1 response was generated in the main group. Additionally, the humoral immune response was assessed, indicating that the titer of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies in the sera of the immunized mice was increased compared to the control groups. Moreover, the serum level of IgG2a to IgG1 was increased in the main group. Therefore, the humoral immune response was increased, which can also have a positive effect on increasing the Th1 response. Our results revealed that immunization with the novel rLV-multi-epitope vaccine could stimulate the immune system toward Th1 by increasing the production of IFN-γ and IgG2a opsonin antibody.",

We pursued the possibility of sHLH and repeated a bone marrow examination, which showed <i>Leishmania donovani</i> bodies with haemophagocytosis. Thereafter, the patient was prescribed liposomal amphotericin B, but unfortunately, he succumbed to the illness. This case reiterates that infection is a frequent trigger of sHLH.

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by protozoa of the genus <i>Leishmania</i>. While it is endemic in the Mediterranean Basin and the Balkans, Romania remains a non-endemic country. However, climate change, increased international travel, and the documented presence of competent vectors (<i>Phlebotomus</i> spp.) have raised concerns about the potential emergence of autochthonous cases. We report two cases of imported cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) diagnosed in central Romania, a region without previously confirmed human or animal cases. The first case involved a 31-year-old male with a recent travel history to Spain, presenting with erythematous papules and plaques that evolved into ulcerated lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically and by a PCR. Treatment with miltefosine was effective, with minimal hepatic toxicity and a sustained response at a six-month follow-up. The second case concerned an 11-year-old boy who had traveled to Elba, Italy. He developed ulcerative lesions that progressed rapidly and were complicated by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> superinfection. Despite an initially negative smear, PCR testing of the skin lesion confirmed the presence of CL. Antifungal therapy with fluconazole led to clinical improvement; treatment was ongoing at the time of publication. These cases highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with CL in non-endemic settings. The varied clinical evolution underscores the importance of considering leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis of chronic, non-healing cutaneous lesions, particularly in patients with a travel history to endemic regions. Increased awareness among clinicians, supported by accurate diagnostic tools and public health surveillance, is essential to identify and manage imported leishmaniasis. Given the absence of a licensed vaccine and the growing risk of vector expansion in Eastern Europe, these cases support the WHO's inclusion of leishmaniasis among the priority neglected tropical diseases targeted for intensified global control efforts by 2030.",

Indicators related to access and operability of the strategy implemented were calculated for the steps involved in approving the request for use and dispensing of the drug. The authorization rate was 97.5% for 281 valid requests. The outpatient clinic of the René Rachou Institute, a reference center for leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, was responsible for the largest number of requests during the period. The health macro-regions Centre and North concentrated the largest number of requests (48.9% and 33.6%), which coincided with the regions with the highest number of reported cases. Median time for analyzing requests and for the person to access the medicine was 1.0 (0-76) and 10.0 (0-340) days, with significant variation between the health macro-regions. One hundred and nineteen people were treated in a municipality other than their place of residence. Of these, 49 needed to travel to another health macro-region. The miltefosine diffusion rate was 11.3% for the three-year period monitored, with significant variation between the macro-regions. The indicators confirmed that miltefosine has been implemented, but revealed low diffusion and regional disparities.

It is a neglected tropical disease that is endemic in Asia, the Middle East, North and East Africa, the Mediterranean region, and South and Central America. Clinical manifestations and disease severity depend on the species of the infecting parasites and the immunity status of the host. <i>Leishmania</i> represses the protective host immune response by manipulating the macrophage function, subverting cytokine expression to favor its survival and dissemination.

This study investigates the potential of Beauvericin (BEA), a fungal secondary metabolite, as an alternative antileishmanial agent. This study investigates the potential of Beauvericin (BEA), a fungal secondary metabolite, as an alternative antileishmanial agent. We assessed the efficacy of BEA against different developmental stages of <i>L. tropica</i> using <i>in vitro</i> assays and an <i>in vivo Galleria mellonella</i> infection model. The ability of <i>L. tropica</i> to develop resistance to BEA and its effects on the parasite's gene expression profile were also examined. BEA exhibited potent antileishmanial activity with equipotency across both promastigote and amastigote stages of <i>L. tropica</i>, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.25 µM and 0.27 µM, respectively, significantly lower than those of miltefosine. Mechanistically, BEA acts as a calcium ionophore, inducing a marked increase in intracellular calcium levels, which serves as the primary cytotoxic event. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that BEA-induced calcium dysregulation triggers secondary cellular responses involving calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and stress response, contributing to its multifaceted mechanism of action. The <i>G. mellonella</i> model demonstrated that BEA significantly reduced parasite burden, improved survival rates. Notably, BEA showed a slower rate of resistance development compared to ML, indicating its potential as a more sustainable treatment option. BEA is a promising candidate for antileishmanial therapy, demonstrating superior efficacy, a broad mechanism of action, and a favorable resistance profile compared to ML. Further investigations in mammalian models are warranted to validate BEA's potential as a novel, cost-effective treatment for leishmaniasis.",

        "title": "DNA damage in canine leishmaniasis infection is detectable by micronucleus and comet assay in peripheral blood samples.",
        "abstract": "<i>Leishmania infantum</i> is a parasite that causes leishmaniasis in its visceral clinical manifestations, which is considered a zoonosis and can infect both humans and animals. Currently, there is no highly effective treatment available, and many animals that exhibit symptoms ultimately die as a result of the disease and its complications. The clinical signs of leishmaniasis are varied and nonspecific. The main symptoms are severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, weight loss, splenomegaly, lymphadenomegaly, liver disease, kidney failure, and skin lesions, among others. Due to the chronic inflammatory state caused by the parasite, an oxidative environment is created, leading to potential cell injury and damage to the infected animals' genetic material. To investigate DNA damage, we conducted the micronucleus test and comet assay, as well as measured serum LDH levels in infected and non-infected dogs. Our results indicate that infected dogs present significantly higher levels of serum LDH (461.4 ± 204.5 U/L, n=36) compared to healthy dogs (142.38 ± 37.94 U/L, n=5). Additionally, the DNA of infected dogs is more damaged than that of the control group, as demonstrated by the micronucleus test (p=0.01) and comet assay (p=0.002). These findings suggest that <i>Leishmania infantum</i> infection can lead to clastogenic events, highlighting the need for further research on this process. It is important to consider the potential mutagenic properties of <i>Leishmania infantum</i>, given its ability to cause DNA damage in infected animals.",

        "abstract": "Although tissue aspiration procedures (TAPs) are considered the gold standard for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) diagnosis, they often fail to detect disease progression before the amastigote-demonstrable phase. To overcome this limitation, a primary direct agglutination test (DAT) was developed using intact Leishmania donovani promastigotes initially treated with trypsin as the antigen. To enhance the exposure of specific epitopes on the promastigote surface and antibody-binding sites, alternative proteolytic agents were evaluated and incorporated into antigen processing and test execution. This approach led to significant or complete inhibition of agglutination in most known cross-reacting disorders. The LQ-DAT consistently demonstrated highly reproducible results across diverse geographical regions, regardless of the L. donovani sub-species or strain. To facilitate routine implementation and local production, the LQ-DAT processing know-how was disseminated to all major VL-endemic areas. Sensitivities comparable to TAP outcomes were demonstrated in 2,224 of 2,697 VL cases successfully diagnosed and treated over 35 years of routine, epidemic, and outbreak evaluations. Notably, 473 (17.5%) of these cases were symptomatic, with TAP-negative but LQ-DAT-positive results, and responded favorably (98.0%-100%) to specific treatment. Given the lower sensitivity also demonstrated by LQ-DAT, TAP does not meet the criteria for classification as the gold-standard VL diagnostic. Consequently, a positive response to specific anti-leishmanial treatment is recommended as a benchmark for diagnostic reliability. Beyond its advantage in detecting VL at earlier stages compared to TAP, the improved LQ-DAT described here also exhibited feasibility and stability required for local production in low-resource settings.",

The therapeutic options for the treatment of VL are limited due to problems such as drug resistance and toxicities. Drug repurposing can be a promising alternative in this case. In this work, the antileishmanial potential of FDA approved anti-arrhythmic drug propafenone has been evaluated for repurposing. It reduced the viability of L. donovani promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 8.25 ± 2.48 μM and 11.19 ± 0.01 μM respectively. In the macrophages, the IC<sub>50</sub> was 32 ± 7.07 μM. Propafenone treatment altered morphology of parasites and induced damage to the body and flagellum. The cell membrane became damaged and more permeable when the promastigotes were treated with this drug. However, no change in the cell membrane potential was detected. Treatment with propafenone was detrimental to mitochondrial health of L. donovani. It significantly depolarized the mitochondrial membrane and decreased the ATP levels in the promastigotes. Propafenone also induced oxidative stress in the parasites. Cell cycle arrest was detected at the G<sub>2</sub>/M stage. The data suggests that propafenone has antileishmanial potential and can be evaluated further in an experimental VL model.",

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a prevalent parasitic neglected disease caused by protozoans of the genus Leishmania. Currently, no vaccines are available for humans, and existing treatments are ineffective because of their toxicity and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Consequently, it is crucial to identify new potential therapeutic targets, thereby facilitating the development of effective therapies. This study indicates a correlation between the upregulated biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and the resistance to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and trivalent antimony exposure (Sb<sup>3+</sup>) in L. braziliensis promastigotes. CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing of the nicotinamide/nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyl transferase in L. braziliensis (Lbnmnat), the key gene in the NAD biosynthetic pathway, allowed upregulation at both the mRNA and protein levels, as well as elevated NAD and NADP contents in the Lbnmnat-edited parasites. A single guide RNA template, directed against the 5' end of the Lbnmnat and a donor DNA consisting of the mCherry reporter gene preceded by the 5' UTR from the Crithidia fasciculata phosphoglycerate kinase (CfPGKB) were electroporated into L. braziliensis promastigotes that constitutively express the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and T7 RNA polymerase. PCR analysis and DNA sequencing demonstrated the successful editing of the Lbnmnat gene. Importantly, dose-dependent oxidative stress susceptibility assays to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Sb<sup>3+</sup> revealed higher IC<sub>50</sub> values in the Lbnmnat-edited parasites. These findings denote a correlation between the upregulated biosynthesis of NAD in L. braziliensis and its enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, indicating that the Lbnmnat gene may play a significant role in the survival and resistance mechanisms of the parasite against antimony compounds.",

        "abstract": "The obligate human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (also known as GAS; Group A <i>Streptococcus</i>) carries high morbidity and mortality, primarily in impoverished or resource-poor regions. The failure rate of monotherapy with conventional antibiotics is high, and invasive infections by this bacterium frequently require extensive supportive care and surgical intervention. Thus, it is important to find new compounds with adjunctive therapeutic benefits. The conserved secreted protease streptopain (Streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin B; SpeB) directly contributes to disease pathogenesis by inducing pathological inflammation, degrading tissue, and promoting the evasion of antimicrobial host defense proteins. This study screened 400 diverse off-patent drugs and drug-like compounds for inhibitors of streptopain proteolysis. Lead compounds were tested for activity at lower concentrations and anti-virulence activities during <i>in vitro</i> infection. Significant inhibition of streptopain was seen for pentamidine, an anti-protozoal drug approved for the treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis. Streptopain inhibition rendered GAS susceptible to killing by human innate immune cells. These studies identify unexploited molecules as new starting points for drug discovery and a potential for repurposing existing drugs for the treatment of infections by GAS.IMPORTANCE<i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> is a common cause of severe invasive infections. Repeated infections can trigger autoimmune diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. This study examines how targeting a specific, highly conserved virulence factor of the secreted cysteine protease streptopain can sensitize a serious pathogen to killing by the immune system. Manipulating the host-pathogen interaction, rather than attempting to directly kill a microbe, is a promising therapeutic strategy. Notably, its benefits include limiting off-target effects on the microbiota. Streptopain inhibitors, including the antifungal and antiparasitic drug pentamidine as identified in this work, may therefore be useful in the treatment of <i>S. pyogenes</i> infection.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania species, affecting millions worldwide. The current treatment options for CL have several limitations, including low efficacy, inability to reach the target site, potential toxicity, and longer treatment duration, leading to poor patient compliance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for alternative treatments, especially topical ones, that are more effective, safe, and patient-friendly. Although numerous reviews have described the advantages of a wide range of nanoparticles in the treatment of CL, this review narrows its focus to the utilization of novel lipid-based nanocarriers for the topical treatment of CL, offering an in-depth analysis of the topical potential and mechanism of skin permeation of these lipidic nanocarriers. Lipid-based nanostructures such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers have been extensively studied for CL treatment, either alone or in combination with other drugs or therapies. These carriers can improve the bioavailability, stability, and efficacy of the drug, target the infected site, and reduce adverse effects on healthy tissues. Moreover, these can be easily formulated into different dosage forms, such as creams, gels, or ointments, for convenient topical application. Despite the many benefits of lipid-based carriers, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed, such as optimizing the formulation parameters, ensuring the reproducibility and scalability of the process, and evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy in clinical trials. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art lipid-based nanocarriers for topical treatment of CL, covering the recent advances, limitations, clinical evidence, and prospects of this promising approach. In addition, the skin and macrophage targeting potential of various lipid-based nanocarriers is also discussed, which is especially helpful in treating the lesions of CL.",

It is a morbid condition that leads to stigmatization and disfiguring scars. Numerous methods have been tried to treat leishmaniasis with variable cure rates and side effects. This study aimed to compare the effects of oral zinc bisglycinate (ZnGly) and oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ), alone and in combination, in treating acute CL. Materials and methods This comparative therapeutic study was conducted at the Center of Dermatology and Venereology, Medical City, Baghdad, Iraq, during the period from December 2021 to February 2023. All participants had been diagnosed through history and clinical examination, which involved skin smear in all patients and skin biopsy for some suspicious cases. Patients were classified into three groups based on the type of treatment: Group A was treated with oral ZnGly capsules 50 mg twice daily for eight weeks; Group B was administered oral HCQ tablets 200 mg twice daily for eight weeks; and Group C received a combination of both drugs for eight weeks. All patients were examined every four weeks for eight weeks, followed by every month for two months after stopping therapy. The treatment's impact on the lesions was assessed using Sharquie`s modified Leishmania score. Results A total of 40 patients with acute CL were included in this study, which spanned eight weeks. The total number of lesions was 144, and their duration ranged from five to 12 weeks. Group A included 14 patients, and the cure rate was 78.6% (11); Group B included 13 patients, and the cure rate was 84.7 % (11), while Group C included 13 patients, and the cure rate was 92.3% (12). We observed a statistically significant difference in the cure rate in Group C when compared to Group A and Group B at the end of the study (p=0.034). Conclusions While both oral ZnGly and HCQ as monotherapy were effective in the treatment of acute CL, the combination regimen of both drugs led to higher effectiveness without any increase in the frequency of adverse effects.",

In this context, vanillin-derived molecules are well established in inhibiting several kinases present in cancer cells and have high LD<sub>50</sub> values along with broad therapeutic window. In view of the demand of suitable oral candidate for controlling Leishmania parasitic proliferation in human body here, we are reporting ortho vanillin and l-Alanine amino acid derived ligand molecule t2-{(E)-[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methylidene] amino} propanoate (L) and its Cu(II) conjugates L<sub>1</sub> & L<sub>3</sub> as water-soluble, and nontoxic drug candidates for the treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis. In silico binding study against potential chemotherapeutic target MAP kinase (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, (PDB id: 4QNY) was undertaken and significant binding was shown by these molecules.

In this study, we evaluated the activity of LP against Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), wherein LP demonstrated both anti-promastigote and anti-amastigote activity, as measured by MTS cell viability assay and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) respectively, the IC<sub>50</sub> derived being 22.0 and 6.0 µM respectively, while the CC<sub>50</sub> was >500 µM, which translated into a safety index >83. LP induced leishmanicidal activity by triggering a redox imbalance in promastigotes, by enhancing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused lipid peroxidation, but failed to impact on generation of mitochondrial superoxide. Furthermore, as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) attenuated the parasiticidal properties of LP via scavenging the free radicals, it substantiated that the cytotoxicity of LP was mediated by inducing a redox imbalance. An apoptotic-like cell death was demonstrated in promastigotes, features being an enhanced annexin V positivity, altered mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell cycle arrest at sub G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>.

In this study, molecular docking approaches were used to identify potential inhibitors of LdHEL-67, a crucial DEAD-box RNA helicase (DDX3 family) in <i>L</i>. <i>donovani</i>. A total of 100 bioactive compounds were identified through GC-MS analysis of ethanol and hexane extracts of <i>Berberis asiatica</i>, of which 48 compounds were selected based on their percentage occurrence in extracts. These compounds were initially docked against LdHEL-67 and its human homolog (PDB ID: 6CZ5) using PyRx for comparative analysis. To enhance reliability, all 48 compounds were re-docked using AutoDock, and 14 compounds with the highest binding affinities were shortlisted for further evaluation.

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a potentially life-threatening protozoan infection that presents with many clinical manifestations, including cutaneous, mucocutaneus and visceral forms. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cutaneous leishmaniasis can persist or re-emerge due to treatment-induced immunosuppression. However, it remains unclear whether this severe opportunistic infection is primarily driven by medication-induced immunosuppression or other poorly understood immune-mediated mechanisms that increase susceptibility. We describe an unusual case of disseminated leishmaniasis in a 50-year-old Italian man from Apulia, diagnosed with RA two years earlier. Following 15 months of unsuccessful immunosuppressive therapies, he developed severe multilineage pancytopenia, moderate hypertransaminasemia, elevated inflammatory markers, monoclonal gammopathy, clinically significant hepatosplenomegaly, and an ulcerated skin lesion. Initial diagnostic efforts excluded common infectious agents, primary hematological disorders, Felty syndrome, and amyloidosis. The non-specific histopathological findings from the pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesion and the transient clinical response to empirical steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factors further complicated the diagnostic process. The breakthrough came when a liver biopsy, performed to investigate persistent hypertransaminasemia, revealed <i>Leishmania</i> amastigotes within macrophages. This finding triggered a re-evaluation of the ulcerated skin lesion, and histological analysis confirmed concurrent cutaneous leishmaniasis. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy also identified <i>Leishmania</i> amastigotes, clinching the diagnosis of disseminated leishmaniasis. A holistic re-assessment of the patient's clinical presentation, developmental history, and laboratory, radiologic, and pathological data led to the definitive diagnosis. Treatment with standard intravenous amphotericin B resulted in clinical resolution. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy a few weeks later confirmed the infection had been completely eradicated. In patients with rheumatological conditions, the overlapping symptoms of systemic diseases and infections like leishmaniasis can lead to significant diagnostic delays. This case underscores the importance of comprehensive and meticulous diagnostic evaluations in immunosuppressed individuals to prevent potentially fatal outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a dual role in leishmaniasis by contributing to both host defence and parasite survival mechanisms. In the host, ROS promote parasite clearance through induction of apoptosis, activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways (e.g., MAPK, JNK), inflammasome assembly, and M1 macrophage polarisation. Conversely, Leishmania species have evolved multiple strategies to neutralize ROS, including the upregulation of host antioxidant enzymes like HO-1, inhibition of ROS-producing pathways, and expression of parasite-derived antioxidants such as SOD, GPx, and trypanothione reductase. The parasite alsoadapts through gene regulation and metabolic changes to counter oxidative stress. Importantly, ROS have emerged as key targets for antileishmanial therapies, with various drugs and natural compounds shown to induce ROS-mediated parasite death, highlighting their potential in future therapeutic development. In summary, the survival of Leishmania hinges on its ability to counteract host-induced oxidative stress. Targeting its antioxidant defences and enhancing host ROS production can disrupt this balance, leading to parasite death. Exploring ROS-related signalling offers a promising path for developing effective therapies against leishmaniasis.",

We report the case of a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, presenting with autoimmune inflammatory manifestations and rapidly progressing kidney failure. The kidney biopsy revealed MPGN with extracapillary proliferation. The patient's condition rapidly improved under corticosteroid therapy, with normalization of the kidney function. However, during corticosteroid treatment, the patient developed severe visceral leishmaniasis with cutaneous, splenic, and osteo-medullary involvement. Upon review, we found that parasites were already present in minimal quantities in the bone marrow biopsy performed three months prior to corticosteroid treatment. We cannot conclusively determine whether the kidney lesions are linked to the autoimmune inflammatory manifestations of the myelodysplastic syndrome or to leishmaniasis. This case may be noteworthy due to the combination of two diseases that could be responsible for the histological lesions, and emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation in the case of MPGN.",

The scoping review was conducted in accordance with the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group's guidance and reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. We searched the following databases and sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Global Medicus Index, PROSPERO, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry and known local journals. We included studies addressing the issue of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia that were published in English language. Two reviewers independently extracted data from each study, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. The identified studies were analysed using an extensive codebook, which was previously developed by this team and adapted to the Ethiopian context to classify the research into different categories. A total of 8698 articles were identified. A stepwise review was conducted, and 639 papers were selected for inclusion. The research spans different themes and designs and has steadily increased over the past 14 years. Research on prevention and control, health systems/policies and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, as well as randomised controlled trials, was lacking. Studies on coinfections with other diseases accounted for 14% of research. The findings underscore the growing amount of research on leishmaniasis in Ethiopia, addressing several themes and emphasising the need for more research in prevention, control, health systems/policy and high-quality studies for evidence-based treatment.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) typically manifests as one or more chronic, non-healing skin ulcers, often with raised borders and central necrosis, accompanied by erythema. These lesions are most commonly seen on exposed areas. However, the clinical presentation of CL can vary based on factors such as the <i>Leishmania</i> species, the host's immune response, and the region of infection. Biopsy typically confirms the diagnosis of CL by identifying amastigotes, the intracellular form of the parasite, in tissue samples. However, there are rare instances where a biopsy fails to detect the amastigotes, resulting in a negative biopsy despite a clinical presentation highly suggestive of CL. This scenario complicates the diagnostic process and may lead to delays in proper treatment. We present the case of a middle-aged gentleman from a desert region of the country who had several weeks of hand lesions unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. Although a biopsy of the lesions was negative, he was clinically diagnosed with CL based on positive <i>Leishmania</i> serology and the gross appearance of the lesions. There was no evidence of systemic involvement on bone marrow biopsy, and the lesions significantly improved with treatment using amphotericin B and miltefosine.",

        "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania donovani is characterized by clinicopathological features like hepatomegaly with loss of liver function, etc. Albumin is an essential parameter of liver function, performing various tasks like maintaining osmotic balance in blood vessels, preventing tissue fluid leakage, carrier properties, etc. Human VL patients and Leishmania donovani-infected hamsters (ExVL) were tested for their albumin levels. IL-10 derived from Leishmania donovani-infected monocytes and recombinant IL-10 were tested on HepG2 cells for CEBP-β and albumin expression with IL-10 blocking and JAK1/STAT3 inhibition. CEBP-β binding onto the albumin promoter and its silencing were performed to confirm its role in albumin expression. Low albumin, i.e., hypoalbuminemia, was found in visceral leishmaniasis and ExVL. Its levels were inversely associated with parasitic load and hepatic IL-10 in both models. When treated with Leishmania donovani-driven IL-10 from the infected monocytes and recombinant IL-10, there was a significant decrease in albumin expression from HepG2 cells in a JAK1/STAT3-dependent manner. To further explore the molecular mechanism behind hypoalbuminemia in Visceral leishmaniasis, CEBP-β, a transcription factor having three isoforms (LAP1, LAP2, and LIP), was shown to increase upon recombinant IL-10 treatment and bind to the D site of the albumin promoter using Chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR. shRNA silencing results confirm CEBP-β-mediated decrease in albumin levels. Our findings showed that increased hepatic IL-10 upon Leishmania donovani infection reduces albumin levels in a JAK1/STAT3 and CEBP-β-dependent manner.",

There is limited research on the renal effects of antimonial compounds. A 25-year-old Arab male patient presented to the dermatology clinic with a 9-month history of multiple skin lesions. The patient had a history of end-stage renal failure. Physical examination of these lesions revealed ulcerated nodules that are painless and non-itchy located on the hands, forearms, feet, and neck. The lesions were diagnosed as cutaneous leishmaniasis tropica on the basis of the histopathology of a skin biopsy and the patient's region, which is endemic to female sandflies and this specific subtype cutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient started taking meglumine antimoniate intramuscular administration after the dialysis session at a dose of 750 mg/kg per week. The lesions showed partial to complete remission after 60 days of treatment without any meglumine antimoniate side effects. The patient has not experienced any relapse of leishmaniasis since kidney transplantation 6 years ago.

        "abstract": "Leishmaniasis, a major neglected tropical disease (NTD), affects millions of people globally. Current treatments are plagued by infection relapse, high toxicity, and lengthy regimens. A contemporary study investigated the 2-aminobenzimidazole scaffold for leishmanicidal activity but it was found to be associated with poor exposure and lack of efficacy in vivo. This inspired us to develop a QSAR model of leishmanicidal activity leveraging the reported in vivo leishmanicidal activity data toward Leishmania infantum. Interpretable 2D molecular descriptors were employed so that the key leishmanicidal structural features could be utilized to develop the novel molecules. The QSAR model highlighted key structural features associated with leishmanicidal activity, including hydrophobicity, aromatic ring, hydrogen bond acceptor/donor, as well as hetero-atoms (nitrogen, fluorine, etc.) that enhance activity. Various categories of drugs from DrugBank were screened using the developed QSAR model, followed by inverse docking against the putative protein targets for leishmaniasis, to identify the plausible target of the parent leads. QSAR-guided structural modifications were undertaken to generate potential analogs of the top five parent leads. The analogs were checked for their ADMET profiles, and the protein-ligand interactions stability of the top candidates (DB03231-A6 and DB12269-A4) was assessed by 300 ns molecular dynamics simulation. Free energy landscapes (FEL) of the apo and bound target receptor were constructed to further streamline the prioritized analogs. Upon cumulative retrospection, an analog of DB12269 (N-{5-[2-amino-4-fluro-7-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5-carbonyl]-4,6-difluoropyrid-3yl}-2-(5-chloropyrazin-2-yl)acetamide) is proposed for further wet lab validation studies for prospective application against leishmaniasis.",

Traditional treatments include topical agents and laser therapies, but recent advancements have introduced intradermal and microneedling-assisted Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) injections as promising alternatives. This study aims to compare the efficacy of these two methods in reducing the size of enlarged facial pores. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at a referral centre in Iran. Thirty patients aged 25-60 years with enlarged facial pores were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive intradermal BoNTA injections on one side of the face and microneedling-assisted BoNTA injections on the other side. Dermoscopic evaluation and physical examination were performed at baseline and 1-month post-treatment. Improvement in pore size was assessed by three blinded dermatologists using the Quartile Improvement Scale (QIS), and patient satisfaction was measured using the Likert scale. The average age of participants was 34.2 years, with 29 females and one male. Dermoscopic and physical examination scores showed no significant difference between the two treatment modalities for both cheek and nose areas (p > 0.05). Patient satisfaction scores were also comparable between the two sides (p = 0.13). Both treatments effectively reduced pore size, but no statistically significant difference was observed between intradermal and microneedling-assisted BoNTA injections. Both intradermal and microneedling-assisted BoNTA injections are effective in treating enlarged facial pores, with no significant difference in efficacy. These findings provide flexibility for dermatologists in selecting the appropriate treatment method based on patient preferences and clinical considerations.",

Current treatments for both diseases are highly toxic for the vertebrate host and lack specificity for the parasites, highlighting the need for the discovery of new therapies against these diseases. In this study, we tested the use of the lytic peptide <i>Hecate</i> and a <i>Ligand-Hecate</i> construct that incorporates a ligand to bind the lytic peptide to protozoa membranes and screened them for protozoacidal activity. We first screened parasite survival of luciferase expressing <i>Leishmania major</i> promastigotes and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> epimastigotes in the presence of <i>Hecate</i> or <i>Ligand-Hecate</i>, and after 12, 48 and 96 h by measuring the parasite luciferase activity. In addition, High-Content Imaging Assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of intracellular <i>L. major</i> amastigotes propagated inside murine macrophages after treatment with <i>Hecate</i> or <i>Ligand-Hecate</i>. The lowest half maximal effective concentration observed after 48 h of incubation with <i>Hecate</i> and <i>Ligand-Hecate</i> was lower against <i>L. major</i> promastigotes than <i>T. cruzi</i> epimastigotes. <i>Ligand-Hecate</i> treatment significantly reduced infection rate of macrophages <i>L. major</i> amastigotes compared to the non-treated vehicle control; while treatment with <i>Hecate</i> was significant only at higher drug concentrations. Importantly, no significant cytotoxicity was observed when screened against intraperitoneal murine macrophages for either <i>Hecate</i> or <i>Ligand-Hecate</i> treatments.
