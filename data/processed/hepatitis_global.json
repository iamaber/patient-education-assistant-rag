        "abstract": "Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has demonstrated non-inferior efficacy to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with improved bone and renal safety across diverse populations, including those with mild renal or hepatic impairment. We evaluated TAF efficacy and safety in a subset of Taiwanese chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients enrolled in a phase 2, multicentre study (NCT03180619) of patients with more advanced renal or hepatic impairment. In a sub-analysis of virally-suppressed (hepatitis B virus DNA <20 IU/mL) adult Taiwanese CHB patients with renal (chronic kidney disease stage ≥1) or hepatic (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class B or C) impairment, all participants received open-label TAF 25 mg once daily for 96 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated based on proportion of patients with viral suppression and normal alanine aminotransferase levels. Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were considered over 96 weeks, alongside renal function parameters, hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD) and fasting lipid changes. Of 124 patients treated in the phase 2 study, 33 (27 %) were from Taiwan. All sub-analysis participants (renal impairment, n = 22; hepatic impairment, n = 11) achieved virologic response after 24 weeks of TAF; of the 28 patients who completed the study, 96 % (n = 27) maintained suppression through Week 96. One AE in each group, and no serious AEs, were related to study treatment. Following TAF switch, renal function and BMD remained stable or improved slightly over 96 weeks. Consistent with overall population results, TAF demonstrated high efficacy and favourable safety and tolerability in Taiwanese CHB patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

        "abstract": "Screening nonhuman primates (NHPs) for tuberculosis (TB) is important to protect the health of NHP colonies and people who interact with them. Screening is especially important for imported NHPs from countries where TB is prevalent and biosecurity practices may be lax. There are a variety of testing methods available for TB screening and diagnosis in NHPs; all have limitations, and their performance in different settings is incompletely characterized. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects TB testing results as part of its regulatory oversight of NHP importation. We collated the results of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), multiplexed fluorometric immunoassay (MFIA), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex PCR, staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture of bacteria from tissues for imported NHPs in CDC-mandated quarantine during fiscal years 2021 to 2024. We used these data to assess test performance and intertest agreement for the different tests used. Among 107 imported NHPs tested, TST and IGRA were the most common antemortem tests performed, but they agreed poorly with each other and with culture. AFB staining and PCR exhibited moderate agreement and high positive predictive values using culture as the gold standard. The most commonly affected tissues were lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, regardless of the Mycobacterium sp. identified. Further research is needed to identify and validate additional methods for TB testing in NHPs, particularly for antemortem screening. Tissue acid-fast staining and PCR exhibited high positive predictive values and could be useful to inform policies and clinical decisions about colony management and occupational health while awaiting culture results.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses a significant global public health challenge due to its ability to rapidly evolve antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we analyzed 141 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae obtained between 2015 and 2022 from clinical laboratories in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance mechanisms, and clonal diversity were investigated. Whole-genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed the circulation of internationally relevant sequence types (STs) such as ST-1901, ST-7363, and ST-9363. While non-susceptibility rates to penicillin (98 %) and ciprofloxacin (73 %) remained stable compared to earlier data, tetracycline resistance decreased from 67 % (in 2015-2016) to 20 % (in 2019-2020), likely due to the reduced prevalence of ST-1588. However, mainly after 2020, tetM plasmids were detected in ST-7822 and the emerging ST-7363, suggesting the concern of a rising occurrence of these determinants in the near future. Azithromycin non-susceptibility varied between 15 and 33 % in the different time frames, associated with mutations in the mtrR promoter and rrl gene, affecting isolates across eleven STs. While no ceftriaxone non-susceptibility was identified, ST-1901 and ST-7363 isolates harbored unique mosaic penA 34 alleles, and ST-1580/ST-17526 carried semi-mosaic 93 alleles. These findings underscore the persistence of resistance to older antimicrobials, the spread of plasmid-mediated resistance in key clones, and the growing threat of azithromycin resistance, which could compromise the treatment of gonorrhea in patients allergic to beta-lactams.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the associations between surgical menopause, age at menopause, and frailty in older women. Furthermore, we examine whether age at menopause mediates the potential association between surgical menopause and frailty, and the extent of interaction or joint effects of surgical menopause and age at menopause on frailty. The analysis included 7462 women aged ≥60 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018. Frailty was measured using a 49-item frailty index and was diagnosed if the score on that index exceeded 0.21. Menopausal data were collected using a standardized reproductive health questionnaire. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between surgical menopause, menopausal age, and frailty. We also conducted mediation analyses and interaction analyses on both the multiplicative and additive scales. Of the 7462 women, 2687 (32.4 %) had frailty. Women with a history of surgical menopause had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.44 (95 % CI: 1.25-1.66) for frailty compared to those with natural menopause. Age at menopause mediated 26.4 % of the total association between surgical menopause and frailty. No significant multiplicative or additive interactions were observed in the effects of type of menopause and age at menopause on frailty (Additive: Relative excess risk due to interaction = -0.01, 95 % CI: -0.32-0.31; Multiplicative, OR = 0.94, 95 % CI: 0.75-1.19). Joint ORs for individuals with both surgical and early menopause, compared with those with natural menopause and without early menopause, were 1.59 (95 % CI: 1.40-1.81) for frailty. In postmenopausal women, surgical menopause was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of frailty than natural menopause. Age at menopause mediated more than 26 % of this association.",

        "abstract": "A 56-year-old man receiving immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate (MTX) for a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder developed acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV). Persistent HEV viremia was observed, and the patient was diagnosed with chronic HEV infection based on the continued presence of HEV RNA in both serum (10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL) and feces (~ 10<sup>9</sup> copies/mL in 15% suspensions) 6 months after the initial infection. A 12-week course of ribavirin (RBV) therapy, combined with gradual tapering of MTX, resulted in undetectable HEV RNA levels in serum and feces at the end of the RBV treatment. However, 6 months after completion of RBV therapy and MTX cessation, HEV RNA reappeared at low levels in serum (10 copies/mL) and feces (~ 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL in 15% suspensions). This low-level viremia persisted for approximately 4 months without any clinical symptoms or additional treatment. Eventually, HEV RNA became spontaneously undetectable in both serum and feces, and the patient was considered cured based on sustained HEV RNA negativity 1129 days after the onset of hepatitis. This case highlights the importance of extended follow-up-beyond the standard 6 months-when assessing the viral clearance in HEV-infected patients following antiviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Using the Global Burden of Disease 2021 data, this study reports the global, regional, and national disease burden of liver cancer due to hepatitis B (LCDHB) from 1990 to 2021, stratified by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI), and projects future burden to 2051. We examined incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of LCDHB. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), age-standardized death rates (ASDR), and age-standardized DALYs rates were analyzed (1990-2021). Spearman correlation assessed age-standardized rates-SDI relationships. The Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model projected the burden to 2051. Compared to 1990, the number of LCDHB incidences, deaths, and DALYs increased by 46.9, 41.2, and 33.9% in 2021; however, from 1990 to 2021, the ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALYs rate all exhibited a declining trend. In 2021, the highest ASIR occurred in East Asia, High-income Asia Pacific, and Western sub-Saharan Africa. At the national and regional levels, Mongolia, the Republic of Paraguay, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas showed peak ASIR. ASIR was higher in males and increased with age, peaking at 85-89 age group for both males and females in 2021. A reverse U-shaped correlation existed between age-standardized DALYs and SDI during 1990-2021. BAPC projections indicate declining global ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALYs rates (2021-2051). Despite rising incidence, deaths, and DALYs, LCDHB treatment challenges persist, especially for males and elderly populations.

Early recurrence is largely driven by aggressive tumor biology, while late recurrence reflects de novo carcinogenesis in a cirrhotic liver. Traditional clinical and pathological predictors are insufficient for accurately identifying high-risk patients. Emerging translational advances including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers; liquid biopsy techniques; artificial intelligence (AI)-driven histological and radiomic analyses offer new avenues to refine recurrence risk stratification and guide perioperative therapy. Simultaneously, the shifting etiological landscape from viral hepatitis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and alcohol-related liver disease underscores the need for tailored surveillance and preventive strategies. Advanced technologies such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide unprecedented insights into fibrosis progression and tumor evolution.

        "abstract": "Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major viral pathogen that causes severe complications in immunosuppressed individuals, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In these patients, Cytomegalovirus has been associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and even graft-versus-host disease, and a possible relationship has been identified between Cytomegalovirus genotypes and clinical course, complications and outcome. Early detection of Cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation is important, and previous findings show that it could potentially be evaluated in saliva, where HCMV causes asymptomatic viral shedding. Since saliva can be collected easily and safely, it is important to evaluate its potential for HCMV detection and genotyping, especially in pediatric patients who are receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using saliva to detect and genotype HCMV in a cohort of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCTR). This study was conducted at Fundación Hospital Pediátrico la Misericordia, in Bogota, Colombia. Stimulated saliva samples were collected once a week and subjected to HCMV detection by qualitative PCR and genotyping by nested PCR followed by sequencing. Finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Twenty patients were enrolled, and 105 saliva samples were collected, of which 29 were positive for HCMV. Twelve patients had at least one positive sample. The gB1 genotype was identified with no coinfection with any other genotype. Phylogenetic analysis showed that some saliva samples were closer to the sequence reported for the Towne laboratory strain, while others were closer to the Merlin strain, with slight differences between them. It was demonstrated that saliva can be used to detect and genotype Cytomegalovirus in pediatric transplant recipients, and that sample collection is easy, with no risk of bleeding or discomfort in the pediatric patients evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are common in the European population, typically presenting with mucocutaneous and anogenital manifestations. However, disseminated infections and organ involvement are rare, usually occurring in immunocompromised individuals, particularly after hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation. HSV1/2-induced hepatitis is infrequent but can result in acute liver failure (ALF) and increased mortality. We present a case of fulminant ALF caused by disseminated primary HSV2 infection in a fifty-year-old male with rheumatoid arthritis treated with the JAK-inhibitor upadacitinib for 3 months prior to presentation. Clinical examination revealed severe oropharyngeal mucositis and hepatic encephalopathy. Initial laboratory results showed bicytopenia, significantly elevated transaminases, bilirubin, inflammatory markers, and severe coagulopathy. Empirical treatment with an antimicrobial regimen, intravenous aciclovir, acetylcysteine, and plasmapheresis (PPH) was initiated. The patient was listed for urgent liver transplantation based on King's College criteria. Further investigations revealed a high viral load of HSV2 DNA in the blood, and transjugular liver biopsy confirmed extensive liver necrosis with positive HSV staining. Despite antiviral therapy, the HSV2 viral load remained high, indicating resistance, and the patient was deemed \"nontransplantable\" due to clinical deterioration with progressive hepatic coma, hemorrhagic-septic shock, multiorgan failure, and secondary bowel ischemia, ultimately leading to the patient's death from refractory shock. This is only the second documented case of fulminant ALF due to HSV2 hepatitis in a patient undergoing JAK inhibition, and the first involving upadacitinib. It highlights the importance of considering primary herpesvirus infection as a potential cause of ALF, particularly in immunocompromised patients, and underscores the need for early antiviral intervention to improve outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Chronic liver disease has become a global health crisis, with increasing incidence and mortality rates placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. A key factor in the progression of chronic liver disease is intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, which influences liver function <i>via</i> the intricate liver-gut axis. This axis plays a central role in various physiological processes, and disruptions in microbial composition can exacerbate liver pathology. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, with the potential to restore the composition and metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota. Supported by encouraging findings from clinical trials and animal studies, FMT has demonstrated therapeutic benefits, including improvements in clinical symptoms, objective indicators, and long-term prognosis. These benefits encompass reductions in hepatic lipid deposition and inflammation, mitigation of complications in advanced liver disease, promotion of hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and enhancement of cognitive function. Although clinical evidence remains preliminary, current data underscore the transformative potential of FMT in managing chronic liver diseases. Nonetheless, challenges persist, including the need for standardized procedures, variability among donors, potential risks, and concerns regarding long-term safety. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current literature on the efficacy and safety of FMT, while exploring future research directions to expand its application in liver disease management.",

The aim of this study was to investigate hepatitis C virus (HCV) variability and frequency of NS5B naturally occurring polymorphisms and transmitted resistance-associated mutations or substitutions (RAMs or RASs) in DAAs-naïve patients. From 240 HCV-infected, DAA-naïve individuals, the NS5B region of 92 samples were sequenced, genotyped by phylogeny using MEGA 11.0.13 software and analysed for polymorphisms conferring resistance to polymerase inhibitors using bioinformatics tools (Geno2Pheno HCV 0.92 and BioEdit version 7.2.5). Thirty-two GT1 (34.8%), 37 GT2 (40.2%), 22 GT4 (23.9%) and 1 GT5 (1.1%), 13 subtypes (1e, 1g, 1h, 1j, 1l, 2j, 2r, 4a, 4f, 4l, 4p, 4t and 5a) were found.

However, the polymorphisms of unreported resistance-associated impact in positions 316 and 321 were identified: C316H (8.7%), C316N (18.5%), V321I (6.5%) and a double mutant C316H/V321I (4.3%). Comparison of GTs obtained by a commercial PCR kit versus Sanger sequencing and phylogeny of the NS5B region, showed a discrepancy of 30%. Genotype 5 was identified for the first time in Cameroon.

This case report presents a rare case of spontaneous necrosis of a small HCC in a patient with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. A 63-year-old male with compensated hepatitis B-related cirrhosis was under routine surveillance when a suspicious liver lesion was detected on ultrasound. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of an 18-mm HCC in segment VIII, corresponding to Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer stage A. Due to limited curative treatment options, transarterial chemoembolization was considered. However, a follow-up CT scan was performed 2 weeks before the procedure unexpectedly revealed complete regression of arterial enhancement, suggestive of spontaneous tumor necrosis. The patient remained asymptomatic, with stable liver function and mild biological inflammatory markers. No evidence of vascular thrombosis or significant systemic inflammation was noted, suggesting localized vascular disturbances or intrinsic tumor factors might have precipitated the necrosis. This case highlights the exceptional occurrence of spontaneous necrosis in a small HCC.

Although metastasis from lung cancer to the prostate is exceedingly rare, we present a rare case of prostatic metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and no evidence of a primary lung lesion. A 64-years-old male with chronic hepatitis B and a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed in 2014 presented in 2023 with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Initial imaging revealed isolated bone metastasis, initially presumed to be recurrent HCC. Given the long interval since diagnosis, a bone biopsy was performed, unexpectedly showing adenocarcinoma. Subsequent PET-CT identified a prostatic lesion without pulmonary abnormalities, leading to an initial diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer. Prostate biopsy, however, revealed features consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Molecular testing detected an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, confirming metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient responded favorably to osimertinib therapy. This case illustrates a rare instance of prostatic metastasis from EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma and emphasizes the critical role of repeat biopsy, molecular profiling, and multidisciplinary evaluation in atypical metastatic presentations. The diagnostic process involved a \"triple reversal\" phenomenon, revising initial misdiagnoses of recurrent HCC and primary prostate cancer to metastatic NSCLC.

        "abstract": "Despite significant achievements in combating hepatitis C (HCV), HCV remains a major global public health issue with approximately 71 million cases and 400,000 deaths annually. The international community has taken several important steps for HCV control, including the Global Health Sector Strategy (2016-2021), the Global Hepatitis Action Plan (2011), and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) for 2030. However, achieving the World Health Assembly's goal of eliminating HCV by 2030 treating 90% of all infected individuals remains a significant challenge, particularly in Pakistan. This study delves into the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in the hepatitis elimination policy and its implementation in Pakistan, identifying barriers to effective policy execution and highlighting motivating factors. Through a phenomenological approach, interviews were conducted with ten key informants, including policymakers, clinicians and provincial hepatitis program personnel. Thematic analysis uncovered several critical themes: perceptions of hepatitis and elimination policies, the feasibility of achieving elimination goals, international collaborations, policy development, gaps in epidemiological data, and the influence of political contexts. The findings emphasize the need for a robust national database, stronger political commitment, better resource allocation, and a more integrated healthcare system. Drawing on successful models, such as Egypt, the study suggests that Pakistan must adopt comprehensive and coordinated strategies to meet the WHO targets and eliminate hepatitis by 2030.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a genetically diverse blood-borne pathogen causing liver inflammation and damage. It is one of the global public health problems responsible for claiming thousands of lives every year. Although there are various HCV testing strategies depending on the specific circumstances and guidance of local authorities, the proportion of diagnosed HCV cases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) is estimated to be less than 5%. This review analyzes and documents evidence for different ways of screening HCV. The updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines have been used as the basis for this scoping review. Retrieved articles were screened and extracted by three independent individuals to make sure that all pertinent literatures were included. A total of 8318 records were retrieved from four electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar). Of the total retrieved records and after applying the pre-defined inclusion criteria, we included 51 studies in this review. According to the studies included in this review, three major screening approaches were noted: The universal, targeted, and risk-based HCV screening strategies. Population to screen include the baby boomer cohort, pregnant women, key populations, those experiencing homelessness, adults visiting health facilities, employees, and social event attendants. A \"one-stop-shop\" HCV testing initiative at different settings, such as prisons, addiction rehabilitation centers, and community dropping centers, were found to increase HCV test uptake among key populations. Integrating HCV screening with the existing HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics was highlighted to identifying and linking HCV-infected individuals to appropriate care and treatment. Although there are many ways of diagnosing HCV for treatment, identifying those who were reactive for HCV antibody first, followed by an HCV-antigen test for those antibody-positive, were found to be the most cost-efficient way of diagnosing HCV infection. HCV screening among pregnant women, the baby boomer cohort, adults visiting health facilities, engaging in injection drug use, incarcerated individuals, and those experiencing homelessness are useful approaches in identifying HCV-antibody positive individuals. An efficient way to reach the most at-risk people is to incorporate HCV screening into community service centers and clinics.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has been a game-changer in the elimination of hepatitis C virus infection. DAAs treatment achieved higher rates of sustained virological response among HCV-infected individuals across different virus genotypes. DAAs directly target HCV viral several proteins in the HCV lifecycle resulting in controlling the infection. So far, the immune system also plays a crucial role in effective viral eradication. Prolonged antigen exposure, coupled with high viral loads, are key factors that drive immune system failure and the development of chronic infection. T cell exhaustion is the hallmark of the failure of immune response to eliminate the infection. Several sequelae contribute to T cell exhaustion, including the failure of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, the expansion of the immune suppressive effects of regulatory T cells, and the modulation of epigenetics, which collectively contribute to the persistence of HCV infection. The interplay between DAA therapy and the influence on immune response particularly T cell exhaustion is still an opening question. In this review, we shed light on the recent studies exploring the impact of DAA therapy on CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response as well as the epigenetics change. We also aim to bridge the gap in the new approaches to HCV control.",

        "abstract": "International guidelines recommend the administration of two doses of pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccination for people with chronic liver disease to prevent severe complications. We aimed to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage and mortality in adults with chronic liver disease in England. We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected medical record data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network. We included people aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with chronic liver disease between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2022. The primary outcome of interest was hepatitis A vaccination. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was calculated using the number of vaccinated people with chronic liver disease as the numerator and the chronic liver disease population in the RSC dataset as the denominator. We compared individual characteristics by vaccination status using descriptive statistics. We used a multistate survival model to estimate the transition probabilities between four states: (1) diagnosis of chronic liver disease; (2) first hepatitis A vaccination; (3) second hepatitis A vaccination; and (4) death. 664 571 individuals aged 18 years or older with chronic liver disease were identified from the RSC sentinel network population, of whom 625 079 individuals were included in our analysis. Of 625 079 individuals with chronic liver disease, 13 875 (2·2%) had received a first hepatitis A vaccination, 3007 (0·4%) had received a second dose, 732 (5·3%) of 13 875 vaccinated individuals died, and 101 065 (16·5%) of 611 204 individuals without vaccination died during the study period. Adjusting for death as a competing risk, vaccination was more likely among younger age quintiles (hazard ratio 5·46 [95% CI 5·13-5·81]), non-smokers (1·59 [1·54-1·65]), residents of urban areas (1·28 [1·21-1·35]), individuals with higher socioeconomic status (1·06 [1·03-1·10]), and individuals with a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; 1·71 [1·64-1·78]). Individuals with a history of harmful alcohol use (0·36 [0·32-0·39]), type 1 diabetes (0·46 [0·36-0·57]), chronic kidney disease (0·63 [0·57-0·70]), or mental disorders (0·66 [0·64-0·69]) were less likely to be vaccinated. The lowest risk of mortality was in people with chronic liver disease of infectious or autoimmune aetiology and in people with MASLD. Hepatitis A vaccine uptake among people with chronic liver disease in England is low, with disparities by age, location (urban vs rural), and socioeconomic status. Steps should be taken to reduce the inequalities in vaccine administration. GlaxoSmithKline's Investigator Sponsored Studies Program.",

While liver stiffness and fibrosis indices significantly improved post-SVR, hepatic steatosis (HS) paradoxically increased in prevalence, highlighting a shift from virus-driven injury to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). In this correspondence, we expand upon these findings by discussing the clinical and pathophysiological implications of post-SVR steatosis, underscoring the need for ongoing metabolic surveillance even in patients with virologic cure. We also emphasize the limitations of traditional risk stratification based on BMI alone and call for refined, longitudinal approaches to detect and manage metabolic liver disease in the post-SVR population.",

        "abstract": "Achieving the World Health Organization's 2030 hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination goals necessitates robust and outcome-focussed surveillance. In Australia, HCV is a nationally notifiable condition, with state and territory health authorities leading surveillance and public health response. This study aimed to examine Queensland's HCV surveillance system and to identify barriers to, and solutions for, implementing notification-driven linkage to care. This study was conducted in two parts. System mapping and gap identification were conducted through consultation with key stakeholders operationally involved in HCV surveillance. Secondly, a proof-of-concept descriptive analysis of two months of notification data (January to February 2023), coinciding with a period of enhanced surveillance work, was conducted to scope the magnitude of follow-up and to provide insights into groups needing targeted support. Cases were grouped into indeterminate, active and cleared categories. System mapping and gap analysis identified significant constraints, including the absence of automated data processes and key data elements. These factors impeded the implementation of surveillance case definitions and hindered the identification of priority groups for linkage to care. Of 2,257 cases, 1,218 (54.0%) were individuals who had cleared HCV infection. There were 305 cases with incomplete diagnostic testing; 92/305 (30.2%) were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. Incomplete diagnostic testing was significantly more likely to occur for cases tested in the community compared to those tested in a correctional setting (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Of 734 active cases, 83.1% were male, 53.3% were tested in corrections, and 36.0% were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. To strengthen Queensland's HCV surveillance and enable effective linkage to care, several recommendations are proposed. These include amending public health regulations to require negative HCV RNA testing notification; establishing systematic real-time or close to real-time linkage of related datasets, including treatment data; automating the reporting of Point of Care Testing results; implementing a HCV clearance cascade; and adopting a centralised state-wide public health model. Addressing these barriers will be essential to achieving optimal HCV surveillance and care in Queensland.",

We report summarized descriptive statistics of survey responses. Seventy-three PCPs completed the survey, 55% of whom prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Nineteen percent directly treat HCV. Forty-five percent were aware of collaborative practice agreements (CPAs) and 22% reported interest in establishing a CPA to treat HCV. Most respondents were comfortable or extremely comfortable with pharmacists managing key elements of HCV care. In a sample of WA State PCPs, of whom greater than half prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, fewer than 1 in 5 directly treat HCV. Comfort with pharmacists managing most components of HCV treatment was high, but a minority of PCPs were familiar with or interested in establishing CPAs.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the research trends, patterns of opportunistic infections in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their impact on patient management strategies, especially in the context of the widespread use of DMARDs. Research papers on RA and opportunistic infections were analysed by performing a literature search in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, covering the period from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2023. Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOS viewer and Cite Space software, including country and institution analyses, journal and co-citation journal analyses, author and co-citation author analyses, and key word co-occurrence and clustering analyses. Two hundred and ninety-three research papers were analysed, and it was found that research publications on RA-associated opportunistic infections have shown a general upward trend over the past three decades, with a significant increase especially between 2007 and 2021. Japan, the United States, and China have the highest research output in this area, with institutions such as Yang Ming University and Taichung Veterans General Hospital being more active. Key word analysis revealed 'infection', 'risk', 'treatment', and 'infliximab' as research hotspots. Cluster analysis showed that tuberculosis, latent tuberculosis infection and hepatitis B virus were the focus of attention. Research on opportunistic infections in RA has shown a clear trend of growth and extensive international collaboration, reflecting a deep understanding of the risk of opportunistic infections in RA patients treated with DMARDs. Future studies should strengthen the identification of high-risk patient groups, the use of biomarkers, the balance of safety and efficacy in treatment regimens, and patient education to promote the optimisation of RA management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Shorter treatment courses for early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could simplify treatment approaches, particularly in key populations. PURGE-C (A5380) was a single-arm, multicenter trial evaluating the treatment of early HCV (primary or reinfection) with 4 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). Early HCV was defined as new detectable HCV RNA or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation within 24 weeks of study entry. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after prescribed treatment completion (SVR12). Re-treatment outcomes were also collected. Forty-five participants (98% male, 51% White, 31% Hispanic, median age 36 years, 51% with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 27% self-reported injecting drugs) were enrolled from the United States and Brazil between November 2019 and January 2023. Median time from HCV diagnosis to entry was 31 days (Q1-Q3: 15-49). Median baseline HCV RNA was 5.3 log10 IU/mL (Q1-Q3: 3.3-6.0) and ALT 146 U/L (min-max: 22-3866). Overall, 38 of 45 (84%) participants (90% confidence interval [CI]: 74%-91%) achieved SVR12. All 4 participants who were retreated and had outcome data achieved SVR12. In this population with elevated risk of onward HCV transmission, 84% were cured with 4 weeks of G/P. Failing this short-course treatment did not compromise retreatment. This study suggests that people with early HCV infection can achieve moderately high cure rates with abbreviated courses of direct-acting antivirals (DAA). Simplified approaches to treatment are critical for HCV elimination and are particularly relevant for populations difficult to retain in care. NCT04042740.",

We aimed to determine the relationship of exposure to two faecal-orally transmitted pathogens, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV), with WASH levels and other factors. A cross-sectional study conducted in three districts in Khammouane Province enrolled 2300 participants aged 5 to 87 years by random sampling. Anti-HAV and anti-HEV antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between serology (outcome), WASH and other variables was determined by bivariate and multivariable analysis. Overall, 12.0% of participants had surface water as a water source, 22.0% practiced open defecation and 66.9% had basic hygiene facilities. Anti-HAV IgG seropositivity was 63.2% and 57.5% were anti-HEV seropositive. The mean age at which 50% of the population were positive for anti-HAV and anti-HEV was 24 and 27 years old, respectively. Anti-HAV seroprevalence was lower in those with improved sanitation than those practicing open defecation (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.4-0.8, p = 0.001) and higher in adults consuming undercooked meat (OR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.1-2.0, p = 0.01). It also varied by district, ethnicity, education and age. Anti-HEV seroprevalence was lower in those with improved water source than those using surface water (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.4-0.8, p = 0.002) and higher in adults consuming raw meat (OR = 1.3, 95%CI = 1.0-1.7, p = 0.04). Anti-HEV seroprevalence varied by district, sex, education, and age. Khammouane province has low levels of WASH leading to high transmission of HAV and HEV. Reducing the practice of open defecation and other risk practices such as undercooked meat consumption may reduce transmission as well as consideration of HAV vaccine introduction for younger ages.",

        "title": "Ascertaining the association between smoking behaviors and viral hepatitis risk: A Mendelian randomization approach.",
        "abstract": "Viral hepatitis, caused by various hepatitis viruses, is a global health threat leading to chronic liver disease, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Smoking, a known risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. However, understanding the relationship between smoking and viral hepatitis is complex due to the presence of confounding factors and the potential for reverse associations. We utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the potential association between smoking behavior and viral hepatitis. In this study, SNPs were utilized as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization framework to examine the relationship between smoking behavior and viral hepatitis risk. To ensure the accuracy of the experiment, our data were sourced from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and analyzed using a series of methods, such as inverse variance weighting (IVW) and leave-one-out analysis. The MR analysis revealed significant positive associations between SNPs related to smoking initiation, status, and cessation, and the risk of viral hepatitis. The IVW method demonstrated a consistent rightward shift of the effect estimates, indicating a potential increase in viral hepatitis risk associated with smoking exposure. Smoking initiation, status, and cessation were associated with increased odds of viral hepatitis by 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.45-3.24, p=0.00015), 2.93-fold (95% CI: 1.58-5.41, p=0.00061), and 5.30-fold (95% CI: 2.05-13.70, p=0.00057), respectively. The leave-one-out analysis further validated the robustness of our model, with minor SNP-specific deviations observed. Our study presents strong associations between smoking behavior and an elevated risk of viral hepatitis, highlighting the need for further investigation into this potential connection. These findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation in liver disease management and inform public health strategies aimed at reducing the burden of viral hepatitis.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze trends in the etiologies of liver transplants at Abu Ali Sina Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, from 2020 to 2024. Liver transplantation (LT) is a crucial treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Over time, the etiologies leading to LT have evolved due to changes in disease prevalence, advancements in medical treatments, and public health interventions. Etiologies of LT were categorized into nine groups: acute liver failure, autoimmune disorders, alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cancer, vascular, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), viral hepatitis, metabolic disorders, and others. Trend analysis was performed using Python 3.12 programming language with appropriate libraries. A total of 1579 patients, 59.9% male with a mean age of 45.12 years (SD: 13.52), were analyzed. Autoimmune disorders emerged as the leading cause of LT, increasing from 32.2% in 2020 to 40.6% in 2024 (p-trend = 0.039). Viral hepatitis cases decreased significantly from 18.1% to 3.0% (p-trend = 0.033). Liver cancer became the third leading cause in 2021, replacing viral hepatitis, while MASH consistently remained the second leading cause. The significant shifts in LT etiologies underscore the success of public health interventions in reducing the burden of viral-related ESLD. Additionally, the findings highlight the need for ongoing research into the prevention, early diagnosis, and management of autoimmune liver diseases, MASH, and liver cancer. These findings provide critical insights for clinicians and policymakers to enhance liver disease management and allocate resources effectively.",

Several risk factors are described, including immunosuppression, diabetes, tobacco use, and multiple sexual partners. About 90% of cases are associated with human papillomavirus infection. Given the rarity of this lesion, there are still no established guidelines for the assessment and treatment of this tumor. The most reported and consensus approach described in the literature is surgical intervention. We report a case of a 32-year-old man who was immunosuppressed following a lung transplant due to cystic fibrosis. He also had stage IV chronic kidney disease and chronic pancreatitis. The patient was evaluated in a proctology consultation due to complaints of itching, perianal pain, and constipation with a 4-month history. Clinical examination showed a cauliflower-like, papillomatous tumor measuring 9 cm along the perianal area with other surrounding smaller lesions. The evaluation of immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus and syphilis was negative. The patient denied engaging in receptive anal sex and other risky sexual behaviors. A macro biopsy of the lesion was performed, and the histopathological examination revealed an anal condyloma acuminatum, with no signs of malignancy. Therapy with imiquimod was initiated for several weeks, with no significant reduction in lesion size. In a multidisciplinary discussion, it was decided to start neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine and mitomycin. After 5 months of treatment, a significant reduction in lesion size was observed with significant clinical improvement. Currently, the patient has no proctological symptoms and no need for analgesia.",

This retrospective cohort study used data from an Australian sentinel surveillance system to assess the proportion of individuals who had a recorded test that indicated being susceptible to hepatitis B infection in six priority populations, as well as the proportion who were then subsequently vaccinated within six months of being identified as susceptible. Priority populations included in this analysis were people born overseas in a hepatitis B endemic country, people living with HIV, people with a recent hepatitis C infection, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, people who have ever injected drugs, and sex workers. Results of the study found that in the overall cohort of 43,335 individuals, 14,140 (33%) were identified as susceptible to hepatitis B, and 5,255 (37%) were subsequently vaccinated. Between 26% and 33% of individuals from priority populations were identified as susceptible to hepatitis B infection, and the proportion of these subsequently vaccinated within six months was between 28% and 42% across the groups. These findings suggest further efforts are needed to increase the identification and subsequent vaccination of susceptible individuals among priority populations recommended for hepatitis B vaccination, including among people who are already engaged in hepatitis B care.",

Clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia were present in both patients: from the 1st day of life (episode of apnoea) in patient № 2 and from 7 months (seizures) in patient № 1. Cholestatic jaundice, hepatomegaly, signs of hepatocyte cytolysis, impaired protein-synthetic liver function were the main manifestations of the disease in 1st patient. This may indicate non-infectious cholestatic hepatitis. Improvement and gradual normalization of clinical and laboratory symptoms during hydrocortisone therapy confirmed the association of liver damage with hypocortisolemia. 2nd patient had no signs of cholestasis.

        "abstract": "The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has marked a significant milestone in the therapeutic landscape of hepatitis C, greatly improving treatment efficacy. A therapeutic regimen encompassing sofosbuvir (SOF), velpatasvir (VEL), and voxilaprevir (VOX) has demonstrated strong efficacy across all genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has recently been incorporated into the Korean healthcare system. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of these antivirals in the South Korean population. This prospective, multicenter, observational study enrolled patients with chronic HCV treated with SOF/VEL-based regimens at six hospitals between November 2022 and January 2024. DAA-naïve patients received SOF/VEL ± ribavirin for 12 weeks. Patients who had failed prior DAA therapy received SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Among 101 patients treated with SOF/VEL, the mean age was 64.71 years, and 40.9% were male. Genotypes 1b and 2 were identified in 40.6% and 59.4% of patients, respectively. Two patients had a history of interferon-based treatment. The mean baseline HCV RNA level was 3,088,097 IU/mL. Cirrhosis was observed in 26.7% of patients (21.8% compensated; 5.0% decompensated). Of the 101 patients, 12 were lost to follow-up. Among the 89 patients who completed follow-up, SVR12 was achieved in 100.0% (89/89), including 5 patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In the SOF/VEL/VOX group, 17 patients were treated. The mean age was 61.84 years, 29.4% were male, and four had compensated cirrhosis. One patient was lost to follow-up. SVR12 was achieved in 100.0% (16/16) of the patients who completed follow-up. No serious adverse events (≥grade 3) were reported in either group during the DAA treatment period. In this first prospective real-world study in South Korea, SOF/VEL-based regimens demonstrated excellent efficacy and safety, achieving 100% SVR12 in the per-protocol population, including patients with cirrhosis and prior treatment failure.",

Using dual IFNγ and IL-4 ELISpot assays, we found robust, predominantly Th1-mediated cellular responses at 30 days after the third vaccine dose, comparable to responses during acute infection. Longitudinal antibody assessments confirmed sustained antibody production, primarily against the E2 domain of genotypes 1 and 3, persisting up to two years post-vaccination.

        "abstract": "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that earlier in February 2020 the WHO had named COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). There were neither drugs nor vaccines that were known to be effective against the virus, stimulating an urgent worldwide search for treatments. An evaluation of existing drugs by 'repurposing' was initiated followed by a transition to de novo drug discovery. Repurposing of an already approved drug may accelerate the introduction of that drug into clinical use by circumventing early, including preclinical studies otherwise essential for a de novo drug and reducing development costs. Early in the pandemic three drugs were identified as repurposing candidates for the treatment of COVID-19: (i) hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus; (ii) ivermectin, an antiparasitic approved for both human and veterinary use; (iii) remdesivir, an anti-viral originally developed to treat hepatitis C. The scientific evidence, both for and against the efficacy of these three drugs as treatments for COVID-19, vied with public demand and politicization as unqualified opinions clashed with evidence-based medicine. To quote Hippocrates, \"<i>There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance</i>\".",

        "abstract": "Polyphenols are structurally diverse plant metabolites that have attracted significant interest. Their compositions are versatile, depending on their structures, including the number of rings in the polyphenol composition. Based on these attributes, polyphenols can be classified as flavanols, anthocyanins, flavones, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans. Polyphenols mainly possess inhibition of viral replication, interference with viral protein synthesis, and modulation of immune responses, providing significant antiviral effects against several viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, and influenza. They are crucial for medical compounds in diverse, versatile treatments, namely in diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative problems. Plants are the primary source of bioactive molecules, which are valued for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities. Especially, polyphenols are extracted as the most abundant bioactive compounds of plants. Moreover, viral infections are one of the major factors in illnesses and diseases, along with bacteria and fungi. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies report antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, Mayaro virus, dengue virus, herpesvirus, and influenza A virus, though clinical validation remains limited. Additionally, inhibition of viral entry, interference with viral replication, modulation of host immune response, and direct virucidal effects were examined.",

This nationwide, cross-sectional study utilized claims data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (2014-2021) to investigate the prevalence, comorbidities, treatment patterns, and liver-related complications among patients with HBV monoinfection, HBV/HIV, HBV/HCV, or triple coinfection. Among over 4.5 million patients with chronic hepatitis B, the prevalence of HIV and HCV coinfection ranged from 0.05 to 0.07% and 0.77 to 1.00%, respectively. Patients with HBV/HCV coinfection were older and had significantly higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and major adverse liver outcomes, including hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation, compared to other groups. HBV/HIV coinfection was more common in younger males and was associated with higher dyslipidemia. The use of HBV antivirals increased over time across all groups. These findings highlight the distinct clinical characteristics and unmet needs of coinfected populations, underscoring the importance of tailored screening and management strategies in HBV-endemic settings.",

        "abstract": "Current structural barriers experienced by First Nations in Canada shape access and engagement for testing and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. This non-systematic informative review considers transdisciplinary perspectives, regional data, and published literature connecting context to the disproportionate HCV burden experienced by First Nations populations in the prairie provinces of Canada, and offers examples of participatory and community-led initiatives working toward the elimination of HCV as a public health threat. First Nations in Canada are disproportionately impacted by chronic HCV infection, with a reported rate of newly diagnosed HCV cases in First Nations communities five times the respective rate in the general Canadian population in 2022. This review explores the reasons underlying the disproportionate burden of HCV infection. Significant over-representation of First Nations in the Canadian Prairies is seen in the major risk categories for HCV acquisition, and the impact of these risk factors is aggravated by barriers to accessing healthcare services and medication coverage. These barriers stem from the legacy of colonialism, discrimination, disenfranchisement, and are exacerbated by stigmatization, victimization, and racism in the justice and healthcare systems. Other contributory factors that impede access to care include inadequate healthcare clinic staffing and infrastructure in First Nations communities, and significant geographical distances between First Nations reserves and laboratories, pharmacies, and treating/prescribing healthcare providers. Recent recognition of historical harms and early steps towards nation-to-nation reconciliation, along with support for culturally connected, holistic, and First Nations-led wellness programs, instill hope that elimination strategies to eradicate HCV infection in First Nations populations will be successful in Canada.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the development of numerous prognostic models for patient assessment. However, the potential utility of the predisposition, insult/infection, response, organ dysfunction (PIRO) score in evaluating COVID-19 severity and outcomes remains unexplored, presenting a gap in current research. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 374 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to the emergency department of Beijing Youan Hospital. Demographic data, treatment regimens, and seven prognostic scoring systems, including PIRO, were evaluated. To evaluate the models' prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) analysis was employed. Comparative performance between scoring systems was quantified using the DeLong method for paired ROC curves. Of the 374 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 120 (32.1%) died within 28 day of hospitalization. Significant disparities were observed between survivors and non-survivors regarding age, laboratory parameters, and clinical scores. Analysis of patient distribution and mortality rates across different score ranges revealed a positive correlation between score magnitude and 28-day mortality. The PIRO score demonstrated superior prognostic capability, yielding an AUC of 0.898 (95% CI 0.866-0.929). The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score followed closely (AUC 0.882, 95% CI 0.849-0.914). Both critical illness risk score (COVID-GRAM) and national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) exhibited AUCs exceeding 0.85 (COVID-GRAM 0.854, 95% CI 0.812-0.895; NEWS2: 0.851, 95% CI 0.813-0.889). DeLong test analysis revealed statistically significant differences in AUC between PIRO and confusion, urea, respiration, systolic pressure, age ≥ 65 (CURB-65), pneumonia severity index (PSI), COVID-GRAM, rapid acute physiology score (RAPS), and NEWS2 (all p < 0.05). Analysis revealed the PIRO scoring system as a robust predictor of 28-day mortality among COVID-19 cases presenting to the emergency setting, offering potential refinement of risk stratification and clinical management strategies.",

        "abstract": "HCC is the most common primary liver cancer, ranking as the sixth most prevalent cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Etiological factors include:chronic liver diseases driven by alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, obesity, and metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence also suggests that gut microbiome alterations and subsequent immune and metabolic dysregulation contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of HCC. The gut-liver axis represents a dynamic interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, modulated by the gut microbiome, microbial metabolites, and immune responses. This bidirectional communication plays a pivotal role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and immune surveillance, while its dysregulation is implicated in various pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gut microbiome, through microbial dysbiosis and metabolite secretion, significantly influences the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion mechanisms in HCC. Perturbations in gut barrier function and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation drive chronic inflammation, promoting tumor progression. Moreover, microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, modulate inflammatory and metabolic pathways, offering novel insights into disease pathogenesis and potential biomarkers. Therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, and immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate promise in reprogramming the gut microbiome and restoring immune balance in HCC management. This review explores the multifaceted roles of the gut-liver axis in pathogenesis, the contributions of the intra-tumoral microbiome, and the potential of microbial metabolites as therapeutic avenues. A deeper understanding of these interactions could pave the way for innovative, targeted interventions in liver cancer and other gut-liver axis-associated diseases.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis progression involves complex multicellular crosstalk, highlighting the critical need to identify key therapeutic targets. In this study, we identify insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) as a marker specifically enriched in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and upregulated in viral hepatitis-associated fibrosis. Using thioacetamide (TAA)-induced mouse models and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-stimulated cell models, we demonstrate the pro-fibrotic role of IGFBP6. Through network pharmacology screening, pantothenic acid (PA) is identified as a potent compound targeting IGFBP6. PA administration significantly reduces collagen deposition, attenuates HSCs' activation, and decreases hepatic fibrosis-related markers. Notably, PA maintains efficacy in mouse models with established fibrosis. Mechanistically, PA directly interacts with IGFBP6, inducing ubiquitin-dependent degradation and inhibiting TGF-β/SMADs signaling. This study identifies IGFBP6 as a driver of hepatic fibrosis and validates PA as a potent therapeutic agent. Therefore, targeting IGFBP6 with PA offers a potential clinical treatment strategy for hepatic fibrosis.",

Notably, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling, a crucial pathway in inducing type I interferons (IFN-I) and orchestrating innate immunity, has been increasingly recognized for its involvement in anti-HBV responses. Also, studies have stated that HBV-derived components can modulate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, subsequently regulating IFN-I production and shaping anti-HBV responses.

We enrolled 515 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with detectable anti-HDV antibodies from 32 Italian centres between August 2022 and July 2024; all patients underwent centralised virologic assessment. Overall, 432 out of 515 (83.9%) patients were HDV-RNA-positive (4.39, 1.30-5.82 Log IU/mL; 99.0% HDV genotype-1). HDV-RNA levels correlated with ALT (r<sub>s</sub> = 0575, 0.514-0.630) and hepatitis B core-related antigen (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.521, 0.455-0.581).

The exact prevalence remains unknown but is estimated at 1 in 500.000 for PFIC 3, caused by mutations in the ABCB4 gene. We report three cases of PFIC 3 from the patient's sister, brother, and cousin, diagnosed in our Pediatric Department in 2022-2023. <b>Case Presentation:</b> Case 1: A 10-year-old girl was admitted for jaundice and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with severely advanced hepatic cirrhosis and massive cholestasis. Genetic testing showed ABCB4 homozygous mutation. She rapidly developed fulminant liver failure, and a living donor liver transplant was performed. Case 2: A 6-year-old brother was previously diagnosed with cholestatic hepatitis of unknown cause back in 2018 and presented with similar features (generalized jaundice, severe pruritus with generalized scratching lesions); symptoms had progressively developed from the first year of life. He also exhibited particular facial features (big forehead, twisted ear lobe, straight nose). He received cadaveric liver transplantation. Case 3: Nephew of first two children, a 3-year-5-month-old boy, was admitted for failure to thrive and a one-year history of jaundice, pruritus, and splenomegaly. He was tested positive for homozygous ABCB4 mutation. He is currently under medical treatment with stable liver function. <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical significance of this particular homozygous variant identified in ABCB4 in our series of cases (c.2534G>T (p.Gly845Val)) was uncertain up to this case report. The present data provide convincing evidence as to the correlation between this mutation and the clinical phenotype of PFIC 3.",

        "abstract": "Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) hepatitis C treatment can reduce fibrosis and prevent cirrhosis and its sequelae. This study aims to evaluate changes in fibrosis and lab measurements from pre-treatment to post-treatment and over time following the end-of-treatment among Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) peoples treated with sofosbuvir-based DAAs between 2014 and 2023. Study participants were predominantly male (53.9%) with a mean age of 54.4 years at start of treatment. Among the 290 (61.3%) participants with at least one pre- and one post-treatment Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM), post-treatment LSM was significantly lower than pre-treatment LSM (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Median post-treatment LSM increased with increasing pre-treatment fibrosis stage (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Median values for ALT, AST, AFP, FIB-4 and APRI decreased significantly between pre- and post-treatment visits (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.002), while platelets remained stable (<i>p</i> = 0.827). The majority of AN/AI adults successfully treated with sofosbuvir-based DAAs experienced a reduction in LSM, with LSM subsequently remaining stable up to 4 years following end-of-treatment. Liver function and blood-based estimates of fibrosis also improved. The most important predictor of LSM improvement was pre-treatment fibrosis stage.",

        "abstract": "The management of retained orthopedic hardware during amputation procedures presents significant challenges. A case utilizing a modified Gritti-Stokes through-knee amputation to address a periprosthetic fracture with an exposed intramedullary nail (IMN) in a patient with multiple comorbidities is reported. A 47-year-old male with a history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with a left femoral periprosthetic supracondylar fracture. The patient had an existing IMN from a previous femoral shaft fracture 20 years prior, along with a left below-knee amputation. Due to the newly occurred periprosthetic fracture and the patient's immunocompromised status, further amputation was deemed necessary. However, removal of the well-integrated IMN posed significant risks. A modified Gritti-Stokes through-knee amputation was performed, adapting the procedure to use the patella as a biological cap to cover the exposed IMN tip. At 4-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated satisfactory wound healing and stable positioning of the patellar cap. The patient achieved ambulation with an above-knee prosthesis and crutch assistance, reporting high satisfaction and no pain or discomfort. This case highlights the versatility of the Gritti-Stokes procedure in addressing complex scenarios involving retained hardware. By utilizing the patella as a biological cover for the exposed IMN, the risks associated with hardware removal was avoided while achieving a stable, well-healed amputation stump. This modification of the Gritti-Stokes technique offers a viable solution for patients with retained IMNs requiring through-knee amputation, particularly in cases where hardware removal is contraindicated or highly risky.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and bacterial infections are major global health concerns. However, the impact of bacterial co-infection on HBV clearance remains unclear. To investigate how bacterial co-infection affects HBV clearance, we used a mouse model with chronic HBV replication and Klebsiella pneumoniae co-infection. We evaluated HBV virological markers, innate immune responses, inflammation, and intrahepatic HBV-specific T cell responses, with and without antibiotic treatment or MDSCs depletion. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial co-infection activates innate immunity and inflammation in the liver, leading to initial activation followed by exhaustion of HBV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which delays HBV clearance. Antibiotic treatment alleviated inflammation and restored HBV elimination, while MDSCs depletion exacerbated inflammation and induced premature exhaustion of HBV-specific T cells. These results suggest that bacterial co-infection disrupts HBV-specific T cell responses and impairs HBV clearance, with MDSCs playing an indispensable role in indirectly regulating T cell activation, primarily through modulating the innate immune response and inflammatory pathways.",

We developed a quality improvement project to address persistent challenges to HCV treatment at one primary care clinic. Challenges addressed included barriers to accessing specialist care to receive antiviral treatment and lack of patient resources, education, and awareness. Recognizing the potential for primary care providers to bridge treatment gaps, our initiative at an urban family medicine residency clinic in a large Midwest city targeted a patient population diagnosed with HCV but who remained untreated. Searching the medical record, we identified 40 eligible patients who had not received treatment despite a positive HCV diagnosis. Enrolled participants were asked to report their awareness, perceived barriers, and willingness to receive treatment in a primary care setting via a phone-assisted survey. A total of 16 patients completed the survey (response rate 40%). Eighty-two percent were aware of their diagnosis, and 68.8% had not completed treatment. Only seven (43.8%) understood what an HCV infection is, while eight (50.0%) were aware that untreated HCV can lead to liver damage and cancer. Six (37.5%) claimed not to understand what an HCV infection is, and five reported that a medical professional had never explained it to them. Most respondents (81.2%) expressed a desire to initiate a treatment regimen and preferred to receive treatment at their primary care clinic.

Chronic Hepatitis B infection can be identified by the simultaneous use of virological, serological and biochemical markers involved in monitoring the progression of the disease. In Africa, only 1% of people infected are screened, and few benefit from antiviral treatment. This study aimed to determine the relationship between serological, biochemical and virological markers involved in the follow-up of patients with chronic viral hepatitis B virus infection at the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun. we conducted a cross-sectional study of patients' electronic records registered in the Laboratory Information System of the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun from 2011 to 2021. HBs antigen-positive patients with viral load, HBe antigen and liver transaminases assays were included. Chronic HBV infection phases were classified in 5 phases according to EASL which are: Phase 1: HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, Phase 2: HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, Phase 3: HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection, Phase 4: HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, Phase 5: HBsAg-negative phase. we registered 1652 patients, 43.9% females and 56.1% males. The median age of women and men was 31 [>25;38] years and 33 [6;40] years respectively.

        "abstract": "Effective handling of healthcare waste is paramount for infection prevention, particularly in fragile environments such as Somalia. When infectious and sharps waste are not appropriately segregated and disposed of, Infectious diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis can spread due to improper waste segregation and disposal, which poses a serious threat to public health. This study aims to assess the infectious and sharps waste management practices and waste segregation in Somalia's healthcare facilities. A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022/2023 by UNICEF, WHO, and the Federal Ministry of Health in Somalia. Data were collected from 423 healthcare facilities out of 1,410 using the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) questionnaire. Simple random sampling ensured an objective and representative assessment. Based on our study, more than 60% of healthcare facilities lacked proper waste segregation systems, and many reported insufficient colour-coded or covered bins. For infectious garbage, incineration was the most common approach (33.57%), whereas for sharps waste, pit burning was the most common option (52.48%). Geographic location and the type of waste management strategies used were significantly correlated (p < 0.001), indicating regional inequalities. These results draw attention to the numerous discrepancies and structural shortcomings in current systems for managing medical waste. Addressing gaps in waste management through policy enforcement, funding, and healthcare worker training is paramount to reducing healthcare-associated infections and improving healthcare safety in Somalia.",

        "abstract": "Liver transplantation (LT) provides a potential cure for hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF). We aimed to develop and externally validate a prognostic model to predict 1-year post-LT mortality in patients with HBV-ACLF. This retrospective, nationwide, observational cohort study was conducted at ten high-volume LT centres in China. 4378 adult patients who underwent primary LT between January 2015 and December 2021 were screened, and those with HBV-ACLF according to the COSSH-ACLF criteria (separated into three ACLF grades based on the number of organ failures) were included. The HBV-ACLF LT (HALT) model was developed in the derivation cohort and validated in the external testing cohort. The derivation cohort were derived from two LT centres in one province (Zhejiang). The external testing cohort were derived from eight LT centres in two provinces. For model development, univariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with 1-year post-LT mortality. Variables with univariable <i>p</i> < 0.05 were entered into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analysis for further feature selection. 10-fold cross validation was used to choose the optimal lambda (penalty for the number of features) of the Lasso model. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to construct the HALT model based on the risk factors selected by Lasso analysis. Primary outcome was survival rate at 1-year after LT. Secondary outcomes were short-term (28- and 90-day) and long-term survival after LT (3- and 5-year). Model performance was compared with eight other models (COSSH-ACLF II, COSSH-ACLF, CLIF-C ACLF, AARC, MELD, MELD-Na, SALT-M and TAM scores), using receiver operating characteristic curve and C-index values. A nomogram was developed to analyse the probability of the primary outcome in different graft-recipient combinations based on recipient factors (age, number of organ failures [OF], lactate) and graft factors (donation after circulatory death [DCD] and cold ischaemia time [CIT]). Between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 1, 2021, 668 patients were included (derivation cohort, n = 418; external testing cohort, n = 250), with survival rates of 88.0%, 81.1%, 77.5%, 75.6% and 72.1% at 28-day, 90-day, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year post-LT, respectively. Three recipient's factors (age, number of OF and arterial lactate concentration) as well as two graft's parameters (DCD and CIT) were independently associated with 1-year post-LT mortality in the derivation cohort (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). The HALT model was established accordingly, showing better discriminative performance (C-index, 0.791) than eight current models in the external testing cohort (C-index, 0.529-0.627; all <i>p</i> < 0.001). If the sickest patients (age >55 years, OFs ≥3 and lactate ≥2.5 mmol/L) received high-risk grafts (DCD and CIT >10 h), the estimated 1-year post-LT mortality was 85.6%. The HALT model showed superior predictive ability over eight current models and may help for LT candidate selection and optimal organ allocation. Though the findings need to be verified in prospective studies and among different patient populations.

        "abstract": "Pseudoprogression is an atypical response pattern to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), characterized by initial tumor enlargement or the appearance of new lesions, followed by subsequent tumor regression. While this phenomenon has been observed in several solid tumors, its occurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare and not well understood, presenting diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the first female case of HCC pseudoprogression during atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B-related advanced HCC. After multiple prior treatments, she was started on combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Following four treatment cycles, imaging revealed tumor enlargement and new small lesions, suggestive of disease progression. However, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level had decreased from 45,598 ng/mL to 23,719 ng/mL, and there was no clinical deterioration. Based on these findings, treatment was continued. Imaging after eight and 12 cycles demonstrated marked tumor regression and the normalization of AFP (<2 ng/mL), confirming a diagnosis of pseudoprogression. Although uncommon, pseudoprogression should be considered during ICI therapy for HCC. The accurate interpretation of radiologic findings in conjunction with clinical status and tumor markers is essential to avoid the premature discontinuation of potentially effective treatments. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, predictive markers, and clinical significance of pseudoprogression in HCC.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a severe public health problem affecting nearly 3% of the world population. Of those affected, approximately 80% develop chronic infections. Initiating treatment through HCV RNA testing remains challenging, especially in resource-limited settings where access to molecular diagnostics is restricted. In this study, a novel and inexpensive HCV molecular diagnostic approach based on on-chip reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) integrated with image intensity measurement and machine learning-based prediction (RT-LAMP-IM-MLP) is developed. This method uses a low-cost microfluidic chip to carry out RT-LAMP (total cost of each test: <$4) and enables rapid, user-friendly, accurate, and quantitative detection of HCV RNA in blood plasma. Amplified products are visualized under fluorescence excitation and the captured image is processed using the OpenCV package in Python, followed by training and prediction through a modified random forest algorithm. When tested on plasma samples positive for HCV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), or from healthy individuals, the RT-LAMP-IM-MLP method demonstrates 97.1% sensitivity, 96.9% specificity, and 97% overall accuracy. Compared to the reference method, the real-time PCR-based COBAS® TaqMan® HCV assay (Roche Diagnostics, USA), our assay can detect HCV RNA concentrations as low as 10 IU mL<sup>-1</sup> (60 fg μL<sup>-1</sup>). Further, only 0.5 μL of dye is used for fluorescence labeling compared to larger quantities required in colorimetric assays. Therefore, the proposed sensitive and specific detection scheme may serve as an inexpensive and reliable point-of-care (POC) test for detecting HCV RNA in clinical samples.",

A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved.

        "abstract": "This study explores the potential targets and signaling pathways of the Li Qi Dao Tan Decoction (LQDTD) in the treatment of schizophrenia using network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. The traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform database was searched to obtain the active ingredients and targets of the LQDTD. Databases such as GeneCards, DrugBank, and OMIM were searched for schizophrenia-related disease targets. By drawing a Venn diagram, the intersection targets of LQDTD and schizophrenia were obtained. The STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction. The online tool of the DAVID database was used to analyze the gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of the intersection targets of LQDTD and schizophrenia. The Cytoscape software was employed to construct the network of traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, targets, and pathways. AutoDock, Chem3D, and PyMOL software facilitated molecular docking and the calculation of binding energy for the identified key active ingredients and targets, from which the 7 pairs with the lowest binding energy were selected. PyMOL was utilized for analysis and visualization. We identified 5 active ingredients of LQDTD: luteolin, nobiletin, baicalin, quercetin and licochalcone A. Key proteins, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, TP53, and EGFR, were identified through the protein-protein interaction map. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that the pathways involved primarily included lipid and atherosclerosis pathways, hepatitis B virus-related pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, Chemical carcinogenesis receptor activation, and prostate cancer signaling pathways. The treatment of schizophrenia may influence key proteins such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, TP53, and EGFR, intervening in lipid and atherosclerotic pathways, hepatitis B virus-related pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, chemical carcinogenesis receptor activation, and prostate cancer signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms of action require further experimental verification.",

Hematologic involvement is commonly observed in SS patients, with 1.5% of patients presenting with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Chronic antigenic stimulation of B lymphocytes in autoimmune diseases may eventually lead to clonal proliferation or MGUS. Nevertheless, studies reporting the concurrent manifestation of IgG4-related autoimmune hepatitis (IgG4-AIH), Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), SS, and MGUS are scarce. This article reports a rare case involving the overlap of multiple autoimmune diseases. A middle-aged female patient experienced fatigue, anorexia, xerostomia, jaundice, and pruritus, as well as elevated levels of liver enzymes, globulin, and monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein). Based on the findings of serum IgG4 levels, autoimmune serology, liver and labial gland biopsy, and bone marrow puncture, a diagnosis of IgG4-AIH, PBC, SS, and MGUS was made. The patient was initiated on oral prednisone 40 mg once daily and ursodeoxycholic acid capsules 250 mg 3 times daily. Upon stabilization of the condition, prednisone was progressively tapered to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily. Over the 6-month follow-up period, favorable improvements were noted in the patient's symptoms. The purpose of this report's research is to thoroughly describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and treatment difficulties associated with the rare co-existence of multiple autoimmune diseases and hematological diseases, and to summarize the management methods. The significance of this study lies in emphasizing the importance of screening for autoimmune diseases and hematological diseases in patients presenting similar symptoms in clinical practice, aiming to provide a reference for clinicians in identifying and managing such complex cases, thereby enhancing the understanding and treatment level of these diseases.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents significant health challenges, especially among patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This study uses machine learning models to predict NAFLD in patients with inactive CHB. It builds on previous research by employing classification algorithms to analyze demographic, clinical, and laboratory data to identify NAFLD predictors. <b>Methods</b>: A single-center cross-sectional study was conducted, including 450 inactive CHB patients from Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. Five ML models were developed: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). <b>Results</b>: The prevalence of NAFLD was 50.22%. Among the machine learning models, Random Forest achieved the highest performance with an ROC AUC of 0.983 (95% CI: 0.952-0.999), followed by XGBoost at 0.977 (95% CI: 0.938-0.999) and MLP at 0.963 (95% CI: 0.915-0.995). SVM also showed strong performance with an AUC of 0.949 (95% CI: 0.897-0.985), while Logistic Regression demonstrated comparatively lower discrimination with an AUC of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.799-0.952). Key predictive features identified included platelet count, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Logistic Regression highlighted platelet count as the most significant negative predictor, while LDL and ALT were positive contributors. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study shows the utility of ML in improving the identification and management of NAFLD in CHB patients, enabling targeted interventions. Future research should expand on these findings, integrating genetic and lifestyle factors to enhance predictive accuracy across diverse populations.",

        "abstract": "The influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of etiological factors remains to be explored. This study evaluated the distribution of <i>PNPLA3</i> rs738409, <i>TM6SF2</i> rs58542926, and <i>HSD17B13</i> rs6834314 and overall survival of HCC patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD-HCC) and viral-related HCC (VIRAL-HCC). This study included 564 patients with HCC: 254 with MASLD-HCC and 310 with VIRAL-HCC. The SNPs were determined by real-time PCR using TaqMan assays. The mean ages of patients with MASLD-HCC and VIRAL-HCC were 68.4 vs. 60.9 years (<i>p</i> < 0.001), with a significant difference between groups. The prevalence of <i>PNPLA3</i> GG genotype in MASLD-HCC was significantly higher in MASLD-HCC than in VIRAL-HCC (24.0% vs. 15.5%, OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.14-3.05, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Similarly, the prevalence of <i>TM6SF2</i> TT genotype in MASLD-HCC and VIRAL-HCC was 7.1% vs. 2.6% (OR = 3.39, 95% CI = 1.36-9.21, <i>p</i> = 0.003), while <i>HSD17B13</i> GG genotype in the corresponding groups was 7.1% vs. 12.6% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.27-1.01, <i>p</i> = 0.039). The overall median survival of MASLD-HCC was significantly shorter than that of the VIRAL-HCC group (42 vs. 66 months, <i>p</i> = 0.035). In Cox regression hazard analysis, <i>HSD17B13</i> GG genotype was significantly associated with a lower mortality rate in MASLD-HCC (HR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.18-0.81, <i>p</i> = 0.011). In contrast, <i>PNPLA3</i> and <i>TM6SF2</i> were not associated with overall survival in patients with MASLD-HCC or VIRAL-HCC. Our data demonstrated that the prevalence of the SNPs significantly differed between MASLD-HCC and VIRAL-HCC. The <i>HSD176B13</i> GG genotype was also associated with a survival benefit in Thai patients with MASLD-HCC. Thus, assessing the <i>HSD176B13</i> genotype might be beneficial in risk stratification and potential therapeutic inhibition of <i>HSD17B13</i> among patients with MASLD-HCC.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) specifically infects hepatocytes and has a complex life cycle owing to the stabilization and pooling of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. We previously reported that the suppression of dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11) decreases cccDNA and HBV-DNA levels and identified it as a new HBV therapeutic target. The DOCK11-associated gene, Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulator tankyrase (TNKS), was identified using in vitro methods; however, its function in the HBV life cycle remains unknown. Here, we used various inhibitors, antagonists, and short-hairpin RNA treatments related to TNKS signaling in HBV-infected hepatocytes. The role of TNKS-related Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the HBV life cycle was evaluated using immunoprecipitation assays with DOCK11 and bulk RNA sequencing methods. TNKS and Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors significantly repressed cccDNA and HBV-DNA levels. Conversely, certain Wnt/β-catenin signaling agonists enhanced the HBV life cycle. DOCK11 directly binds to β-catenin to regulate HBV using its nuclear transport system. SKL2001, normally used as a Wnt/β-catenin signaling agonist, strongly reduced cccDNA in HBV-infected hepatocytes and in combination with entecavir predominantly eradicated HBV without cytotoxicity. Therefore, DOCK11 and other Wnt/β-catenin signaling molecules may be therapeutic targets to prevent persistent HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "Psoriasis, a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder, presents complex pathogenetic mechanisms potentially influenced by viral infections. This comprehensive study explored the possible interplay of resistance and viral infections among psoriasis patients using serological screening techniques. The investigation involved 90 patients aged 23-45 years, systematically examining viral seropositivity for HSV (herpes simplex virus), HZ (herpes zoster), HBV (hepatitis B virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and HCV (hepatitis C virus) through ELISA testing. The findings revealed notable active or recent viral infection rates: 8.9% HSV positivity, 2.2% HZ antibody detection, 4.4% HCV positivity, and 4.4% HIV positivity. The research can contribute to current knowledge gaps, broaden the knowledge regarding the relationship between psoriasis and viral infection, and assess resistance, as it can mediate the interaction. The results can lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and patient care options. This study emphasizes the importance of thorough viral testing for psoriasis patients, as well as focused therapeutic regimens that take into account viral co-infections. It elucidates the complex networks of biological relationships between immune factors, contributes information that is critical to our understanding of the multifactorial etiology of psoriasis, and concludes with a strong argument for investigating the mechanisms of viral involvement in this chronic-relapsing inflammatory disease.",

        "abstract": "Rat hepatitis E virus (rat HEV) is an emerging zoonotic virus detected in rodents worldwide, with increasing evidence of presence in environmental sources such as surface water, wastewater and bivalves. This systematic review compiles and analyzes all the published research on rat HEV contamination in these matrices, as well as its implications for human health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Mendeley, including studies published up until 27 May 2025. Studies were included if they evaluated rat HEV in water- or food-related matrices using molecular detection. The risk of bias was not assessed. The certainty of evidence was not formally evaluated. Limitations include reliance on PCR methods without infectivity confirmation. Following PRISMA inclusion and exclusion criteria, eight eligible studies were analyzed. The results show high detection rates of rat HEV RNA in influent wastewater samples from several high-income European countries, namely Sweden, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Lower detection rates were found in effluent wastewater and surface waters in Sweden. In bivalve mollusks sampled in Brazil, rat HEV RNA was detected in 2.2% of samples. These findings show the widespread environmental presence of rat HEV, particularly in urban wastewater systems. While human infections by rat HEV have been documented, the true extent of rat HEV zoonotic potential remains unclear. Given the risks associated with this environmental rat HEV contamination, enhanced surveillance, standardized detection methods, and targeted monitoring programs in food production and water management systems are essential to mitigate potential public health threats. Establishing such programs will be crucial for understanding the impact of rat HEV on human health.",

A scoping review was performed by searching across three databases to identify systematic reviews that discussed hepatitis C in PWID within the context of harm reduction. The studies were then analyzed for success metrics used to describe hepatitis C in PWID. The indicators used were prevalence, incidence, screening, treatment uptake, treatment completion, and sustained virologic response. A total of fourteen systematic reviews were included. The most frequently reported indicators were prevalence and incidence, addressed in eight/seven systematic reviews, respectively. In contrast, screening, treatment uptake, and treatment completion were less commonly reported, with only two reviews addressing screening and treatment uptake, and a single review reporting treatment completion. Similarly, sustained virologic response (SVR) was reported in only two systematic reviews. Seven additional indicators were reported. Prevalence and incidence are the dominantly used HCV indicators, while others are often neglected. Inconsistencies in measurements and reporting can be found for all indicators. This study reports a gap regarding indicators beyond prevalence and incidence, inconsistent measurement approaches, and a lack of standardized frameworks.",

AAT has been reported to protect against renal injury via anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its role in mitigating renal inflammation and reducing high blood pressure induced by salt-loading has never been studied. In this study, we salt-loaded 129Sv mice to induce hypertension and then administered purified human AAT (hAAT) or the vehicle to investigate whether renal inflammation and associated inflammatory/signaling pathways are mitigated. Western blotting and densitometric analysis showed administration of hAAT attenuated protein expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1), CD93, CD36, and the toll-like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR-2/4) in kidney lysates. Similarly, protein expression of two key inflammatory transcription factors, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-Kappa B were shown to be attenuated in the kidneys of 129Sv mice that received hAAT. Conversely, hAAT treatment upregulated the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and immunohistochemistry confirmed these findings.

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Aims:</b> Ornidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic, is widely used for protozoal and anaerobic infections and is generally considered safe. However, ornidazole-induced liver injury (OILI) is an underrecognized yet potentially severe adverse reaction. This multicenter study aims to characterize the clinical features, histopathology, and outcomes of OILI to improve the awareness and management of this rare entity worldwide. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective analysis of 101 patients with OILI from eight tertiary centers between 2006 and 2023. Cases were included based on liver enzyme elevations temporally linked to ornidazole and the exclusion of other causes. Causality was assessed using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score. Clinical data, laboratory parameters, autoantibody profiles, histology, treatments, and outcomes were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> OILI was classified as highly probable in 42.6% of cases (n = 43), probable in 51.5% of cases (n = 52), and possible in 5.9% (n = 6) of cases. The predominant pattern was acute hepatocellular injury (83.2%) (n = 84). Autoimmune-like hepatitis occurred in 5% of cases (n = 5), with ANA positivity in 16.8% of cases (n = 17). Corticosteroids were used in 24.8% of cases (n = 25) and were associated with higher ANA positivity and a 20% (n = 5) relapse rate post-discontinuation. Recovery was achieved in 87.7% of cases (n = 88), while 7.9% of cases (n = 8) required liver transplantation and 4% (n = 4) died. <b>Conclusions:</b> Ornidazole can cause serious idiosyncratic liver injury, including autoimmune phenotypes, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis. Given the notable risk of liver failure and death, early recognition, drug discontinuation, and close monitoring are essential. In select cases, corticosteroids and plasmapheresis may be beneficial, though the evidence remains limited.",

This study compared the analytical performance of two HDV RNA quantification assays, Bosphore (Anatolia) and AltoStar<sup>®</sup> (Altona), focusing on their sensitivity, specificity, and potential implications for clinical management. Sixty-one clinical samples from twenty-four patients, including fifteen HDV-infected patients receiving BLV treatment and nine controls, were tested using each assay. Of 30 samples identified as HDV-negative by the Bosphore assay, 17 (56.7%) were HDV-positive with AltoStar<sup>®</sup>, demonstrating the superior sensitivity (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) of the latter assay. Quantitative analyses revealed consistently higher viral load measurements with AltoStar<sup>®</sup> compared to Bosphore, with a difference of 1.23 Log IU/mL and a moderate correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.7385) between assays. Each assay demonstrated a high specificity, with no false positives detected among control samples. However, our findings suggest that differences in assay sensitivity could impact the evaluation of virological response, highlighting the risk of false-negative results in chronically HDV-infected patients with low-level viremia.

By applying propensity score matching (PSM) to real-world data, we aimed to identify traits associated with functional cure. <b>Methods:</b> We included CHB cases which achieved a functional cure and randomly selected non-achievers from patients followed from 2000 to 2020. Initial screening of baseline candidate traits was conducted using PSM-balanced cases and controls. Subsequently, through multiple rounds of leave-one-covariate-out on the balanced cohorts, we validated the impact of these traits using survival analysis. <b>Results:</b> In total, 85 cases (mean age: 35.78; female/male: 23/62) were compared with 247 controls (mean age: 37.08; female/male: 80/167, out of 3666), with a median follow-up of 69.56 months. Steatosis and interferon (IFN) treatment were significantly more frequent in the cases, as confirmed by forest plots showing significant hazard ratios. During validation, whether through balancing all covariates or leave-one-covariate-out matching, both steatosis and exposure to IFN resulted in a higher number of functional cures and HBsAg seroconversions. Further comparisons revealed that add-on or monotherapy outperformed switching (from IFN to NUC), while the de novo (IFN + NUC, followed by NUC) approach was not observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> We confirmed that individuals with steatosis at baseline or those who received IFN were more likely to achieve HBsAg immune control, with monotherapy/add-on therapy being emphasized.",

        "abstract": "As the global population ages, research on the biology of ageing and its role in chronic disease is expanding, alongside a growing clinical focus on the unique needs of older adults. In the past, the liver was not thought to undergo substantial age-related changes, nor was there thought to be any liver disease characteristic of older adults. Current studies challenge this perspective, revealing that ageing substantially influences liver pathophysiology at the organ level and within each of the liver cell types. These observations have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of liver diseases common in older adults, including hepatocellular carcinoma, hypoxic hepatitis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Previously, managing older patients with liver disease mostly addressed age-related changes in drug metabolism and liver function tests. However, current clinical practice increasingly emphasizes age-specific issues such as frailty, sarcopenia, multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Given the liver's pivotal role in systemic metabolism, immunity and detoxification, ageing of the liver can contribute to systemic diseases. In the future, interventions that target ageing biology might offer new treatment options for liver diseases. Here, we review those age-related changes in the liver that have substantial biological and clinical consequences for older adults.",

Cytolysin-producing (C+) E. faecalis resides in the gut microbiome in a commensal role, but results in negative clinical outcomes in alcoholic hepatitis patients. To potentially combat cytolysin virulence, we report inhibitors of its maturation. An extracellular serine protease CylA that is essential for toxin activation is chosen as target. A series of α-aminopeptide boronic acids are designed and synthesized that block cytolysin maturation at low micromolar to nanomolar concentrations in vitro. A crystal structure of CylA provides insights into substrate recognition, autocatalytic activation of the enzyme, and toxin maturation. The inhibitors block hemolytic activity, reduce the amount of cytolysin, and attenuate expression of the cytolysin biosynthetic gene cluster without impeding cell growth. These studies provide a potential route to the development of treatments for cytolysin-induced disease states.",

This evidence-based consensus statement summary provides recommendations for the assessment and monitoring of adults with MAFLD in primary care. Adults with type 2 diabetes, obesity or two or more other metabolic risk factors should be tested for MAFLD. Hepatic steatosis should be evaluated using ultrasound, whereas the presence and complications of type 2 diabetes and obesity should be assessed according to current Australian guidelines. Cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnoea are common in people with MAFLD and should be considered as part of a holistic health assessment. Alternative causes of hepatic steatosis, including excess alcohol consumption, must be considered, and patients with elevated serum aminotransferase levels should be tested for hepatitis B and C infection and iron overload. The risk of advanced liver fibrosis requires assessment using the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index; a low score (< 1.3) is associated with a more than 95% negative predictive value for advanced liver fibrosis. People with an indeterminate FIB-4 score (between 1.3 and 2.7) should undergo second-line assessment with liver elastography or a direct liver fibrosis serum test or, if these tests are unavailable, should be referred to an expert clinician in liver disease. People with MAFLD and a high FIB-4 score (> 2.7), an elevated direct liver fibrosis serum test, high elastography results or with clinical, laboratory or imaging evidence of cirrhosis should be referred for further evaluation. Individuals with a low FIB-4 score (< 1.3), low elastography or direct liver fibrosis serum test results should be monitored with a repeat FIB-4 test at least every three years. Monitoring of weight, body mass index and/or waist circumference and for emergence of type 2 diabetes (in individuals without) should be performed at least annually.

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major global health burden, ranking as one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This review synthesizes current evidence on HCC epidemiology, highlighting both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors-including chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), excessive alcohol consumption, aflatoxin exposure, and genetic susceptibility. These diverse etiologies reflect not only biological mechanisms but also broader social and environmental determinants of health, emphasizing the need for integrated, population-level preventive strategies. Effective strategies across all levels of prevention are reviewed. Primordial and primary prevention strategies include public health policies, health education to raise awareness, universal hepatitis B vaccination, expanded access to antiviral therapies for HBV and HCV, lifestyle interventions targeting obesity and alcohol use, and environmental controls to reduce aflatoxin exposure. Secondary prevention focuses on early detection through viral hepatitis screening and routine HCC surveillance in high-risk populations. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce morbidity and mortality through timely treatment and multidisciplinary care. Despite the availability of effective tools, substantial implementation gaps remain persist. Underdiagnosis of viral hepatitis, low treatment uptake, inadequate surveillance coverage, and disparities in healthcare access continue to limit progress. Addressing these challenges requires a coordinated public health response grounded in health system strengthening, policy innovation, and equitable access to care. A renewed public health commitment-integrating prevention, early diagnosis, and continuity of care-is essential to reduce the global burden of HCC and bridge the gap between knowledge and action.",

In the present study, we conducted a living pharmacovigilance study, integrating data from clinical trials and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, to assess the safety profile of nivolumab-relatlimab. Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) in trials of nivolumab-relatlimab available in electronic databases were systematically searched. The outcomes included were all-grade (grades 1-5) and high-grade (grades 3-5) TRAEs, considering both overall and individual aspects. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the incidence and risk ratio of TRAEs associated with nivolumab-relatlimab. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Adverse events reports were extracted from the FAERS database, and a disproportionality analysis was carried out to estimate the safety signals of AEs associated with nivolumab-relatlimab. A total of 12 trials were included, the incidence of all-grade and high-grade TRAEs for nivolumab-relatlimab was 74.11 % and 38.05 %, respectively. Compared with nivolumab monotherapy, therapy with nivolumab-relatlimab was associated with a significantly increased risk of high-grade TRAEs, and some individual specified all-grade TRAEs, including hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, rash, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, arthralgia and myalgia. Disproportionality analyses of FAERS pharmacovigilance data identified 39 positive signals, with 18 AEs not mentioned in the drug label. Nivolumab-relatlimab showed significantly higher reporting frequencies for 15 AEs than nivolumab monotherapy. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential safety profile of nivolumab-relatlimab, the results of this living study will be updated to incorporate new, robust evidence as it becomes available.",

We included consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) in the study, in whom we performed anti-HDV assays verified by molecular testing. The analysed population consisted of 398 patients, predominantly male with a median age of 50 years, 58.3 ​% of whom had comorbidities. Forty-three patients (10.8 ​%) were diagnosed with cirrhosis.

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by profound immunosuppression resulting from both disease-related mechanisms and treatment-induced immune dysfunction. This compromised immune status markedly increases susceptibility to infections, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in MM patients. While vaccination represents a cornerstone of infection prevention, standard immunization strategies often yield suboptimal responses in this population. This review synthesizes current evidence on the immunological barriers and clinical effectiveness of vaccination in MM. We evaluate vaccines targeting influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, SARS-CoV-2, and other relevant pathogens, and explore determinants influencing vaccine efficacy, including optimal timing, formulation, and patient-specific immune parameters. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, encompassing clinical trials, retrospective cohort studies, expert consensus guidelines, and population-based data. Extracted outcomes included serological responses, infection-related events, and vaccine safety in MM patients. Patients with MM exhibit impaired vaccine responses due to hypogammaglobulinemia, T- and B-cell dysfunction, and therapy-induced lymphodepletion. Despite modest immunogenicity, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines reduce respiratory infections and hospitalizations. Sequential administration of PCV13 followed by PPSV23, as well as post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) three-dose regimens, is associated with reduced pneumonia incidence. COVID-19 vaccines elicit variable responses, particularly in patients on anti-CD38 or BCMA-targeted therapies, highlighting the need for booster doses and, in selected cases, prophylactic monoclonal antibodies. Vaccines against herpes zoster, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B are also recommended, particularly around ASCT. Immunophenotypic markers such as CD19+ B-cell and CD4+ T-cell counts are predictive of vaccine responsiveness, supporting immune profiling as a tool for individualized vaccination planning. Vaccination remains a critical component of infection prevention in MM. Although immunogenicity may be attenuated, clinical benefits-namely, reduced infection burden and healthcare utilization-support broad vaccine implementation. A personalized approach, considering the treatment phase, disease control, and immune status, is essential to optimize vaccine effectiveness. Ongoing research into high-dose, adjuvanted, and next-generation vaccines is critical to enhance protection in this vulnerable population.",

This study examined when SATs were accepted for added benefit by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) and/or the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) in Germany. We identified health technology assessments via the AMNOG-Monitor database through December 2024, with additional details from G-BA documents. We compared the SATs and other evidence for added benefit decisions (granted/not granted), stratified by orphan drug status, special marketing authorization, approved indication (chronic hepatitis C/others), and population (adults/children). Added benefit claims by manufacturers, IQWiG recommendations, and G-BA appraisals were compared. Among 1738 G-BA decisions, 85.8% (1491/1738) of the subpopulations were fully assessed by IQWiG, with 13.5% (202/1491) based on SATs. Among the 247 orphan drugs assessed by the G-BA, 37.7% (93/247) were SAT-based. Overall, SAT-based assessments demonstrated an added benefit in 12.2% (36/295) of cases.

Statistical tests revealed significant differences between manufacturers' claims, IQWiG recommendations, and G-BA appraisals. SATs were most frequently accepted for chronic hepatitis C treatments (mostly with non-standard marketing authorization) and paediatric indications. The G-BA cited reasons such as dramatic effects, rare diseases, a lack of alternatives, or fewer side effects, although justifications were often unclear. Acceptance rates for SATs remain low, and criteria for added benefit are not always explicitly defined. To enable benefit assessments when randomised controlled trials are infeasible or unethical, clear and binding criteria developed in collaboration with the G-BA are essential.",

Intracranial subdural hematoma (SDH) is a potentially fatal complication of neuraxial anesthesia and is extremely uncommon. This report describes a case of SDH following uncomplicated spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery and highlights the importance of timely intervention and patient follow-up. A 35-year-old patient with a history of hepatitis B underwent elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia provided with a pencil-point 25G needle at the presumed L3-L4 interspace. She experienced a mild non-positional headache the next day managed with oral pain medications. After discharge, she presented twice for worsening headache symptoms. By the 12<sup>th</sup> postpartum day, symptoms were suggestive of post-dural puncture headache, prompting imaging that revealed a left-sided subdural hematoma with mass effect. After multidisciplinary consultation with neurosurgery, an epidural blood patch (18 mL) was performed. Despite worsening radiological findings, the patient experienced symptomatic relief. The patient was discharged with follow-up arranged at the institution's headache clinic. While post-dural puncture headache after unintended dural puncture may be common, serious complications such as SDH are rare and require prompt diagnosis and intervention. This case illustrates a rare but serious complication of an uncomplicated spinal anesthesia, highlighting the need for thorough follow-up and prompt interventions. This report underscores the importance of revising discharge instructions after neuraxial anesthesia to include education on symptoms of post-dural puncture headache and the necessity of timely re-evaluation if symptoms worsen.",

This population-based retrospective cohort study included adult patients with cirrhosis who were identified from a US private health insurance claims database (Merative MarketScan Research Databases) from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2022. Males compared with females. The main outcome was the incidence of adverse liver events (decompensated cirrhosis [DC], hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], and liver transplant [LT]). Propensity score matching on age, liver disease etiologies, geographic region, insurance type, specialty type, alcohol use disorder, obesity, baseline status of decompensation, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score was used to balance baseline characteristics of the male and female groups. The study included 438 706 patients with cirrhosis (mean [SD] age, 56.8 [15.4] years; 50.8% males), with a higher mean (SD) age in males than in females (57.6 [14.3] vs 55.9 [16.4] years). Propensity score matching yielded 169 711 pairs of female and male patients with similar baseline characteristics for subsequent analyses. Males compared with females had a higher incidence (per 1000 person-years) of DC (65.77 [95% CI, 64.74-66.81] vs 55.35 [95% CI, 54.46-56.25]; P < .001), HCC (6.98 [95% CI, 6.71-7.27] vs 3.35 [95% CI, 3.17-3.54]; P < .001), and LT (10.23 [95% CI, 9.89-10.58] vs 6.27 [95% CI, 6.01-6.52]; P < .001). In the Cox proportional hazards regression model, male sex was associated with 16% higher risk of DC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16 [95% CI, 1.14-1.19]; P < .001), 63% of LT (HR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.54-1.71]; P < .001), and 110% of HCC (HR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.96-2.25]; P < .001).

Subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed a higher reinfection rate in MSM from studies published on or before 2020 and among individuals with chronic HCV infection. Additionally, time to reinfection was shorter in MSM, with a pooled mean difference of -0.57 years. These findings highlight a consistently higher reinfection risk in HIV-positive MSM.

        "abstract": "We aimed to develop an effective model to identify the risk of concurrent bacterial infections in older patients with acute-on-chronic liver disease (AoCLD). Data from 809 individuals aged 60-80 sourced from the CATCH-LIFE cohort were analyzed. Participants were randomly assigned to training and internal validation groups at a ratio of 7:3. An independent cohort of 336 older inpatients with AoCLD from Xiangya Hospital, Central South University was used to conduct an external validation of the model. Independent risk factors were identified using LASSO and logistic regression analysis in the training cohort and were subsequently used to develop a user-friendly model. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis in the internal and external validation cohorts. Two different cutoff values were determined to stratify infection risk in older patients with AoCLD. The infection rate among older patients with AoCLD was 30.28%. Pulmonary infections were predominant, accounting for 93% of all infections. Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated pathogens, representing 64% of cases in this population. The novel model developed to identify bacterial infections included three variables: cirrhosis, absolute neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The AUC for the training, internal, and external validation datasets demonstrated high accuracy in identifying bacterial infections (AUC of the training dataset = 0.805, AUC of the internal validation dataset = 0.848, and AUC of the external validation dataset = 0.838). The model significantly outperformed neutrophil count, CRP level, and procalcitonin level alone in detecting bacterial infections among older patients with AoCLD. To facilitate clinical decision-making, we defined two cutoff values of prediction probability: a low cutoff of 32.2% to rule out bacterial infections and a high cutoff of 47.9% to confidently confirm bacterial infections. Our model aids in the early and precise diagnosis of bacterial infections in older patients with AoCLD, thereby facilitating prompt interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.",

To explore changes in mortality trends among patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease based on etiology in the Veneto Region (Italy), to differentiate mortality between liver-related and non-liver-related causes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine trends in the development of cirrhosis complications. Three subsequent population-based cohorts of individuals with chronic liver disease/cirrhosis were identified in Veneto (North-eastern Italy, 4.9 million residents): the first enrolled before introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAA); the second corresponding to full availability of DAA treatment; and the last enrolled at the beginning of the pandemic. Risks of liver decompensation and death-liver and non-liver related-were recorded for each cohort during a 3-year follow-up. Changes in the risk of death across cohorts were measured by risk ratios (RR) obtained through Poisson regression models with robust error variance. Across the cohorts spanning over 10 years, we found that the number of individuals with CLD and cirrhosis remained stable at about 40,000 and 10,000, respectively. The 3-year risk of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma decreased across the study period, largely due to individuals with HCV-related liver disease. The overall 3-year mortality risk declined by 14% (liver cirrhosis, subjects enrolled in 2020 vs. 2013: RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.89), especially among those with viral etiology.

Despite increased awareness and proactive enrollment into patient care, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis remain significant health-challenges. The reduction in HCV-related mortality underscores the impact of antiviral treatments, while the persistently high mortality risk of alcohol-related disease highlights the need for targeted interventions.",

The research was designed as a cross-sectional observational study. This study was conducted at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases, University Clinical Center Kragujevac, as a COVID-19 treatment center. The study group consisted of a total of 101 adult hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, excluding patients under 18 years of age, patients with malignant diseases, tuberculosis, hepatitis, immune disorders, pregnant women, or HIV-positive patients. SARS-CoV2 infection was diagnosed by rapid antigen tests or real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from a nasal swab. The patients were classified into two groups based on oxygen therapy needs, disease severity, and disease outcomes. Low CD4+ and CD8+ T cell values were associated with severe clinical presentation, more need for oxygen therapy as well as poor disease outcome. Receiver operating characteristic analysis provided cutoff values to support predicting the aforementioned variables, establishing CD4+ and CD8+ values as significant prognostic biomarkers.

        "abstract": "Decompensated liver disease is a debilitating condition often accompanied by significant micro- and macronutrient deficiencies, which can worsen prognosis and complicate treatment, particularly in potential liver transplant candidates. We aimed to identify nutritional deficiencies in patients with decompensated chronic liver disease (CLD), who are potential recipients for liver transplantation. This cross-sectional, single-center prospective study included consecutive patients. Blood tests were performed to measure levels of key micronutrients, including vitamin D3, zinc, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12. Nutrient deficiencies were compared in patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥15 or less, and Child-Pugh class of B and C. The cohort comprised a total of 116 patients, 79 (68.1%) males and 37 (31.9%) females. Sixty-nine patients (59.5%) were classified as Child-Pugh class B and 47 patients (40.5%) as Child-Pugh class C, and 71 (61.2%) patients had an MELD score of ≥15. The primary etiologies of CLD were hepatitis C [49 (42.2%)], non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [30 (25.9%)], alcoholic liver disease [20 (17.2%)], hepatitis B [11 (9.5%)], and autoimmune liver disease [6 (5.2%)]. The study identified higher frequencies of deficiencies in zinc (89.7%), vitamin D3 (deficient 62.1%, insufficient 23.3%), calcium (18.1%), folate (15.5%), magnesium (14.7%), iron (13.8%), phosphorus (10.3%), and vitamin B12 (5.2%) across the entire cohort. Vitamin D and magnesium deficiencies became more frequent in Child-Pugh class C compared to B (<i>p</i> = 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.006) and MELD score ≥15 (<i>p</i> = 0.001 and <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). The high prevalence of deficiencies of crucial micronutrients, such as vitamin D3, zinc, magnesium, and iron highlighted the necessity of comprehensive assessments of nutrition and targeted intervention in patients with decompensated CLD. Effective management of micronutrient levels could potentially reduce complications, improve patient health, and enhance outcomes in these potential liver transplant candidates.

        "abstract": "Suriname has a hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence of 1%. In 2019, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) were introduced. Treatment was started in HCV patients who could afford the procurement of DAAs, since no insurance policy covered treatment at that time. This study aims to identify barriers in our HCV treatment cascade and evaluate the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) as a non-invasive test for detecting fibrosis and cirrhosis. We developed an HCV cascade of care for patients in the four general hospitals in the capital, spanning from linkage to care through to resolution of the infection. Furthermore, liver elastography is a crucial diagnostic tool for staging liver disease. Unfortunately, this is not widely available and can delay treatment initiation. Therefore, we evaluated the APRI as an alternative tool for staging liver disease. Of the 274 HCV patients, 216 (78.8%) could be linked to care, 174 (63.9%) were eligible for treatment, 156 (57.3%) started treatment, of which 149 (54.7%) completed it. Ultimately, 123 (45.3%) individuals attended their outcome evaluation, all of whom had achieved a sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment completion. For detecting cirrhosis, an APRI value > 1.0 had a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 85.7%, respectively. For detecting fibrosis or cirrhosis, an APRI value > 0.7 had a sensitivity and specificity of 69.2% and 61.4%, respectively. Although treatment with DAAs in Suriname is highly efficacious, several hurdles, including improving linkage and access to treatment, must be addressed to reduce the disease burden of HCV in Suriname successfully.",

This study compares long-term outcomes of these treatments. This retrospective study included patients with recurrent HCC smaller than 3 cm treated with re-resection or RFA from 2001 to 2019 in a tertiary center. Propensity score matching (PSM) minimized baseline differences. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Subgroup analyses explored outcomes based on recurrence interval, hepatitis infection status, and RFA guidance method (ultrasound [US] versus computed tomography [CT]). Multivariate Cox regression identified predictors of survival and secondary recurrence. After PSM, 106 patients in the re-resection group and 106 in the RFA group were compared. OS rates at 3, 5, and 8 years for re-resection were 97.9%, 85.4%, and 75.8%, compared to 87.8%, 77.9%, and 62.8% for RFA (p = 0.15). DFS rates were 53.3%, 41.8%, and 26.7% for re-resection versus 43.9%, 28.1%, and 24.0% for RFA (p = 0.15). Subgroup analysis indicated re-resection was superior in early recurrence (<24 months) and HBV-related HCC. US-guided and CT-guided RFA showed no significant differences in OS or DFS. HCV infection and multiple tumors were independent predictors of secondary recurrence. Repeat hepatic resection and RFA offer comparable survival for small recurrent HCC. Re-resection is preferred for early recurrence and HBV-related HCC. US- and CT-guided RFA are equally effective alternatives.",

Globally, and in Aotearoa New Zealand (AoNZ), chronic infection with hepatitis B (Hep-B) or hepatitis C (Hep-C) remain the most significant aetiological factors and the most amenable to intervention. Whilst Hep-B vaccination was nationally implemented in AoNZ in 1988 in children up to the age of 15 years, an estimated 3.2 million New Zealanders remain unvaccinated, each with up to a 15% likelihood of developing HCC by the age of 70 years if they contract Hep-B during their lifetime. Overall, 19,000 Māori, 15,000 Pacific and 10,000 non-Māori and non-Pacific New Zealanders are affected with undiagnosed Hep-B. Correspondingly, 45,000 New Zealanders are infected with chronic Hep-C with an appreciable long-term risk of developing HCC. Inexplicably, there has never been a nationally coordinated screening, treatment and surveillance programme established for either condition.

The incidence of HBV-related HCC also decreases. However, the elimination of HBV is still a challenge to achieve. Novel HBV biomarkers, including quantitative HBsAg, HBcrAg and HBV RNA are promising in predicting clinical phases, risks of disease progression and HBV functional cure. Current antiviral therapies, nucleoside/nucleotide (NA) and pegylated alpha-interferon, effectively decrease HCC incidence in CHB patients and minimize the recurrence of HCC in patients receiving curative therapy. Novel agents under development to achieve HBV cure include direct-acting antivirals that target various stages of the HBV lifecycle and host targeting agents that enhance HBV-specific immunity. The action plans for eliminating hepatitis B in the future are universal HBV screening, early and simplified treatment as well as precision lifelong management for CHB patients.

In this study, the role of paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion (HBeAg SC) was explored to identify a therapeutic target and predictive model. In total, 349 participants were recruited, and 141 HBeAg-positive patients were followed up after 48 weeks of antiviral therapy. Key genes were screened by machine learning algorithms (BORUTA, RF and LASSO). PEG10 mRNA, promoter methylation and plasma levels were examined. The effect of PEG10 was assessed by logistic regression, and HBeAg SC was predicted by nomograms. HBeAg-positive patients showed markedly elevated PEG10 mRNA expression (p < 0.001), which correlated strongly with major virological markers such as HBV DNA (r = 0.520, p < 0.001), HBeAg (r = 0.490, p < 0.001) and HBsAg (r = 0.400, p < 0.001). In addition, HBeAg-positive patients exhibited a significant reduction in PEG10 promoter methylation levels compared with controls (p < 0.001). According to logistic regression analysis, PEG10 promoter methylation status was an independent predictor of HBeAg SC. The predictive nomogram incorporating PEG10 promoter methylation ratio (PMR), albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and HBeAg demonstrated excellent clinical predictive value (area under curve (AUC) = 0.895,95% confidence interval (CI): 0.808 ~ 0.963).

This study explores HBx-induced glucose metabolic reprogramming of HCC cells to promote the generation of CSCs. Immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of glucose metabolic reprogramming-related enzymes and stemness markers in HCC tissues and corresponding paracancer tissues of 30 patients; Western blotting, laser confocal microscopy, and metabolism-detection kits were applied to analyse the expression of glucose metabolism-related enzymes and cancer stemness markers and glucose metabolic products; the generation of CSCs was observed by stem cell pellet and soft agar colony formation experiments. Results indicated that the expression of PKM2, HK2, LDHA, CSC-related proteins, and CD133 and CD44 in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in the corresponding paracancerous tissues. HBx stimulated the expression of the key enzyme of the Warburg effect and CSC-related proteins, and these proteins were significantly reduced after interference with the expression of the PKM2 protein. PKM2 and OCT4 interact in HCC cells, and PKM2 has a regulatory effect on OCT4 function. This study found that HBx stimulated the Warburg effect and induced HCC stemness reprogramming by activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway; PKM2 played a key role in promoting the initiation of HCC stem cells.

It is emphasized that green spaces (e.g., trees, grass, forests and parks) and blue spaces (e.g., lakes, rivers, ponds, etc.) provide beneficial effect on human health, being in fact protective factors for NCDs. The NCD risk factors are found to interact closely with each other: air pollution, depression, tobacco smoking, high blood pressure and obesity have been linked to all NCDs. The evidence is provided that presence of behavioral risk factors for NCDs exacerbates severity of infectious pathology, particularly COVID-19 and other infectious diseases (influenza, HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, etc.).

In this study, we aim to elucidate the role of RAB1A in HBV replication and to explore its potential underlying mechanisms. Our study indicated that RAB1A mRNA and protein levels were significantly elevated in liver tissue samples from patients with chronic HBV infection, as well as in HBV-expressing hepatoma cells. Silencing of RAB1A markedly inhibited HBV replication and transcription in HBV-transfected and -infected hepatoma cells, whereas RAB1A overexpression resulted in increased replication and transcription. Additionally, RAB1A silencing strongly inhibited HBV replication in an HBV-persistent replicating mouse model. Mechanistically, RAB1A enhanced HBV transcription by upregulating the expression of the transcription factor PPARα. Furthermore, RAB1A facilitated HBV replication by triggering ULK1-mediated autophagy by interacting with C9orf72. In conclusion, RAB1A enhances HBV replication through dual synergistic mechanisms at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, positioning RAB1A as a potential novel target for the treatment of chronic HBV infection.",

Studies have estimated that 7-12% of children born to women with HCV infection will acquire HCV, although around two-thirds of children will then clear their HCV infection by 5 years of age. We aimed to estimate the annual number of vertically transmitted HCV infections and how many cases remain at 5 years of age at the country or territory, regional, and global levels. In this data synthesis study, we produced estimates of vertical HCV transmission by combining data from several sources: data on the number of women, age-specific fertility rates, mortality rates among children aged 0-5 years, and HIV prevalence among women aged 15-49 years from the UN; modelled data on HCV prevalence among women aged 15-49 years; meta-analysis data on HCV-HIV co-infection prevalence; and recent estimates of the probabilities of vertical HCV transmission and subsequent clearance by age 5 years. The annual number of births with HCV was estimated by multiplying the number of women with HCV in 5-year age bands by age band-specific birth rates, separately by HIV status, and multiplying by HIV status-specific HCV vertical transmission probabilities. The number of births with HCV was multiplied by the probability of spontaneous clearance of HCV by 5 years of age, accounting for mortality. All estimates were sampled 1000 times from their uncertainty intervals (UIs) to produce 95% UIs. The estimated annual global number of new HCV infections occurring through vertical transmission was 73 862 (95% UI 69 808-78 279). Southern Asia (21 245 [18 095-24 847]), western Africa (16 482 [14 873-18 283]), and eastern Africa (8182 [7479-9085]) were the regions with the most infections. Pakistan (16 350 [13 325-19 844]) and Nigeria (8483 [6944-10 184]) had the largest burden and together accounted for around a third of new infections. We estimated that 23 120 (20 596-25 813) of these children would be alive and still have HCV when aged 5 years.

Our study aimed to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and prevention practices (KAPs) and associated factors among patients in the North Gondar Zone toward hepatitis B and C virus infection. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November to December 2023 among 383 randomly selected patients visiting Debark and Janamora Hospitals in the North Gondar Zone. Data on KAP related to hepatitis B and C viruses among patients were collected by interviewing participants via pretested and well-structured questionnaires. Bivariate (P value less than 0.25) and multivariate (P- value less than 0.05) logistic regression were performed to identify factors associated with KAP levels among patients attending Debark and Janamora hospitals. In this study, 208 (54.3%) of participants had good knowledge, 203 (53%) had poor attitudes, and 210 (54.8%) had poor prevention practices. Educational level and hospital admission history were significantly associated with knowledge; residence and educational level were significantly associated with attitudes; and only study participants' attitudes were significantly associated with prevention practices. A large number of patients included in our study had poor attitudes and prevention practices toward the hepatitis B and C viruses. Therefore, intervention strategies such as community-based education on attitude improvement and prevention practices should be planned and implemented by the local health bureau to overcome morbidity and mortality due to HBV and HCV.",

        "abstract": "Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) of various aetiologies is a complex syndrome with high short-term mortality and significant global burden. To explore easily applicable diagnostic criteria and an accurate prognostic score for ACLF. Clinical data from 5288 patients (after exclusions from 7388 screened) with acute deterioration of chronic liver disease across various aetiologies were used to evaluate the performance of European Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) and Chinese Group on the Study of Severe Hepatitis B (COSSH) criteria. Three non-Asian cohorts were performed to validate the results. CLIF criteria categorised 844 patients as ACLF (28-day/90-day liver transplantation (LT)-free mortality: 40.7%/57.0%; 321 with non-hepatitis B virus (HBV) aetiology, 523 with HBV aetiology), while COSSH criteria categorised 2038 patients as ACLF (mortality: 27.3%/41.0%; 602 with non-HBV aetiology, 1436 with HBV aetiology). COSSH criteria identified 22.6% (1194/5288) more patients (mortality: 19.1%/31.4%) compared with CLIF criteria, including 14.2% non-HBV patients (mortality: 15.9%/33.3%). COSSH criteria produced a more reasonable epidemiological pyramid-like distribution across severity grades (grades 1-3: 63.4%/27.5%/9.1% vs CLIF's grades 1-3: 25.8%/56.3%/17.9%). COSSH-ACLF II score showed the highest predictive values for 28-day/90-day LT-free mortality in both cirrhotic and all ACLF patients with various aetiologies, outperforming the CLIF-C ACLF and other scores. The comparable performance of China-CLIFs (renamed from COSSH-ACLFs) was validated in three non-Asian cohorts. This study evaluated the broader applicability of the China-CLIF framework across diverse aetiologies and varying severity levels of ACLF. These findings may provide a valuable foundation for harmonising ACLF diagnostic and prognostic system.",

Overview tables of prognostic factors were constructed to outline the number of studies, the respective effect direction and statistical significance. Meta-analysis was performed if at least three studies reported on a factor. The level of certainty in evidence was evaluated using the GRADE guideline. Thirty-three studies were included, and 44 prognostic factors were investigated in at least two studies. Cirrhosis at diagnosis (HR 3.21, 95% CI 2.38-4.34) and insufficient response to therapy (HR 4.35, 95% CI 2.5-7.58) were significant predictors with the highest risk ratios. Additional factors associated with reduced survival include advanced age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, variant syndrome with PSC, asymptomatic presentation, higher relapse rates and elevated INR, creatinine, ALP/AST ratio, and MELD score. Protective factors include elevated baseline levels of aminotransferases and albumin levels.

We aimed to project the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the WHO-recommended AHD package in Malawi. Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model, we simulated a cohort of non-hospitalised people living with HIV (aged >19 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), 25% of whom had AHD (CD4 count <200 cells per μL and/or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease). We assessed 13 increasingly comprehensive strategies, ranging from ART only to the WHO-recommended AHD package, including tuberculosis diagnostics (ie, sputum Xpert and urine lipoarabinomannan), tuberculosis preventive therapy, serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening with pre-emptive fluconazole treatment if CrAg-positive, and co-trimoxazole to prevent bacterial infections. Model outcomes included 1 year survival, life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, US$ per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]); we considered a strategy cost-effective if the ICER was less than $600 per QALY (based on 2023 Malawi per capita gross domestic product). ART only resulted in life expectancy of 17·45 undiscounted QALYs and discounted lifetime costs of $1450. All other strategies would increase both QALYs and costs. The WHO-recommended AHD package would result in the greatest life expectancy (19·30 undiscounted QALYs) and be cost-effective (ICER $580 per QALY). AHD prevalence and intervention efficacy had the greatest influence on ICERs; however, the WHO-recommended AHD package would remain cost-effective over a wide range of estimates. The WHO-recommended AHD package of care at ART initiation would provide substantial clinical benefits and be cost-effective in Malawi. This package for AHD should be made widely available in Malawi and similar settings.

A wide group of other drugs may induce liver injury, from simple anti-pyretic medication like Acetaminophen to various dietary herb supplements like Ashwagandha. <b>Case Presentation</b>: A 39-year-old female patient, diagnosed with MS, has been previously treated with Glatiramer Acetate and interferon-beta, and is currently undergoing immunomodulatory treatment with natalizumab (infusion no. 81). She had a recent history of an airway infection for which she took 4-5 capsules of Acetaminophen per day for 7 days, along with the consumption of dietary supplement with Ashwagandha herb. She presented with jaundice, pruritus, and lower limb ecchymoses. The laboratory results revealed higher aminotransferase levels, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. The screening for autoimmune and infectious hepatitis was negative. The scenario of toxic hepatitis induced by recently used drugs (Ashwagandha dietary herb supplement and Acetaminophen) was adequate to start therapy with oral cortisone. The clinical and laboratory results gradually improved, with normal levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin, with no further increase after the discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy and dietary herb supplements. <b>Conclusions</b>: This case highlights the challenges in determining the multiple etiologies and managing acute liver injury in an MS patient on natalizumab, an immunomodulatory drug that can induce liver injury after the first infusions, especially in the context of recent ingestion of hepatotoxic drugs.",

Its incidence continues to rise worldwide, and it is currently the fastest-growing cancer by incidence in the United States. HCC most often arises in the context of chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. While chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C) has traditionally been the primary etiologic factor, recent advances in antiviral therapies and prevention strategies have shifted the epidemiological landscape. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and alcohol-related liver disease are increasingly prominent risk factors, especially in Western populations. This shift underscores the need for targeted risk factor modification, improved early detection, and enhanced surveillance protocols. The management of HCC necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating locoregional therapies, surgical resection, liver transplantation, and systemic therapies for advanced-stage disease. Recent advances in systemic treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and combination therapies, have transformed the therapeutic landscape. Despite these developments, significant challenges persist in optimizing treatment, identifying predictive biomarkers, and personalizing therapy. Ongoing research is focused on refining molecular classifications and advancing precision medicine strategies to improve outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the etiology, surveillance strategies, diagnostic approaches, molecular features, and current treatment modalities for HCC.",

While some data on viral hepatitis B and C prevalence exist among key populations, nationwide prevalence in the general population has never been assessed.AIMTo assess the prevalence of viral hepatitis B, C, and D seromarkers in Ukraine in 2021 to plan and monitor elimination measures.METHODSBlood samples available from a cross-sectional household-based SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey conducted in 2021 were tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, total antibodies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen (HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) antibodies. We calculated crude and weighted proportions for anti-HCV, anti-HBc and HBsAg positivity. To account for differences in sex, age group and urbanisation level, we applied post-stratification weights using inverse probability weighting based on the distribution of the Ukrainian population. We calculated proportions positive for anti-HDV among HBsAg-positive cases and weighted regional estimates for HBV and HCV seromarkers.RESULTSWeighted prevalence of anti-HCV was 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0), anti-HBc 11.6% (95% CI: 10.8-12.5) and HBsAg 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.2). Among HBsAg-positive individuals, 7.5% (95% СI: 3.0-17.9) were anti-HDV positive. We found higher prevalence of HBV and HCV seromarkers among men and in southern Ukraine.CONCLUSIONHBsAg prevalence and considerably high anti-HBc and anti-HCV prevalence indicate substantial lifetime exposure. This reinforces the necessity of sustained prevention such as HBV vaccination of newborns and groups at increased risk, regular hepatitis B and C screening, early treatment, and raising awareness to reduce ongoing transmission.",

The detection of infectious diseases in blood donors ensures the safety of blood transfusion. Another challenge is the differences in blood group antigens due to the ability of clinically significant antibodies to cause adverse reactions. This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of distribution and the possible correlation of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) with different blood groups. This study also aimed to evaluate the frequencies of minor blood group antigens detected on screening in a few infected blood donors. Methodology This study included replacement donors who were fit to donate blood after screening. After blood donation, tests for TTIs was done using the chemiluminescence immunoassay for hepatitis B virus (HBV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HCV), and rapid diagnostic kits were used for malaria and syphilis. Blood grouping was performed by IMMUCOR'S NEO IRIS instrument using commercial antisera. Samples of blood donors infected with TTIs over the study period of two months were also tested for minor antigens. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Software, version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results In total, 46,549 blood donors were included, of whom 3,064 (6.6%) donors were reactive for TTIs, with the most prevalent being HBV infection (n = 1,183, 2.5%). In this study, 2.4% (n = 23) of the total B-negative blood donors were HCV reactive (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.3, p = 0.038; statistically significant), and 0.9% (n = 8) of the total B-negative blood donors were malaria reactive (Fisher's exact test = 11.06, p = 0.001; statistically significant). Blood donors with A-positive blood group were significantly associated with syphilis infection (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.86, p = 0.05). The Fyb antigen was relatively more prevalent among HIV-reactive donors (n = 24, 77.4%), while E (n = 3, 9.7%) and c (n = 13, 41.9%) antigens were relatively lesser prevalent compared to other infected donors. Similarly, malaria-reactive donors had a lower prevalence of C antigen (n = 17, 73.9%) and a higher prevalence of E antigen (n = 8, 34.8%). The most common Rh phenotype found among all the TTI-infected reactive donors was CCDee, and among the Rh-negative infected donors, ccdee was the only phenotype observed. Conclusions This study determined the regional prevalence of TTIs among blood donors and noted a significant association of B-negative blood group with HCV and malaria. This study also assessed the frequency of some minor blood group antigens among TTI-infected blood donors.",

HCV seroprevalence fell from 60.8% to 27.4%, and active infection from 46.3% to 0.9%. In the DAA era (2015-2023), active HCV dropped by 100% in heterosexuals, 94% in IDU, and 71% in MSM. Treatment uptake increased from 23% in 2002 to 99% by 2023 with all-oral DAAs. Cirrhosis among active HCV cases peaked at 23.1% in 2015 but fell to 0% by 2021. Among those achieving sustained virologic response (SVR), cirrhosis prevalence was 20.4% in 2023. HIV/HCV coinfection has drastically declined in Spain, with active HCV infection prevalence below 1% since 2021. DAAs were pivotal in this achievement. However, cirrhosis remains a concern among those with SVR. Ongoing surveillance and prevention efforts are essential to sustain these gains and address residual risks.",

        "abstract": "The pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) involves complex mechanisms, and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced immune responses play a central role in hepatocyte injury and inflammatory necrosis. CHB infection not only drives liver pathology but also demonstrates significant extrahepatic associations which include depression, cognitive dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, insomnia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and thrombocytopenia. Conventional Western medicine primarily employs antiviral therapy but faces limitations which include low hepatitis B surface antigen clearance rates and frequent adverse drug reactions. In contrast, traditional Chinese medicine demonstrates therapeutic advantages in CHB management which are exemplified by <i>Artemisia capillaris</i>, Xiaochaihu Decoction and Fuzheng Huayu Tablet. Through its modulation of immune pathways and intervention in key HBV lifecycle targets, traditional Chinese medicine achieves a tripartite therapeutic synergy that combines immune reconstitution, viral suppression, and hepatic repair. Chinese medical interventions exhibit characteristic multi-ingredient, multi-target mechanisms that possess immunomodulatory effects in CHB management. Future research should employ modern technologies to elucidate these mechanisms further and thus facilitate the development of optimized treatment protocols. Standardized therapeutic approaches derived from such evidence will hold significant clinical value.",

        "abstract": "Pathogen reduction technologies (PRTs) have the potential to reduce the risk of emerging transfusion transmissible infections. Evaluating PRT activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) presents some unique challenges due to the lack of robust model systems. Surrogate viruses (e.g., duck HBV) can be used, but may differ from the human pathogen in ways that influence susceptibility to a given PRT. Whole blood (WB) collected from volunteers was spiked with human plasma from deferred HBV-positive donors. Spiked WB was then treated with the nucleic acid crosslinking compound S-303 or left untreated. Additional physical and chemical treatments were also assessed. Plasma prepared from the spiked WB was used to inoculate human hepatocyte cultures isolated from chimeric mice with humanized livers. Culture medium was monitored over time for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and viral DNA. Cell lysates were analyzed for evidence of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA. The culture system faithfully measured infectious HBV in blood components. S-303 treatment of HBV-spiked WB prevented infection of hepatocyte cultures, as monitored by HBsAg expression, at concentrations as low as 0.125 mM of S-303 or with incubation times as short as 1 h. Additionally, S-303 treatment prevented the accumulation of T5 exonuclease-resistant HBV DNA in inoculated hepatocytes, suggesting that S-303 prevents establishment of HBV cccDNA. This model mimics transfusion transmission by using donor-derived HBV and mouse-passaged human hepatocytes, allowing evaluation of the efficacy of different PRTs against authentic human HBV isolates. We found S-303 to be a potent inactivator of HBV.",

        "abstract": "Despite price advantages, local direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for hepatitis C (hep C) have not been widely used in China compared with the imported ones. There is no evidence on their relative efficacy and safety, nor whether the small market share of local DAAs was attributable to the potential differences. This study systematically evaluated the efficacy and safety evidence of 5 local and 6 imported DAAs with valid Chinese registration numbers as of January 25, 2024. Meta-analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to synthesize evidence and compared the outcomes by using the random-effects empirical Bayes model. Nineteen randomized controlled trials and 82 single-arm trials (SATs) were included. The results demonstrated no statistically significant difference in 12-week sustained virological response [0.97, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 0.99) vs 0.96, (95% CI: 0.94, 0.98), P = 0.21], relapse [0.02, (95% CI: 0.01, 0.04) vs 0.02, (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03), P = 0.65], virological breakthrough [0.003, (95% CI: < 0.001, 0.02) vs 0.0000002, (95% CI: < 0.001, 0.0006), P = 0.51] and serious adverse events (SAEs) [0.04, (95% CI: 0.03, 0.06) vs 0.03, (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03), P = 0.12] between local and imported DAAs. By controlling for ethnicities of patients in multiple meta-regression, the local DAAs had a 33.7% higher rate of adverse events (AEs) [0.337, (95% CI: 0.188, 0.486), P < 0.001]. No statistically significant difference was found in the interaction test between local and imported pan-genotypic DAAs regarding the rate of AEs [0.72, (95% CI: 0.64, 0.79) vs 0.73, (95% CI: 0.65, 0.50), P = 0.81]. Current evidence demonstrates no statistically significant differences in efficacy and SAEs between local and imported DAAs. Given that simplified pan-genotypic DAA regimens are now standard care, local pan-genotypic DAAs hold potential to increase hepatitis C virus treatment rates in China. It is critical for local DAA developers to generate more evidence with expanded patient population in terms of age, treatment experience and genotype of hepatitis C virus, conducting head-to-head studies directly comparing the efficacy and safety. Clinical and policy decision-making should be adaptive and evolve as new evidence is generated.",

        "abstract": "Alcohol, one of the most widely popular and consumed beverages worldwide, often leads to acute alcoholic liver injury (AALI) when excessively consumed within a short timeframe. It can further induce alcoholic hepatitis, posing a serious risk to human health and public health safety. Pyroptosis, a typical mode of programmed cell death, is closely associated with the body's inflammatory response and plays a central role in AALI. However, the role of yogurt in acute alcohol-induced pyroptosis and inflammation is unclear. In this study, we found that yogurt and its metabolite d-lactate effectively mitigate alcohol-induced liver damage in mice, reducing hepatocyte pyroptosis and attenuating the inflammatory response. For the specific mechanism, further studies have shown that yogurt may inhibit autophagy through its substance d-lactate, leading to the accumulation of P62 protein in cells. This accumulation subsequently triggers the activation of Nrf2 through nonclassical pathways. Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus to play its antioxidant role, thereby reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species levels, inhibiting the activation of the alcohol-induced NLRP3 inflammasome, and ultimately alleviating pyroptosis and inflammation. Overall, this study reveals the potential protective effect of yogurt and its metabolite d-lactate in alleviating AALI, offering new insights and scientific basis for yogurt as a dietary strategy to improve AALI.",

An HCV and HIV transmission model was calibrated to urban and rural area data (San Diego, CA and Central/Northern Wisconsin). Fentanyl use among PWID was assumed to increase mortality and injecting-related risk of HIV and HCV based on San Diego data. We predicted HCV/HIV incidence with recent trends (in fentanyl use, transition from injecting to smoking drugs, opiate agonist treatment (OAT) and incarceration), and scenarios with no trend changes since 2020. We calculated the population attributable fraction of fentanyl on incidence, comparing to a no fentanyl counterfactual from 2015 to 2025. High and increasing self-reported fentanyl use among PWID was observed in Central/Northern Wisconsin (20 % in 2018 to 45 % in 2021) and San Diego (51 % in 2021 to 66 % in 2023). Between 2015-2025, modeling suggests fentanyl use contributed to 18 % (95 %CI 9-25) and 34 % (95 %CI 26-45) of new HCV infections among PWID in Central/Northern Wisconsin and San Diego, respectively. Fentanyl contributed to 10 % (95 %CI 1-26) of HIV infections in San Diego; no HIV was observed among Central/Northern Wisconsin PWID. Fentanyl-associated risk was mitigated by increased OAT, reduced incarceration (Wisconsin), and shifts from injecting to smoking drugs (San Diego).

Recent evidence suggests that dietary salt influences immune diseases by modulating Th17 differentiation. This study assessed the impact of dietary salt on Th17-driven inflammation in patients with compensated cirrhosis and explored its effects on liver injury in mouse models.MethodsA non-drug, open-label, non-randomized study involved 37 patients with compensated cirrhosis, who were given personalized guidelines to reduce salt intake over three months. Changes in Th17-driven inflammation and liver function markers were assessed at baseline and after salt restriction. In parallel, the impact of a high-salt diet on hepatic CD4+ T cells was analyzed in mouse models of acute liver injury and fibrosis. ResultsHigh salt intake was associated with Th17-mediated inflammation and correlated with markers of impaired liver function in these patients. Importantly, moderating salt intake through a personalized nutritional intervention was sufficient to reduce CD4+ T cell- mediated inflammation. Furthermore, analysis of RNA-seq data revealed enrichment of salt-induced Th17 gene signatures in both liver tissue and peripheral cells from patients with liver disease. Similarly, mice fed a high salt diet showed hepatic enrichment of Th17 cells and exacerbated liver fibrosis upon injury. Mechanistic studies revealed that high sodium conditions activated NF-κB and induced IL-6 production in hepatocytes, which may promote Th17 responses.ConclusionDietary salt exacerbates Th17-driven inflammation and contributes to cirrhosis progression.

Patients with clinical and laboratory evidence of acute infection, defined by positive phase II IgG serology or Coxiella burnetii RT-PCR were included. Patients were categorised into two groups based on the presence or absence of hepatitis, defined as elevated liver transaminases above the upper normal limit. Descriptive comparisons were conducted between the two groups. 116 patients were included, 87 in the hepatitis group and 29 in the non-hepatitis group. The hepatitis group showed a male predominance (66.7%), while the non-hepatitis group had a higher proportion of females (55.2%) (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Fever was more common in the hepatitis group (85.1%) compared to the non-hepatitis group (65.5%) (<i>p</i> = 0.02).

        "abstract": "As one of the key features of the immune active (IA) phase (HBeAg-positive) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver fibrosis (LF) is a critical treatable stage to avoid progressing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is an urgent need to establish mouse models that mimic CHB during this phase to clarify the mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance and liver injury, as well as to facilitate therapy development. In the present work, we introduce a novel HBV mouse model via injections of porcine serum (PS, an immunological liver injury inducer), in combination with hydrodynamic injection of pAAV-HBV1.2 plasmid. The (pAAV-HBV1.2+PS BALB/c) mouse model we developed exhibits the typical features of the IA phase in CHB, including high/intermediate serum HBsAg levels, positive HBeAg and HBV DNA, intermittent elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase, and significant LF. Notably, despite dramatic increases in both duration and intensity of HBV viremia, PS induced definitive LF within 12 weeks only in BALB/c, not in C57BL/6J mice. The heightened functional adaptive immunity impairment, characterized by increased PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, may contribute to the improvement in HBV persistence, whereas intermittent HBV activation, followed by liver injury induced by PS injection, primarily drives LF progression. Furthermore, we validate the characteristics of this model by treating the model with entecavir (an HBV replication blocker). Consequently, we have established a novel CHB mouse model in the IA phase, which undoubtedly holds significant value for deepening our understanding of CHB progression mechanisms and evaluating corresponding therapies.IMPORTANCEHere, we constructed a novel mouse model which shows the typical features of IA phase chronic hepatitis B, including positive serum HBV-indicators (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg; hepatitis B e antigen, HBeAg and HBV DNA), intermittent serum alanine aminotransferase elevation, and significant LF. This model could be a valuable platform for understanding the mechanisms associated with virus clearance, liver damage, immune tolerance, and immune activation, and for the development of therapies. The PS injections can remarkably attenuate the clearance of HBV in pAAV-HBV1.2 mice (BALB/c and C57BL/6J), but only in HBV carrier BALB/c mice induce moderate/severe LF. Impairment of adaptive immunity by PS injections accounts for the model's HBV-persistence improvement, whereas the intermittent HBV activation and immunological liver injury by each PS injection in pAAV-HBV1.2 mice are responsible for LF. Blockage of HBV replication can diminish LF progression. These findings provide new insights into the study of interactions between immune responses and the virus.",

        "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a heterogeneous bile duct adenocarcinoma with a rising global incidence and a poor prognosis. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the most recent radiological research on iCCA, focusing on its histopathologic subclassification and the use of imaging findings to predict prognosis and inform treatment decisions. Histologically, iCCA is subclassified into small duct (SD-iCCA) and large duct (LD-iCCA) types. SD-iCCA typically arises in the peripheral small bile ducts and is often associated with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. It presents as a mass-forming lesion with a relatively favorable prognosis. LD-iCCA originates near the hepatic hilum, is linked to chronic bile duct diseases, and exhibits more aggressive behavior and poorer outcomes. Imaging is essential for differentiating these subtypes and assessing prognostic factors like tumor size, multiplicity, vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, enhancement patterns, and intratumoral fibrosis. Imaging-based prognostic models have demonstrated predictive accuracy comparable to traditional pathological staging systems. Furthermore, imaging findings are instrumental in guiding treatment decisions, including those regarding surgical planning, lymphadenectomy, neoadjuvant therapy, and the selection of targeted therapies based on molecular profiling. Advancements in radiological research have improved our understanding of iCCA heterogeneity, facilitating prognosis prediction and treatment personalization. Imaging findings assist in subclassifying iCCA, predicting outcomes, and informing treatment decisions, thus optimizing patient management. Incorporating imaging-based approaches into clinical practice is crucial for advancing personalized medicine in the treatment of iCCA. However, further high-level evidence from international multicenter prospective studies is required to validate these findings and increase their clinical applicability.",

        "abstract": "Advanced chronic liver disease is frequently complicated by hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis; predictors of poor prognosis that significantly reduce survival. While orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) remains the definitive treatment, it is often inaccessible in resource-limited settings. We present the case of a 70-year-old retired hospital attendant with hypertension who developed decompensated liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C virus HCV infection. She presented with portal hypertension, grade 4 HE, hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. She remained in grade 3 to 4 HE for approximately three months and in grade 2-3 HE for an additional two months. Despite profound hepatic decompensation and a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) score of 48 (indicating a 71% three-month mortality) and a Child-Pugh score of 15 (Class C), she responded remarkably to intensive conservative management. After six months of inpatient care, which included direct-acting antiviral therapy, anti-failure therapy, and seizure management, she recovered from hepatic coma. She received a six-month course of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)daclatasvir and sofosbuvir and achieved sustained virologic response. Over six and a half years later, she remains in good health with preserved cognition and normal blood pressure and has been under annual surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma. This case underscores the transformative potential of DAAs in improving survival even among severely decompensated HCV-related cirrhotic patients. It highlights the need for expanded access and subsidization of DAAs in low-resource settings, where liver transplantation is not feasible, and emphasizes the role of aggressive, supportive management in bridging the treatment gap.",

Seven therapies showed OS benefit over TACE, including TACE plus microwave ablation (MWA) (HR = 0.24, 95%CI = 0.06-0.91), TACE plus liver resection (HR = 0.35, 95%CI = 0.22-0.57), liver resection plus RFA (HR =0.49,95%CI=0.35-0.70), TACE plus immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (HR = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.27-0.95), liver resection (HR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.45-0.65), and TACE plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (HR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.36-0.93). However, no therapies improved the PFS better than TACE alone. Subgroup analysis indicated that liver resection plus TACE showed the best OS for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Seven therapies showed better efficacy than TACE alone for particular patients with intermediate-stage HCC. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/, PROSPERO CRD42023459740.",

        "abstract": "This investigation assessed the clinical outcomes and adverse effects of combination therapy using sofosbuvir (SOF) and daclatasvir (DCV) among dialysis-dependent patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1b or 2a in real-world settings. We conducted a prospective, single-arm interventional trial comprising 16maintenance hemodialysis patients (14 with HCV-1b, 2 with HCV-2a). Participants received SOF-DCV combination therapy over 24 weeks with monitoring at weeks 4, 12, and 24 during treatment, plus a follow-up assessment 12 weeks post-treatment completion. The primary outcome measure was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Secondary endpoints included therapeutic tolerance and safety profiles. All 16 participants completed the prescribed treatment regimen. Demographic characteristics revealed a mean age of 57.0 years, male predominance (75%), average dialysis duration of 7.0 years, and mean body weight of 63.0 kg. Five patients (31.3%) had compensated cirrhosis. Liver function parameters remained stable throughout the study period. Rapid virologic response (RVR) was documented in 87.5% (14/16) of participants, while end-of-treatment response (ETR) and SVR12 were both achieved in 93.8% (15/16) of cases. All cirrhotic patients (5/5) ultimately attained SVR12. The therapeutic regimen demonstrated favorable tolerability, with no treatment discontinuations due to adverse events. One participant was lost to follow-up. APRI scores significantly decreased from baseline (0.56) to week 24 (0.20, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Reported adverse reactions included headache, fatigue, nausea (each 6.3%), and anemia (18.8%). The 12-week SOF-DCV combination demonstrated robust therapeutic efficacy and acceptable safety profiles in hemodialysis patients infected with HCV genotypes 1b or 2a, including those with compensated cirrhosis.",

        "abstract": "Pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) has been utilized as an early predictive marker for antiviral therapy, an indicator for the emergence of drug resistance in hepatitis B virus (HBV), or a marker for safe discontinuation of nucleoside analog therapy. However, its role during pregnancy has rarely been reported. We aimed to evaluate the pgRNA profiles and its dynamic changes among pregnant, postpartum, and non-pregnant women with chronic HBV infection (CHB). We conducted a study involving 479 women with CHB, including 235 during pregnancy, 90 postpartum, and 154 non-pregnant women of childbearing age. pgRNA was detected using the HBV-SAT method. Additionally, we followed up 39 women in mid-pregnancy, 21 in late pregnancy, 20 within 0-3 months postpartum, and 20 non-pregnant women of childbearing age with different treatment regimens for two times. Significant differences were observed in clinical indicators such as HBV DNA, ALT, AST, and pgRNA among CHB women during pregnancy, postpartum, and non-pregnant periods. Pregnant and postpartum women with positive pgRNA had higher levels of DNA, HBeAg, HBsAg, and ALT. Moreover, the detection rates of pgRNA, DNA, and HBeAg varied significantly across the three stages and different treatment regimens in CHB women. pgRNA was highly correlated with HBeAg, and a moderate correlation was found between pgRNA and HBV DNA levels. This study also revealed the patterns of viral activity changes during pregnancy and postpartum, and the first three months postpartum represent a critical period for viral activity changes. This unique immune adjustment phase may offer new opportunities for the treatment of hepatitis B. CHB women have different pgRNA and clinical characteristics during pregnancy, postpartum, and the non-pregnant childbearing period.",

        "abstract": "We sought to investigate the factors influencing liver regeneration after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma and the relationship between liver regeneration and prognosis. This retrospective cohort study enrolled 92 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing hemihepatectomy at Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital (2014-2020) with complete CT imaging (postoperative day 3 and month 1) and clinical records. Using Hisense CAS software, we performed three-dimensional liver reconstruction to quantify standardized residual liver volume (SRLV) and calculate hepatic regeneration rate (HRR) at 1-month postoperation. Patients were stratified into high and low-regeneration groups based on median HRR. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were applied to identify factors influencing regeneration. Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests analyzed tumor-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes in relation to regeneration capacity. The cohort comprised 61 right and 31 left hemihepatectomies. Median 1-month HRR was 17.6% overall, with significant disparity between right (20.29%) and left hepatectomy subgroups (12.2%). Univariate analysis identified age, sex, alcohol history, hepatitis B status, cirrhosis severity, and SRLV as significant regeneration predictors (all P < 0.05). Multivariate modeling established cirrhosis severity (OR = 0.217, 95% CI:0.064-0.732, P = 0.014) and SRLV (OR = 0.989, 95% CI:0.982-0.995, P < 0.001) as independent determinants.Prognostically, high-regeneration patients exhibited extended median TFS (16 vs. 5 months, P<0.05) compared to low-regeneration counterparts, though no significant OS difference was observed (P>0.05). Cirrhosis severity and standardized residual liver volume (SRLV) independently predict post-hemihepatectomy liver regeneration in HCC patients. Preoperative 3D reconstruction-guided SRLV assessment combined with cirrhosis evaluation optimizes surgical planning. Enhanced hepatic regeneration correlates with shorter tumor-free survival (median 16 vs 5 months, P＜0.05), necessitating intensified surveillance in high-regeneration cohorts to mitigate recurrence risks.",

We utilized MRI to compare three-dimensional volumetric liver fat fraction by chronic HCV status and evaluated associations between liver fat fraction and inflammatory cytokines and IGF-1. Participants with untreated, non-genotype 3 chronic HCV and participants without HCV were enrolled between 2019-2022 and underwent MRI to quantify three-dimensional volumetric liver fat fraction. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IGF-1 were also measured. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine associations between liver fat fraction, chronic HCV, and cytokine and IGF-1 levels. Among 54 participants with HCV and 54 without HCV, median volumetric liver fat fraction was 12.4% (IQR: 9.3, 18.0%) and 10.9% (IQR: 8.7, 13.3%), respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, mean liver fat fraction was 2.28% (95% CI: 0.55, 4.02%) higher in participants with HCV. HCV was associated with higher mean log TNF-α (0.11 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.16]) and IL-18 (0.14 [95% CI: 0.05, 0.24]), but lower mean log IGF-1 (-0.18 [95% CI: -0.26, -0.11]) when compared to those without HCV. IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α, and IGF-1 were not associated with liver fat fraction. Chronic HCV is associated with higher volumetric liver fat fraction by MRI.

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a significant public health concern in Thailand, with genotype-specific, drug-dependent variations influencing treatment response and disease progression. Despite the availability of pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), genotype surveillance remains essential for optimizing national elimination strategies. This study thus aims to characterize the molecular distribution of HCV genotypes in northern Thailand. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective molecular epidemiological study on 1737 HCV-infected patients who attended the Clinical Microbiology Service Unit (CMSU) Laboratory, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University between April 2016 and June 2024. HCV genotyping was performed using Sanger sequencing and reverse hybridization line probe assay (LiPA). <b>Results:</b> Genotype 3 was the most prevalent (36.6%), followed by genotype 1 (35.8%) and genotype 6 (27.2%). Subtype 3a (27.2%) predominated, along with 1a (22.1%), 1b (12.6%), and genotype 6 subtypes including 6c to 6l (13.5%) and 6n (6.6%). Males had a higher prevalence of genotype 1, while genotype 3 was more common among females. Temporal analysis revealed a relative increase in genotype 6 prevalence since 2021. Genotype 6 also exhibited significantly higher median viral loads compared to genotypes 1 and 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides updated evidence on the shifting distribution of HCV genotypes in northern Thailand, particularly the increasing prevalence of genotype 6. These findings underscore the importance of continued molecular surveillance to guide genotype-specific treatment strategies and support Thailand's 2030 HCV elimination goals.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Clinical Significance:</b> Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations, particularly de novo compound mutations such as exon 19 deletions (Ex19del) with T790M substitutions, present a significant clinical challenge due to resistance to many treatments. While treating these patients, the administration of osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, after immunotherapy can lead to unique immune-related adverse events (irAEs), such as pneumonitis and, rarely, hepatitis. <b>Case Presentation:</b> A 36-year-old Filipino woman presented with metastatic NSCLC harboring de novo Ex19del and T790M mutations. Despite initial therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by chemoimmunotherapy, the patient's disease progressed. She subsequently developed severe hepatitis from osimertinib after her prior immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. After the hepatitis resolved with high-dose steroids, osimertinib was switched to afatinib, but her disease rapidly progressed with new metastases. A second attempt at osimertinib rechallenge, with concomitant prednisone, resulted in substantial disease control, including improved leptomeningeal disease (LMD) and no recurrence of hepatitis. <b>Conclusions:</b> This case underscores the feasibility of rechallenging with osimertinib in patients who experience adverse events such as hepatotoxicity, provided that appropriate management strategies, such as steroid therapy, are employed. The successful rechallenge in this case highlights the potential of osimertinib as a viable option in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, even after prior treatment-related complications.",

        "abstract": "The hepatitis C virus is an important cause of chronic hepatitis and primary hepatocellular carcinomas. Early treatment of HCV infection, especially in the acute phase, can facilitate elimination of the virus and prevent chronic infection. This will limit HCV-related liver damage and mortality. This study provides the current clinical-epidemiologic pattern, risk factors and seroprevalence of hepatitis C in clinical suspected cases attending different departments of a tertiary care centre. The study was conducted for a period of 1 year (March 2023 to March 2024) in the Department of Microbiology, AIIMS, Raebareli. After obtaining ethical clearance, serum samples were collected from all patients referred to the Department of Microbiology to determine antibodies against HCV. An ELISA was performed for anti-HCV antibodies and HBsAg. The results and relevant clinical information were noted and analysed. Of the 16911 samples, 127 (0.75%) were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Of the 127 anti-HCV positive samples, 88 (69.3%) samples had an S/Co ratio >5.0, while 39 (30.7%) samples had an S/Co ratio <5.0. Majority of the cases were in the age group 46-60 years (31%), followed by the age group 31-45 years (26.%) and 61-75 years (26.%). The number of male cases (55.91%) was slightly higher than female cases (44.09%). In our study, serum bilirubin was elevated in 29.8% (29/127) of anti-HCV seropositive patients, alanine transaminase (ALT) was elevated in 56.7% (72/127) of seropositive patients and 49.6% (63/127) of seropositive patients had elevated aspartate transaminase (AST). A history of surgery (30.9%) was the most important risk factor in the seropositive patients. The study shows the seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus in patients with clinical suspicion, with 0.75% of samples testing positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Most positive cases were observed in adults aged 46-60 years, with elevated ALT and AST levels found in several seropositive patients. Surgical history has emerged as a notable risk factor.",

Since direct comparisons of body composition parameters are lacking, we here investigate 12 different body composition parameters. Adult participants from NHANES 2017-2023 with liver health data were included. Exclusion criteria were age >80 years, excessive alcohol (>60gr/day), viral hepatitis and missing anthropometrics. MASLD was defined as CAP ≥275 dB/m with metabolic dysfunction, MASH as FibroScan-AST (FAST) ≥0.35, and increased liver stiffness measurement (LSM) as ≥8 kPa. Predictive performance of 12 body composition parameters was assessed using AUC-analysis. Predicted probabilities of outcomes were visualized for standardized parameters, and non-linearity was assessed via restricted cubic splines. Among 11,579 participants (age 51[35-63], 47% male); 41% had MASLD, 6.5% at-risk MASH and 9.9% increased LSM. Waist circumference (WC) and not BMI or waist-to-height-ratio obtained the highest AUC for MASLD (0.82), at-risk MASH (0.73) and increased LSM (0.75) outperforming or equalling all other indices across subgroups. Associations between WC and MASLD were non-linear, with slight risk saturation beyond 100 cm; at-risk MASH was linearly associated across the entire spectrum; increased LSM risk rose only after WC >100 cm. In the general population, MASLD and MASH risk increased even when WC < 100 cm, while increased LSM risk was increasing only >100 cm. Although relatively minor differences, WC consistently demonstrated the highest predictive value for MASLD, at-risk MASH, and increased LSM and therefore most suited for MASLD diagnosis, management and risk stratification.",

        "abstract": "People with human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis B virus (HIV-HBV) co-infection have faster rates of liver disease progression and an increase in hepatocellular carcinoma compared to people with HBV mono-infection. Given that HIV can infect multiple cells in the liver, including hepatocytes, we hypothesized that HIV will impact HBV replication through HIV viral proteins that can impact HBV replication either directly or indirectly, via effects on cellular pathways. Following infection of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP)-expressing HepG2 cells with HBV and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV.G)-pseudotyped HIV, we found that productive HIV infection led to a twofold upregulation of HBV surface (HBs) mRNA and a marked increase in intracellular production and cellular retention of HBs antigen (HBsAg). Overexpression of HIV Tat protein, but not other HIV proteins, by DNA plasmid transfection in the HBV-producing cell line AD38 significantly stimulated HBs mRNA expression. This could be rescued by CDK9 inhibition with BAY-1251152. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which HIV directly impacts HBV replication and has implications for understanding adverse liver outcomes in people living with HIV and HBV.IMPORTANCEPeople with both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) face faster liver disease progression and a higher risk of liver cancer than those with HBV alone. This study investigated how HIV affects HBV replication in liver cells and found that HIV infection increases the production of a key HBV surface protein (HBsAg) by enhancing the expression of its gene (HBs). This effect is driven by the HIV Tat protein. Notably, blocking the CDK9 pathway prevented this increase, suggesting a possible explanation for the adverse liver outcomes in co-infected individuals. Our findings have implications for interventions aiming to cure HIV through latency reversal, as these interventions can specifically increase the Tat protein. Future exploratory treatment strategies, such as Tat inhibitors, could play a role in the management of people with HIV and HBV at high risk of liver disease.",

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of initiating antiviral therapy in patients in an indeterminate phase of CHB, defined as those who do not clearly fit into the established four phases categorised by serum HBV DNA and ALT levels. A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a Markov model to compare the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of initiating antiviral therapy at the indeterminate phase ('treat-Indet') versus delaying treatment until chronic hepatitis ('untreated-Indet'). A hypothetical cohort of 10 000 patients in the indeterminate phase (60% male, HBV DNA 4-8 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL, ALT < 40 IU/L, 50% HBeAg-positivity) was simulated over a 10-year horizon. Input parameters were obtained from a Korean multicentre historical cohort. From a healthcare system perspective, the ICER of the treat-Indet strategy was US$12050/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), indicating cost-effectiveness under the local willingness-to-pay threshold of US$25000/QALY. From a societal perspective, the ICER was less than 0, indicating lower costs. A U-shaped association was identified between baseline HBV DNA levels and the ICER, as HBV DNA levels of 6-7 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL were associated with the lowest ICER (US$2018/QALY), followed by 5-6 (US$7233/QALY), 7-8 (US$19677/QALY) and 4-5 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL (US$24570/QALY), following the order of HCC risk.

        "abstract": "Transplantation is one of the few life-saving therapies for patients with end-stage organ disease, yet organ availability remains restrictive. Expanding donors to include those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, incorporating HBV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) positive donors, could improve organ access. However, the risk of donor-derived HBV transmission and recipient management of organs transplanted from HBV NAT-positive donors, particularly in thoracic organ recipients, is limited. We conducted a single-center retrospective study to assess the safety and outcomes in recipients of non-hepatic organ transplants from HBV NAT-positive donors. Over a 4.5-year period, 25 transplant recipients, including 16 thoracic organ recipients, received organs from 22 unique, qualitative HBV NAT-positive donors. All recipients were HBV surface antibody-positive prior to transplant. Quantitative NAT was performed in 20/22 (91%) donors with values ranging from 0 to 1 280 000 IU/mL; 8/22 (36%) donors had HBV NAT values that were undetected or below the lower limit of quantification. All recipients were administered HBV immunoglobulin (HBIG) and received HBV active antiviral therapy post-transplant. Recipients were followed post-transplant for a median of 250 days (IQR: 169-467 days). No recipients developed de novo HBV infection characterized by HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion, quantifiable HBV NAT detection, or sustained HBV core antibody (HbcAb) seroconversion post-transplant. Similarly, no recipient developed liver dysfunction or died due to HBV infection. Quantifying HBV from NAT-positive donors may better inform the risk of donor-derived infection in recipients, and the use of these organs incorporating a multimodal prevention strategy could safely increase the donor pool.",

However, tailored online psychological interventions remain limited. This pilot randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a culturally-adapted four-week mobile cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing depression, anxiety, and stress levels among individuals with HBV in China. Thirty-seven HBV-positive participants (age 18-65) with moderate to severe depression, anxiety or stress were recruited through an online platform. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (<i>n</i> = 19) or waitlist control (<i>n</i> = 18). The intervention included animated psychoeducation, interactive exercises, and weekly feedback from trained clinical psychology graduates. Primary outcomes-depression, anxiety, and stress-were assessed weekly (T0-T4), while secondary outcomes-fatigue, cognitive flexibility, and post-traumatic stress-were measured at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T4). Results showed that the intervention was feasible, with no serious adverse events reported. Participants in the intervention group completed an average of 43.2 % of the program and reported high satisfaction with it. Intention-to-treat repeated-measures ANOVA indicated significant improvements in depression and anxiety for both groups but found no significant differences between groups in primary or secondary psychological outcomes. This pilot study underscores the need to refine intervention content and delivery methods. Larger trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of online psychological interventions for individuals with HBV and to explore strategies for enhancing engagement and adherence.",

        "abstract": "The interplay between abnormal glucose metabolism and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients with both chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. Previous studies have suggested that the coexistence of these conditions may exacerbate liver inflammation and fibrosis; however, the impacts of dynamic changes in glucose metabolism indicators, hypoglycemic medication regimens, and glycemic control status on liver fibrosis require further elucidation. To explore the effect of glycemic control on hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHB and T2DM. A total of 420 patients with CHB and T2DM admitted to the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu between October 2018 and January 2022 were retrospectively included and classified according to liver stiffness measurement and glycemic control for between-group comparisons. Significant differences were observed in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, AST/ALT ratio, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, diabetes treatment program, and thrombin time values among the liver fibrosis groups (adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.05). Significant differences in albumin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were observed among the groups categorized by glucose status at admission (adjusted <i>P</i> < 0.05). A positive correlation between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and liver stiffness measurement was found to be mediated by ALT and AST. Fibrinogen and the international normalized ratio were positively correlated with glycated hemoglobin A1c, while the fibrosis-4 score, ALT, AST/ALT ratio, type III procollagen N-terminal peptide, ferritin, and activated partial thromboplastin time were correlated with FPG at admission. Additionally, AST was positively correlated with FPG at discharge (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Specific glucose metabolic parameters, hypoglycemic agents, and glycemic control status markers are associated with hepatic fibrosis in patients with both CHB and T2DM. Close blood glucose monitoring, optimized use of hypoglycemic agents, and continuous maintenance of good glycemic control may slow the progression of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB and T2DM.",

We aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the gut microbiota-bile acid (BA) axis using ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) combined with the probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium</i> to treat chronic hepatitis B (CHB). BA profiles were characterized by mass spectrometry, and gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing in patients with CHB and healthy controls (HCs). The effects of UDCA and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> were assessed both in a preclinical model and in a 2-month clinical trial involving 22 patients with CHB who received either UDCA (250 mg twice daily; n = 6), <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (2 g twice daily; n = 6), or a combination of UDCA and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (n = 10). UDCA was the most significantly decreased serum BA in patients with CHB compared to HCs (<i>p <</i>0.001), and had the strongest anti-HBV effect <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In the gut, the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> abundance was the most dramatically decreased fecal genus in patients with CHB (<i>p =</i> 0.018), and had the anti-HBV effect <i>in vivo</i>. Finally, combined treatment with UDCA and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> significantly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (<i>p =</i> 0.008), HBV DNA (77% reduction; <i>p <</i>0.001), pregenomic RNA (59% reduction; <i>p <</i>0.001), and hepatitis B surface antigen (15% reduction; <i>p =</i> 0.002) levels. It also decreased NKG2A expression on natural killer (NK) cells and PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by approximately 50% (<i>p</i> <0.01), while enhancing secretion of granzyme B, perforin, and interferon-γ by CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells (<i>p</i> <0.05). These effects were superior to those achieved with either monotherapy. Combined treatment with UDCA and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> promotes CD8<sup>+</sup> T/NK cell function and viral control in patients withCHB and may represent a promising adjunct therapy warranting further investigation. Targeting the gut microbiota-bile acid axis has the potential to treat chronic hepatitis B. Results from preclinical models and a clinical trial show that combination treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid plus the probiotic <i>Bifidobacterium</i> exerts antiviral effects in patients with chronic hepatitis B by promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell and natural killer cell function.

Accurate prediction is crucial for timely intervention, particularly to reduce the risk of infection. To explore the predictive and prognostic value of the nutritional risk index (NRI) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cancer. Ninety-six patients with HBV-related primary liver cancer who underwent surgery at our hospital between May 2022 and May 2024 were included. Patients were classified into infection and non-infection groups, and the NRI was compared. The infection group was further divided into mild and severe infection groups and then into survival and deceased groups, and the NRI was compared. Postoperative follow-up lasted 6 months. The predictive value of NRI for surgical site infections (SSIs), severity of infections, and prognostic assessment was analyzed. Compared with patients with mild infection, those with severe infections had a significantly lower NRI (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Compared with patients with mild infections, those with severe infections had a significantly higher NRI (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The NRI was significantly lower in the good prognosis group than in the poor prognosis group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the areas under the curve for NRI in predicting SSIs, infection severity, and patient prognosis were 0.984, 0.986, and 0.949, respectively. The NRI can accurately predict postoperative SSIs in patients with HBV-related primary liver cancer and plays a role in predicting the severity of infections and in prognostic assessment.",

Herein, biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs), constructed from macrophage membrane (RM)-coated cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), are developed to concurrently scavenge multiple inflammatory mediators for AID management. Upon systemic administration, the NPs feature long blood circulation and targeted accumulation at the inflamed site. In the inflammatory microenvironment, RM with abundant cytokine receptors neutralizes varieties of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and CeO<sub>2</sub> with nuclease- and antioxidase-like activities scavenges multiple types of ROS. In addition, O<sub>2</sub> bubbles generated from CeO<sub>2</sub>-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition foster membrane shedding and subsequent CeO<sub>2</sub> exposure for effective cfDNA cleavage. Thus, the NPs effectively interrupt the inflammatory cycle and promote tissue repair in mouse models of AIDs including rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hepatitis.

These nonspecific symptoms can complicate diagnosis and subsequently delay the initiation of appropriate treatment. A 68-year-old female presented to our hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and jaundice. Laboratory tests and clinical symptoms are often nonspecific for this atypical presentation of secondary hepatic lymphoma, and imaging findings can be challenging to distinguish. Histopathological examination remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Due to severe thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, only low-dose prephase chemotherapy was administered along with supportive treatments, including platelet transfusion and coagulation factor supplementation. The patient was dead. No autopsy was performed, as the patient's family declined consent. Clinicians should maintain high vigilance for atypical presentations of lymphoma, especially when encountering unexplained cholestatic hepatitis and cytopenias, and promptly initiate diagnostic evaluations to avoid delays in treatment.

        "abstract": "Sexually transmitted infections are a global public health concern. We aimed to assess the burden of a diverse range of sexually transmitted infections in a high HIV burden setting in Eswatini and associated risk factors. This cross-sectional study enrolled adults accessing routine outpatient care at six sites in Shiselweni, from July 2022 to April 2023. Laboratory investigations included antibody-based tests for HIV, Treponema pallidum, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and herpes simplex 2 viruses. The molecular-based Xpert platform tested urine samples for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Trichomonas vaginalis, self-collected vaginal/anal swabs for Human papillomavirus, and plasma for HIV viremia. We calculated the proportion of laboratory-confirmed sexually transmitted infections among available test results and identified predictors of combined Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoea/Trichomonas vaginalis infection. Of 1396 study participants, 65.4% were women, the median age was 29 (IQR 23-36) years, and 19.6% were known HIV-positive. Overall, 68.6% had symptoms suggestive of Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoea/Trichomonas vaginalis infections. Laboratory-confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoea/Trichomonas vaginalis infection was found in 31.7% (n = 443/1396), of whom 20.8% were asymptomatic. Combined Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoea/Trichomonas vaginalis infections were common even among individuals with low risk of infection (e.g., no sexual intercourse: 20.7%) and were associated with young age, factory employment, and transactional sex. Prevalences for individual sexually transmitted infections were 16.9% (n = 236/1394) for Chlamydia trachomatis, 12.4% (n = 173/1394) for Neisseria gonorrhoea, 10.6% (n = 148/1390) for Trichomonas vaginalis, and 9.7% (n = 135) for Treponema pallidum. Viral infections were high for herpes simplex 2 viruses (n = 792/1279, 61.9%) and human papillomavirus (n = 166/324, 51.2%) and lower for hepatitis B virus (n = 55/1396, 3.9%) and hepatitis C virus (n = 3/1396, 0.2%). Of 1122 clients undergoing HIV testing, 4.1% (n = 46/1122) tested positive, with 21.7% (n = 10/46) being acute/early HIV infection. The substantial sexually transmitted infections burden highlights the urgent need to strengthen sexually transmitted infections service integration, expand access to affordable diagnostics, and target prevention in decentralised care. These findings support the development of context-adapted strategies to improve detection, treatment, and partner services in high-burden settings.",

These tsRNAs play a pivotal role in regulating cellular processes such as protein synthesis, translation, and gene expression networks. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the functional characteristics of 24 tsRNAs, highlighting significant changes in their expression profiles across various liver diseases. Notably, 13 tsRNAs are upregulated, while 4 are downregulated in liver diseases compared to healthy controls, providing new insights into their biological roles. A major focus of this review is the latest research on the involvement of tsRNAs in a range of liver diseases, including hepatitis B and C, alcoholic liver disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review explored how altered expression of tsRNAs in these conditions contributes to disease progression, along with the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Beyond their molecular roles, this review also examined the potential of tsRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for liver diseases. Due to their unique biological characteristics and functional versatility, tsRNAs hold promise as therapeutic targets in precision medicine. By highlighting their potential for developing more effective, targeted therapies, this review paves the way for future clinical applications of tsRNAs in liver disease treatment.",

        "abstract": "Bontia is a monotypic genus containing Bontia daphnoides which is known as olive bush. It was used traditionally for the treatment of herpes, cough, colds, inflammation, ulcers and wounds. Therefore, in this study the anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities of the leaves extract and fractions were measured in vitro. Also phytochemical investigation of the non-polar fractions was done to identify the compounds responsible for activity. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by measuring the inhibition of superoxide anion generation and elastase release in fMLF/CB-induced human neutrophils. The antiviral activity was measured against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and Hepatitis A virus (HAVH10). The dichloromethane fraction showed the most potent anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting superoxide anion generation and elastase release with IC<sub>50</sub> 5.21and 6.72 μg/mL, respectively. It showed antiviral activity with EC<sub>50</sub> of 332 and 290 μg/mL for HSV-1 and HAVH10, respectively. The total extract showed a promising antiviral activity with EC<sub>50</sub> of 214 and 190 μg/mL against HSV-1 and HAVH10, respectively. Phytochemical investigation of the n-hexane fraction of B. daphnoides resulted in the isolation of three oxygenated sesquiterpenes; dehydroepingaione (1), 10,11-dehydromyoporone (2) and the newly isolated compound; 1,2,15 trihydro-1,15-dimethoxy-2, 3-dihydroxy-dehydrongaione (3). Phytochemical investigation of dichloromethane fraction resulted in the isolation of new epimeric isomers 1R/1S-1-methoxy-1-hydro-15-oxodehydrongaione (4) and (5). From the results, it was concluded that nonpolar fractions of B. daphnoides could exhibit anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, probably owing to the major oxygenated sesquiterpenes.",

The risk of RVF virus (RVFV) emergence in new regions and the effectiveness of a strategy for preventing establishment are impacted by how infection persists at local scales. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for its persistence in regions prone to epidemics, including maintenance via transovarial transmission (TOT) but whether and how TOT can support local persistence is not well understood. Through the development of host- and multi-vector climate-driven simulation models to recreate observed patterns of prevalence and outbreak frequency, we show that TOT has the potential to play an important role in local persistence through seasonal cold or dry periods. Local persistence required annual low-level transmission of RVFV concurrently with substantial TOT, whereas the infrequent large outbreaks hampered long-term persistence in our simulations. We show that under this mode of local persistence, large outbreaks can be prevented with low-level vaccination, but that the long-term local persistence can only be interrupted with many years of sustained vaccination. Determining the role of TOT in persistence is critical for designing countermeasures to prevent establishment after emergence.",

Next, we conducted a prospective study where CWB samples were collected from a cohort of 109 adult subjects at a safety-net hospital and tested for HCV RNA using the Xpert® HCV test on the GeneXpert® Xpress system and the cobas® HCV platform. We consistently obtained 250 μl CWB which was stable for up to 5 hours in the microtainer. Laboratory LoD studies demonstrated that the Xpert® HCV test could detect most HCV genotypes to <100 IU/ml in CWB. In the prospective clinical study, 89 subjects (82%) with valid Xpert® and cobas® HCV comparator results were analyzed.

This study aimed to determine the risk of HCC in AIH patients and associated risk factors, focusing on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We analyzed the claims data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2007 to 2020. The study included 7,382 patients with AIH and a control group of 58,538 age- and sex-matched individuals, at a ratio of 1:8. We compared the incidence rates of HCC between these groups and investigated the risk factors of HCC. During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 160 AIH patients were diagnosed with HCC, resulting in an incidence rate of 3.60 per 1,000 person-years. The matched controls exhibited an incidence rate of 0.48 per 1,000 person-years. After adjustment, AIH patients had a 4.85-fold heightened risk of HCC compared to the control group. Within the AIH cohort, the presence of coexisting MASLD further elevated the risk of HCC, along with other factors such as older age, male sex, and decompensated liver cirrhosis, as observed in a two-year landmark analysis. The presence of concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune diseases did not affect the prognosis, while glucocorticoid treatment was associated with a decreased risk of HCC. Patients with AIH had an increased risk of HCC compared to matched controls, particularly those with coexisting MASLD. In addition to appropriate medical treatment, proactive interventions and lifestyle modifications for concurrent MASLD are recommended for these patients.",

        "title": "When HEV Infection Meets Organ Transplantation.",
        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a single-stranded RNA virus, is a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. In recent years, the incidence of hepatitis E has increased significantly, making it a major public health concern globally. Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, who require long-term immunosuppressive therapy to prevent graft rejection, are particularly vulnerable to HEV infection because of their immunocompromised state. This population faces a heightened risk of developing chronic hepatitis E, which can progress to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the monitoring of solid organ transplant recipients in clinical practice, to elucidate the associated risk factors further, and implement stringent diagnostic and preventive measures. Building on previous research, this paper comprehensively reviews the virological characteristics of HEV and the epidemiological features, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic strategies for HEV infection in solid organ transplant recipients. The aim is to provide valuable insights for effectively managing, treating, and preventing HEV infection in this high-risk population.",

        "abstract": "In nonendemic areas, transplantation from donors with hepatitis B virus (HBV) to recipients without HBV (D+/R-) has been proposed to expand the donor pool; however, data are limited. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiology of HBV in thoracic organ donors, assess HBV-related thoracic organ nonuse, and determine the impact of HBV D+/R- in recipient outcomes. Adult first-time heart and lung transplant recipients with negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV nucleic acid testing (NAT) were identified through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network between January 2004 and December 2022. Multivariable Cox regression models were built to assess the relationship of donor HBV status with death and graft failure. Our final cohort included 64,514 thoracic organ transplant recipients, 53 HBV D+/R- (0.1%) versus 64,461 (99.9%) HBV D-/R-, including 34,547 (53.5%) heart and 29,967 lung (46.5%) transplants. Donors with positive HBsAg or HBV NAT tests represented 0.31% of the donor pool. There were no reported cases of thoracic organ nonuse due to hepatitis, nor were there differences in the rates of HBV-NAT or HBsAg positivity in used versus nonused thoracic organs. In multivariable modeling, HBV D+/R- was not associated with increased hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 0.80 [95% CI, 0.30-2.13], p = 0.652) or graft failure (aHR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.27-1.93], p = 0.522) at 1-year. HBV D+/R- thoracic organ transplantation does not appear to have a deleterious impact on recipient or graft survival. However, more data are needed to determine the long-term risk of donor-derived HBV infection and define the optimal management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Telemedicine is a promising approach to reach people with limited access to treatment for hepatitis C. People who use drugs (PWUD) and are disengaged from services, however, experience barriers to telemedicine access. The Oregon HOPE TeleHCV study employed peer support specialists to provide outreach to engage PWUD, support pretreatment screening, facilitate telemedicine Hepatitis C virus visits, and assist HCV medication initiation and adherence. In our randomized controlled trial (N =203), the model demonstrated substantially higher HCV treatment initiation and cure compared with enhanced usual care. Our qualitative investigation examined the role of peers from the perspective of patients. We conducted semistructured phone interviews with 34 patients to better understand the influence of peer interactions on patient experiences and the role of peer support in shaping patient outcomes. The domains of interest were to better understand (1) the influence of peer interactions on patient experiences and (2) the role of peer support in shaping patient outcomes. Interviews were recorded, professionally transcribed and analyzed using Thematic Analysis. We identified 3 major themes regarding the role of peers in the model: (1) peers' lived experience and ways of engaging with patients create an alliance with patients, (2) peers serve as a communication bridge with the health care system, and (3) peers facilitate access to resources and support. Peers were key to the success of the model. Expansion of the Oregon HOPE TeleHCV model of using peer support specialists to engage, retain, and support PWUD could galvanize efforts to eliminate HCV.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a leading cause of chronic viral hepatitis, particularly in Asia. Vertical transmission during pregnancy is a key contributor to chronic HBV prevalence, and maternal screening with HBV DNA quantification enables the identification of high-risk cases. Antiviral therapy is recommended for pregnant women with HBV DNA levels >200,000 IU/mL to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of high maternal viral load in chronic HBV, assess the initiation of antiviral therapy, and evaluate hepatic flares following treatment cessation postpartum. Methods We conducted a retrospective audit of pregnant women with chronic HBV infection referred to a gastroenterology specialist clinic in Singapore from August 2015 to December 2022. Data were collected from electronic medical records. The audit was approved by the institutional board. Results Data from 112 patients were analysed. The mean age was 34.6 years (standard deviation (SD) ± 4.4). A total of 25.9% had HBV DNA levels >200,000 IU/mL, with a mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 31.1 U/L, compared to 19.5 U/L in those with lower viral loads. Among high viral load patients, 89.7% (n=26) were started on antiviral therapy; 3 declined treatment. Two patients with a lower viral load but elevated ALT were also treated. Mean gestational age at delivery was 37.7 weeks (SD ± 2.3). Postpartum follow-up revealed 10 cases of hepatitis flare. Eight patients agreed to the re-initiation of treatment. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion A significant proportion of pregnant women with chronic HBV had high viral loads, necessitating treatment. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was safe and well-tolerated. Postpartum monitoring is essential due to the risk of hepatic flares following treatment cessation.",

        "title": "The Perinatal Committee report: Review of the progress of obstetric healthcare in Japan.",
        "abstract": "Japan's maternal mortality rate and perinatal mortality rate have shown one of the world's most significant declines, positioning Japan at the global forefront of the lowest levels. The nearly logarithmic annual decline in maternal and perinatal mortality rates suggests that, in addition to advances in medicine and healthcare, various types of care for mothers and newborns have played a crucial role in this achievement. From the period of World War II to the postwar era, up to around 1980, and then every decade thereafter, the events and movements surrounding perinatal healthcare in each era were examined from the perspectives of epidemiology, medical/healthcare advancements, and institutional/policy trends. The major events in each era are outlined as follows: Until around 1980: After World War II, in 1948, several laws were enacted to protect mothers and fetuses, including the Maternal and Child Health Handbook, in 1966. The number of births experienced a baby boom for about 10 years following 1945, peaking in 1973. Birthplaces shifted from home deliveries to medical facilities, with doctors becoming the primary birth attendants. Academically, the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) for Maternal Protection and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) were established in 1949. In the medical field, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were introduced and neonatal transport systems became well-established by the 1970s. In 1976, the limit of viability was revised from under 28 weeks of gestation to under 24 weeks. The late 1970s saw the fetal heart rate monitoring, the heartbeat detection using Doppler ultrasound and the ultrasound imaging techniques. 1980s: The perinatal medicine became well established, leading to hold The Japan Society of Perinatal Medicine. For fetal management, the fields of fetal diagnosis and fetal treatment entered their early stages with the widespread use of fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound imaging. In neonatal care, neonatal transport systems to NICU facilities were enhanced. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery and widespread use of pulmonary surfactant. Two key concepts that emerged and advanced during this period were maternal transport systems and the Perinatal Maternal and Child Center initiative. In 1987, cases of hepatitis caused by non-heat-treated coagulation products became a major issue. As a result, informed consent affecting mothers and fetuses became a significant point of discussion. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist system was introduced, along with the regular publication of Training Notes for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Glossary of Obstetrics and Gynecology Terms. As a result of these efforts, both the perinatal mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate were reduced by approximately half over the course of 10 years. 1990s: In 1991, the limit of viability was revised to 22 weeks of gestation. In terms of maternal care, nutritional management guidelines for general pregnant women were introduced. In fetal medicine, major topics included the administration of steroids to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation, as well as direct fetal treatments such as shunt procedures and needle aspirations. In neonatal care, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment became more widely adopted. Following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, in 1995, led to the development of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the establishment of Perinatal Maternal and Child Medical Center. In 1996, the Maternal Protection Law was enacted, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC) was founded to standardize medical care. Asia & Oceania Federation of Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal and Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research were launched as English-language academic journals. 2000s: Japan's perinatal mortality rate became the lowest in the world, but the maternal mortality rate was still struggling. Obstetric care changed significantly after an obstetrician was arrested for causing a maternal death during a cesarean section. The JSOG and the JAOG developed practice guidelines describing standard obstetric diagnosis and treatments, and the JCQHC established the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy. In addition, a project to report on maternal deaths by JAOG was also launched, and the combination of these measures led to form a framework of professional autonomy for obstetricians. During this period, brain hypothermic therapy for brain injury was developed. 2010s: The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 led to major changes in disaster medical planning. This included the introduction of training programs for disaster medical coordinators and the development of disaster-time pediatric and perinatal liaisons. To enhance medical safety, JAOG launched an incidental case reporting system in 2004. Additionally, in 2010, a maternal mortality reporting system was introduced, followed by the maternal severe complications reporting system in 2021. The Japan Council for Implementation of Maternal Emergency Life-Saving System was established, along with the Japan Association for Labor Analgesia, a collaborative council for academic societies and organizations related to painless delivery. Suicide as a significant cause of maternal death led to the establishment of the \"Mother and Child Mental Forum\" academic conference, which later evolved into the Mental Health Care for Mother & Child training program. In the field of prenatal testing, non-invasive prenatal testing was introduced as a clinical research initiative. From 2020 onward: The year 2020 began with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Until 2023, numerous issues arose due to repeated pandemics, including delivery methods and locations for COVID-positive pregnant women, standard precautions during labor, mother-infant separation after birth, vaccination, so on. JSOG and JAOG worked together to address these challenges. The most pressing issue in the perinatal field is the declining birth rate. Alongside an aging workforce of physicians and a shortage of successors, the decrease in new obstetric clinic openings has become a major concern. By 2024, the decrease in the number of full-time obstetricians and the overtime work limits in Medical Care Act are making it necessary to reconsider the structure of obstetric medical services. Japan's perinatal care system, which has maintained the highest global standards, now stands at a major crossroads. Researchers (clinicians), academic societies, and professional organizations, centered on the mother and child, have collaborated with support from the government, making progress and building the current safe pregnancy and childbirth management system. However, significant issues remain that need urgent attention, including regulations on overtime work, securing obstetrician numbers, the rapid decline in childbirth facilities, and the functional collapse of perinatal maternal-child healthcare centers. These are critical challenges that must be addressed promptly.",

        "abstract": "Part 2 of the DORA study, an international clinical trial evaluating glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (G/P) treatment in children aged 3-11 years with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, demonstrated high efficacy and safety. However, there is limited evidence regarding real-world use of G/P in this pediatric population. This prospective multicenter study in Japan evaluated the real-world efficacy and safety of G/P treatment in children aged 3-11 years with chronic HCV. Children aged 3-11 years with chronic HCV were prospectively enrolled and received a once-daily dose of G/P for either 8 or 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12). Safety was assessed through adverse events, laboratory tests, and growth measurements. A total of 18 children (8 girls) from 9 pediatric centers in Japan were enrolled, with a median age of 9 years (range, 3-11). Genotype distribution was as follows: 1b (n = 3), 2a (n = 8), 2b (n = 5), 3a (n = 1), and unknown of Serotype 2 (n = 1). All participants were treatment-naïve and completed G/P treatment (17 for 8 weeks, 1 for 12 weeks). SVR12 was achieved in 17 patients (94%). Most adverse events were mild, with no serious events. Treatment led to significant reductions in serum alanine aminotransferase and Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2 binding protein levels. No impairments in growth were observed. In real-world clinical practice, G/P treatment demonstrated high efficacy and good tolerability in children aged 3-11 years with chronic HCV.",

In this study, we report a case with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), which has a heterozygous variant in the <i>IRF2BP2</i> gene. <b><i>Case Presentation:</i></b> A 13-year-old girl was evaluated for immunodeficiency due to recurrent sinusitis and tonsillitis in the previous year. She had been suffering from chronic cough for 3 months. She was hospitalized with lobar pneumonia and bronchiectasis. She was the second child of consanguineous parents. On physical examination, there was no growth and development retardation. Immunological screening of the patient demonstrated panhypogammaglobulinemia with low total memory B and class-switching memory B cells. Specific antibody responses to rubella and hepatitis B were negative. T- and B-lymphocyte counts and T-cell responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were normal. Exome sequencing identified a heterozygous variant in <i>IRF2BP2</i> (c.112C>Tp.Arg38Cys). On follow-up, she has maintained a good infection control with antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> To the best of our knowledge, this case is the youngest CVID who was diagnosed with <i>IRF2BP2</i> in the literature. The low percentage of total memory and switched memory B cells in the proband suggested that <i>IRF2BP2</i> might have had a role in the development or survival of memory B cells.

        "abstract": "We are interested in how patients with hepatitis B progress to liver cirrhosis (an intermediate outcome) and liver cancer (a primary outcome). The separable effect has recently been proposed to study causal effects in the setting of competing risks. In this work, we extend the separable effect approach to semicompeting risks involving a primary and intermediate outcome. We decompose the exposure to hepatitis B virus into two disjoint components: the first component affects liver cancer directly, that is, direct effect, and the other affects liver cancer through liver cirrhosis, that is, indirect effect. Under such an effect separation, the identification formula of counterfactual risk for liver cancer that we derive for semicompeting risks is a function of cause-specific hazards and transition hazards of multistate models. It can be reduced to the formula for competing risks as a special case. We propose nonparametric and semiparametric methods to estimate the causal effects and study their asymptotic properties. The model-free nonparametric method is robust but less efficient for confounder adjustment; the model-based semiparametric method flexibly accommodates confounders by treating them as covariates. We conduct comprehensive simulations to study the performance of the proposed methods. Our data analyses of the hepatitis study show that there exist both direct and indirect effects of hepatitis B infection on the incidence of liver cancer through liver cirrhosis.",

In order to design a navigation program specific for HCC patients, the aims of this study were 3-fold: (1) to identify the needs of HCC patients, (2) to identify barriers to the successful treatment of HCC, and (3) to identify specific supports needed for the successful treatment of HCC. In-depth qualitative interviews, lasting 60-90 minutes, were conducted with 42 individuals, including 14 patients, 7 caregivers, 8 advocates, 2 research coordinators, and 11 providers. The specialty of the provider participants included Hepatology, Transplant Surgery, Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, and Interventional Radiology. Advanced practice providers, social workers, and nurse navigators were also included. Patients, caregivers, and providers were recruited from 2 healthcare systems in South Florida. Advocates were recruited through collaboration with the Global Liver Institute and the Hepatitis B Foundation. The interviews identified 5 overarching themes representing the navigation needs of HCC patients: (1) Education/Health Literacy, (2) Financial Resources, (3) Coordination of Care, (4) Emotional/Mental Health Management, and (5) Social Support. These overarching themes were composed of various subthemes, which further delineated the specific needs that patients and caregivers have in the context of their HCC treatment. This study provides valuable insight into the needs of patients with HCC and their caregivers. Key stakeholders in the field of HCC provided valuable insights into the multidimensional needs of patients with HCC, identifying areas to target with high-quality interventions. To best meet the treatment needs of patients with HCC, successful navigation should include interventions targeted at addressing each of these areas of need.",

The \"treat for all\" strategy, although debated, was partially endorsed by the Indian National Association for the Study of the Liver (INASL). Pegylated interferon (Peg IFN) was not widely recommended due to limited practice, and genotype testing was avoided. Hepatitis D was not considered a prevalent condition; thus, testing for it was not emphasized. Special conditions, including immunosuppression and steroid therapy, were also discussed, and INASL provided comprehensive guidelines to address these unique scenarios in HBV management. High-resistance-barrier drugs like tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) were highlighted for their effectiveness and safety, particularly in pregnant women.

        "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a significant health concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Some CHB patients with normal or mildly elevated ALT may have advanced liver fibrosis, which often goes undetected. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of significant fibrosis and the diagnostic accuracy of serum markers in CHB patients with ALT <2× ULN in Vietnam. A cross-sectional study was conducted at 175 Military Hospital between October 2019 and December 2021. A total of 144 CHB patients with ALT <2× ULN were assessed for liver fibrosis using FibroScan (METAVIR criteria). The diagnostic accuracy of APRI and FIB-4 was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Among 144 participants, 26.4% exhibited advanced fibrosis (F≥2), including 9% with cirrhosis. Advanced fibrosis correlated with older age (50 vs. 42 years, p=0.012), male sex (p=0.024), higher AST, ALT, and GGT levels (p<0.05), and lower platelet counts (PLT) (p<0.001). APRI and PLT demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.802 and 0.805, respectively). APRI achieved 84.2% sensitivity and 92.5%, negative predictive value (NPV), while PLT had the highest specificity (81.1%). FIB-4 (AUC=0.716), ALT (AUC=0.676), and prothrombin time (PT) (AUC=0.646), had moderate performance. Combining APRI and PLT significantly improved diagnostic accuracy (p<0.05). Significant fibrosis was present in 26.4% of CHB patients with normal or mildly elevated ALT levels. APRI and PLT are reliable and cost-effective to detect early fibrosis in re-source-limited settings. These findings underscore the need to revise Vietnam's CHB management strategies for earlier fibrosis diagnosis and treatment.",

        "title": "Hypercalcemia as an Immune-Related Adverse Event in a Patient Receiving Nivolumab and Ipilimumab for Metastatic Melanoma: A Case Report.",
        "abstract": "Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a well-known phenomenon in cancer patients, often associated with poor prognosis. The discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionised cancer therapy by improving prognosis in numerous different cancer types. Unfortunately, immune-related adverse events frequently arise, particularly with dual checkpoint inhibition. We present a case of severe hypercalcemia in a 65-year-old woman undergoing treatment for metastasised malignant melanoma. Eleven weeks after initiating ipilimumab-nivolumab, the patient developed severe hypercalcemia, along with inflammation and hepatitis. This was initially presumed to be due to hypercalcemia of malignancy, given the clinical examination, imaging findings and laboratory values potentially consistent with progressive disease. The hypercalcemia responded well to bisphosphonates, intravenous saline and methylprednisolone. Interestingly, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) performed shortly after hospital discharge showed a complete metabolic remission, thereby making hypercalcemia of malignancy unlikely. Review of her medical history, imaging and laboratory revealed several features consistent with a sarcoid-like reaction. We hypothesise that this reaction led to elevated 1-alpha hydroxylase, thereby facilitating calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia. In this report, we summarise previously published case reports on immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced hypercalcemia and discuss the various mechanisms that cause hypercalcemia in this rare immune-related adverse event. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can induce production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), calcitriol, and may cause hypocortisolaemia, all of which can disrupt calcium homeostasis. Through this case, we contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding hypercalcemia as an immune-related adverse event and aim to raise awareness among clinicians of this potential complication. Early recognition is critical for this life-threatening condition, as it can be refractory to conventional therapies and may necessitate corticosteroid therapy.",

        "abstract": "Several studies have assessed the short-term effectiveness and safety of obeticholic acid (OCA) in the real-world setting. We aimed to extend knowledge on the real-world effectiveness and safety of OCA treatment by expanding sample size and follow-up, and by exploring changes in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) over time. The RECAPITULATE project involves centres belonging to the \"Italian PBC registry\" and/or the \"Club Epatologi Ospedalieri\" PBC working group. Effectiveness was evaluated as biochemical response according to POISE and normal range (NR) criteria (normal alkaline phosphatase/alanine aminotransferase/bilirubin). Safety was assessed as the incidence of <i>de novo</i>/worsening pruritus and discontinuation rate/causes. Available LSMs were also captured. We included 747 patients from 66 Italian centres: mean age 58 years; female/male 88%/14%; median follow-up 24 months [IQR 12-42]; 28% with cirrhosis, and 14% with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)/PBC overlap syndrome. Probabilities of POISE and NR response increased from baseline to 57% and 20%, respectively, by the 42<sup>nd</sup> month. The probabilities of response were lower in patients with cirrhosis (<i>p =</i> 0.02 and <i>p =</i> 0.004 for POISE and NR), but not different between patients with AIH/PBC and pure PBC (<i>p =</i> 0.8). Overall, 130 patients (17%) discontinued treatment, mainly due to pruritus (36.9%), while 28.5% did so after developing hepatic events. The discontinuation rate was higher in patients with cirrhosis (<i>p <</i>0.001). LSM was available in 573 patients (∼77%), of whom 255 had multiple measurements. LSM variation over time differed based on the attainment of POISE biochemical response (expected mean annual variation -0.48 [-0.78, -0.19] in responders <i>vs</i>. +0.33 [-0.07, 0.73] in non-responders, respectively, <i>p</i> <0.001). Our findings confirm the effectiveness and safety profiles of OCA in the medium/long term and demonstrate that biochemical response is associated with the change in LSM over time. After the conditional approval of OCA for the treatment of PBC, the main confirmatory study failed to demonstrate OCA's ability to reduce liver-related events, leading the EMA to revoke the drug's marketing authorization. The ensuing scientific debate highlights an urgent need for further evidence from real-world practice. In the largest real-world series of patients treated with OCA to date, we confirm that the drug's effectiveness and safety profiles are maintained over a medium-to-long follow-up period. Valuable data for the management of the drug in relevant subgroups of patients, such as those with cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis/PBC overlap syndrome, are also provided. Our original results on liver stiffness measurement variation over time suggest a favourable impact of OCA on fibrosis progression, particularly in patients achieving a biochemical response to the drug. Overall, these data provide important insights for clinicians managing patients with PBC and contribute to the ongoing scientific debate about the effectiveness/safety profile of this drug.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the duration of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) level maintenance and characterize the corresponding IgG-H CDR3 repertoire in volunteers exhibiting either ultra-high or extremely low HBsAb levels following hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. This study was designed to monitor the longitudinal changes in HBsAb levels at multiple time points post-vaccination in healthy volunteers exhibiting either ultra-high or extremely low antibody responses following HBV vaccination. Furthermore, we employed high-throughput sequencing technology to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the compositional differences in the IgG-H CDR3 repertoire. Peripheral blood samples were collected at four distinct phases: pre-vaccination, post-second vaccination, post-third vaccination, and during the follow-up period, to characterize the dynamic changes in the antibody repertoire. The longitudinal analysis revealed distinct patterns in antibody response kinetics between the two groups. In the ultra-high responder cohort, a peak HBsAb level (25,354 ± 17,993 mIU/mL) was observed following the second vaccine dose. This was followed by a gradual decline, with mean levels stabilizing at 11,356 ± 9,098 mIU/mL post-third dose and 4,229 ± 2,694 mIU/mL at the 4-year follow-up. The ultra-high hepatitis B surface antibody level group (Group H) exhibited a decrease in IgG-H CDR3 diversity after the second vaccination, followed by an increase after the third vaccination. Compared to the extremely low hepatitis B surface antibody level group (Group L), Group H showed higher characteristic immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region V gene (<i>IGHV</i>) usage frequencies in the CDR3 repertoire after both vaccinations than before vaccination. Additionally, the average mutation rate of the IgG-H CDR3 repertoire in Group H was slightly higher than that in Group L after the third vaccination. Notably, multiple samples from Group H revealed common conserved CDR3 region motifs associated with HBV, as reported in the literature: \"YGLDV\", \"DAFD\", \"YGSGS\", \"GAFDI\", and \"NWFDP\". The prolonged maintenance of ultra-high antibody levels induced by recombinant HBV vaccines in individuals may be closely related to the characteristic <i>IGHV</i> usage and mutation frequency in individual responses. These findings could provide novel insights into the complex mechanisms of HBV vaccines and HBV infection.",

Although mixed cryoglobulinemia, typically associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is well-documented in other autoimmune diseases, its coexistence with BD is exceedingly rare. This report details the case of a 56-year-old male presenting with BD complicated by HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia, manifesting as retinal vasculitis, purpuric skin lesions, and systemic vasculitis. Despite initial corticosteroid treatment, the patient required escalated therapy, including immunosuppressants and antiviral agents, to achieve disease stability. This case underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach in managing BD with secondary cryoglobulinemia and highlights the complex interplay between autoimmune and viral-induced vasculitis.

        "abstract": "Despite the successful implementation of prophylactic vaccines, hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to affect over 350 million individuals globally. It remains a predominant etiology of end-stage liver pathologies, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) therapies effectively suppress viral replication, functional cure is achieved in less than 1% of patients annually. Given that viral clearance fundamentally requires reconstitution of antiviral immunity, emerging therapeutic paradigms necessitate combinatorial strategies integrating direct-acting antiviral agents with immunomodulatory interventions. Substantial research efforts have been directed toward elucidating the immunological mechanisms underlying HBV persistence during chronic infection. This review systematically summarizes the functional impairment of innate immune populations and unconventional T cell subsets across distinct clinical phases of chronic HBV infection, and characterizes longitudinal immune reconstitution patterns following antiviral treatments. Our review identifies potential immunological biomarkers and provides a mechanistic framework for developing targeted immunotherapies to achieve durable HBV control.",

        "abstract": "Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are one of the mainstays of treatment for chronic hepatitis B, but their effects on bone density are highly controversial. In this study, four pharmacovigilance analysis methods and Bonferroni-corrected <i>p</i>-values were used to analyze the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database to investigate the relationship between adefovir and tenofovir and osteoporosine-related adverse events. In addition, the biological pathways and target proteins were studied by network toxicology and molecular docking techniques. Adefovir showed signs of adverse skeletal events at the two PT levels of OSTEOPOROSIS and BONE DENSITY DECREASED, while tenofovir showed signs of adverse skeletal events at the five PT levels of BONE DENSITY DECREASED, BONE LOSS, OSTEOPENIA, OSTEOPOROSIS and OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURE. Furthermore, at the overall SMQ level, positive signals of adverse skeletal events were also valid. Subgroup analysis showed that adefovir was more likely to cause osteoporosis in the elderly and women, while tenofovir exhibited the opposite trend. Furthermore, GO and KEGG analyses indicated that both drugs may jointly promote osteoporosis through pathways such as cell migration, G protein-coupled receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Molecular docking technology further reveals that the two drugs can produce pathological effects by binding to osteoporosis-related genes such as ADORA1 and JAK1. This study comprehensively reported the risk and mechanisms of osteoporosis caused by the clinical use of NAs drugs, and provided more detailed recommendations for clinical improvement and prevention of adverse events.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate and compare the biochemical efficacy and safety profiles of MMF and AZA in the treatment of AIH. This review systematically examined the available literature from the inception of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to November 2024. The primary outcomes of interest included the evaluation of biochemical remission (BR), the effectiveness of MMF in patients who were non-responsive (AZA-NR) or intolerant to azathioprine (AZA-IT), and the assessment of adverse events (AEs) and overall survival. This meta-analysis evaluated 11 studies comprising 952 participants, with 57.45% receiving MMF and the remaining receiving AZA. The findings indicate that MMF demonstrated a significantly higher BR rate (88.57%) than AZA (53.64%). The pooled analysis revealed a substantial improvement in the BR rate with MMF compared to AZA (odds ratio (OR): 7.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.21 - 27.69). Furthermore, the estimated enhancement in treatment efficacy with MMF was 61% (95% CI: 42.63 - 78.04) among AZA-NR patients and 61.73% (95% CI: 54.88 - 68.35) in AZA-IT patients.

With the rapid development of molecular biology technology, many new markers have been identified and developed in cancer screening tests in recent years. This article reviews the development of novel liquid biopsy-based markers in cancer screening, including methylation, hydroxymethylation, mutation, copy number variation, and microRNA (miRNA), with specific focuses on clinical trials and studies from approved cancer screening assays or tests under development in China. Studies on screening of lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, and multiple cancers (pan-cancer screening) are reviewed and summarized. Liquid biopsy techniques detecting novel markers show great potential in the early screening of cancers, but still face challenges in sensitivity, specificity, productization, standardization, and cost-effectiveness. The emerging pan-cancer screening represents a direction of high-throughput and multiple cancer simultaneous screening, while it still needs optimization in detection performance and organ-specific recognition. Multi-omics integration analysis, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis, and large-scale prospective clinical studies will become important development steps in this field. Through a systematic review of the relevant literature, this paper describes in detail the development of new liquid biopsy technology, new progress in the field of cancer early screening, clinical application status, and future research direction. The review provides some useful insights into the future selection of early screening technology, the formulation of clinical research or trial protocols, and the balance between performance and cost.",

        "abstract": "Metastatic liver tumors (MLTs) are the most common type of malignant liver tumors, primarily because the liver is a frequent target organ for metastasis. Metastatic cancer is generally considered a systemic disease, so the mainstay of treatment should be systemic therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. Currently, it is believed that a multimodal approach, combining local and systemic treatments, can improve tumor control and potentially prolong patient survival. Local treatments, in addition to surgery, include ablation therapy as one of the options. Ablation therapy has its limitations and advantages for local tumor control but can also be combined with other locoregional treatments such as surgical resection, transarterial embolization, and stereotactic body radiotherapy to manage appropriate subsets of patients. Ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma has been performed for many years. In recent years, the number of MLTs cases treated with ablation has been increasing. However, the characteristics of primary liver tumors and MLTs, as well as their responses to ablation therapy, are distinct. At present, there is no established international guideline specifically for the ablation treatment of MLTs. The consensus guidelines developed by the Taiwan Academy of Tumor Ablation (TATA) represent evidence-based medical statements. These guidelines are created and reviewed by an expert team including hepatologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and intervention radiologists through comprehensive medical literature searches, discussions, and voting. The process adheres to evidence-based standards, such as evaluating levels of evidence and grading recommendations. Furthermore, the guidelines are finalized through thorough discussions among all experts and by calculating voting consistency. In cases where clinical evidence is unclear or lacking, expert opinions are also incorporated. Additionally, the guidelines provide recommendations on the future development of ablation therapy for MLTs.",

This combined panel demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to AFP alone (AUC: 0.924 vs. 0.794; <i>p</i> < 0.001) in distinguishing HCC patients in the testing and validation set, highlighting its potential as a promising minimally invasive screening method for HCC.",

        "abstract": "The association of dermatomyositis (DM) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is rare and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We describe the case of a 36-year-old man with DM diagnosed in 2012 and treated with corticosteroid and methotrexate. The patient achieved total remission 18 months later. In 2022, an AIH was diagnosed (cytolysis, cholestasis, anti-LC1, and anti-SLA antibodies) while DM was in remission. Liver function normalized after two months of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. Liver damage in systemic autoimmune diseases can result from viral, iatrogenic, or autoimmune processes. The association between DM and AIH is exceptional and has only been documented in one previous observation. Autoantibodies are essential for diagnosing and managing patients with inflammatory myopathy and AIH. In conclusion, this exceptional association of AIH and DM raises many questions regarding the presence of etiopathogenic links, such as genetic predisposition, autoimmunity disorders, viral infection triggers, or simply a happenstance.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a lethal virus that results in the loss of two lives every minute, induces chronic and acute infections. Chronic infections may result in liver cirrhosis, which in turn may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study analysed 1,06,970 protein sequences of HBV genotypes (<i>Gen A</i> to <i>H</i>) from the HBV database (HBVdb) to construct position-specific scoring matrices. A total of 5,058 mutations were detected across all proteins, reflecting the notorious mutability of HBV. Among these, 2,658 significant mutations (sigmuts) with frequencies ranging between 10 and 80 were screened. <i>Gen A</i> presented the greatest number of sigmuts, whereas <i>Gen H</i> presented the least. <i>Gen C</i>, the most common HBV gene, featured 417 sigmuts, which we used for structural studies using DynaMut2 and molecular docking. We found that most core protein signatures significantly impact functions, including B-cell receptor binding and dimerisation. Interestingly, most sigmuts of the RNase H domain (694-843) of polymerase proteins promoted structural disorder, with possible impact on interactions with LINE-1 elements and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. Intriguingly, despite the use of prominent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for over two decades, the drug-binding pockets of polymerase proteins have been found to be highly conserved. Nevertheless, since the long-term use of a few drugs as monotherapies has resulted in the development of drug resistance in recent years, we propose novel HBV targets for alternative therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Cephalosporins are widely prescribed antibiotics due to their efficacy and safety. Although rare, idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has been reported with their use. Here, we characterise the clinical features and HLA associations of cephalosporin-related liver injury. Between Jan 1, 2004, and Nov 2, 2022, a total of 2347 cases of DILI were enrolled in the DILIN study, of which 1854 were adjudicated as probable, highly likely, or definite. HLA sequencing was performed, and association with the risk of DILI was examined. 58 cases (3%) were attributed to different cephalosporins, including cefazolin (n = 40), cephalexin (n = 4), ceftriaxone (n = 3), cefdinir (n = 3), cefuroxime (n = 3), and five other individual agents. Clinical features included a self-limited course with a mixed or cholestatic biochemical pattern without hypersensitivity features occuring in 1 to 4 weeks. Most striking was the phenotype of cefazolin and other parenteral cephalosporins given as a single dose with the onset of jaundice, fatigue, and itching 1 to 3 weeks later. In the total cohort, HLA-A*02:01 was significantly associated with an increased risk of cephalosporin-induced liver injury (OR: ~2.5-2.7, P < 0.0001). The association was strongest with cefazolin, with carrier frequencies of 85% vs. 38% in those with DILI from other drugs. Cephalosporins can cause self-limited, mixed/cholestatic hepatitis that arises after a short course of therapy with a latency of up to 3 weeks with cefazolin. Cephalosporin-induced liver injury is associated with the HLA-A*02:01 allele, which is linked to more severe liver injury at the onset of illness.",

A total of 840 treatment-naïve HBeAg-positive CHB patients from two medical centres were included. Cox regression analysis was used to analyze factors associated with HBeAg clearance and seroconversion. Eighty-six patients (10.2%) had coexisting HBeAg/anti-HBe.

        "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological ailment characterized via specific clinical and molecular heterogeneous disorders. It is associated with poor long-term survival, even with new chemotherapy regimens. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) is a membrane protein expressed in various kinds of immune cells. Recent studies reported that higher TIM-3 expression levels correlate with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis in several solid tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of TIM-3 as a specific marker of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed AML, and its possible role as a prognostic biomarker. The expression levels of TIM-3 were assessed in the bone marrow aspirate (BMA) of 32 newly diagnosed pediatric AML cases and 10 control subjects by flow cytometry on (CD34+/CD38+) fraction, as well as on (CD34+/CD38-) fraction, at the time of diagnosis and at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy (first induction). These expression levels in patients were then correlated with clinical outcome. TIM-3 expression levels were significantly higher in pediatric AML patients on LSCs (CD34+/CD38-) and leukemic progenitors (CD34+/CD38+) fractions compared to the control group (p-value < 0.001). TIM-3 expression levels on LSCs (CD34+/CD38-) fraction were associated with a higher mortality risk and short survival. In conclusion, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) may serve as LSCs specific biomarker for poor prognosis in pediatric AML patients.",

We established the WACCBIP long-term HIV Infection Cohort (WHICH Study) to investigate the dynamics of HIV epidemic in Ghana. This report evaluates viral load dynamics, immune responses, and organ-level metabolic changes following antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. We collected blood samples, medical, and demographic data from ART-naïve individuals at baseline and six months post-ART, and from ART-experienced individuals at a single time point. Participants, aged 10 years and above, were purposively enrolled from six health facilities. Laboratory analyses included viral load, CD4 and CD8 counts, co-infection screening (hepatitis B/C, syphilis), liver and kidney function tests, haemoglobin estimation, and HIV-1/2 typing. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between participant demographics and clinical data with uncontrolled viremia and immune recovery. A total of 426 participants were recruited, comprising 159 ART-naïve and 267 ART-experienced individuals, with a mean age of 41.5 years. Median ART duration for ART-experienced was greater than 5 years. Infections included HIV-1 (78.6%), HIV-2 (2.1%), and dual HIV-1&2 (19.2%). Common comorbidities were anaemia (54.9%), hepatitis B (9.5%), and hypertension (8.2%). Most participant (97.9%) were on dolutegravir-anchored regimen. Among ART-naïve individuals, median viral load decreased from log<sub>10</sub> 5.16 at baseline to log<sub>10</sub> 4.64 copies/mL after six months (p = 0.0156). Median viral load for the ART-experienced arm was log<sub>10</sub> 3.23 copies/mL. Median CD4 count increased from 290 cells/mm³ in ART-naïve participants to 504 cells/mm³ at six-months post-ART (p = 0.0003) and 581 cells/mm³ in ART-experienced participants (p < 0.0001). ART-naïve participants were 19 times more likely to have unsuppressed viral loads at baseline compared to ART-experienced participants. ARTnaïve- participants had significantly decreased odds of immune recovery (aOR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.140-0.85, p = 0.021), as did those with low CD4/CD8 ratio (aOR = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.02-0.20; p < 0.001). Kidney function and haemoglobin levels were significantly improved six-month post-ART among the ART-naïve group. This study highlights the significant reduction in viral load and improved immune recovery following ART initiation despite uncontrolled viremia in a subset of participants. This cohort presents an opportunity to study Ghana's local HIV epidemic, including HIV-1 and HIV-2, and impact of ART on disease progression.",

We performed a disproportionality analysis using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for NIVO-IPI and NIVO-RELA from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2015 to Q4 of 2024. We calculated the reporting odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 7,482 records for NIVO-IPI and 185 records for NIVO-RELA were extracted from FAERS. NIVO-IPI showed significantly higher risks for gastrointestinal (ROR = 1.39), endocrine (ROR = 3.10), hepatobiliary (ROR = 2.32), metabolism and nutrition (ROR = 1.44), and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (ROR = 1.18), particularly in preferred terms (PTs) such as colitis, hypophysitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis. NIVO-RELA was associated with increased risks for cardiac (ROR = 2.84) and vascular disorders (ROR = 2.04), notably in PTs like myocarditis, troponin elevation, and myasthenia gravis. 80% of AEs occurred within three months for both regimens. The median time-to-onset was 42 days for NIVO-IPI compared to 57 days for NIVO-RELA, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.66). NIVO-IPI is linked with a broader range of immune-related toxicities, whereas NIVO-RELA presents higher cardiac-specific risks.

This study identified recurrent HBV DNA integration into the CCDC91 gene in HCC tissues (n = 17) using pooled analysis and HBV capture sequencing. CCDC91 expression was positively correlated with HBV DNA presence, and higher levels were linked to shorter overall survival in HCC patients. CCDC91 was upregulated in HCC and promoted HCC malignancy in vitro and in vivo. CCDC91 deficiency increased sensitivity to sorafenib treatment. By RNA sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we further demonstrated that the Ct-HBx upregulated CCDC91 and that CCDC91 induced aerobic glycolysis by activating LDHA to drive HCC progression. In conclusion, the HBV integrated gene CCDC91 is a novel HCC-related gene that functions through the Ct-HBx/CCDC91/LDHA axis.

The spectrum of ALD encompasses simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and the potential development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of ALD involves a complex interplay of factors, including direct cellular damage caused by alcohol and its metabolites, hepatic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and oxidative stress. Additionally, dysbiosis and the subsequent imbalance of gut homeostasis further exacerbate the progression of ALD. While abstinence from alcohol and nutritional support remain the cornerstone of ALD management, increasing evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting various pathological processes, in particular inflammation, cellular oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and strategies to promote liver regeneration and inhibit fibrosis. Moreover, emerging treatment approaches aimed at modulating the gut-liver-brain axis and targeting innate immune cells offer promising new avenues for ALD therapy. For patients with end-stage alcoholic liver disease, liver transplantation remains the only viable option to improve prognosis. This review summarizes the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, natural history, and recent advancements in the therapeutic management of ALD, aiming to provide further insights into the treatment of ALD and improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (AAGN) is a leading cause of uremia in children, driven by macrophages (Mφs) that mediate crescent formation and fibrosis. Despite their critical role, the signals governing monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization in AAGN remain unclear. We utilized single-cell sequencing to dissect the cellular dynamics of AAGN and conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to explore the role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in monocyte recruitment and macrophage efferocytosis. Protein interaction analyses further delineated the downstream signaling pathways involved. CXCL12, released by apoptotic glomerular endothelial cells, recruited CXCR4<sup>+</sup> monocytes to renal tissue, where they differentiated into M2-polarized macrophages and contributed to the progression of AAGN. CXCR4 signaling mediated M2 polarization via the ELMO1/DOCK180/ RAC1 efferocytosis pathway, resulting in the secretion of TGF-β1 to promote the progression of the crescent to fibrosis. Plasma CXCL12 and CXCR4 levels, along with CXCR4<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration, distinguished AAGN from other crescentic nephritis types. LIT927 and AMD3100 treatment significantly alleviated renal dysfunction and crescent formation in EAV models. This study revealed that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis plays a key regulatory role in the pathological process of AAGN. By establishing the specific molecular dialogue mechanism between endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages, CXCL12 released by apoptotic endothelial cells can activate the CXCR4 on the surface of monocytes/macrophages, thereby promoting monocyte migration, enhancing macrophage-mediated efferocytosis and transforming into a pro-fibrotic phenotype. Targeted intervention with CXCL12/CXCR4 provides a promising approach for the treatment of AAGN.",

        "abstract": "The combination of Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir(S/V) is approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. In registrational trials, cure rates of 95% or more were achieved when administered as one pill per day for a period of 12 weeks, regardless of genotype or disease stage. There is a need to develop and evaluate systems of care in populations excluded from clinical trials. We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S/V in a prospective study of HCV-infected inner-city residents enriched for risk behaviours for non-adherence to therapy, including problematic drug use and unstable housing. Through dedicated outreach events, we identified HCV-infected patients who were not currently engaged in health care and who were eligible to receive government-funded antiviral treatment for HCV infection. We offered them the opportunity to enrol in a multidisciplinary programme of care to address medical, psychological, social, and addiction-related needs, and provide S/V therapy in this context, with enhanced supervision of adherence. We identified 222 eligible subjects, 31.5% female, median age of 47 (24-81) years. The most common genotype was 1, followed by 3 (48.2%, 38.7%) and 21.2% scored F3-F4 FibroScan scores. 55.9% have unstable housing, and 98.6% are active drug users, with the majority utilising fentanyl, followed by amphetamines (82.9%, 64.9%). HCV treatment has been started in all 222 persons within a median of 6 weeks of engagement in care. 218 persons completed treatment, one individual withdrew from the treatment, and 3 overdose deaths were documented. HCV cure was documented in 211/218 (96.8%). Virologic relapse was documented in the other 7 cases. The intent-to-treat SVR rate of HCV treatment with S/V was 211/222 (95.0%). Taken together, our data validate the development of multidisciplinary programmes such as ours to address HCV infection, yielding high rates of engagement and retention in care, promoting initiation of treatment (usually within 6 weeks) and > 97% rate of cure.",

        "title": "Pathogenesis, Non-Invasive Assessments and Treatment of Hepatic Fibrosis in Autoimmune Liver Diseases.",
        "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases (AILD), including autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), can lead to progressive liver fibrosis, development of cirrhosis, decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and need for liver transplantation (LT). This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms of liver fibrogenesis, non-invasive methods to assess hepatic fibrosis and potential anti-fibrotic interventions in AILD. Current management for AILD should incorporate non-invasive methods to evaluate changes in hepatic fibrosis and consider potential interventions aiming at controlling the progression of the disease, interruption and, potentially, reversal of liver fibrosis. Several laboratory tests can help distinguish patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis but their utility in discriminating earlier histological stages of fibrosis is unclear. A current shift toward non-invasive radiological methods, such as vibration-controlled transient elastography, shear wave elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging and magnetic resonance elastography, opens promising avenues for their wide application; however, their performances may be compromised by hepatic inflammation, ascites, biliary obstruction, or concomitant obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Corticosteroids and immunomodulators have been shown to regress fibrosis in AIH patients. In PBC, treatment with either synthetic bile acids, farnesoid X receptor agonists or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist leads to the improvement or stabilization in the fibrosis stage. There is an urgent need for effective medical treatment in PSC, and available evidence of antifibrotic treatment is particularly limited. Promising anti-fibrotic interventions in AILD encompass conventional pharmacological agents as well as potential new treatments, such as fibrates, monoclonal antibodies, and site- and organelle-specific agents.",

        "abstract": "Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is an implantation mycosis caused by dematiaceous fungi in the tropical and subtropical regions. It is a neglected tropical disease that primarily affects poverty-stricken populations. Although located in tropical and subtropical regions, Taiwan is a highly industrialized country with an advanced healthcare system that offers a unique perspective on CBM. To explore the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes of CBM cases in northern Taiwan. This study included 14 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with CBM at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 2017 and August 2024. The relevant clinical profiles were analyzed. The pathogens were isolated by fungal culture and identified using sequence-based methods. The mean age was 65.4 ± 10.4 years, and 92.9 % of the patients were male. The median [IQR] time between onset and diagnosis was 6.5 [3-36] months. In addition to the common comorbidities, we identified four hepatitis B carriers and two immunosuppressed patients. While four patients had occupations requiring physical labor, nine patients were either retired or engaged in sedentary work and had gardening habits. Pathogens were isolated from 13 patients, all of which were identified as Fonsecaea monophora. Treatments included systemic and topical antifungal agents, surgical excision, local thermotherapy, and cryotherapy, with 71.4 % patients achieving complete response (CR). Patients with CBM in Taiwan are characterized by older age, history of gardening-related trauma in some cases, and immunosuppression. We also reported a shorter delay from disease onset to diagnosis and a good CR rate, which may reflect better medical accessibility.",

        "abstract": "Functional exhaustion of T lymphocytes is considered an important factor in the failure of tumor treatment. Accumulating evidence has shown that tumor cells cultivate their immune microenvironment through secreting exosomes. However, the mechanism through which tumor cell-derived exosomes participate in the regulation of lymphocyte function remains unclear. In this study, we found that exosomes derived from prostate cancer (PCa) cells were able to upregulate the expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, inducing the secretion of cytokines related to T cell exhaustion and significantly decreasing the ability to kill PCa cells. Importantly, our data indicated that treatment with GW4869 could reverse the effects of PCa-derived exosomes on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and further inhibit the growth of PCa cells in vivo and in vitro by blocking the generation of exosomes. Our findings support the notion that exosomes derived from PCa cells can induce T cell exhaustion and promote PCa progression, while treatment of GW4869 effectively rejuvenates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and reverses the effect of PCa exosomes. These findings indicate that GW4869 has potential in the treatment of PCa.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a multifaceted health threat to humans, animals, plants, food systems, and environments. In response, China initiated extensive research to understand and address AMR. However, there has been a lack of analysis and synthesis of research results at the national level. This study establishes a national AMR knowledge repository through the systematic analysis of over 44,000 scientific publications (2000-2024), employing a machine learning framework that combines transformer-based language models and cluster analysis. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to identify key AMR research topics, subtopics, and AMR detection methods across One Health sectors, including changes over time. Main findings include: (i) China's AMR research in human health aligns with societal disease burdens, yet gaps exist for pathogens like Clostridium difficile and Hepatitis B virus, despite their significant risks in China. (ii) While AMR research in probiotics is increasing, potential risks of AMR transmission associated with their use are often underestimated, particularly regarding the post-marketing surveillance and standardization of probiotic products. (iii) Discovery of new antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies is crucial for AMR prevention in China. (iv) Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are promising to guide and accelerate research, including exploration of natural products and plant extracts. Overall, while the AMR research in China aligns with One Health principles, with the plant health sector surpassing global counterparts, food systems require enhanced efforts and cross-sectoral research, particularly in the development of effective AMR detection and surveillance technologies. This work demonstrates a replicable methodological framework for establishing and sustaining country-specific scientific evidence platforms, offering valuable data-driven support for synthesizing findings, decision-making, and developing current and future action plans to manage AMR from a One Health perspective.",
