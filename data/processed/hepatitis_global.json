        "abstract": "Drug-related infectious diseases (DRID), such as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), contribute to high morbidity and mortality among people who inject drugs (PWID). The European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) is responsible for monitoring DRID and related behaviours for PWID in Europe. We updated the EUDA DRID technical protocol which covers all steps from planning to data analysis needed for a survey among PWID. Drug-related infectious disease-specific indicators were revised. To enable a more effective monitoring of the current epidemiological situation, we added specific core indicators, such as prevalence of viraemic HBV, HCV and HIV care cascades and harm reduction-related indicators. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and take-home naloxone were added as optional indicators. The process was informed by a European working group, who shared best-practice examples of (repeated) cross-sectional and cohort surveys using different methods in various settings. To reach the World Health Organization's goal of ending HIV and the viral hepatitis epidemics, comprehensive DRID monitoring among the disproportionately affected PWID population is needed.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of global hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Conventional biomarkers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) demonstrate suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. Emerging evidence suggests that serum extra spindle pole bodies like 1 (ESPL1) protein and p53 antibody may improve diagnostic accuracy. To assess and compare the diagnostic performance of serum ESPL1 protein and p53 antibody in HBV-related HCC (HBV-HCC). This case-control study from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University enrolled 30 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 30 with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC), 55 with HBV-HCC, and 30 healthy controls. Serum ESPL1 protein and p53 antibody levels were quantified <i>via</i> ELISA. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, including sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with AFP. Serum ESPL1 protein levels progressively increased across disease stages (CHB: 89.9 ng/L; HBV-LC: 188.83 ng/L; HBV-HCC: 317.63 ng/L), with a significantly higher area under the ROC curve (AUC = 0.917) than either p53 antibody (AUC = 0.725) or AFP (AUC = 0.678). p53 antibody levels were significantly elevated only in the HBV-HCC group. ESPL1 demonstrated superior sensitivity and concordance with histopathological findings. A significant correlation between ESPL1 and p53 antibody levels was observed exclusively in the HBV-HCC group (<i>r</i> = 0.320, <i>P</i> = 0.017), suggesting potential interplay in malignant transformation. Serum ESPL1 protein, a promising biomarker for early HBV-HCC detection, outperforms p53 antibody in diagnostic reliability. Higher ESPL1 levels correlate with increased HCC risk in chronic HBV patients.",

Liver infiltration by leukemic cells, primary and secondary hepatic malignancies, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, immunological disorders, and infections have been reported. Nevertheless, syncytial giant cell hepatitis (GCH) as a manifestation of autoimmune hepatitis in patients with CLL is an extremely rare condition, currently reported only in anecdotal cases. Here, we report the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian woman affected by CLL, who developed GCH with peculiar histopathological features. The patient was evaluated for abnormal liver test results. Liver histology revealed significant inflammatory lymphomononuclear infiltrates with a plasma cell component, widespread syncytial changes in the hepatocytes with gigantocellular features, hepatocyte rosettes, and the typical feature of emperipolesis, consistent with a diagnosis of GCH. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, resulting in a complete biochemical response. Early histological diagnosis of GCH is crucial in patients with CLL, with mycophenolate mofetil representing a promising treatment option.",

        "abstract": "Current treatments for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are lifelong, often accompanied by side effects and the risk of drug resistance, highlighting the urgent need for alternative therapies such as therapeutic vaccines. However, challenges such as selecting appropriate antigens and addressing multiple hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes hinder the development of these vaccines. One approach to overcoming these challenges is reverse vaccinology (RV) combined with immunoinformatics. RV uses computational methods to identify antigens from pathogen genetic information, including genomic and proteomic data. These methods have helped researchers identify conserved epitopes across bacterial strains or viral species, including multiple HBV genotypes. Computational tools, such as epitope mapping algorithms, molecular docking analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and immune response simulations, enable key epitope identification, predict vaccine candidates' binding potential to immune cell receptors, and forecast the immune response. Together, these approaches streamline therapeutic vaccine design for CHB, making it faster, more cost-effective, and accurate. This review aims to explore the potential role of RV and immunoinformatics in advancing therapeutic vaccine design for CHB.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we comment on the article by Peta <i>et al</i>. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of FibroTest-Actitest, transient elastography, and the fibrosis-4 index against a histological reference. Using the Obuchowski measure, the authors demonstrate that FibroTest and vibration-controlled transient elastography outperform the fibrosis-4 index in detecting fibrosis. Additionally, Actitest offers superior estimation of inflammatory activity compared to conventional biomarkers. Assessing liver fibrosis is crucial for managing autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), yet reliance on invasive liver biopsy remains higher than in other liver diseases. This is partly due to more complex diagnostic criteria for AIH, the lack of standardized scoring for non-invasive testing, and the presence of inflammation, which can lead to falsely elevated results with non-invasive tests. A Bayesian latent class model further supports the reliability of these non-invasive tests, highlighting their potential to complement biopsy, particularly for long-term disease monitoring. These findings underscore the importance of non-invasive diagnostics in optimizing AIH management.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and its impact on postoperative survival in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent conversion therapy. The therapeutic regimen consisted of interventional procedures (hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy [HAIC] and/or transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). A retrospective analysis was performed at a single institution involving 91 patients <i>who had</i> initially unresectable HCC linked to the hepatitis B virus. These patients achieved resectability following conversion therapy and subsequently underwent surgical tumor removal. Logistic regression identified risk factors for HBV reactivation (HBVr). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests assessed survival differences. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In our cohort, HBVr occurred in 17 patients (18.7%), all of whom received antiviral therapy. The incidence of HBVr was 16.7% (14/84) in patients with detectable baseline HBV DNA and 42.9% (3/7) in those with undetectable levels. Baseline HBV DNA ≥2000 IU/ml was identified as an independent protective factor against HBVr (OR 0.090, 95% CI 0.015-0.532; P = 0.008). The median PFS was significantly shorter in the reactivation group than in the non-reactivation group (12.1 months [95% CI 5.5-18.7] <i>vs</i>. 29.2 months [95% CI 23.6-34.7]; P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in median OS between the two groups (not reached <i>vs</i>. 45.6 months [95% CI 41.7-49.5]; P = 0.117). HBVr represents a potential complication in subjects receiving hepatectomy for hepatitis B virus associated HCC following conversion therapy involving interventional therapies combined with TKIs and ICIs. Patients experiencing HBVr exhibited significantly shorter progression-free survival compared to those without reactivation. Therefore, prophylactic antiviral therapy and meticulous HBV DNA monitoring are warranted during both conversion therapy and the perioperative period.",

        "title": "Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With Oral Lichen Planus in a Cohort From Casablanca, Morocco.",
        "abstract": "Background Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects the oral mucosa and is more frequently observed in women. OLP presents in various forms, including reticular, papular, plaque-like, erosive, atrophic, and bullous. The etiology remains unclear, though immune dysregulation is thought to be a key factor. OLP has the potential to transform into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Department of Oral Surgery and Pathology, University Hospital Ibn Rochd, Casablanca. Over a period of 46 months, patients diagnosed with OLP were followed. Data were collected using a standardized form that covered demographic, clinical, biological, and histological criteria, as well as follow-up information. Blood tests included complete blood count, glucose levels, and liver function tests. Biopsies were performed for diagnostic confirmation and follow-up, with direct immunofluorescence (DIF) used in complex cases. Patients with suspected cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) were referred to the dermatology department for evaluation. Treatment involved the removal of irritants, with corticosteroid therapy tailored to the severity of the lesion. Systemic corticosteroids were used for severe or treatment-resistant cases. Diabetic patients requiring systemic therapy were managed in collaboration with endocrinologists. Results Out of 9,841 consultations, 44 cases of OLP were identified, resulting in a prevalence rate of 4.5‰. The mean age of patients was 54.5 ± 13.5 years, with a predominance of women. Comorbidities included diabetes and hypertension in some cases. The reticular form was most common, followed by the bullous form. The buccal mucosa was the primary site of involvement. CLP co-occurred in 22.7% of cases. Malignant transformation was observed in one patient. Discussion The study, conducted at a single center with a focus on oral pathology, aligns with international findings, demonstrating a higher prevalence in women aged 50 to 60 years and a predominance of reticular forms with involvement of the buccal mucosa. A higher incidence of bullous lesions was observed compared to previous reports. Anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus) testing was systematically performed due to Morocco's moderate HCV prevalence. The association between OLP and diabetes may be influenced by the high diabetes prevalence in Morocco. Although treatment provided symptom relief, therapeutic options remain limited. The rate of malignant transformation was consistent with that reported in prior studies. Conclusion This study confirms a higher prevalence of OLP in women aged 50 to 60 years, with reticular forms and involvement of the buccal mucosa. Diabetes was the most commonly associated condition, and chronic HCV infection, while infrequent, may pose an increased risk. Regular monitoring is crucial due to the potential for malignant transformation, particularly in women and those with erosive or atrophic subtypes.",

        "abstract": "The Spanish National Health System, with devolved powers to autonomous communities such as Catalonia, faces significant challenges in controlling viral infections like hepatitis C (HCV) among vulnerable groups, particularly people who inject drugs (PWID), where prisons serve as crucial intervention sites. Catalonia's health authorities have implemented strategies to combat HCV, including direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments and harm reduction programmes within both community and penitentiary settings. However, substantial barriers persist in achieving full treatment uptake and clearance among PWID subpopulations. This review aims to discuss the Catalonia's current HCV programmes and explores intervention proposals needed to achieve WHO elimination targets. Catalonia has implemented a comprehensive HCV plan, particularly targeting PWID, that has proven effective through enhanced screening, universal treatment access, and harm reduction, though structural and social barriers remain due to fragmented health and social systems. Advancing towards HCV elimination requires strengthened inter-organisational coordination, integrated social and health services, simplified care pathways, enhanced screening, professional training, targeted research, measurable goals, culturally appropriate and participatory prevention strategies, and a comprehensive, people-centred approach. This is particularly important in prisons, where universal screening, adapted caring processes, harm reduction, and opioid substitution treatments (OST) are essential. Considering the social determinants of health perspective, it is essential that policies and programs are structured to reduce structural inequities and vulnerabilities, thereby promoting equity in both access to prevention, care, treatment, and health benefits across all population groups, particularly those most affected.",

In a sub-analysis of virally-suppressed (hepatitis B virus DNA <20 IU/mL) adult Taiwanese CHB patients with renal (chronic kidney disease stage ≥1) or hepatic (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class B or C) impairment, all participants received open-label TAF 25 mg once daily for 96 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated based on proportion of patients with viral suppression and normal alanine aminotransferase levels. Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were considered over 96 weeks, alongside renal function parameters, hip and spine bone mineral density (BMD) and fasting lipid changes. Of 124 patients treated in the phase 2 study, 33 (27 %) were from Taiwan. All sub-analysis participants (renal impairment, n = 22; hepatic impairment, n = 11) achieved virologic response after 24 weeks of TAF; of the 28 patients who completed the study, 96 % (n = 27) maintained suppression through Week 96. One AE in each group, and no serious AEs, were related to study treatment. Following TAF switch, renal function and BMD remained stable or improved slightly over 96 weeks.

        "abstract": "Screening nonhuman primates (NHPs) for tuberculosis (TB) is important to protect the health of NHP colonies and people who interact with them. Screening is especially important for imported NHPs from countries where TB is prevalent and biosecurity practices may be lax. There are a variety of testing methods available for TB screening and diagnosis in NHPs; all have limitations, and their performance in different settings is incompletely characterized. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects TB testing results as part of its regulatory oversight of NHP importation. We collated the results of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), multiplexed fluorometric immunoassay (MFIA), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex PCR, staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture of bacteria from tissues for imported NHPs in CDC-mandated quarantine during fiscal years 2021 to 2024. We used these data to assess test performance and intertest agreement for the different tests used. Among 107 imported NHPs tested, TST and IGRA were the most common antemortem tests performed, but they agreed poorly with each other and with culture. AFB staining and PCR exhibited moderate agreement and high positive predictive values using culture as the gold standard. The most commonly affected tissues were lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, regardless of the Mycobacterium sp. identified. Further research is needed to identify and validate additional methods for TB testing in NHPs, particularly for antemortem screening. Tissue acid-fast staining and PCR exhibited high positive predictive values and could be useful to inform policies and clinical decisions about colony management and occupational health while awaiting culture results.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses a significant global public health challenge due to its ability to rapidly evolve antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we analyzed 141 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae obtained between 2015 and 2022 from clinical laboratories in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance mechanisms, and clonal diversity were investigated. Whole-genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed the circulation of internationally relevant sequence types (STs) such as ST-1901, ST-7363, and ST-9363. While non-susceptibility rates to penicillin (98 %) and ciprofloxacin (73 %) remained stable compared to earlier data, tetracycline resistance decreased from 67 % (in 2015-2016) to 20 % (in 2019-2020), likely due to the reduced prevalence of ST-1588. However, mainly after 2020, tetM plasmids were detected in ST-7822 and the emerging ST-7363, suggesting the concern of a rising occurrence of these determinants in the near future. Azithromycin non-susceptibility varied between 15 and 33 % in the different time frames, associated with mutations in the mtrR promoter and rrl gene, affecting isolates across eleven STs. While no ceftriaxone non-susceptibility was identified, ST-1901 and ST-7363 isolates harbored unique mosaic penA 34 alleles, and ST-1580/ST-17526 carried semi-mosaic 93 alleles. These findings underscore the persistence of resistance to older antimicrobials, the spread of plasmid-mediated resistance in key clones, and the growing threat of azithromycin resistance, which could compromise the treatment of gonorrhea in patients allergic to beta-lactams.",

Furthermore, we examine whether age at menopause mediates the potential association between surgical menopause and frailty, and the extent of interaction or joint effects of surgical menopause and age at menopause on frailty. The analysis included 7462 women aged ≥60 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2018. Frailty was measured using a 49-item frailty index and was diagnosed if the score on that index exceeded 0.21. Menopausal data were collected using a standardized reproductive health questionnaire. Survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between surgical menopause, menopausal age, and frailty. We also conducted mediation analyses and interaction analyses on both the multiplicative and additive scales. Of the 7462 women, 2687 (32.4 %) had frailty. Women with a history of surgical menopause had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.44 (95 % CI: 1.25-1.66) for frailty compared to those with natural menopause. Age at menopause mediated 26.4 % of the total association between surgical menopause and frailty.

        "abstract": "A 56-year-old man receiving immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate (MTX) for a T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder developed acute hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV). Persistent HEV viremia was observed, and the patient was diagnosed with chronic HEV infection based on the continued presence of HEV RNA in both serum (10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL) and feces (~ 10<sup>9</sup> copies/mL in 15% suspensions) 6 months after the initial infection. A 12-week course of ribavirin (RBV) therapy, combined with gradual tapering of MTX, resulted in undetectable HEV RNA levels in serum and feces at the end of the RBV treatment. However, 6 months after completion of RBV therapy and MTX cessation, HEV RNA reappeared at low levels in serum (10 copies/mL) and feces (~ 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL in 15% suspensions). This low-level viremia persisted for approximately 4 months without any clinical symptoms or additional treatment. Eventually, HEV RNA became spontaneously undetectable in both serum and feces, and the patient was considered cured based on sustained HEV RNA negativity 1129 days after the onset of hepatitis. This case highlights the importance of extended follow-up-beyond the standard 6 months-when assessing the viral clearance in HEV-infected patients following antiviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Using the Global Burden of Disease 2021 data, this study reports the global, regional, and national disease burden of liver cancer due to hepatitis B (LCDHB) from 1990 to 2021, stratified by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI), and projects future burden to 2051. We examined incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of LCDHB. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), age-standardized death rates (ASDR), and age-standardized DALYs rates were analyzed (1990-2021). Spearman correlation assessed age-standardized rates-SDI relationships. The Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model projected the burden to 2051. Compared to 1990, the number of LCDHB incidences, deaths, and DALYs increased by 46.9, 41.2, and 33.9% in 2021; however, from 1990 to 2021, the ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALYs rate all exhibited a declining trend. In 2021, the highest ASIR occurred in East Asia, High-income Asia Pacific, and Western sub-Saharan Africa. At the national and regional levels, Mongolia, the Republic of Paraguay, and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas showed peak ASIR. ASIR was higher in males and increased with age, peaking at 85-89 age group for both males and females in 2021. A reverse U-shaped correlation existed between age-standardized DALYs and SDI during 1990-2021. BAPC projections indicate declining global ASIR, ASDR, and age-standardized DALYs rates (2021-2051). Despite rising incidence, deaths, and DALYs, LCDHB treatment challenges persist, especially for males and elderly populations. Our findings on epidemiological trends and demographic variations provide crucial insights for policymakers addressing this global health burden.",

Early recurrence is largely driven by aggressive tumor biology, while late recurrence reflects de novo carcinogenesis in a cirrhotic liver. Traditional clinical and pathological predictors are insufficient for accurately identifying high-risk patients. Emerging translational advances including genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers; liquid biopsy techniques; artificial intelligence (AI)-driven histological and radiomic analyses offer new avenues to refine recurrence risk stratification and guide perioperative therapy. Simultaneously, the shifting etiological landscape from viral hepatitis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and alcohol-related liver disease underscores the need for tailored surveillance and preventive strategies. Advanced technologies such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide unprecedented insights into fibrosis progression and tumor evolution. Integrating these approaches may enable personalized surveillance protocols and therapeutic interventions, optimizing outcomes for HCC patients and reducing unnecessary resource utilization.",

        "abstract": "Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a major viral pathogen that causes severe complications in immunosuppressed individuals, particularly hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In these patients, Cytomegalovirus has been associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and even graft-versus-host disease, and a possible relationship has been identified between Cytomegalovirus genotypes and clinical course, complications and outcome. Early detection of Cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation is important, and previous findings show that it could potentially be evaluated in saliva, where HCMV causes asymptomatic viral shedding. Since saliva can be collected easily and safely, it is important to evaluate its potential for HCMV detection and genotyping, especially in pediatric patients who are receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using saliva to detect and genotype HCMV in a cohort of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCTR). This study was conducted at Fundación Hospital Pediátrico la Misericordia, in Bogota, Colombia. Stimulated saliva samples were collected once a week and subjected to HCMV detection by qualitative PCR and genotyping by nested PCR followed by sequencing. Finally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Twenty patients were enrolled, and 105 saliva samples were collected, of which 29 were positive for HCMV. Twelve patients had at least one positive sample. The gB1 genotype was identified with no coinfection with any other genotype. Phylogenetic analysis showed that some saliva samples were closer to the sequence reported for the Towne laboratory strain, while others were closer to the Merlin strain, with slight differences between them. It was demonstrated that saliva can be used to detect and genotype Cytomegalovirus in pediatric transplant recipients, and that sample collection is easy, with no risk of bleeding or discomfort in the pediatric patients evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are common in the European population, typically presenting with mucocutaneous and anogenital manifestations. However, disseminated infections and organ involvement are rare, usually occurring in immunocompromised individuals, particularly after hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation. HSV1/2-induced hepatitis is infrequent but can result in acute liver failure (ALF) and increased mortality. We present a case of fulminant ALF caused by disseminated primary HSV2 infection in a fifty-year-old male with rheumatoid arthritis treated with the JAK-inhibitor upadacitinib for 3 months prior to presentation. Clinical examination revealed severe oropharyngeal mucositis and hepatic encephalopathy. Initial laboratory results showed bicytopenia, significantly elevated transaminases, bilirubin, inflammatory markers, and severe coagulopathy. Empirical treatment with an antimicrobial regimen, intravenous aciclovir, acetylcysteine, and plasmapheresis (PPH) was initiated. The patient was listed for urgent liver transplantation based on King's College criteria. Further investigations revealed a high viral load of HSV2 DNA in the blood, and transjugular liver biopsy confirmed extensive liver necrosis with positive HSV staining. Despite antiviral therapy, the HSV2 viral load remained high, indicating resistance, and the patient was deemed \"nontransplantable\" due to clinical deterioration with progressive hepatic coma, hemorrhagic-septic shock, multiorgan failure, and secondary bowel ischemia, ultimately leading to the patient's death from refractory shock. This is only the second documented case of fulminant ALF due to HSV2 hepatitis in a patient undergoing JAK inhibition, and the first involving upadacitinib. It highlights the importance of considering primary herpesvirus infection as a potential cause of ALF, particularly in immunocompromised patients, and underscores the need for early antiviral intervention to improve outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Chronic liver disease has become a global health crisis, with increasing incidence and mortality rates placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. A key factor in the progression of chronic liver disease is intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, which influences liver function <i>via</i> the intricate liver-gut axis. This axis plays a central role in various physiological processes, and disruptions in microbial composition can exacerbate liver pathology. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, with the potential to restore the composition and metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota. Supported by encouraging findings from clinical trials and animal studies, FMT has demonstrated therapeutic benefits, including improvements in clinical symptoms, objective indicators, and long-term prognosis. These benefits encompass reductions in hepatic lipid deposition and inflammation, mitigation of complications in advanced liver disease, promotion of hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and enhancement of cognitive function. Although clinical evidence remains preliminary, current data underscore the transformative potential of FMT in managing chronic liver diseases. Nonetheless, challenges persist, including the need for standardized procedures, variability among donors, potential risks, and concerns regarding long-term safety. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the current literature on the efficacy and safety of FMT, while exploring future research directions to expand its application in liver disease management.",

In 2016, direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) were included in the Treatment Guidelines for hepatitis C in Cameroon. The aim of this study was to investigate hepatitis C virus (HCV) variability and frequency of NS5B naturally occurring polymorphisms and transmitted resistance-associated mutations or substitutions (RAMs or RASs) in DAAs-naïve patients. From 240 HCV-infected, DAA-naïve individuals, the NS5B region of 92 samples were sequenced, genotyped by phylogeny using MEGA 11.0.13 software and analysed for polymorphisms conferring resistance to polymerase inhibitors using bioinformatics tools (Geno2Pheno HCV 0.92 and BioEdit version 7.2.5). Thirty-two GT1 (34.8%), 37 GT2 (40.2%), 22 GT4 (23.9%) and 1 GT5 (1.1%), 13 subtypes (1e, 1g, 1h, 1j, 1l, 2j, 2r, 4a, 4f, 4l, 4p, 4t and 5a) were found. Thirty-four GT2 sequences clustered together without any reference sequences and therefore could not be subtyped. The NS5B S282T resistance-associated substitutions was not detected in any sample. However, the polymorphisms of unreported resistance-associated impact in positions 316 and 321 were identified: C316H (8.7%), C316N (18.5%), V321I (6.5%) and a double mutant C316H/V321I (4.3%). Comparison of GTs obtained by a commercial PCR kit versus Sanger sequencing and phylogeny of the NS5B region, showed a discrepancy of 30%. Genotype 5 was identified for the first time in Cameroon. The frequency of V321I and C316H/N polymorphism with unknown impact on NS5B polymerase inhibitors is increasing in Cameroon.",

Spontaneous necrosis of HCC is an extremely rare phenomenon with an unclear pathophysiology. Various mechanisms, including vascular disturbances, immune-mediated response, and recurrent infection, have been considered. This case report presents a rare case of spontaneous necrosis of a small HCC in a patient with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. A 63-year-old male with compensated hepatitis B-related cirrhosis was under routine surveillance when a suspicious liver lesion was detected on ultrasound. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of an 18-mm HCC in segment VIII, corresponding to Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer stage A. Due to limited curative treatment options, transarterial chemoembolization was considered. However, a follow-up CT scan was performed 2 weeks before the procedure unexpectedly revealed complete regression of arterial enhancement, suggestive of spontaneous tumor necrosis. The patient remained asymptomatic, with stable liver function and mild biological inflammatory markers. No evidence of vascular thrombosis or significant systemic inflammation was noted, suggesting localized vascular disturbances or intrinsic tumor factors might have precipitated the necrosis. This case highlights the exceptional occurrence of spontaneous necrosis in a small HCC. While the underlying mechanisms remain speculative, further documentation and research on similar cases may provide insights into HCC pathophysiology and potential implications for future therapeutic strategies.",

Although metastasis from lung cancer to the prostate is exceedingly rare, we present a rare case of prostatic metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and no evidence of a primary lung lesion. A 64-years-old male with chronic hepatitis B and a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed in 2014 presented in 2023 with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Initial imaging revealed isolated bone metastasis, initially presumed to be recurrent HCC. Given the long interval since diagnosis, a bone biopsy was performed, unexpectedly showing adenocarcinoma. Subsequent PET-CT identified a prostatic lesion without pulmonary abnormalities, leading to an initial diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer. Prostate biopsy, however, revealed features consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Molecular testing detected an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, confirming metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient responded favorably to osimertinib therapy. This case illustrates a rare instance of prostatic metastasis from EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma and emphasizes the critical role of repeat biopsy, molecular profiling, and multidisciplinary evaluation in atypical metastatic presentations. The diagnostic process involved a \"triple reversal\" phenomenon, revising initial misdiagnoses of recurrent HCC and primary prostate cancer to metastatic NSCLC. Targeted therapy with osimertinib was effective, underscoring the importance of precision oncology in managing complex metastatic disease.",

In mice with very high levels of HBsAg (10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> IU/mL), levels that are observed clinically during standard HBV therapy and that were brought low (10<sup>2</sup> IU/mL) by HBV siRNA pre-treatment prior to therapeutic vaccination, PDL1 blockade in combination with stabilized cytokines IL-2 or IL-15 led to immune control of HBsAg in vaccinated animals.",

The international community has taken several important steps for HCV control, including the Global Health Sector Strategy (2016-2021), the Global Hepatitis Action Plan (2011), and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs) for 2030. However, achieving the World Health Assembly's goal of eliminating HCV by 2030 treating 90% of all infected individuals remains a significant challenge, particularly in Pakistan. This study delves into the perspectives of key stakeholders involved in the hepatitis elimination policy and its implementation in Pakistan, identifying barriers to effective policy execution and highlighting motivating factors. Through a phenomenological approach, interviews were conducted with ten key informants, including policymakers, clinicians and provincial hepatitis program personnel. Thematic analysis uncovered several critical themes: perceptions of hepatitis and elimination policies, the feasibility of achieving elimination goals, international collaborations, policy development, gaps in epidemiological data, and the influence of political contexts. The findings emphasize the need for a robust national database, stronger political commitment, better resource allocation, and a more integrated healthcare system. Drawing on successful models, such as Egypt, the study suggests that Pakistan must adopt comprehensive and coordinated strategies to meet the WHO targets and eliminate hepatitis by 2030.",

It is one of the global public health problems responsible for claiming thousands of lives every year. Although there are various HCV testing strategies depending on the specific circumstances and guidance of local authorities, the proportion of diagnosed HCV cases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) is estimated to be less than 5%. This review analyzes and documents evidence for different ways of screening HCV. The updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines have been used as the basis for this scoping review. Retrieved articles were screened and extracted by three independent individuals to make sure that all pertinent literatures were included. A total of 8318 records were retrieved from four electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar). Of the total retrieved records and after applying the pre-defined inclusion criteria, we included 51 studies in this review. According to the studies included in this review, three major screening approaches were noted: The universal, targeted, and risk-based HCV screening strategies. Population to screen include the baby boomer cohort, pregnant women, key populations, those experiencing homelessness, adults visiting health facilities, employees, and social event attendants. A \"one-stop-shop\" HCV testing initiative at different settings, such as prisons, addiction rehabilitation centers, and community dropping centers, were found to increase HCV test uptake among key populations. Integrating HCV screening with the existing HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics was highlighted to identifying and linking HCV-infected individuals to appropriate care and treatment. Although there are many ways of diagnosing HCV for treatment, identifying those who were reactive for HCV antibody first, followed by an HCV-antigen test for those antibody-positive, were found to be the most cost-efficient way of diagnosing HCV infection. HCV screening among pregnant women, the baby boomer cohort, adults visiting health facilities, engaging in injection drug use, incarcerated individuals, and those experiencing homelessness are useful approaches in identifying HCV-antibody positive individuals. An efficient way to reach the most at-risk people is to incorporate HCV screening into community service centers and clinics.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has been a game-changer in the elimination of hepatitis C virus infection. DAAs treatment achieved higher rates of sustained virological response among HCV-infected individuals across different virus genotypes. DAAs directly target HCV viral several proteins in the HCV lifecycle resulting in controlling the infection. So far, the immune system also plays a crucial role in effective viral eradication. Prolonged antigen exposure, coupled with high viral loads, are key factors that drive immune system failure and the development of chronic infection. T cell exhaustion is the hallmark of the failure of immune response to eliminate the infection. Several sequelae contribute to T cell exhaustion, including the failure of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, the expansion of the immune suppressive effects of regulatory T cells, and the modulation of epigenetics, which collectively contribute to the persistence of HCV infection. The interplay between DAA therapy and the influence on immune response particularly T cell exhaustion is still an opening question. In this review, we shed light on the recent studies exploring the impact of DAA therapy on CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response as well as the epigenetics change.

        "abstract": "International guidelines recommend the administration of two doses of pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccination for people with chronic liver disease to prevent severe complications. We aimed to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage and mortality in adults with chronic liver disease in England. We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected medical record data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network. We included people aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with chronic liver disease between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2022. The primary outcome of interest was hepatitis A vaccination. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was calculated using the number of vaccinated people with chronic liver disease as the numerator and the chronic liver disease population in the RSC dataset as the denominator. We compared individual characteristics by vaccination status using descriptive statistics. We used a multistate survival model to estimate the transition probabilities between four states: (1) diagnosis of chronic liver disease; (2) first hepatitis A vaccination; (3) second hepatitis A vaccination; and (4) death. 664 571 individuals aged 18 years or older with chronic liver disease were identified from the RSC sentinel network population, of whom 625 079 individuals were included in our analysis. Of 625 079 individuals with chronic liver disease, 13 875 (2·2%) had received a first hepatitis A vaccination, 3007 (0·4%) had received a second dose, 732 (5·3%) of 13 875 vaccinated individuals died, and 101 065 (16·5%) of 611 204 individuals without vaccination died during the study period. Adjusting for death as a competing risk, vaccination was more likely among younger age quintiles (hazard ratio 5·46 [95% CI 5·13-5·81]), non-smokers (1·59 [1·54-1·65]), residents of urban areas (1·28 [1·21-1·35]), individuals with higher socioeconomic status (1·06 [1·03-1·10]), and individuals with a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; 1·71 [1·64-1·78]). Individuals with a history of harmful alcohol use (0·36 [0·32-0·39]), type 1 diabetes (0·46 [0·36-0·57]), chronic kidney disease (0·63 [0·57-0·70]), or mental disorders (0·66 [0·64-0·69]) were less likely to be vaccinated. The lowest risk of mortality was in people with chronic liver disease of infectious or autoimmune aetiology and in people with MASLD. Hepatitis A vaccine uptake among people with chronic liver disease in England is low, with disparities by age, location (urban vs rural), and socioeconomic status. Steps should be taken to reduce the inequalities in vaccine administration. GlaxoSmithKline's Investigator Sponsored Studies Program.",

        "abstract": "The recent work by Shengir et al. offers compelling insight into the evolving metabolic landscape following hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication via direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). While liver stiffness and fibrosis indices significantly improved post-SVR, hepatic steatosis (HS) paradoxically increased in prevalence, highlighting a shift from virus-driven injury to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). In this correspondence, we expand upon these findings by discussing the clinical and pathophysiological implications of post-SVR steatosis, underscoring the need for ongoing metabolic surveillance even in patients with virologic cure. We also emphasize the limitations of traditional risk stratification based on BMI alone and call for refined, longitudinal approaches to detect and manage metabolic liver disease in the post-SVR population.",

        "abstract": "Achieving the World Health Organization's 2030 hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination goals necessitates robust and outcome-focussed surveillance. In Australia, HCV is a nationally notifiable condition, with state and territory health authorities leading surveillance and public health response. This study aimed to examine Queensland's HCV surveillance system and to identify barriers to, and solutions for, implementing notification-driven linkage to care. This study was conducted in two parts. System mapping and gap identification were conducted through consultation with key stakeholders operationally involved in HCV surveillance. Secondly, a proof-of-concept descriptive analysis of two months of notification data (January to February 2023), coinciding with a period of enhanced surveillance work, was conducted to scope the magnitude of follow-up and to provide insights into groups needing targeted support. Cases were grouped into indeterminate, active and cleared categories. System mapping and gap analysis identified significant constraints, including the absence of automated data processes and key data elements. These factors impeded the implementation of surveillance case definitions and hindered the identification of priority groups for linkage to care. Of 2,257 cases, 1,218 (54.0%) were individuals who had cleared HCV infection. There were 305 cases with incomplete diagnostic testing; 92/305 (30.2%) were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. Incomplete diagnostic testing was significantly more likely to occur for cases tested in the community compared to those tested in a correctional setting (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Of 734 active cases, 83.1% were male, 53.3% were tested in corrections, and 36.0% were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. To strengthen Queensland's HCV surveillance and enable effective linkage to care, several recommendations are proposed. These include amending public health regulations to require negative HCV RNA testing notification; establishing systematic real-time or close to real-time linkage of related datasets, including treatment data; automating the reporting of Point of Care Testing results; implementing a HCV clearance cascade; and adopting a centralised state-wide public health model. Addressing these barriers will be essential to achieving optimal HCV surveillance and care in Queensland.",

We characterized PCP experiences of HCV treatment and assessed acceptability of leveraging pharmacists to treat HCV. We surveyed a convenience sample of Washington (WA) State PCPs regarding HCV treatment, experience of collaborating with pharmacists, and comfort with pharmacists managing HCV care. We report summarized descriptive statistics of survey responses. Seventy-three PCPs completed the survey, 55% of whom prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Nineteen percent directly treat HCV. Forty-five percent were aware of collaborative practice agreements (CPAs) and 22% reported interest in establishing a CPA to treat HCV. Most respondents were comfortable or extremely comfortable with pharmacists managing key elements of HCV care. In a sample of WA State PCPs, of whom greater than half prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, fewer than 1 in 5 directly treat HCV. Comfort with pharmacists managing most components of HCV treatment was high, but a minority of PCPs were familiar with or interested in establishing CPAs.

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the research trends, patterns of opportunistic infections in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their impact on patient management strategies, especially in the context of the widespread use of DMARDs. Research papers on RA and opportunistic infections were analysed by performing a literature search in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, covering the period from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2023. Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOS viewer and Cite Space software, including country and institution analyses, journal and co-citation journal analyses, author and co-citation author analyses, and key word co-occurrence and clustering analyses. Two hundred and ninety-three research papers were analysed, and it was found that research publications on RA-associated opportunistic infections have shown a general upward trend over the past three decades, with a significant increase especially between 2007 and 2021. Japan, the United States, and China have the highest research output in this area, with institutions such as Yang Ming University and Taichung Veterans General Hospital being more active. Key word analysis revealed 'infection', 'risk', 'treatment', and 'infliximab' as research hotspots. Cluster analysis showed that tuberculosis, latent tuberculosis infection and hepatitis B virus were the focus of attention. Research on opportunistic infections in RA has shown a clear trend of growth and extensive international collaboration, reflecting a deep understanding of the risk of opportunistic infections in RA patients treated with DMARDs. Future studies should strengthen the identification of high-risk patient groups, the use of biomarkers, the balance of safety and efficacy in treatment regimens, and patient education to promote the optimisation of RA management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Shorter treatment courses for early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection could simplify treatment approaches, particularly in key populations. PURGE-C (A5380) was a single-arm, multicenter trial evaluating the treatment of early HCV (primary or reinfection) with 4 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). Early HCV was defined as new detectable HCV RNA or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation within 24 weeks of study entry. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after prescribed treatment completion (SVR12). Re-treatment outcomes were also collected. Forty-five participants (98% male, 51% White, 31% Hispanic, median age 36 years, 51% with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 27% self-reported injecting drugs) were enrolled from the United States and Brazil between November 2019 and January 2023. Median time from HCV diagnosis to entry was 31 days (Q1-Q3: 15-49). Median baseline HCV RNA was 5.3 log10 IU/mL (Q1-Q3: 3.3-6.0) and ALT 146 U/L (min-max: 22-3866). Overall, 38 of 45 (84%) participants (90% confidence interval [CI]: 74%-91%) achieved SVR12. All 4 participants who were retreated and had outcome data achieved SVR12. In this population with elevated risk of onward HCV transmission, 84% were cured with 4 weeks of G/P. Failing this short-course treatment did not compromise retreatment. This study suggests that people with early HCV infection can achieve moderately high cure rates with abbreviated courses of direct-acting antivirals (DAA). Simplified approaches to treatment are critical for HCV elimination and are particularly relevant for populations difficult to retain in care. NCT04042740.",

        "abstract": "There have been several Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). We aimed to determine the relationship of exposure to two faecal-orally transmitted pathogens, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV), with WASH levels and other factors. A cross-sectional study conducted in three districts in Khammouane Province enrolled 2300 participants aged 5 to 87 years by random sampling. Anti-HAV and anti-HEV antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between serology (outcome), WASH and other variables was determined by bivariate and multivariable analysis. Overall, 12.0% of participants had surface water as a water source, 22.0% practiced open defecation and 66.9% had basic hygiene facilities. Anti-HAV IgG seropositivity was 63.2% and 57.5% were anti-HEV seropositive. The mean age at which 50% of the population were positive for anti-HAV and anti-HEV was 24 and 27 years old, respectively. Anti-HAV seroprevalence was lower in those with improved sanitation than those practicing open defecation (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.4-0.8, p = 0.001) and higher in adults consuming undercooked meat (OR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.1-2.0, p = 0.01). It also varied by district, ethnicity, education and age. Anti-HEV seroprevalence was lower in those with improved water source than those using surface water (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.4-0.8, p = 0.002) and higher in adults consuming raw meat (OR = 1.3, 95%CI = 1.0-1.7, p = 0.04). Anti-HEV seroprevalence varied by district, sex, education, and age. Khammouane province has low levels of WASH leading to high transmission of HAV and HEV. Reducing the practice of open defecation and other risk practices such as undercooked meat consumption may reduce transmission as well as consideration of HAV vaccine introduction for younger ages.",

        "abstract": "Viral hepatitis, caused by various hepatitis viruses, is a global health threat leading to chronic liver disease, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Smoking, a known risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. However, understanding the relationship between smoking and viral hepatitis is complex due to the presence of confounding factors and the potential for reverse associations. We utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the potential association between smoking behavior and viral hepatitis. In this study, SNPs were utilized as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization framework to examine the relationship between smoking behavior and viral hepatitis risk. To ensure the accuracy of the experiment, our data were sourced from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and analyzed using a series of methods, such as inverse variance weighting (IVW) and leave-one-out analysis. The MR analysis revealed significant positive associations between SNPs related to smoking initiation, status, and cessation, and the risk of viral hepatitis. The IVW method demonstrated a consistent rightward shift of the effect estimates, indicating a potential increase in viral hepatitis risk associated with smoking exposure. Smoking initiation, status, and cessation were associated with increased odds of viral hepatitis by 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.45-3.24, p=0.00015), 2.93-fold (95% CI: 1.58-5.41, p=0.00061), and 5.30-fold (95% CI: 2.05-13.70, p=0.00057), respectively. The leave-one-out analysis further validated the robustness of our model, with minor SNP-specific deviations observed. Our study presents strong associations between smoking behavior and an elevated risk of viral hepatitis, highlighting the need for further investigation into this potential connection. These findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation in liver disease management and inform public health strategies aimed at reducing the burden of viral hepatitis.",

Liver transplantation (LT) is a crucial treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Over time, the etiologies leading to LT have evolved due to changes in disease prevalence, advancements in medical treatments, and public health interventions. Etiologies of LT were categorized into nine groups: acute liver failure, autoimmune disorders, alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cancer, vascular, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), viral hepatitis, metabolic disorders, and others. Trend analysis was performed using Python 3.12 programming language with appropriate libraries. A total of 1579 patients, 59.9% male with a mean age of 45.12 years (SD: 13.52), were analyzed. Autoimmune disorders emerged as the leading cause of LT, increasing from 32.2% in 2020 to 40.6% in 2024 (p-trend = 0.039). Viral hepatitis cases decreased significantly from 18.1% to 3.0% (p-trend = 0.033). Liver cancer became the third leading cause in 2021, replacing viral hepatitis, while MASH consistently remained the second leading cause. The significant shifts in LT etiologies underscore the success of public health interventions in reducing the burden of viral-related ESLD. Additionally, the findings highlight the need for ongoing research into the prevention, early diagnosis, and management of autoimmune liver diseases, MASH, and liver cancer.

Several risk factors are described, including immunosuppression, diabetes, tobacco use, and multiple sexual partners. About 90% of cases are associated with human papillomavirus infection. Given the rarity of this lesion, there are still no established guidelines for the assessment and treatment of this tumor. The most reported and consensus approach described in the literature is surgical intervention. We report a case of a 32-year-old man who was immunosuppressed following a lung transplant due to cystic fibrosis. He also had stage IV chronic kidney disease and chronic pancreatitis. The patient was evaluated in a proctology consultation due to complaints of itching, perianal pain, and constipation with a 4-month history. Clinical examination showed a cauliflower-like, papillomatous tumor measuring 9 cm along the perianal area with other surrounding smaller lesions. The evaluation of immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus and syphilis was negative. The patient denied engaging in receptive anal sex and other risky sexual behaviors. A macro biopsy of the lesion was performed, and the histopathological examination revealed an anal condyloma acuminatum, with no signs of malignancy. Therapy with imiquimod was initiated for several weeks, with no significant reduction in lesion size. In a multidisciplinary discussion, it was decided to start neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine and mitomycin. After 5 months of treatment, a significant reduction in lesion size was observed with significant clinical improvement. Currently, the patient has no proctological symptoms and no need for analgesia.",

Priority populations included in this analysis were people born overseas in a hepatitis B endemic country, people living with HIV, people with a recent hepatitis C infection, gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, people who have ever injected drugs, and sex workers. Results of the study found that in the overall cohort of 43,335 individuals, 14,140 (33%) were identified as susceptible to hepatitis B, and 5,255 (37%) were subsequently vaccinated.

The article presents two cases with a classic manifestation of the СIAD in neonatal period which were confirmed genetically, one of cases revealed the first described TBX19 gene variant. Despite the appearance of significant symptoms in the newborn period in both patients diagnoses were established at the 8th and 22nd months of life. Clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia were present in both patients: from the 1st day of life (episode of apnoea) in patient № 2 and from 7 months (seizures) in patient № 1. Cholestatic jaundice, hepatomegaly, signs of hepatocyte cytolysis, impaired protein-synthetic liver function were the main manifestations of the disease in 1st patient. This may indicate non-infectious cholestatic hepatitis. Improvement and gradual normalization of clinical and laboratory symptoms during hydrocortisone therapy confirmed the association of liver damage with hypocortisolemia. 2nd patient had no signs of cholestasis. Low cortisol levels were observed with reduced or low-normal ACTH, which confirmed central hypocorticism. Genetic study in both patients revealed TBX19 gene pathogenic variants in a homozygous state: c.82C&gt;T(p.Q28X) in patient №1, not previously described variant c.469-1G&gt;A in patient №2.",

For this purpose, it was subsequently combined with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), darunavir (boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat) or dolutegravir. Its wide-spread use is thanks to its combination with cabotegravir (CAB) in the form of a long-acting intramuscular injection once per month (QM), later twice per month (Q2M), for the treatment of adults, later extended to adolescents and pregnant women, with HIV infections. The long-acting CAB plus RPV should not be administered in patients treated with rifampicin or rifabutin, patients with virological failure or patients with resistance to CAB or RPV, or patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

        "abstract": "The advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has marked a significant milestone in the therapeutic landscape of hepatitis C, greatly improving treatment efficacy. A therapeutic regimen encompassing sofosbuvir (SOF), velpatasvir (VEL), and voxilaprevir (VOX) has demonstrated strong efficacy across all genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and has recently been incorporated into the Korean healthcare system. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of these antivirals in the South Korean population. This prospective, multicenter, observational study enrolled patients with chronic HCV treated with SOF/VEL-based regimens at six hospitals between November 2022 and January 2024. DAA-naïve patients received SOF/VEL ± ribavirin for 12 weeks. Patients who had failed prior DAA therapy received SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Among 101 patients treated with SOF/VEL, the mean age was 64.71 years, and 40.9% were male. Genotypes 1b and 2 were identified in 40.6% and 59.4% of patients, respectively. Two patients had a history of interferon-based treatment. The mean baseline HCV RNA level was 3,088,097 IU/mL. Cirrhosis was observed in 26.7% of patients (21.8% compensated; 5.0% decompensated). Of the 101 patients, 12 were lost to follow-up. Among the 89 patients who completed follow-up, SVR12 was achieved in 100.0% (89/89), including 5 patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In the SOF/VEL/VOX group, 17 patients were treated. The mean age was 61.84 years, 29.4% were male, and four had compensated cirrhosis. One patient was lost to follow-up. SVR12 was achieved in 100.0% (16/16) of the patients who completed follow-up. No serious adverse events (≥grade 3) were reported in either group during the DAA treatment period. In this first prospective real-world study in South Korea, SOF/VEL-based regimens demonstrated excellent efficacy and safety, achieving 100% SVR12 in the per-protocol population, including patients with cirrhosis and prior treatment failure.",

However, it is used in our country for treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. This study aims to present real-world data from Türkiye on CHC patients treated with SOF/VEL/VOX. The present study was conducted by the Viral Hepatitis Study Group of the Turkish Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (KLİMİK). It was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. The data were collected from patients receiving SOF/VEL/VOX therapy at 12 medical centers in Türkiye between 1 June 2022 and 31 December 2024. The patients had received the treatment for 8 to 12 weeks. Of the 139 patients enrolled, 63.3% (<i>n</i> = 88) were male, with a mean age of 54.4 years. Most patients were non-cirrhotic (94.2%, <i>n</i> = 131) and treatment-naïve (92%, <i>n</i> = 128); 49.6% (<i>n</i> = 69) were infected with genotype 1b. Early virologic response (EVR) could be assessed in 126 patients, with an EVR rate of 82.5% (<i>n</i> = 104). End-of-treatment data were available for 113 patients, all achieving an end-of-treatment response. Among the 80 patients for whom week-12 post-treatment data were available, 97.5% sustained virologic response at week 12 (SVR12). Significant improvements were observed in AST, ALT, and platelet levels, along with reductions in APRI and FIB-4 scores (<i>p</i> = 0.001).\" No serious adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported. Mild adverse events included pruritus (2.1%, <i>n</i> = 3), fatigue (2.1%, <i>n</i> = 3), and nausea (1.4%, <i>n</i> = 2). The SOF/VEL/VOX combination is a highly effective and well-tolerated treatment option in treatment-naïve CHC patients, achieving an SVR12 rate of 97.5%.",

We systematically analyzed 13 studies (15 cohorts, <i>n</i> = 1529 patients) from PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, and CNKI (through April 2025). A bivariate model evaluated HBcrAg's predictive performance for relapse outcomes, including virological relapse, clinical relapse, and hepatitis flares. HBcrAg demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75-0.86) and specificity of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67-0.76) for relapse prediction, with a diagnostic odds ratio of 10.66 (95% CI: 7.36-15.42) and summary AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80-0.86). Subgroup analysis identified threshold effects as the primary source of heterogeneity, which resolved (I<sup>2</sup> < 13%) after excluding studies with outlier cutoff values. Meta-regression established that HBcrAg's predictive value was unaffected by age, sex, hepatitis B e antigen status, or detection methods (<i>p</i> > 0.05). HBcrAg is validated as a robust non-invasive biomarker to optimize treatment cessation strategies, with high sensitivity providing strong negative predictive value in CHB populations. Future research should prioritize multi-marker models to enhance prediction accuracy.",

The aim of the study is to investigate long-term changes in controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and metabolic profile after sustained virological response (SVR) post-direct acting antivirals (DAAs) in PWH. This is a retrospective observational study including individuals with HIV/HCV coinfection, followed as outpatients at San Raffaele Hospital, who achieved SVR post-DAAs. Individuals were assessed for metabolic parameters before and after the start of DAAs. Univariate and multivariate mixed linear models were calculated to estimate crude mean changes in CAP, metabolic parameters, and weight; slopes were reported with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Overall, during a median follow-up of 4.02 years (interquartile range, IQR 3.04-4.80), the mean percent increase in CAP was 2.86/year (<i>p</i> < 0. 0001), and the mean decrease in stiffness was -4.28 (<i>p</i> = 0.003).

This study characterized humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with HEV239 or natural HEV infection in healthy Bangladeshi women aged 16-39 years. Using dual IFNγ and IL-4 ELISpot assays, we found robust, predominantly Th1-mediated cellular responses at 30 days after the third vaccine dose, comparable to responses during acute infection. Longitudinal antibody assessments confirmed sustained antibody production, primarily against the E2 domain of genotypes 1 and 3, persisting up to two years post-vaccination. Despite limitations related to sample size and assay sensitivity, our findings underscore the immunogenic potential of HEV239 and support a broader use in HEV-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that earlier in February 2020 the WHO had named COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). There were neither drugs nor vaccines that were known to be effective against the virus, stimulating an urgent worldwide search for treatments. An evaluation of existing drugs by 'repurposing' was initiated followed by a transition to de novo drug discovery. Repurposing of an already approved drug may accelerate the introduction of that drug into clinical use by circumventing early, including preclinical studies otherwise essential for a de novo drug and reducing development costs. Early in the pandemic three drugs were identified as repurposing candidates for the treatment of COVID-19: (i) hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus; (ii) ivermectin, an antiparasitic approved for both human and veterinary use; (iii) remdesivir, an anti-viral originally developed to treat hepatitis C. The scientific evidence, both for and against the efficacy of these three drugs as treatments for COVID-19, vied with public demand and politicization as unqualified opinions clashed with evidence-based medicine.

Their compositions are versatile, depending on their structures, including the number of rings in the polyphenol composition. Based on these attributes, polyphenols can be classified as flavanols, anthocyanins, flavones, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans. Polyphenols mainly possess inhibition of viral replication, interference with viral protein synthesis, and modulation of immune responses, providing significant antiviral effects against several viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, and influenza. They are crucial for medical compounds in diverse, versatile treatments, namely in diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative problems. Plants are the primary source of bioactive molecules, which are valued for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities. Especially, polyphenols are extracted as the most abundant bioactive compounds of plants. Moreover, viral infections are one of the major factors in illnesses and diseases, along with bacteria and fungi. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies report antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, Mayaro virus, dengue virus, herpesvirus, and influenza A virus, though clinical validation remains limited. Additionally, inhibition of viral entry, interference with viral replication, modulation of host immune response, and direct virucidal effects were examined.",

Among over 4.5 million patients with chronic hepatitis B, the prevalence of HIV and HCV coinfection ranged from 0.05 to 0.07% and 0.77 to 1.00%, respectively. Patients with HBV/HCV coinfection were older and had significantly higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and major adverse liver outcomes, including hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation, compared to other groups. HBV/HIV coinfection was more common in younger males and was associated with higher dyslipidemia. The use of HBV antivirals increased over time across all groups.

This non-systematic informative review considers transdisciplinary perspectives, regional data, and published literature connecting context to the disproportionate HCV burden experienced by First Nations populations in the prairie provinces of Canada, and offers examples of participatory and community-led initiatives working toward the elimination of HCV as a public health threat. First Nations in Canada are disproportionately impacted by chronic HCV infection, with a reported rate of newly diagnosed HCV cases in First Nations communities five times the respective rate in the general Canadian population in 2022. This review explores the reasons underlying the disproportionate burden of HCV infection. Significant over-representation of First Nations in the Canadian Prairies is seen in the major risk categories for HCV acquisition, and the impact of these risk factors is aggravated by barriers to accessing healthcare services and medication coverage. These barriers stem from the legacy of colonialism, discrimination, disenfranchisement, and are exacerbated by stigmatization, victimization, and racism in the justice and healthcare systems. Other contributory factors that impede access to care include inadequate healthcare clinic staffing and infrastructure in First Nations communities, and significant geographical distances between First Nations reserves and laboratories, pharmacies, and treating/prescribing healthcare providers. Recent recognition of historical harms and early steps towards nation-to-nation reconciliation, along with support for culturally connected, holistic, and First Nations-led wellness programs, instill hope that elimination strategies to eradicate HCV infection in First Nations populations will be successful in Canada.",

We have retrieved 2485 relevant publications published over the past 24 years. A 481-fold increase in global annual publications in this field was observed. China was identified as the most productive country, while the United States demonstrated the highest research impact. For the contributor, Yang Tao (University of Toledo, USA) and the University of Florida (USA) have emerged as the most influential contributors. Among journals, the highest number of articles was published in Nutrients (n = 135), which also achieved the highest citation count (n = 5397). The emergence of novel research hotspots was indicated by high-frequency keywords, mainly \"hypertensive disorders of pregnancy\", \"mendelian randomization\", \"gut-heart axis\", and \"hepatitis B virus\". \"Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)\" and \"receptor\" may represent promising new research frontiers in the gut microbiota-hypertension nexus.

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the development of numerous prognostic models for patient assessment. However, the potential utility of the predisposition, insult/infection, response, organ dysfunction (PIRO) score in evaluating COVID-19 severity and outcomes remains unexplored, presenting a gap in current research. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 374 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were admitted to the emergency department of Beijing Youan Hospital. Demographic data, treatment regimens, and seven prognostic scoring systems, including PIRO, were evaluated. To evaluate the models' prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) analysis was employed. Comparative performance between scoring systems was quantified using the DeLong method for paired ROC curves. Of the 374 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 120 (32.1%) died within 28 day of hospitalization. Significant disparities were observed between survivors and non-survivors regarding age, laboratory parameters, and clinical scores. Analysis of patient distribution and mortality rates across different score ranges revealed a positive correlation between score magnitude and 28-day mortality. The PIRO score demonstrated superior prognostic capability, yielding an AUC of 0.898 (95% CI 0.866-0.929). The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score followed closely (AUC 0.882, 95% CI 0.849-0.914). Both critical illness risk score (COVID-GRAM) and national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) exhibited AUCs exceeding 0.85 (COVID-GRAM 0.854, 95% CI 0.812-0.895; NEWS2: 0.851, 95% CI 0.813-0.889). DeLong test analysis revealed statistically significant differences in AUC between PIRO and confusion, urea, respiration, systolic pressure, age ≥ 65 (CURB-65), pneumonia severity index (PSI), COVID-GRAM, rapid acute physiology score (RAPS), and NEWS2 (all p < 0.05). Analysis revealed the PIRO scoring system as a robust predictor of 28-day mortality among COVID-19 cases presenting to the emergency setting, offering potential refinement of risk stratification and clinical management strategies.",

        "abstract": "HCC is the most common primary liver cancer, ranking as the sixth most prevalent cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Etiological factors include:chronic liver diseases driven by alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, obesity, and metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence also suggests that gut microbiome alterations and subsequent immune and metabolic dysregulation contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of HCC. The gut-liver axis represents a dynamic interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, modulated by the gut microbiome, microbial metabolites, and immune responses. This bidirectional communication plays a pivotal role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and immune surveillance, while its dysregulation is implicated in various pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gut microbiome, through microbial dysbiosis and metabolite secretion, significantly influences the tumor microenvironment and immune evasion mechanisms in HCC. Perturbations in gut barrier function and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation drive chronic inflammation, promoting tumor progression. Moreover, microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, modulate inflammatory and metabolic pathways, offering novel insights into disease pathogenesis and potential biomarkers. Therapeutic strategies, including probiotics, prebiotics, and immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate promise in reprogramming the gut microbiome and restoring immune balance in HCC management. This review explores the multifaceted roles of the gut-liver axis in pathogenesis, the contributions of the intra-tumoral microbiome, and the potential of microbial metabolites as therapeutic avenues. A deeper understanding of these interactions could pave the way for innovative, targeted interventions in liver cancer and other gut-liver axis-associated diseases.",

        "abstract": "Hepatic fibrosis progression involves complex multicellular crosstalk, highlighting the critical need to identify key therapeutic targets. In this study, we identify insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) as a marker specifically enriched in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and upregulated in viral hepatitis-associated fibrosis. Using thioacetamide (TAA)-induced mouse models and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-stimulated cell models, we demonstrate the pro-fibrotic role of IGFBP6. Through network pharmacology screening, pantothenic acid (PA) is identified as a potent compound targeting IGFBP6. PA administration significantly reduces collagen deposition, attenuates HSCs' activation, and decreases hepatic fibrosis-related markers. Notably, PA maintains efficacy in mouse models with established fibrosis. Mechanistically, PA directly interacts with IGFBP6, inducing ubiquitin-dependent degradation and inhibiting TGF-β/SMADs signaling. This study identifies IGFBP6 as a driver of hepatic fibrosis and validates PA as a potent therapeutic agent. Therefore, targeting IGFBP6 with PA offers a potential clinical treatment strategy for hepatic fibrosis.",

Extensive research has demonstrated that adaptive immunity serves as the primary defense mechanism against HBV infection, predominantly mediated through the HBV-specific T cells and antibodies. Notably, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling, a crucial pathway in inducing type I interferons (IFN-I) and orchestrating innate immunity, has been increasingly recognized for its involvement in anti-HBV responses. Also, studies have stated that HBV-derived components can modulate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, subsequently regulating IFN-I production and shaping anti-HBV responses. In this review, we discuss the relationship between cGAS-STING signaling pathway and HBV infection.

We aimed to characterise the current clinical and virologic features of HDV infection in both native Italians and migrants. We enrolled 515 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with detectable anti-HDV antibodies from 32 Italian centres between August 2022 and July 2024; all patients underwent centralised virologic assessment. Overall, 432 out of 515 (83.9%) patients were HDV-RNA-positive (4.39, 1.30-5.82 Log IU/mL; 99.0% HDV genotype-1). HDV-RNA levels correlated with ALT (r<sub>s</sub> = 0575, 0.514-0.630) and hepatitis B core-related antigen (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.521, 0.455-0.581). Native Italians (n = 317; 61.6%) were older than migrants (n = 198; 38.4%) (median age: 60, 55-65 vs. 46, 39-54 years; p < 0.001) and were more frequently male (68.1% vs. 49.5%; p < 0.001), with a higher prevalence of liver cirrhosis (70.3% vs. 50.5%; p < 0.001) and hepatocellular carcinoma (14.8% vs. 0.5%; p < 0.001). Among Italians, 223 (70.3%) had liver cirrhosis, 46 (14.5%) had chronic hepatitis D (CHD) without cirrhosis and 48 (15.1%) exhibited inactive/minimal disease with low viremia (≤ 3 Log IU/mL). Among migrants, 100 (50.5%) had liver cirrhosis, 58 (29.3%) had CHD and 40 (20.2%) showed inactive/minimal disease with low viremia (≤ 3 Log IU/mL). The current clinical landscape of chronic HDV infections in Italy is heterogeneous, changing the perspective of CHD as uniformly severe; although cirrhosis remains common, a substantial proportion of both native Italians and migrants present with milder forms of disease.",

The exact prevalence remains unknown but is estimated at 1 in 500.000 for PFIC 3, caused by mutations in the ABCB4 gene. We report three cases of PFIC 3 from the patient's sister, brother, and cousin, diagnosed in our Pediatric Department in 2022-2023. <b>Case Presentation:</b> Case 1: A 10-year-old girl was admitted for jaundice and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with severely advanced hepatic cirrhosis and massive cholestasis. Genetic testing showed ABCB4 homozygous mutation. She rapidly developed fulminant liver failure, and a living donor liver transplant was performed. Case 2: A 6-year-old brother was previously diagnosed with cholestatic hepatitis of unknown cause back in 2018 and presented with similar features (generalized jaundice, severe pruritus with generalized scratching lesions); symptoms had progressively developed from the first year of life. He also exhibited particular facial features (big forehead, twisted ear lobe, straight nose). He received cadaveric liver transplantation. Case 3: Nephew of first two children, a 3-year-5-month-old boy, was admitted for failure to thrive and a one-year history of jaundice, pruritus, and splenomegaly. He was tested positive for homozygous ABCB4 mutation. He is currently under medical treatment with stable liver function. <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical significance of this particular homozygous variant identified in ABCB4 in our series of cases (c.2534G>T (p.Gly845Val)) was uncertain up to this case report.

        "abstract": "The management of retained orthopedic hardware during amputation procedures presents significant challenges. A case utilizing a modified Gritti-Stokes through-knee amputation to address a periprosthetic fracture with an exposed intramedullary nail (IMN) in a patient with multiple comorbidities is reported. A 47-year-old male with a history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with a left femoral periprosthetic supracondylar fracture. The patient had an existing IMN from a previous femoral shaft fracture 20 years prior, along with a left below-knee amputation. Due to the newly occurred periprosthetic fracture and the patient's immunocompromised status, further amputation was deemed necessary. However, removal of the well-integrated IMN posed significant risks. A modified Gritti-Stokes through-knee amputation was performed, adapting the procedure to use the patella as a biological cap to cover the exposed IMN tip. At 4-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated satisfactory wound healing and stable positioning of the patellar cap. The patient achieved ambulation with an above-knee prosthesis and crutch assistance, reporting high satisfaction and no pain or discomfort. This case highlights the versatility of the Gritti-Stokes procedure in addressing complex scenarios involving retained hardware. By utilizing the patella as a biological cover for the exposed IMN, the risks associated with hardware removal was avoided while achieving a stable, well-healed amputation stump. This modification of the Gritti-Stokes technique offers a viable solution for patients with retained IMNs requiring through-knee amputation, particularly in cases where hardware removal is contraindicated or highly risky.",

To investigate how bacterial co-infection affects HBV clearance, we used a mouse model with chronic HBV replication and Klebsiella pneumoniae co-infection. We evaluated HBV virological markers, innate immune responses, inflammation, and intrahepatic HBV-specific T cell responses, with and without antibiotic treatment or MDSCs depletion. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial co-infection activates innate immunity and inflammation in the liver, leading to initial activation followed by exhaustion of HBV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which delays HBV clearance. Antibiotic treatment alleviated inflammation and restored HBV elimination, while MDSCs depletion exacerbated inflammation and induced premature exhaustion of HBV-specific T cells. These results suggest that bacterial co-infection disrupts HBV-specific T cell responses and impairs HBV clearance, with MDSCs playing an indispensable role in indirectly regulating T cell activation, primarily through modulating the innate immune response and inflammatory pathways.",

We developed a quality improvement project to address persistent challenges to HCV treatment at one primary care clinic. Challenges addressed included barriers to accessing specialist care to receive antiviral treatment and lack of patient resources, education, and awareness. Recognizing the potential for primary care providers to bridge treatment gaps, our initiative at an urban family medicine residency clinic in a large Midwest city targeted a patient population diagnosed with HCV but who remained untreated. Searching the medical record, we identified 40 eligible patients who had not received treatment despite a positive HCV diagnosis. Enrolled participants were asked to report their awareness, perceived barriers, and willingness to receive treatment in a primary care setting via a phone-assisted survey. A total of 16 patients completed the survey (response rate 40%). Eighty-two percent were aware of their diagnosis, and 68.8% had not completed treatment. Only seven (43.8%) understood what an HCV infection is, while eight (50.0%) were aware that untreated HCV can lead to liver damage and cancer. Six (37.5%) claimed not to understand what an HCV infection is, and five reported that a medical professional had never explained it to them. Most respondents (81.2%) expressed a desire to initiate a treatment regimen and preferred to receive treatment at their primary care clinic. In an urban primary care residency clinic, HCV treatment is both possible and desired by patients.",

The Sicilian Network for Therapy, Epidemiology and Screening in Hepatology (SINTESI) runs an HCV point-of-care project in all 23 prisons in Sicily. All prisoners received information on HCV screening and the possibility of receiving treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy during imprisonment. HCV status was assessed by rapid oral test and immediate reflex testing for HCV-RNA by Xpert HCV Viral Load. HCV-RNA-positive subjects received DAA therapy within 72 hours of screening. The project was conducted from October 18, 2021, through March 24, 2023. Among 5912 prisoners (98% of the entire prison population) informed of the screening project, 5050 (85.4%) accepted HCV testing. The mean age was 41.8 years (range, 18-86 years), and 4843 (95.9%) were males. Overall, 245 subjects (4.8%) tested positive for anti-HCV. Among 245 anti-HCV-positive prisoners, 20 (8.1%) refused the HCV-RNA test; 100 (40.9%) tested negative (80 had a previous DAA treatment) and 125 (51.1%) tested positive for HCV-RNA. Twelve (4.9%) of the latter refused treatment, whereas 113 (46.2%) started a cycle of DAA drugs during imprisonment. Of these, 99 (87.9%) completed DAA therapy, and 98 (86.7%) obtained HCV clearance. The findings highlight the importance of tailored interventions for high-risk populations, and the model is replicable in other regions and contexts.",

Chronic Hepatitis B infection can be identified by the simultaneous use of virological, serological and biochemical markers involved in monitoring the progression of the disease. In Africa, only 1% of people infected are screened, and few benefit from antiviral treatment. This study aimed to determine the relationship between serological, biochemical and virological markers involved in the follow-up of patients with chronic viral hepatitis B virus infection at the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun. we conducted a cross-sectional study of patients' electronic records registered in the Laboratory Information System of the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun from 2011 to 2021. HBs antigen-positive patients with viral load, HBe antigen and liver transaminases assays were included. Chronic HBV infection phases were classified in 5 phases according to EASL which are: Phase 1: HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection, Phase 2: HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, Phase 3: HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection, Phase 4: HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, Phase 5: HBsAg-negative phase. we registered 1652 patients, 43.9% females and 56.1% males. The median age of women and men was 31 [>25;38] years and 33 [6;40] years respectively. The transaminase levels were normal in the most patients (65.5% for ALT and 76.2% for AST), low Hepatitis B viral load (<2000 IU/mL) in 68.5% of cases and 90.1% were negative for HBe antigen. Regarding viral Hepatitis B stage, 3.4%, 6.5% and 28.1% were in stage 1,2 and 4 respectively. Most (62.0%) fell in stage 3 representing the mild HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. our results show that a high proportion of HBV-infected patients referred at Centre Pasteur du Cameroun are at a mild stage of disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Effective handling of healthcare waste is paramount for infection prevention, particularly in fragile environments such as Somalia. When infectious and sharps waste are not appropriately segregated and disposed of, Infectious diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis can spread due to improper waste segregation and disposal, which poses a serious threat to public health. This study aims to assess the infectious and sharps waste management practices and waste segregation in Somalia's healthcare facilities. A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022/2023 by UNICEF, WHO, and the Federal Ministry of Health in Somalia. Data were collected from 423 healthcare facilities out of 1,410 using the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) questionnaire. Simple random sampling ensured an objective and representative assessment. Based on our study, more than 60% of healthcare facilities lacked proper waste segregation systems, and many reported insufficient colour-coded or covered bins. For infectious garbage, incineration was the most common approach (33.57%), whereas for sharps waste, pit burning was the most common option (52.48%). Geographic location and the type of waste management strategies used were significantly correlated (p < 0.001), indicating regional inequalities. These results draw attention to the numerous discrepancies and structural shortcomings in current systems for managing medical waste. Addressing gaps in waste management through policy enforcement, funding, and healthcare worker training is paramount to reducing healthcare-associated infections and improving healthcare safety in Somalia.",

        "abstract": "Liver transplantation (LT) provides a potential cure for hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF). We aimed to develop and externally validate a prognostic model to predict 1-year post-LT mortality in patients with HBV-ACLF. This retrospective, nationwide, observational cohort study was conducted at ten high-volume LT centres in China. 4378 adult patients who underwent primary LT between January 2015 and December 2021 were screened, and those with HBV-ACLF according to the COSSH-ACLF criteria (separated into three ACLF grades based on the number of organ failures) were included. The HBV-ACLF LT (HALT) model was developed in the derivation cohort and validated in the external testing cohort. The derivation cohort were derived from two LT centres in one province (Zhejiang). The external testing cohort were derived from eight LT centres in two provinces. For model development, univariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with 1-year post-LT mortality. Variables with univariable <i>p</i> < 0.05 were entered into the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analysis for further feature selection. 10-fold cross validation was used to choose the optimal lambda (penalty for the number of features) of the Lasso model. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to construct the HALT model based on the risk factors selected by Lasso analysis. Primary outcome was survival rate at 1-year after LT. Secondary outcomes were short-term (28- and 90-day) and long-term survival after LT (3- and 5-year). Model performance was compared with eight other models (COSSH-ACLF II, COSSH-ACLF, CLIF-C ACLF, AARC, MELD, MELD-Na, SALT-M and TAM scores), using receiver operating characteristic curve and C-index values. A nomogram was developed to analyse the probability of the primary outcome in different graft-recipient combinations based on recipient factors (age, number of organ failures [OF], lactate) and graft factors (donation after circulatory death [DCD] and cold ischaemia time [CIT]). Between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 1, 2021, 668 patients were included (derivation cohort, n = 418; external testing cohort, n = 250), with survival rates of 88.0%, 81.1%, 77.5%, 75.6% and 72.1% at 28-day, 90-day, 1-year, 3-year and 5-year post-LT, respectively. Three recipient's factors (age, number of OF and arterial lactate concentration) as well as two graft's parameters (DCD and CIT) were independently associated with 1-year post-LT mortality in the derivation cohort (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). The HALT model was established accordingly, showing better discriminative performance (C-index, 0.791) than eight current models in the external testing cohort (C-index, 0.529-0.627; all <i>p</i> < 0.001). If the sickest patients (age >55 years, OFs ≥3 and lactate ≥2.5 mmol/L) received high-risk grafts (DCD and CIT >10 h), the estimated 1-year post-LT mortality was 85.6%. The HALT model showed superior predictive ability over eight current models and may help for LT candidate selection and optimal organ allocation. Though the findings need to be verified in prospective studies and among different patient populations.

        "abstract": "Pseudoprogression is an atypical response pattern to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), characterized by initial tumor enlargement or the appearance of new lesions, followed by subsequent tumor regression. While this phenomenon has been observed in several solid tumors, its occurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare and not well understood, presenting diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We report the first female case of HCC pseudoprogression during atezolizumab and bevacizumab therapy. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B-related advanced HCC. After multiple prior treatments, she was started on combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab. Following four treatment cycles, imaging revealed tumor enlargement and new small lesions, suggestive of disease progression. However, her serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level had decreased from 45,598 ng/mL to 23,719 ng/mL, and there was no clinical deterioration. Based on these findings, treatment was continued. Imaging after eight and 12 cycles demonstrated marked tumor regression and the normalization of AFP (<2 ng/mL), confirming a diagnosis of pseudoprogression. Although uncommon, pseudoprogression should be considered during ICI therapy for HCC. The accurate interpretation of radiologic findings in conjunction with clinical status and tumor markers is essential to avoid the premature discontinuation of potentially effective treatments. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, predictive markers, and clinical significance of pseudoprogression in HCC.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a severe public health problem affecting nearly 3% of the world population. Of those affected, approximately 80% develop chronic infections. Initiating treatment through HCV RNA testing remains challenging, especially in resource-limited settings where access to molecular diagnostics is restricted. In this study, a novel and inexpensive HCV molecular diagnostic approach based on on-chip reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) integrated with image intensity measurement and machine learning-based prediction (RT-LAMP-IM-MLP) is developed. This method uses a low-cost microfluidic chip to carry out RT-LAMP (total cost of each test: <$4) and enables rapid, user-friendly, accurate, and quantitative detection of HCV RNA in blood plasma. Amplified products are visualized under fluorescence excitation and the captured image is processed using the OpenCV package in Python, followed by training and prediction through a modified random forest algorithm. When tested on plasma samples positive for HCV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), or from healthy individuals, the RT-LAMP-IM-MLP method demonstrates 97.1% sensitivity, 96.9% specificity, and 97% overall accuracy. Compared to the reference method, the real-time PCR-based COBAS® TaqMan® HCV assay (Roche Diagnostics, USA), our assay can detect HCV RNA concentrations as low as 10 IU mL<sup>-1</sup> (60 fg μL<sup>-1</sup>). Further, only 0.5 μL of dye is used for fluorescence labeling compared to larger quantities required in colorimetric assays. Therefore, the proposed sensitive and specific detection scheme may serve as an inexpensive and reliable point-of-care (POC) test for detecting HCV RNA in clinical samples.",

A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the potential targets and signaling pathways of the Li Qi Dao Tan Decoction (LQDTD) in the treatment of schizophrenia using network pharmacology and molecular docking technology. The traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform database was searched to obtain the active ingredients and targets of the LQDTD. Databases such as GeneCards, DrugBank, and OMIM were searched for schizophrenia-related disease targets. By drawing a Venn diagram, the intersection targets of LQDTD and schizophrenia were obtained. The STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction. The online tool of the DAVID database was used to analyze the gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of the intersection targets of LQDTD and schizophrenia. The Cytoscape software was employed to construct the network of traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, targets, and pathways. AutoDock, Chem3D, and PyMOL software facilitated molecular docking and the calculation of binding energy for the identified key active ingredients and targets, from which the 7 pairs with the lowest binding energy were selected. PyMOL was utilized for analysis and visualization. We identified 5 active ingredients of LQDTD: luteolin, nobiletin, baicalin, quercetin and licochalcone A. Key proteins, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, TP53, and EGFR, were identified through the protein-protein interaction map. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that the pathways involved primarily included lipid and atherosclerosis pathways, hepatitis B virus-related pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, Chemical carcinogenesis receptor activation, and prostate cancer signaling pathways. The treatment of schizophrenia may influence key proteins such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, TP53, and EGFR, intervening in lipid and atherosclerotic pathways, hepatitis B virus-related pathways, AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, chemical carcinogenesis receptor activation, and prostate cancer signaling pathways. However, the exact mechanisms of action require further experimental verification.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of autoimmune liver disease in Sjogren syndrome (SS) ranges from 1.7% to 47%. Hematologic involvement is commonly observed in SS patients, with 1.5% of patients presenting with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Chronic antigenic stimulation of B lymphocytes in autoimmune diseases may eventually lead to clonal proliferation or MGUS. Nevertheless, studies reporting the concurrent manifestation of IgG4-related autoimmune hepatitis (IgG4-AIH), Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), SS, and MGUS are scarce. This article reports a rare case involving the overlap of multiple autoimmune diseases. A middle-aged female patient experienced fatigue, anorexia, xerostomia, jaundice, and pruritus, as well as elevated levels of liver enzymes, globulin, and monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein). Based on the findings of serum IgG4 levels, autoimmune serology, liver and labial gland biopsy, and bone marrow puncture, a diagnosis of IgG4-AIH, PBC, SS, and MGUS was made. The patient was initiated on oral prednisone 40 mg once daily and ursodeoxycholic acid capsules 250 mg 3 times daily. Upon stabilization of the condition, prednisone was progressively tapered to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily. Over the 6-month follow-up period, favorable improvements were noted in the patient's symptoms. The purpose of this report's research is to thoroughly describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and treatment difficulties associated with the rare co-existence of multiple autoimmune diseases and hematological diseases, and to summarize the management methods. The significance of this study lies in emphasizing the importance of screening for autoimmune diseases and hematological diseases in patients presenting similar symptoms in clinical practice, aiming to provide a reference for clinicians in identifying and managing such complex cases, thereby enhancing the understanding and treatment level of these diseases.",

This study uses machine learning models to predict NAFLD in patients with inactive CHB. It builds on previous research by employing classification algorithms to analyze demographic, clinical, and laboratory data to identify NAFLD predictors. <b>Methods</b>: A single-center cross-sectional study was conducted, including 450 inactive CHB patients from Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. Five ML models were developed: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). <b>Results</b>: The prevalence of NAFLD was 50.22%. Among the machine learning models, Random Forest achieved the highest performance with an ROC AUC of 0.983 (95% CI: 0.952-0.999), followed by XGBoost at 0.977 (95% CI: 0.938-0.999) and MLP at 0.963 (95% CI: 0.915-0.995). SVM also showed strong performance with an AUC of 0.949 (95% CI: 0.897-0.985), while Logistic Regression demonstrated comparatively lower discrimination with an AUC of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.799-0.952). Key predictive features identified included platelet count, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Logistic Regression highlighted platelet count as the most significant negative predictor, while LDL and ALT were positive contributors. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study shows the utility of ML in improving the identification and management of NAFLD in CHB patients, enabling targeted interventions.

This study included 564 patients with HCC: 254 with MASLD-HCC and 310 with VIRAL-HCC. The SNPs were determined by real-time PCR using TaqMan assays. The mean ages of patients with MASLD-HCC and VIRAL-HCC were 68.4 vs. 60.9 years (<i>p</i> < 0.001), with a significant difference between groups. The prevalence of <i>PNPLA3</i> GG genotype in MASLD-HCC was significantly higher in MASLD-HCC than in VIRAL-HCC (24.0% vs. 15.5%, OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.14-3.05, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Similarly, the prevalence of <i>TM6SF2</i> TT genotype in MASLD-HCC and VIRAL-HCC was 7.1% vs. 2.6% (OR = 3.39, 95% CI = 1.36-9.21, <i>p</i> = 0.003), while <i>HSD17B13</i> GG genotype in the corresponding groups was 7.1% vs. 12.6% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.27-1.01, <i>p</i> = 0.039). The overall median survival of MASLD-HCC was significantly shorter than that of the VIRAL-HCC group (42 vs. 66 months, <i>p</i> = 0.035). In Cox regression hazard analysis, <i>HSD17B13</i> GG genotype was significantly associated with a lower mortality rate in MASLD-HCC (HR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.18-0.81, <i>p</i> = 0.011). In contrast, <i>PNPLA3</i> and <i>TM6SF2</i> were not associated with overall survival in patients with MASLD-HCC or VIRAL-HCC.

        "abstract": "The capsid protein plays a crucial role in the viral life cycle. By interacting with the viral genome, it facilitates the assembly of the nucleocapsid, ultimately leading to the formation of the viral particle. Therefore, interfering with or disrupting the interaction between the capsid protein and viral genome can effectively inhibit viral replication and infection. This review focuses on elucidating the binding mechanisms between the capsid protein and the viral genome, as well as their potential applications as therapeutic targets. In particular, it summarizes the research progress on small-molecule drugs targeting the capsid-genome binding sites of dengue virus, HBV, and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, this review provides a detailed discussion on the mechanisms by which these small-molecule inhibitors interfere with the capsid-genome interaction, aiming to offer inspiration for the future development of novel antiviral drugs targeting the capsid-genome binding.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) specifically infects hepatocytes and has a complex life cycle owing to the stabilization and pooling of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. We previously reported that the suppression of dedicator of cytokinesis 11 (DOCK11) decreases cccDNA and HBV-DNA levels and identified it as a new HBV therapeutic target. The DOCK11-associated gene, Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulator tankyrase (TNKS), was identified using in vitro methods; however, its function in the HBV life cycle remains unknown. Here, we used various inhibitors, antagonists, and short-hairpin RNA treatments related to TNKS signaling in HBV-infected hepatocytes. The role of TNKS-related Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the HBV life cycle was evaluated using immunoprecipitation assays with DOCK11 and bulk RNA sequencing methods. TNKS and Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors significantly repressed cccDNA and HBV-DNA levels. Conversely, certain Wnt/β-catenin signaling agonists enhanced the HBV life cycle. DOCK11 directly binds to β-catenin to regulate HBV using its nuclear transport system. SKL2001, normally used as a Wnt/β-catenin signaling agonist, strongly reduced cccDNA in HBV-infected hepatocytes and in combination with entecavir predominantly eradicated HBV without cytotoxicity. Therefore, DOCK11 and other Wnt/β-catenin signaling molecules may be therapeutic targets to prevent persistent HBV infection.",

        "abstract": "Psoriasis, a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder, presents complex pathogenetic mechanisms potentially influenced by viral infections. This comprehensive study explored the possible interplay of resistance and viral infections among psoriasis patients using serological screening techniques. The investigation involved 90 patients aged 23-45 years, systematically examining viral seropositivity for HSV (herpes simplex virus), HZ (herpes zoster), HBV (hepatitis B virus), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and HCV (hepatitis C virus) through ELISA testing. The findings revealed notable active or recent viral infection rates: 8.9% HSV positivity, 2.2% HZ antibody detection, 4.4% HCV positivity, and 4.4% HIV positivity. The research can contribute to current knowledge gaps, broaden the knowledge regarding the relationship between psoriasis and viral infection, and assess resistance, as it can mediate the interaction. The results can lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, and patient care options. This study emphasizes the importance of thorough viral testing for psoriasis patients, as well as focused therapeutic regimens that take into account viral co-infections. It elucidates the complex networks of biological relationships between immune factors, contributes information that is critical to our understanding of the multifactorial etiology of psoriasis, and concludes with a strong argument for investigating the mechanisms of viral involvement in this chronic-relapsing inflammatory disease.",

        "abstract": "Rat hepatitis E virus (rat HEV) is an emerging zoonotic virus detected in rodents worldwide, with increasing evidence of presence in environmental sources such as surface water, wastewater and bivalves. This systematic review compiles and analyzes all the published research on rat HEV contamination in these matrices, as well as its implications for human health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Mendeley, including studies published up until 27 May 2025. Studies were included if they evaluated rat HEV in water- or food-related matrices using molecular detection. The risk of bias was not assessed. The certainty of evidence was not formally evaluated. Limitations include reliance on PCR methods without infectivity confirmation. Following PRISMA inclusion and exclusion criteria, eight eligible studies were analyzed. The results show high detection rates of rat HEV RNA in influent wastewater samples from several high-income European countries, namely Sweden, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Lower detection rates were found in effluent wastewater and surface waters in Sweden. In bivalve mollusks sampled in Brazil, rat HEV RNA was detected in 2.2% of samples. These findings show the widespread environmental presence of rat HEV, particularly in urban wastewater systems. While human infections by rat HEV have been documented, the true extent of rat HEV zoonotic potential remains unclear. Given the risks associated with this environmental rat HEV contamination, enhanced surveillance, standardized detection methods, and targeted monitoring programs in food production and water management systems are essential to mitigate potential public health threats. Establishing such programs will be crucial for understanding the impact of rat HEV on human health.",

A scoping review was performed by searching across three databases to identify systematic reviews that discussed hepatitis C in PWID within the context of harm reduction. The studies were then analyzed for success metrics used to describe hepatitis C in PWID. The indicators used were prevalence, incidence, screening, treatment uptake, treatment completion, and sustained virologic response. A total of fourteen systematic reviews were included. The most frequently reported indicators were prevalence and incidence, addressed in eight/seven systematic reviews, respectively. In contrast, screening, treatment uptake, and treatment completion were less commonly reported, with only two reviews addressing screening and treatment uptake, and a single review reporting treatment completion. Similarly, sustained virologic response (SVR) was reported in only two systematic reviews. Seven additional indicators were reported. Prevalence and incidence are the dominantly used HCV indicators, while others are often neglected. Inconsistencies in measurements and reporting can be found for all indicators. This study reports a gap regarding indicators beyond prevalence and incidence, inconsistent measurement approaches, and a lack of standardized frameworks.",

AAT has been reported to protect against renal injury via anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, its role in mitigating renal inflammation and reducing high blood pressure induced by salt-loading has never been studied. In this study, we salt-loaded 129Sv mice to induce hypertension and then administered purified human AAT (hAAT) or the vehicle to investigate whether renal inflammation and associated inflammatory/signaling pathways are mitigated. Western blotting and densitometric analysis showed administration of hAAT attenuated protein expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1), CD93, CD36, and the toll-like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR-2/4) in kidney lysates. Similarly, protein expression of two key inflammatory transcription factors, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-Kappa B were shown to be attenuated in the kidneys of 129Sv mice that received hAAT. Conversely, hAAT treatment upregulated the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and immunohistochemistry confirmed these findings. Purified hAAT administration may be efficacious in mitigating renal inflammation associated with the development of hypertension from salt-loading, potentially through a mechanism involving the reduction of pro-inflammatory and injury-associated proteins.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Aims:</b> Ornidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic, is widely used for protozoal and anaerobic infections and is generally considered safe. However, ornidazole-induced liver injury (OILI) is an underrecognized yet potentially severe adverse reaction. This multicenter study aims to characterize the clinical features, histopathology, and outcomes of OILI to improve the awareness and management of this rare entity worldwide. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective analysis of 101 patients with OILI from eight tertiary centers between 2006 and 2023. Cases were included based on liver enzyme elevations temporally linked to ornidazole and the exclusion of other causes. Causality was assessed using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score. Clinical data, laboratory parameters, autoantibody profiles, histology, treatments, and outcomes were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> OILI was classified as highly probable in 42.6% of cases (n = 43), probable in 51.5% of cases (n = 52), and possible in 5.9% (n = 6) of cases. The predominant pattern was acute hepatocellular injury (83.2%) (n = 84). Autoimmune-like hepatitis occurred in 5% of cases (n = 5), with ANA positivity in 16.8% of cases (n = 17). Corticosteroids were used in 24.8% of cases (n = 25) and were associated with higher ANA positivity and a 20% (n = 5) relapse rate post-discontinuation. Recovery was achieved in 87.7% of cases (n = 88), while 7.9% of cases (n = 8) required liver transplantation and 4% (n = 4) died. <b>Conclusions:</b> Ornidazole can cause serious idiosyncratic liver injury, including autoimmune phenotypes, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis. Given the notable risk of liver failure and death, early recognition, drug discontinuation, and close monitoring are essential. In select cases, corticosteroids and plasmapheresis may be beneficial, though the evidence remains limited.",

Accurate measurement of HDV RNA is critical for monitoring therapeutic responses, especially during treatment with novel therapies such as bulevirtide (BLV). This study compared the analytical performance of two HDV RNA quantification assays, Bosphore (Anatolia) and AltoStar<sup>®</sup> (Altona), focusing on their sensitivity, specificity, and potential implications for clinical management. Sixty-one clinical samples from twenty-four patients, including fifteen HDV-infected patients receiving BLV treatment and nine controls, were tested using each assay. Of 30 samples identified as HDV-negative by the Bosphore assay, 17 (56.7%) were HDV-positive with AltoStar<sup>®</sup>, demonstrating the superior sensitivity (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) of the latter assay. Quantitative analyses revealed consistently higher viral load measurements with AltoStar<sup>®</sup> compared to Bosphore, with a difference of 1.23 Log IU/mL and a moderate correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.7385) between assays. Each assay demonstrated a high specificity, with no false positives detected among control samples. However, our findings suggest that differences in assay sensitivity could impact the evaluation of virological response, highlighting the risk of false-negative results in chronically HDV-infected patients with low-level viremia. This emphasizes the need for careful assay selection to accurately monitor treatment outcomes.",

Initial screening of baseline candidate traits was conducted using PSM-balanced cases and controls. Subsequently, through multiple rounds of leave-one-covariate-out on the balanced cohorts, we validated the impact of these traits using survival analysis. <b>Results:</b> In total, 85 cases (mean age: 35.78; female/male: 23/62) were compared with 247 controls (mean age: 37.08; female/male: 80/167, out of 3666), with a median follow-up of 69.56 months. Steatosis and interferon (IFN) treatment were significantly more frequent in the cases, as confirmed by forest plots showing significant hazard ratios. During validation, whether through balancing all covariates or leave-one-covariate-out matching, both steatosis and exposure to IFN resulted in a higher number of functional cures and HBsAg seroconversions. Further comparisons revealed that add-on or monotherapy outperformed switching (from IFN to NUC), while the de novo (IFN + NUC, followed by NUC) approach was not observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> We confirmed that individuals with steatosis at baseline or those who received IFN were more likely to achieve HBsAg immune control, with monotherapy/add-on therapy being emphasized.",

In the past, the liver was not thought to undergo substantial age-related changes, nor was there thought to be any liver disease characteristic of older adults. Current studies challenge this perspective, revealing that ageing substantially influences liver pathophysiology at the organ level and within each of the liver cell types. These observations have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of liver diseases common in older adults, including hepatocellular carcinoma, hypoxic hepatitis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Previously, managing older patients with liver disease mostly addressed age-related changes in drug metabolism and liver function tests. However, current clinical practice increasingly emphasizes age-specific issues such as frailty, sarcopenia, multimorbidity and polypharmacy. Given the liver's pivotal role in systemic metabolism, immunity and detoxification, ageing of the liver can contribute to systemic diseases. In the future, interventions that target ageing biology might offer new treatment options for liver diseases. Here, we review those age-related changes in the liver that have substantial biological and clinical consequences for older adults.",

This evidence-based consensus statement summary provides recommendations for the assessment and monitoring of adults with MAFLD in primary care. Adults with type 2 diabetes, obesity or two or more other metabolic risk factors should be tested for MAFLD. Hepatic steatosis should be evaluated using ultrasound, whereas the presence and complications of type 2 diabetes and obesity should be assessed according to current Australian guidelines. Cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnoea are common in people with MAFLD and should be considered as part of a holistic health assessment. Alternative causes of hepatic steatosis, including excess alcohol consumption, must be considered, and patients with elevated serum aminotransferase levels should be tested for hepatitis B and C infection and iron overload. The risk of advanced liver fibrosis requires assessment using the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index; a low score (< 1.3) is associated with a more than 95% negative predictive value for advanced liver fibrosis. People with an indeterminate FIB-4 score (between 1.3 and 2.7) should undergo second-line assessment with liver elastography or a direct liver fibrosis serum test or, if these tests are unavailable, should be referred to an expert clinician in liver disease. People with MAFLD and a high FIB-4 score (> 2.7), an elevated direct liver fibrosis serum test, high elastography results or with clinical, laboratory or imaging evidence of cirrhosis should be referred for further evaluation. Individuals with a low FIB-4 score (< 1.3), low elastography or direct liver fibrosis serum test results should be monitored with a repeat FIB-4 test at least every three years. Monitoring of weight, body mass index and/or waist circumference and for emergence of type 2 diabetes (in individuals without) should be performed at least annually.

This review synthesizes current evidence on HCC epidemiology, highlighting both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors-including chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), excessive alcohol consumption, aflatoxin exposure, and genetic susceptibility. These diverse etiologies reflect not only biological mechanisms but also broader social and environmental determinants of health, emphasizing the need for integrated, population-level preventive strategies. Effective strategies across all levels of prevention are reviewed. Primordial and primary prevention strategies include public health policies, health education to raise awareness, universal hepatitis B vaccination, expanded access to antiviral therapies for HBV and HCV, lifestyle interventions targeting obesity and alcohol use, and environmental controls to reduce aflatoxin exposure. Secondary prevention focuses on early detection through viral hepatitis screening and routine HCC surveillance in high-risk populations. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce morbidity and mortality through timely treatment and multidisciplinary care. Despite the availability of effective tools, substantial implementation gaps remain persist. Underdiagnosis of viral hepatitis, low treatment uptake, inadequate surveillance coverage, and disparities in healthcare access continue to limit progress.

        "abstract": "In 2022, the FDA approved nivolumab-relatlimab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In the present study, we conducted a living pharmacovigilance study, integrating data from clinical trials and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, to assess the safety profile of nivolumab-relatlimab. Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) in trials of nivolumab-relatlimab available in electronic databases were systematically searched. The outcomes included were all-grade (grades 1-5) and high-grade (grades 3-5) TRAEs, considering both overall and individual aspects. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the incidence and risk ratio of TRAEs associated with nivolumab-relatlimab. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Adverse events reports were extracted from the FAERS database, and a disproportionality analysis was carried out to estimate the safety signals of AEs associated with nivolumab-relatlimab. A total of 12 trials were included, the incidence of all-grade and high-grade TRAEs for nivolumab-relatlimab was 74.11 % and 38.05 %, respectively. Compared with nivolumab monotherapy, therapy with nivolumab-relatlimab was associated with a significantly increased risk of high-grade TRAEs, and some individual specified all-grade TRAEs, including hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, rash, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, arthralgia and myalgia. Disproportionality analyses of FAERS pharmacovigilance data identified 39 positive signals, with 18 AEs not mentioned in the drug label. Nivolumab-relatlimab showed significantly higher reporting frequencies for 15 AEs than nivolumab monotherapy. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential safety profile of nivolumab-relatlimab, the results of this living study will be updated to incorporate new, robust evidence as it becomes available.",

        "title": "Prevalence of hepatitis D virus in chronic hepatitis B patients: findings from Poland.",
        "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B/hepatitis D virus (HBV/HDV) co-infections in eastern Poland. We included consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) in the study, in whom we performed anti-HDV assays verified by molecular testing. The analysed population consisted of 398 patients, predominantly male with a median age of 50 years, 58.3 ​% of whom had comorbidities. Forty-three patients (10.8 ​%) were diagnosed with cirrhosis. Patients were treated with entecavir, tenofovir, or lamivudine for a median of 5 years. At the start of treatment, the median viral load was 5110 IU/ml, and 98 ​% of patients achieved viral eradication during the therapy. In the study population, anti-HDV antibodies were detected in 6 patients (1.5 ​%), 3 men and 3 women, of whom in 1 (0.25 ​%) the presence of genetic material of the HDV was confirmed by molecular testing. Among anti-HDV-positive patients, 3 (50 ​%) had cirrhosis, 1 of them underwent liver transplantation, and 2 had extrahepatic malignancy. All of them were negative for hepatitis B virus envelope (HBe) antigen and had antibodies to HBe antigen present at the beginning of antiviral treatment. All anti-HDV-positive patients achieved viral clearance during the therapy. In a population of almost four hundred patients infected with HBV, we observed a low prevalence of anti-HDV antibodies of 1.5 ​% and HDV replication of only 0.25 ​%. Half of the 6 patients with serologic evidence of co-infection had cirrhosis, so HDV likely played a role in disease progression.",

        "title": "Vaccination in Multiple Myeloma: Challenges and Strategies.",
        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by profound immunosuppression resulting from both disease-related mechanisms and treatment-induced immune dysfunction. This compromised immune status markedly increases susceptibility to infections, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in MM patients. While vaccination represents a cornerstone of infection prevention, standard immunization strategies often yield suboptimal responses in this population. This review synthesizes current evidence on the immunological barriers and clinical effectiveness of vaccination in MM. We evaluate vaccines targeting influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, SARS-CoV-2, and other relevant pathogens, and explore determinants influencing vaccine efficacy, including optimal timing, formulation, and patient-specific immune parameters. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, encompassing clinical trials, retrospective cohort studies, expert consensus guidelines, and population-based data. Extracted outcomes included serological responses, infection-related events, and vaccine safety in MM patients. Patients with MM exhibit impaired vaccine responses due to hypogammaglobulinemia, T- and B-cell dysfunction, and therapy-induced lymphodepletion. Despite modest immunogenicity, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines reduce respiratory infections and hospitalizations. Sequential administration of PCV13 followed by PPSV23, as well as post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) three-dose regimens, is associated with reduced pneumonia incidence. COVID-19 vaccines elicit variable responses, particularly in patients on anti-CD38 or BCMA-targeted therapies, highlighting the need for booster doses and, in selected cases, prophylactic monoclonal antibodies. Vaccines against herpes zoster, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B are also recommended, particularly around ASCT. Immunophenotypic markers such as CD19+ B-cell and CD4+ T-cell counts are predictive of vaccine responsiveness, supporting immune profiling as a tool for individualized vaccination planning. Vaccination remains a critical component of infection prevention in MM. Although immunogenicity may be attenuated, clinical benefits-namely, reduced infection burden and healthcare utilization-support broad vaccine implementation. A personalized approach, considering the treatment phase, disease control, and immune status, is essential to optimize vaccine effectiveness. Ongoing research into high-dose, adjuvanted, and next-generation vaccines is critical to enhance protection in this vulnerable population.",

        "title": "Challenges and Criteria for Single-Arm Trials Leading to an Added Benefit in German Health Technology Assessments.",
        "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials are the standard for health technology assessment, but when they are infeasible or unethical, single-arm trials (SATs) are submitted. This study examined when SATs were accepted for added benefit by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) and/or the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) in Germany. We identified health technology assessments via the AMNOG-Monitor database through December 2024, with additional details from G-BA documents. We compared the SATs and other evidence for added benefit decisions (granted/not granted), stratified by orphan drug status, special marketing authorization, approved indication (chronic hepatitis C/others), and population (adults/children). Added benefit claims by manufacturers, IQWiG recommendations, and G-BA appraisals were compared. Among 1738 G-BA decisions, 85.8% (1491/1738) of the subpopulations were fully assessed by IQWiG, with 13.5% (202/1491) based on SATs. Among the 247 orphan drugs assessed by the G-BA, 37.7% (93/247) were SAT-based. Overall, SAT-based assessments demonstrated an added benefit in 12.2% (36/295) of cases. This included 13.4% (27/202) of full assessments and 9.7% (9/93) of orphan drug assessments. IQWiG accepted only 18.5% (5/27) of the SATs endorsed by the G-BA. Statistical tests revealed significant differences between manufacturers' claims, IQWiG recommendations, and G-BA appraisals. SATs were most frequently accepted for chronic hepatitis C treatments (mostly with non-standard marketing authorization) and paediatric indications. The G-BA cited reasons such as dramatic effects, rare diseases, a lack of alternatives, or fewer side effects, although justifications were often unclear. Acceptance rates for SATs remain low, and criteria for added benefit are not always explicitly defined. To enable benefit assessments when randomised controlled trials are infeasible or unethical, clear and binding criteria developed in collaboration with the G-BA are essential.",

        "title": "Spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery resulting in postdural puncture headache and intracranial subdural hematoma - a case report.",
        "abstract": "Spinal anesthesia is routinely used for cesarean delivery. Intracranial subdural hematoma (SDH) is a potentially fatal complication of neuraxial anesthesia and is extremely uncommon. This report describes a case of SDH following uncomplicated spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery and highlights the importance of timely intervention and patient follow-up. A 35-year-old patient with a history of hepatitis B underwent elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia provided with a pencil-point 25G needle at the presumed L3-L4 interspace. She experienced a mild non-positional headache the next day managed with oral pain medications. After discharge, she presented twice for worsening headache symptoms. By the 12<sup>th</sup> postpartum day, symptoms were suggestive of post-dural puncture headache, prompting imaging that revealed a left-sided subdural hematoma with mass effect. After multidisciplinary consultation with neurosurgery, an epidural blood patch (18 mL) was performed. Despite worsening radiological findings, the patient experienced symptomatic relief. The patient was discharged with follow-up arranged at the institution's headache clinic. While post-dural puncture headache after unintended dural puncture may be common, serious complications such as SDH are rare and require prompt diagnosis and intervention. This case illustrates a rare but serious complication of an uncomplicated spinal anesthesia, highlighting the need for thorough follow-up and prompt interventions. This report underscores the importance of revising discharge instructions after neuraxial anesthesia to include education on symptoms of post-dural puncture headache and the necessity of timely re-evaluation if symptoms worsen.",
