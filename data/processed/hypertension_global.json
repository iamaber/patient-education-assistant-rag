        "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, particularly among adults aged 45 years and older. Self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) is an evidence-based intervention that can help patients manage hypertension outside of the clinical setting. We conducted a needs and assets assessment to identify (1) health center adopters and implementers and (2) barriers and facilitators to SMBP adoption and implementation in six community health centers in Texas. Data sources included: (1) needs and assets assessment surveys and semi-structured interviews; (2) site visits with participating health centers; and (3) detailed meeting notes and logs. Leaders and administrators from the participating health centers completed a self-administered 56-item survey. We computed descriptive statistics for survey data. For open-ended survey responses, interview data, and meeting notes, team members labeled the reported and observed barriers and facilitators to program implementation. Barriers to SMBP adoption and implementation included staffing shortages, limited funding to procure blood pressure devices, and perceived challenges reaching patients and maintaining engagement in an SMBP program. Facilitators included existing hypertension management guidelines, health center familiarity with SMBP programs, and the use of non-physician team members in hypertension management programs. Adopters included leadership professionals and administrators, and implementers included healthcare providers, and non-physician team members. Findings inform our understanding of SMBP program adoption, implementation, and importantly, how to best allocate resources to incorporate SMBP programs into clinical workflows.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with a significantly elevated incidence among individuals with hypertension. Conventional risk assessment methods primarily rely on a limited set of clinical parameters and often exclude imaging-derived structural features, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based multimodal stroke risk prediction model by integrating carotid ultrasound imaging with multidimensional clinical data to enable precise identification of high-risk individuals among hypertensive patients. A total of 2,176 carotid artery ultrasound images from 1,088 hypertensive patients were collected. ResNet50 was employed to automatically segment the carotid intima-media and extract key structural features. These imaging features, along with clinical variables such as age, blood pressure, and smoking history, were fused using a Vision Transformer (ViT) and fed into a Radial Basis Probabilistic Neural Network (RBPNN) for risk stratification. The model's performance was systematically evaluated using metrics including AUC, Dice coefficient, IoU, and Precision-Recall curves. The proposed multimodal fusion model achieved outstanding performance on the test set, with an AUC of 0.97, a Dice coefficient of 0.90, and an IoU of 0.80. Ablation studies demonstrated that the inclusion of ViT and RBPNN modules significantly enhanced predictive accuracy. Subgroup analysis further confirmed the model's robust performance in high-risk populations, such as those with diabetes or smoking history. The deep learning-based multimodal fusion model effectively integrates carotid ultrasound imaging and clinical features, significantly improving the accuracy of stroke risk prediction in hypertensive patients. The model demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical application potential, offering a valuable tool for early screening and personalized intervention planning for stroke prevention.

        "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a frequent complication in dogs with heartworm disease caused by Dirofilaria immitis. Although echocardiography remains the main diagnostic tool, its operator- and preload-dependence may limit accuracy. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is a cardiac biomarker that increases in response to ventricular wall stress and may be useful for monitoring right-sided heart disease. This study aimed to evaluate NT-proBNP concentrations in dogs with precapillary PH due to heartworm disease during adulticide treatment. In total, 90 dogs diagnosed with heartworm disease were prospectively enrolled and classified according to the presence of PH based on echocardiographic criteria. NT-proBNP concentrations were measured on days 0, 30, 60, and 90 of adulticide treatment. Additional data collected included the presence/absence of microfilariae, clinical signs, parasite burden, and renal values. Dogs received adulticidal therapy following current international guidelines. Statistical analyses assessed correlations between NT-proBNP levels, epidemiological, clinical and echocardiographic classification, and treatment progression. Dogs with PH had significantly higher NT-proBNP concentrations at baseline compared with those without PH (2038 ± 1671 versus 583 ± 185 pmol/L, P < 0.001). NT-proBNP levels were also positively correlated with parasite burden (r = 0.530, P < 0.05), presence of clinical signs (r = 0.456, P < 0.05), and age (r = 0.29, P < 0.05). During treatment, a progressive decrease in NT-proBNP concentrations was observed in dogs with PH, while levels remained stable in dogs without PH. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a cut-off of 1524.8 pmol/L for detecting moderate-to-severe PH (sensitivity: 99%, specificity: 87%). NT-proBNP is a valuable noninvasive biomarker for detecting and monitoring PH in dogs with heartworm disease. Its concentrations seem to reflect parasite burden, clinical status, and echocardiographic severity, and decline progressively with adulticide therapy. Integration of NT-proBNP into diagnostic and therapeutic protocols may enhance management of heartworm-infected dogs with suspected PH.",

        "abstract": "Portal hypertension (PH) is a major complication of chronic liver disease and a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established treatment for PH-related complications, including refractory ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic hydrothorax and Budd-Chiari syndrome. However, post-TIPS cardiac decompensation has been reported in up to 25% of patients, often due to haemodynamic shifts revealing occult cardiac dysfunction. Current approaches to pre-procedural cardiac assessment and risk stratification remain inconsistent. This systematic review examines current recommendations and emerging strategies for cardiovascular evaluation in patients with cirrhosis prior to a TIPS. To identify the key predictive factors for cardiac decompensation following a TIPS in patients with cirrhosis. A systematic review of available literature, using PubMed (including MEDLINE), Embase and Cochrane databases. Results were searched comprehensively, without exclusion criteria, from inception to May 2025. Given the predominance of retrospective cohort studies, risk of bias assessment was primarily performed using the ROBINS-E tool. Thirteen studies were included (<i>n</i> = 1674 patients), with a pulled mean decompensation rate of 8.8%. Due to the variability in TIPS timing, study quality and heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not feasible, therefore results were synthesised narratively. Multiple diastolic dysfunction parameters independently and integrated through the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines demonstrated predictive value. Newly validated risk score, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and biomarkers such as N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 125 pg/mL consistently highlight cardiac dysfunction amongst the literature. Our review also explored left-atrial strain imaging as well as recent advances in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and potential genetic contributors. Multiple predictors of cardiac decompensation following TIPS exist, however studies are of limited quality. Implementing reliable markers may enable early risk stratification, candidate selection and guide pre-procedural optimisation.",

The patient was a 55-year-old woman who experienced dyspnea on exertion. She was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, and surgery was scheduled; however, she was also diagnosed with CTEPH during preoperative examinations. She was referred to our hospital, where right heart catheterization revealed a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 39 mmHg. We prioritized the treatment of CTEPH, starting oral riociguat followed by BPA three times. The mPAP decreased to 27 mmHg. Then, right upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection were performed. After surgery, there was no significant worsening of right heart failure, and no recurrence of the lung cancer. This case report presents a method for managing both CTEPH and primary lung cancer.

        "abstract": "Studies on the pro-inflammatory effects of primary aldosteronism (PA) in humans have largely relied on measurements of circulating inflammatory biomarkers and are mostly observational in nature, making it difficult to establish a causal relationship between PA and inflammatory responses. In addition, the association between PA and bone mineral density (BMD) remains controversial and warrants further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the causal effects of PA on circulating inflammatory proteins and bone mineral density. We performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal relationships between PA and 91 circulating inflammatory proteins, as well as BMD at four anatomical sites. The findings were further validated using a rat model and clinical data. MR analysis revealed significant inverse causal associations between PA and the circulating levels of interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL-10RB) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These findings were further supported by the rat model results, in which serum IL-10RB (2.10 ± 1.18 ng/mL) and HGF (1120.95 ± 144.33 pg/mL) levels in the Aldo-salt group were significantly lower than those in both the Aldo-salt-Epl group (4.80 ± 1.40 ng/mL and 1434.74 ± 192.45 pg/mL, respectively) and the control group (5.07 ± 0.79 ng/mL and 1540.42 ± 316.32 pg/mL, respectively) (P < 0.05). Consistently, clinical data showed that patients with PA had significantly lower serum IL-10Rb and HGF levels compared to those with essential hypertension (EH) (1146.20 ± 178.23 vs. 1660.49 ± 238.44 pg/mL and 1082.93 ± 231.47 vs. 1935.18 ± 296.44 pg/mL, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Notably, MR analysis did not identify any significant causal associations between PA and bone mineral density at the total body, forearm, femoral neck, or lumbar spine. This study is the first to demonstrate a causal relationship between PA and reduced circulating levels of IL-10RB and HGF, suggesting that PA may promote disease progression by impairing anti-inflammatory defenses and providing new insights for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation-related pathways.",

This study aimed to investigate whether RDN affects myocardial mitochondrial oxidative stress and myocardial fibrosis through norepinephrine (NE)/Kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15)/renalase (RNLS) pathway. The impact of RDN on myocardial remodeling was assessed in rats subjected to transverse aortic coarctation (TAC) surgery. To explore the mechanism by which NE influences mitochondrial oxidative stress and fibrosis in AC16 cardiomyocytes, we intervened with KLF15 and RNLS. The molecular mechanism underlying the role of RDN in TAC-induced myocardial remodeling was achieved through intraperitoneal injection of NE and adeno-associated virus to knock down KLF15 and RNLS. Echocardiography showed that RDN increased left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening in TAC rats, while decreasing left ventricular end-systolic diameter. RDN decreased the myocardial infarction size, myocardial tissue injury, and fibrosis; decreased serum NE level; increased RNLS level; and promoted KLF15 and RNLS expression in cardiac tissue in TAC rats. NE prevented RDN effects on TAC rats. Further results showed that RDN improved myocardial remodeling in TAC rats by upregulating RNLS. NE promoted mitochondrial oxidative stress and fibrosis in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting RNLS. Mechanically, NE aggravated mitochondrial oxidative stress and fibrosis of cardiomyocytes by inhibiting KLF15 to downregulate RNLS. Moreover, RDN improved myocardial remodeling in TAC rats by upregulating KLF15. Our results implicated that RDN improved mitochondrial oxidative stress and myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the NE/KLF15/RNLS pathway. Our findings demonstrated that the NE/KLF15/RNLS axis is a molecular strategy for RDN treatment of myocardial fibrosis.",

This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2001 and 2010, including 1,681 male diabetic patients (409 of whom had DKD). Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, race, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were employed to evaluate the relationships between total PSA (TPSA), free PSA (FPSA), and the FPSA/TPSA ratio with DKD. Dose-response curves and subgroup analyses were performed to further assess these associations. Elevated levels of TPSA, FPSA, and the FPSA/TPSA ratio were significantly associated with an increased risk of DKD. In fully adjusted models, the highest tertiles of TPSA (OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.43-2.56) and FPSA (OR = 2.69, 95% CI 2.00-3.60) demonstrated the strongest associations. The FPSA/TPSA ratio exhibited a linear dose-response relationship with DKD (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.60-2.91), whereas TPSA and FPSA showed non-linear threshold effects. Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent findings across populations. PSA-related biomarkers may serve as potential indicators for early diagnosis and risk stratification of DKD. Further validation studies and mechanistic investigations are necessary to optimize clinical interventions and improve renal outcomes in diabetic patients.",

Proper reporting and handling of missing data are crucial in such studies to avoid loss of statistical power and precision and generate unbiased results. We aimed to assess the reporting and handling of missing data in published studies of co-morbid hypertension and diabetes among PLWH. We searched in PubMed for cross-sectional studies of co-morbid hypertension and diabetes among PLWH published worldwide between January 1990 and June 2023. We extracted data on reporting of missing data (quantity, type, where it occurred, and any bias assessment) and how it was handled. Of 2179 records identified, 154 studies were included among which 53 (34.4%) reported missing data, primarily within exposure variables such as CD4 count and viral load. Only 19 of these studies (37.7%) cited reasons for missingness, predominantly attributed to lack of documentation and non-response. Out of the 24 (45.5%) studies that detailed how they handled missing data, the majority (16 studies; 30.2%) used complete case analysis. Only 5/53 studies (9.43%) adopted multiple imputation methods. The potential biases introduced by missing data were acknowledged in only 12/53 (22.6%) studies. The reporting and handling of missing data in hypertension and diabetes studies among PLWH are currently suboptimal. Enhanced understanding of why data is missing and choosing appropriate methods to address it is paramount to reduce potential biases. Adopting and adhering to comprehensive guidelines for managing missing data is a pressing need and will ensure that more accurate results are better represented in PLWH population.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral edema is a consequential outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may lead to intracranial hypertension, necessitating urgent medical attention. One of the primary causes of cerebral edema is microvascular hyperpermeability, characterized by excessive leakage of intravascular fluid and proteins via blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysregulation. Prolonged activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and inflammatory pathways due to BBB hyperpermeability results in poor patient outcomes. The primary goal of this study was to ascertain if quercetin, a bioflavonoid plant pigment, would protect against BBB breakdown and hyperpermeability in the acute context following TBI. We used a mixed in vitro and in vivo model to test the effects of quercetin pretreatment on endothelial cell tight junctions in murine models of TBI and stress-induced hyperpermeability. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a key contributor of secondary injuries following TBI, was used as an inducer of oxidative stress in cerebral endothelial cells in vitro. BBB tight junction/cytoskeletal integrity was assessed using immunofluorescence of junctional proteins zonula occludens-1, β-catenin, and vascular endothelial-cadherin, alongside filamentous actin labeling and a monolayer permeability assay. Intracellular ROS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were determined using fluorescent probes. In vivo experiments consisted of intravital microscopy of brain pial vasculature in a mouse model of TBI. The results demonstrate that quercetin (100 μM; 1 h) attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 μM; 2 h)-induced monolayer hyperpermeability and ROS formation significantly and decreased the loss of tight junction and cytoskeletal integrity. Quercetin treatment (50 mg/kg) after injury decreased TBI-induced vascular hyperpermeability significantly compared to sham. These results indicate that quercetin provides BBB protection by decreasing oxidative stress-induced loss of tight junction/cytoskeletal integrity, ultimately resulting in decreased microvascular hyperpermeability. The data suggest that quercetin may be a viable therapeutic option for preventing or managing cerebral oedema acutely following TBI.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate protocol adherence and its impact on inpatient mortality in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at a tertiary hospital in Karachi. The major hypothesis was that adherence to the DKA protocol reduces inpatient mortality. This was a retrospective cohort study. The study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. The study included patients diagnosed with DKA and admitted to AKUH from 2017 to 2021. Eligibility criteria included patients aged 18 and older, excluding those with incomplete records or referred to other hospitals. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. The analysis included Cox proportional hazards regression. Secondary outcome measures included predictors of mortality such as hypertension, intubation, tachycardia and elevated creatinine levels. Non-compliance with the DKA protocol (<70%) was associated with a significantly higher inpatient mortality rate (p=0.003). Survival analysis revealed a shorter median survival time for patients with <70% compliance (15 days versus 19 days, p<0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that non-compliance was an independent risk factor for adverse events (adjusted HR 1.37 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.86), p=0.04). Hypertension, intubation, tachycardia and elevated creatinine levels were significantly associated with increased mortality risk. Adherence to the DKA protocol is crucial for reducing inpatient mortality and improving outcomes, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Ensuring at least 70% compliance is vital. Recommendations include continuous training for healthcare providers, adequate staffing and resource optimisation. Future research should focus on interventions to boost compliance and explore other factors affecting protocol adherence to further enhance patient care.",

Diagnosis remains challenging because it is frequently subclinical; however, advanced imaging, biomarkers, and electrocardiographic changes have improved early detection. Clinically, this syndrome has significant implications, particularly in decompensated cirrhosis and periods of increased myocardial stress. Although no standardized treatment guidelines exist, orthotopic liver transplantation remains the most effective intervention and often results in cardiovascular recovery.

However, accumulating data suggest an important association with cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs), including arrhythmias, hypertension, and bleeding, in patients with CLL and other hematological malignancies treated with this therapeutic class. Data from comparative trials with BTKis suggest second-generation agents, eg, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, may be associated with fewer CV AEs than first-in-class BTKi ibrutinib. PubMed and the proceedings of key hematology congresses were searched for relevant information using broad search terms including CLL, BTKi, and toxicity. When managing patients with CLL, screening before and during treatment to assess CV risk is suggested to guide decision-making. Due to the increased toxicity with ibrutinib, the second-generation BTKis are now preferred (per the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology [NCCN Guidelines®]). For patients with a high CV-risk, the decision between second-generation BTKi or a time-limited alternative, like venetoclax plus an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, should be made on an individual basis after patient consultation and consideration of the presenting characteristics of CLL in any given patient. The management of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication during BTKi treatment requires specific attention, with coexistent medications being carefully assessed before starting a BTKi to reduce the risk of bleeding. For patients with a new-onset or worsening CV events during BTKi therapy, management may involve temporarily stopping the BTKi or switching to another class of therapy. To ensure the best outcomes, a collaborative care approach is essential, and some patients may need to be referred to a cardiologist/cardio-oncologist for specialist management. Baseline and ongoing CV risk assessment, careful monitoring, management, and a multidisciplinary team approach are all critical to ensure optimal oncologic and CV outcomes for patients with CLL receiving BTKis.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is a growing global health issue, linked to chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Nursing staff could play a significant role in managing obesity, with telemedicine being a potentially effective tool for monitoring weight and caloric intake. However, the effectiveness of telemedicine-based nursing interventions in managing obesity and overweight remains unclear. This systematic review with meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nursing telemedicine interventions in managing overweight and obesity in adults. This review followed PRISMA guidelines and involved a literature search in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science. Eligible studies were in English, involved adults with a BMI over 25, and evaluated nursing-led telemedicine interventions (non-randomized and randomized controlled studies). Study quality was assessed using the Down and Black checklist. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Four moderate-quality articles were included. The nursing-led telemedicine interventions, delivered through digital platforms, mobile apps, and remote monitoring, focused on health education and motivational strategies to promote self-regulation and dietary improvements. The meta-analysis showed that, compared to traditional approaches, nursing-led interventions resulted in an average weight loss of 2.59 kg (95% CI: - 3.09 to - 2.08), a reduction of 1.05 kg/m² in BMI (95% CI: - 1.50 to - 0.60), and a decrease of 2.52 cm in waist circumference (95% CI: - 2.96 to - 2.09). Nursing telemedicine interventions are effective in promoting short-term weight loss and lifestyle changes. However, further research is needed to assess long-term effects and the impact of different interventions.",

        "abstract": "The 2022 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines updated the definition of pulmonary hypertension (PH). This study aimed to evaluate implications of the new PH definition. A retrospective analysis of a single-center right heart catheterization registry (April 2016-July 2023) was conducted. Patients were classified using the classic definition (mean pulmonary arterial pressure [mPAP] ≥25 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] >3 Wood units [WU]) and the new definition (mPAP >20 mmHg, PVR >2 WU). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization over a maximum follow-up of 5 years. Among 314 patients (median age, 62.5 years; male, 50.3%), the new definition led to a 9.6% increase in diagnosis of pre-capillary PH (Pre-PH) and a 10.5% increase in combined pre- and post-capillary PH (Cpc-PH). Event discrimination was comparable between the 2 definitions, as assessed by the C-index and net reclassification improvement. Multivariable Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, showed a lower risk of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization under the new definition. Spline analyses indicated that risk increased from mPAP >20 mmHg and PVR >2 WU. The new definition increased PH diagnoses, particularly in Pre-PH and Cpc-PH, while maintaining comparable discriminative performance. Improved 5-year event-free survival observed under the new definition may be partly attributable to the inclusion of patients with milder disease. Notably, the risk progressively increased beyond mPAP >20 mmHg and PVR >2 WU, reinforcing the prognostic significance of the new thresholds.",

Another objective was to to observe what correlation the variables of age showed with the parameters of BNP, NT-proBNP values, and with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). A case-control study was performed for six months between January to June 2024. In total 254 individuals took part in the study, with ages between 30-75 years, of which 85 were healthy controls and 169 CKD cases. CKD patients were recruited from the Department of Nephrology Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Karachi. Diagnosis was made on the basis of raised serum urea, creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalance. The following were excluded from participation: individuals with coronary artery disease, pregnancy, more than twice-weekly dialysis, or on steroid therapy. CKD cases were also staged according to National Kidney Foundation GFR guidelines. Among the <50-year-old participants, BNP was abnormal in 92.7% of patients (p = 0.001), while NT-proBNP was abnormal in 38.5% (p = 0.01). When BNP and NT-proBNP were compared between the same individuals, BNP detected more abnormal cases, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01), indicating its better diagnostic yield in this group. BNP was identified as a more authentic marker than NT-proBNP in order to detect cardiovascular stress in CKD patients. Its close correlation with increasing age and decreasing GFR highlights its prognostic significance and potential role in routine cardiovascular risk assessment in CKD populations.",

        "abstract": "Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, with the Black population experiencing an earlier onset and severe form of the disease compared to the White population. Despite the increased prevalence in the Black community, most research pertaining to glaucoma is focused on White patients. The current management guidelines recommend prostaglandin analogues and non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists as the mainstay treatment, however their comparative efficacy in the Black community has not been thoroughly investigated. This systematic review aims to investigate the efficacy of the various intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering agents used to treat primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT) in Black patients. A systematic review of three randomised controlled trials was conducted to assess the efficacy of IOP-lowering agents specifically in the Black population. The protocol was set prior to the literature search and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420025652374). Databases searched included PubMed, Cochrane Library, Europe PMC and Semantic Scholar. Two independent researchers reviewed the articles and data was extracted from the three eligible articles. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias (RoB) 2 tool. Our study found prostaglandin analogues to be highly efficient in the Black community and non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists to have a lower efficacy in this population. The results align with the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommending prostaglandin analogue as the first-line treatment for POAG and OHT. However, the NICE guidelines recommend non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists as the second-line treatment, which has a lower efficacy in Black patients. In addition, our study found prostamides to be only slightly less efficient compared to prostaglandin analogues in the Black population. In conclusion, prostaglandin analogues are a suitable first-line IOP-lowering agent in Black patients. Further research is required to investigate a suitable second-line treatment option in this community if patients have any adverse effects or do not tolerate the first-line option or need additional reduction in IOP.",

        "title": "Calcium Supplementation in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review of Clinical Studies.",
        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in fetal development and maternal health during pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends a daily calcium intake of 1.5-2 g for pregnant adult women. Calcium deficiency during gestation may lead to complications, such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, loss of bone mineral density, impaired fetal development, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the present review is to evaluate the current clinical evidence on calcium intake during pregnancy. <i>Methods</i>: The present systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 statement by searching two major databases, PubMed and Mendeley. The study protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework (DOI: osf.io/rvj7z). Inclusion criteria were clinical trials on calcium supplementation during pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were clinical guidelines, reviews, case reports, case series, letters, and commentaries. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. <i>Results</i>: Initially, 451 publications were identified, and after removal of duplicates and screening of titles and/or abstracts and/or full texts, 34 studies were included. The number of participants ranged between 30 and 22,000 women. Calcium supplementation was associated with lower incidence of and less severe gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, lower risk of preterm birth, longer pregnancy duration and higher neonatal birth weight, and improved maternal bone mineral density postpartum. When the doses were split up into smaller doses, the benefits were strongest with high-dose regimens (1.5-2 g/day). <i>Conclusions</i>: Calcium supplementation during pregnancy has beneficial effects on maternal and neonatal health, especially in populations with insufficient dietary daily calcium intake and women at high risk of hypertensive disorders. Daily dose may vary according to individual needs, daily dietary calcium intake, and general health status. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to confirm these findings.",

We aimed to investigate the associations of OPA, TPA, and LTPA with suicidal ideation in adults. We included and analyzed 25,497 participants (aged ≥ 18 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2018. The domain-specific PA was assessed by a self-report questionnaire and categorized based on the PA guidelines. Suicidal ideation was measured by item nine of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Participants achieving PA guidelines (≥ 150 min/week) had a 21% (odds ratio [OR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.98) and 32% (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.89) reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation depending on total PA and LTPA, respectively, while OPA or TPA did not correlated with suicidal ideation. The mediation analysis revealed that 74.1% of this association was mediated by the severity of depressive symptoms. In subgroup analyses, LTPA was associated with suicidal ideation in participants who were aged ≥ 60 years, those with BMI < 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, sedentary time < 360 min/day, smoking, hypertension, depression and proportion of vigorous exercise ≥ 0.5. These connections indicate that LTPA could be especially beneficial for older individuals and those with specific lifestyle or health risks. LTPA at levels of 150-299 and ≥ 300 min/week was associated with 31% (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.97) and 30% (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.94) lower odds of suicidal ideation, respectively. Stratified by exercise intensity, vigorous-intensity LTPA, but not moderate-intensity LTPA, was negatively associated with the risk of suicidal ideation (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.86). When the amount achieving the PA guidelines, LTPA, but not OPA or TPA, was associated with a lower risk of suicidal ideation through the mediation of depressive symptoms.

Studies have identified genetic predisposition in both familial PAH (fPAH) and idiopathic PAH (iPAH) cases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the genetic susceptibility of PAH in pSS. Forty-three pSS-PAH patients, 92 pSS-non-PAH patients, and 105 healthy controls (HC) were obtained. PAH was diagnosed according to the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines, and ruled out by echocardiogram as estimated PAP < 40 mmHg. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites related to PAH and pSS were selected and then compared between pSS-PAH and pSS-non-PAH groups. In pSS-PAH group, 97.7% of the patients were female and average age of PAH onset was 37.3 ± 10.6 years. The allele frequency of STAT4 rs10168266 was markedly different between pSS-PAH and pSS-non-PAH groups (p = 0.027, OR = 0.547), with the genotypic frequency of CC/CT/TT 47.6%/38.1%/14.3% versus 25.6%/53.3%/21.1%. While C-allele was much more frequent in pSS-PAH group than in pSS-non-PAH group (66.7% vs. 52.2%), the intron variant rs10168266 (C > T) of signal transductor and activator of transcription (STAT4) gene was speculated to be a protective factor for PAH in pSS patients. A remarkable divergence was also proven in the dominant and additive hereditary model tests between pSS-PAH and pSS-non-PAH groups (p = 0.012, OR = 0.378). SNP sites identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) in pSS, especially STAT4 rs1016826, was verified to be correlated with pSS-PAH.

Improving physical activity is an effective way to manage hypertension, and there has been a lot of interest in the use of wearable devices for promoting physical activity, which have become increasingly popular in recent years, but in many countries, improvements in physical activity levels remain inadequate. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether interventions using wearable devices have a beneficial effect on blood pressure in adults. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023442506), we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and IchuShi-Web, identifying 21 randomized controlled trials including participants with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or overweight/obesity. Interventions ranged from 12 to 48 weeks using pedometers, activity trackers, and smartwatches. Random-effects meta-analysis showed these interventions did not produce statistically significant improvements in systolic or diastolic blood pressure at any intervention duration (12, 24, or 48 weeks). Similarly, no statistically significant improvements were found in secondary outcomes (body weight, fasting blood glucose, and Hemoglobin A1c). Heterogeneity varied from low to high depending on outcome and intervention period. These findings indicate that evidence of direct intervention using wearable devices for promoting physical activity alone is currently insufficient to establish clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure and related metabolic parameters. Future research may need to integrate wearable technology into comprehensive care models that combine targeted feedback and education with behavioral support strategies, rather than direct intervention through monitoring alone.",

While metabolic syndrome (MS) and sarcopenia independently impact postoperative outcomes, their synergistic effects on intertrochanteric fracture prognosis remain unclear. This study investigates the individual and combined influence of MS and sarcopenia on complications and functional recovery in elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures. We retrospectively analyzed 460 elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures, categorized into four groups: control (n = 174), MS (n = 122), sarcopenia (n = 89), and combined (n = 75). Preoperative-perioperative and postoperative data of the MS, sarcopenia, and combined groups were compared with the control group. Primary outcomes included 3-month Barthel Index (BI) and Harris Hip Score (HHS). Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of poor recovery (HHS < 70). The MS group had younger patients with higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes prevalence, and longer surgery durations (P < 0.05). Sarcopenia and combined groups exhibited lower weight, BMI, handgrip strength (HS), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), and higher American society of Aneshesiologists (ASA) scores (P < 0.05). The MS, sarcopenia, and combined groups had higher incidences of pulmonary infections and pressure ulcers compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The sarcopenia and combined groups also had higher rates of organ failure (P < 0.05), with the combined group showing increased ICU admission (P = 0.003) and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.027). At three months post-discharge, the sarcopenia and combined groups exhibited higher mortality rates (P < 0.001). At the 3-month follow-up, the sarcopenia and combined groups had significantly lower HHS and BI compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression identified sarcopenia alone (OR 6.50, 95% CI 2.56-20.10; P < 0.001) and combined with MS (OR 9.46, 95% CI 3.33-34.80; P < 0.001) as significant predictors of poor postoperative recovery. Sarcopenia significantly worsens postoperative prognosis in elderly intertrochanteric fracture patients, with synergistic deterioration when combined with MS. Chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and muscle-bone metabolic dysregulation drive adverse outcomes. Comprehensive preoperative screening for sarcopenia and MS, coupled with tailored nutritional support and early rehabilitation, is critical to mitigate complications and improve functional recovery. These findings advocate for integrated care protocols targeting metabolic-musculoskeletal health in geriatric fracture management.",

        "abstract": "Le Canada a longtemps figuré parmi les leaders mondiaux de la prise en charge de l'hypertension artérielle (HTA), mais ses taux de traitement et de maîtrise de l'HTA ont régressé ces dernières années. Le présent guide de pratique clinique vise à fournir des recommandations pragmatiques axées sur les soins de première ligne afin d'améliorer la prise en charge de l'HTA chez les adultes à l'échelle de la population. MÉTHODES: Conformément aux normes de qualité et de présentation du guide AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation), nous avons utilisé la méthode GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) et le processus ADAPTE pour formuler des recommandations sur la prise en charge de l'HTA chez les adultes de 18 ans et plus. Nous avons ensuite intégré ces recommandations dans des algorithmes simplifiés, pragmatiques et fondés sur les données probantes en nous appuyant sur le guide technique HEARTS - un modèle de soins mis au point par l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé (OMS) afin d'améliorer la maîtrise de l'HTA et de réduire le fardeau des maladies cardiovasculaires (MCV). Le comité qui a préparé ce guide de pratique clinique se composait principalement de prestataires de soins de première ligne, mais aussi de patients et patientes, de spécialistes de la méthodologie et de spécialistes de l'HTA. Notre processus de gestion des intérêts concurrents a respecté les principes du Guidelines International Network. Les 9 recommandations pour la prise en charge de l'HTA chez les adultes sont regroupées sous les rubriques « Diagnostic » et « Traitement ». Les recommandations diagnostiques comportent une méthode standardisée de mesure de la pression artérielle (PA) et de confirmation de l'HTA, ainsi qu'une définition uniforme de l'HTA, soit une PA ≥130/80 mm Hg. Les recommandations thérapeutiques comprennent l'établissement d'une cible de pression artérielle systolique (PAS) <130 mm Hg, l'adoption de saines habitudes de vie, de même qu'une démarche par étapes pour guider un choix optimal de médicaments lorsqu'une pharmacothérapie est nécessaire. INTERPRÉTATION: Notre objectif consiste à améliorer la norme de soins de l'HTA en soins de première ligne au Canada. Un diagnostic exact et un traitement optimal de l'HTA peuvent réduire le nombre d'événements cardiovasculaires indésirables ainsi que le risque de décès.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to systematically evaluate the risk factors associated with the development of postoperative lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (LEDVT) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Comprehensive searches of Chinese and English databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang, were conducted from inception to December 12, 2024. Two researchers independently screened articles and extracted relevant data. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3, applying a random-effects model to combine effect sizes, with subsequent sensitivity analyses and assessments for publication bias. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024629624). A total of 13 studies (n = 777,327) were included, comprising 8 case-control studies, 2 cohort studies, and 3 cross-sectional studies. Eleven significant risk factors for postoperative LEDVT were identified: advanced age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.14), use of dehydrant (OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.38-3.04), mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.01-1.02), elevated D-dimer level (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11-1.27), polytrauma (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.29-2.03), hypertension (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07-1.15), surgical duration (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06-2.42), elevated body mass index (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.16-1.45), deep venous catheterization (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.15-1.60), length of hospital stay (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.18-1.56), and blood transfusion (OR = 3.56, 95% CI: 1.91-6.63), with all p values <0.05.

        "abstract": "Previous research has classified sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) into various symptom phenotypes. The cardiovascular risks associated with SDB differ by gender, age, and subtype, with uncertainty about the mediating role of metabolic syndrome in these risks. This study has three primary objectives: (1) to analyze the correlation between SDB and MetS risk across gender-age groups and symptom subtypes, (2) to identify the nocturnal hypoxia parameter most indicative of this relationship, and (3) to evaluate the link between sleep parameters (insomnia, daytime sleepiness, snoring, and sleep duration) and MetS. Combining these parameters into a sleep quality score may improve predictions of health outcomes. Participants underwent type IV sleep monitoring and completed structured questionnaires. MetS was defined according to the Chinese Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (2020 Edition). We conducted a latent class analysis to categorize patients based on SDB symptoms and characteristics. The severity of SDB was independently associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, particularly in males under 60 and females aged 60 and above. A total of 1,483 SDB patients were categorized into four distinct clusters: Cluster 1 included the pure insomnia group with fewer daytime symptoms; Cluster 2 consisted of the minimally symptomatic group; Cluster 3 comprised the insomnia group with multiple daytime symptoms; and Cluster 4 encompassed the group with upper airway symptoms and sleepiness. Among the SDB subtypes, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. However, the pure insomnia group had the highest prevalence of hypertension. These findings highlight the importance of considering gender, age differences, and sleep symptom subtypes when evaluating and managing metabolic syndrome. Tailored strategies, early identification, and consideration of different subtypes are necessary to optimize treatment.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Renal transplantation (RT) represents the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), offering improved quality of life and restored fertility in women post-transplant. While post-transplant pregnancies are possible, they can lead to complications including pre-eclampsia, graft dysfunction, and other adverse outcomes. This study evaluates existing literature to assess pregnancy's impact on kidney transplantation outcomes, specifically long-term graft function and survival. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature from January 2000 to September 2023 across multiple databases, following PRISMA guidelines. We established inclusion criteria focusing on graft function and adverse events. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction, and we assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. <b>Results:</b> From 4917 articles, we included 26 studies encompassing 1202 pregnancies in 902 kidney transplant recipients. Mean maternal age was 30.8 years, with an average interval of 52 months between transplant and pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy hypertension occurred in 54.2% of cases, and pre-eclampsia developed in 25.7%. The live birth rate reached 70.5%, while miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death rates were 11.3%, 2.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. We noticed graft dysfunction during pregnancy in 20.2% of cases. Though kidney function often deteriorated temporarily, most patients recovered post-delivery. <b>Discussion:</b> Post-transplant pregnancies remain viable but high-risk, with elevated rates of obstetric complications. Our findings highlight the need for standardized data collection and reporting to better understand and manage pregnancy's impact on graft outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> With appropriate management, pregnancy in kidney transplant recipients is feasible, though it carries elevated risks of obstetric complications. We recommend further multicenter studies with standardized data collection to improve understanding and outcomes.",

The patients were stratified based on enrollment before (233 patients) and after (145 patients) the guideline update, and medication usage was compared between the two groups. <b>Results</b>: Although all patients presented with Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), only 35% received calcium channel blockers. Medications such as iloprost, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, fluoxetine, and bosentan, recommended for the treatment of RP and digital ulcers, were not approved for SSc by the Republic Health Insurance Fund. Treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was administered to only 16 patients (4.2%), including 2 who received bosentan, 10 who received PDE-5 inhibitors, and 4 who were treated with riociguat. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors increased following the 2016 update of the guidelines. Cyclophosphamide was consistently prescribed for interstitial lung disease (ILD), with an increased frequency observed after the guideline update. No significant differences were observed in the use of methotrexate for skin involvement, ACE inhibitors for scleroderma renal crisis, or antibiotics for gastrointestinal symptoms. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were prescribed to 87.3% of patients with gastrointestinal involvement, with an increase in use of both PPIs and prokinetic agents following the guideline update. <b>Conclusions</b>: Rheumatologists' adherence to the EULAR/EUSTAR guidelines varied considerably, with 25% to 100% of eligible patients receiving the recommended treatments.

A total of 125 MM patients treated with CFZ at the Hypertension Center, \"Città della Salute e della Scienza\" in Turin, were enrolled. Baseline assessments included transthoracic echocardiography for LAS analysis via Philips QLAB software. During CFZ therapy, 52% of patients experienced hypertensive events. LAS conduit was significantly impaired in those who experienced CVAEs (-16.20 [-20.75; -12.65] vs. -20.80 [-26.30; -15.40], <i>p</i> = 0.006) and LAS conduit > -22 acted as a predictor of hypertensive adverse events in the normotensive population (OR 2.37 [1.02; 5.50]). These findings indicate that alterations in LAS conduit are linked to an increased risk of hypertensive adverse events during CFZ treatment.

Primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in these patients remains controversial. Our study aims to evaluate the management of gastrointestinal (GI) varices in children with PH in Italy. <i>Methods:</i> A questionnaire was sent to 21 major pediatric hepatology centers. It included 34 questions referring to the medical, endoscopic, radiological, and surgical management of GI varices. <i>Results</i>: Out of 21 centers, 16 returned a completed questionnaire (survey response rate 76%) with a high level of completeness. A total of 1206 children with PH were under follow-up. Splenomegaly associated with hypersplenism was the main indication for endoscopic surveillance in all centers (100%). Primary prophylaxis was performed with endoscopy plus non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) in 50%, endoscopy alone in 38%, and NSBBs alone in 12%. All centers managed acute variceal bleeding with endoscopy within 24 h, acid suppression, and octreotide infusion. Secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding was conducted using endoscopy (100%) and NSBBs (87%). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was considered a good option when endoscopic treatment failed in 94% of centers. <i>Conclusions</i>: In Italy, there is broad consensus among centers regarding the management of gastrointestinal varices in children with portal hypertension.

Oxygen supply and other medical managements combined with vasodilator drugs are adopted for PPHTN and HPS treatment, but these two clinical conditions also represent an indication for liver transplantation. Despite poor evidence, PPHTN is treated as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. The latter is combined with improved pulmonary hemodynamics permitting lung transplant. Lung transplant improves PPHTN in one-half of patients and has been associated with longer survival in selected patients. However, the risk of the latter procedure can be relevant as it is closely related to PPHTN severity.

        "abstract": "Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function in aging individuals is closely linked to physical deterioration and disability. Because exosomes of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSC-Exos) have been widely used to treat various human diseases, we examined their effects on aging-associated muscle atrophy and dysfunction in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 10 (SAMP10) mice, an animal model of human Sarcopenia. Twenty-four-week-old male SAMP10 mice were randomly assigned to a non-treatment or hucMSC-Exos treatment group. Twelve weeks after intravenous injection of hucMSC-Exos, the treatment group mice showed improvements in skeletal muscle morphology and performance, and elevated levels of the proteins phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), myosin heavy chain (MHC), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator, and sirtuin1 (Sirt1) in gastrocnemius muscle tissues. HucMSC-Exos also improved muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid drop accumulation in the gastrocnemius muscles. In in vitro experiments, hucMSC-Exos improved cell viability, senescence, apoptosis, and differentiation in association with induction of molecules related to anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2), differentiation (myogenin, MyoD1, myogenic factor-5, and myogenic factor-6), and protein anabolism (p-mTOR, MHC, Sirt1, phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase, phosphor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2, and glycogen synthase kinase3alpha/beta) in C2C12 cells under our experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that hucMSC-Exos treatment ameliorated skeletal muscle atrophy and dysfunction via mitochondrial biogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and protein anabolism mechanisms that might be dependent on an mTOR and Sirt1/PGC1α signaling pathways, indicating that hucMSC-Exos may have promise as a treatment for the management of aging-related frailty and sarcopenia.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains a critical public health concern in the U.S., with rising rates in recent years. Obstetric hemorrhage and hypertension in pregnancy are leading causes of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. Maternal safety bundles, developed by the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, provide guidelines to improve maternal health outcomes. This study examined the implementation of obstetric hemorrhage and severe hypertension safety bundles in Arkansas hospitals, identifying factors associated with successful adoption. Safety bundle implementation data were collected from 37 hospitals in the third quarter of 2023. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association database. Implementation index scores were calculated as the percentage of recommended elements adopted, both overall and within specific domains. Descriptive statistics summarized hospital characteristics and implementation status. Implementation differences across domains were assessed using Friedman's test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while between-bundle comparisons were evaluated using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. A total of 23 hospitals (62%) were in the urban region, while 14 hospitals (38%) were located in rural areas. In the obstetrical hemorrhage bundle, Readiness domain had significantly higher implementation than Recognition and Prevention (p = 0.0005) and Reporting and Systems Learning domains (p < 0.0001). In the severe hypertension bundle, Readiness (p < 0.0001), Recognition and Prevention (p = 0.0035), and Response (p < 0.0001) domains all had higher scores than Reporting and Systems Learning domain. The Recognition and Prevention domain had significantly higher implementation in the severe hypertension bundle than in the obstetrical hemorrhage bundle (p = 0.0351). Urban hospitals had significantly higher obstetrical hemorrhage bundle implementation scores than rural hospitals (p = 0.0121). Hospitals with more full-time facility personnel and registered nurses demonstrated better implementation of both obstetrical hemorrhage (facility personnel: p = 0.0454; registered nurses: p = 0.0126) and severe hypertension (facility personnel: p = 0.0180; registered nurses: p = 0.0093) bundles. Readiness components were the most frequently implemented, while Reporting and Systems Learning elements had lower adoption rates. Urban hospitals had higher obstetric hemorrhage bundle implementation levels than rural hospitals. Hospitals with greater staffing resources, particularly full-time facility personnel and registered nurses, demonstrated better implementation of safety bundles.

        "abstract": "High health risk and low management compliance pose significant challenges in controlling hypertensive patients' blood pressure. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of follow-up services on blood pressure control at the primary level. A total of 871 hypertensive patients consecutively enrolled from 2016 to 2021 were randomly selected from Qianjiang County, Hubei Province and Changsha County, Hunan Province of China. Blood pressure measurements (systolic blood pressure, SBP, and diastolic blood pressure, DBP) were defined as outcome variables, whereas the interval and regularity of follow-up visits served as key explanatory variables. A fixed-effects model was used to examine the influence of follow-up behaviors on blood pressure control among hypertensive patients. An increased frequency of follow-up visits, particularly those closer to or above the minimum threshold outlined in the 2020 Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Hypertension in China, was found to be beneficial for blood pressure control. The effectiveness of blood pressure control further improved with shorter follow-up intervals. However, when the number of follow-up visits deviated significantly from the minimum threshold, optimizing blood pressure control was achievable by extending follow-up intervals. A moderate increase in follow-up visits may be more effective in reducing hypertension patients' blood pressure than limiting follow-up intervals. It is suggested that primary hypertension management should focus on the regularity and intervals of follow-up visits and flexibly complete follow-up tasks. Moreover, the formal review of follow-up frequency and intervals, along with the efficiency of interventions implemented, should not be overlooked in hypertension control.",

        "abstract": "We report a clinical case of severe and prolonged hypofibrinogenemia caused by envenomation from Protobothrops cornutus, an pit viper species found mainly in Vietnam and parts of southern China. A 60-year-old woman was bitten while hiking in Cuc Phuong national forest of Ninh Binh province, Vietnam. Although WHO guidelines discourage antivenom administration for minor coagulation abnormalities, in this case, the decision was made due to a fibrinogen level <1.0 g/l and the patient's risk factors, including age (60 years) and untreated arterial hypertension, increasing the risk of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. Her fibrinogen level progressively dropped from 1.5 g/l to a nadir of 0.24 g/l at 112 hours post-bite, despite administration of 60 vials of monovalent Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom (produced by the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC), Nha Trang, Vietnam, and distributed by Vabiotech). A temporary increase to 1.13 g/l was observed after infusion of 400 ml of cryoprecipitate, but hypofibrinogenemia relapsed thereafter and only stabilized after 181 hours after Protobothrops cornutus bite. This clinical case highlights the distinctive coagulopathy caused by Protobothrops cornutus envenomation with severe and prolonged hypofibrinogenemia despite the use of large doses of monovalent Trimeresurus albolabris antivenom (which was not specific to P. cornutus) and cryoprecipitate while liver and kidney functions, creatine kinase (CK) levels, remained within normal limits, indicating that the venom primarily affected the coagulation system without causing damage to other major organs.",

        "abstract": "Arterial hypertension (AH) affects over 1.28 billion adults globally, remaining a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite effective therapies, suboptimal blood pressure control persists, highlighting the need for precision approaches. Epigenetic biomarkers, particularly DNA methylation, have emerged as potential tools to enhance risk stratification and personalise antihypertensive therapy, yet their clinical relevance remains uncertain. To systematically synthesise evidence on genetic and epigenetic biomarkers associated with hypertension, focusing on DNA methylation signatures, regulatory pathways, and translational potential. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines, registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251059256). PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched up to March 2025. Eligible studies investigated genetic or epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or chromatin modifications in adult hypertension populations. Data on study design, populations, biomarkers, analytical methods, and outcomes were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools. Twelve studies were included, encompassing cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. DNA methylation signatures at loci including AGTR1, PHGDH, SLC7A11, ACE, and WNT3A were recurrently associated with blood pressure regulation. Trans-ancestry genome-wide analyses identified methylation-enriched loci such as KCNK3, PDE3A, and PRDM6. However, no study demonstrated predictive value for clinical endpoints or robust replication across diverse populations. Methodological heterogeneity limited longitudinal data, and underrepresentation of low- and middle-income countries were key limitations. While epigenetic markers show promise for hypertension research, current evidence remains exploratory. Rigorous, longitudinal studies integrating clinical endpoints are essential for advancing toward clinical translation.",

        "abstract": "The technique of transauricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is methodologically applied by placing electrodes on the auricular region, specifically on the cymba, cavum, or tragus, to stimulate the vagus nerve non-invasively. Additionally, the earlobe, which is not innervated by the vagus nerve, can serve as a placebo site for control stimulation. The stimulation intensity is adjusted between 0.5-3.0 mA, with session durations ranging from 20-60 min, administered either daily or weekly, depending on the study protocol. The total number of sessions varies according to the protocol, extending from a few weeks to several months. Ethically, research involving taVNS must adhere to regulations set by the local Agency for Medicines and Health Products and European Union guidelines. Approval from an Ethical Committee is required for studies involving healthy participants, while a Medical Ethical Committee is necessary for clinical research, ensuring that written information and informed consent are provided. Additionally, rigorous exclusion criteria must be established to safeguard participant safety, excluding pregnant individuals, those with cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic diseases, psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, hypertension, or those using medications affecting the autonomic nervous system. In terms of clinical outcomes, the current study protocol demonstrated promising results with taVNS in patients with Disorders of Consciousness, showing significant improvement in alertness recovery and response to stimuli. Patients treated with taVNS experienced neurophysiological changes compared to the control group. Moreover, electroencephalographic biomarkers can be utilized to evaluate treatment efficacy, even in the absence of observable behavioral indicators. These findings suggest significant clinical potential for taVNS in managing Disorder of Consciousness, although the lack of specific regulations for taVNS underscores the need to adhere to international scientific best practices and seek consensus on European guidelines for its research application.",

        "abstract": "The cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have attracted significant attention. The calcium ion signaling pathway influences various aspects of cellular function, store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) serve as key calcium ion channels that induce cell apoptosis and exacerbate cardiac remodeling. This study aims to investigate the effects of SGLT2i on SOCCs and its potential cardioprotective mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were sequentially treated with angiotensin II (Ang II) and dapagliflozin (Dapa), randomly divided into four groups: Sham, Dapa, Ang II, and Ang II + Dapa. Blood pressure, cardiac structure and function were measured. Cardiac fibrosis evaluated using Masson's trichrome staining. The apoptosis rate of H9C2 cells was determined by flow cytometry. Protein expression levels and functional activity of SOCCs were analyzed using Western blotting, calcium imaging, and fluorescence co-localization staining. In Ang II-induced hypertension rats, no significant blood pressure lowering effect of Dapa was observed within 28 days. Notably, the absence of blood pressure reduction did not affect the timely improvement of Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling by Dapa. Ang II enhanced store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), subsequently promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Dapa administration effectively suppressed this pathological process by inhibiting the overexpression and overactivation of SOCC. SGLT2i improved early cardiac remodeling induced by Ang II without relying on antihypertensive effects, mainly by inhibiting excessive activation of SOCE, which effectively attenuated Ang II-triggered cardiomyocyte apoptosis. This provides a novel therapeutic paradigm targeting impaired myocardial calcium handling in hypertensive heart disease management.",

Traditionally characterized by high-blood pressure and proteinuria, organ and placental dysfunction were later proposed in some clinical practice guidelines as additional components for its definition. Variability in diagnostic criteria across international guidelines could be a barrier to harmonized and equitable care in different settings. We reviewed current relevant clinical practice guidelines to identify similarities and differences in recommendations related to the definition and diagnosis of preeclampsia, and their supporting evidence. We also reviewed additional systematic reviews related to the diagnosis of preeclampsia. We searched different databases and websites of international and professional organizations for guidelines published or updated from 2014 to 2024. We searched databases to identify additional systematic reviews on preeclampsia diagnosis. Fifteen guidelines from 11 organizations were identified with 11 systematic reviews supporting evidence on the diagnosis of preeclampsia. We found 21 additional systematic reviews, not included in these guidelines. There is agreement for hypertension and proteinuria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, without a uniform consensus on methods and devices for their assessment. Organ dysfunction is considered in eight guidelines and placental dysfunction in four, with some disagreements on their usefulness, and the methods and tools for their measurement. Few guidelines support their recommendations on preeclampsia diagnosis with systematic reviews. Consensus in preeclampsia definition is needed to guide not only clinical practice but also future research and policy, particularly in global health contexts.",

As the exact relationship between various stages of hypertension and epistaxis severity and frequency remains poorly defined, in this study we aimed to evaluate the correlation between stages of hypertension and the incidence, type, and severity of epistaxis among patients presenting to the emergency department. A prospective observational study was carried out over 12 months in the casualty department of a tertiary care hospital in India in which a total of 250 patients with epistaxis were evaluated for their status of blood pressure and history of hypertension. Blood pressure was classified per the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines into normal, elevated, stage 1, and stage 2 hypertension. Variables including the type of epistaxis (anterior vs posterior), recurrence, severity, and required interventions were recorded and statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Among 250 patients, 48% (120 patients) had stage 2 hypertension, 30% (75 patients) had stage 1, 15% (38 patients) had elevated blood pressure, and 7% (17 patients) had normal readings. Posterior epistaxis was significantly more common in stage 2 hypertensive patients (p < 0.001). Recurrent and severe episodes were also more frequent in stage 2. Multivariate analysis indicated stage 2 hypertension as an independent predictor for posterior and recurrent epistaxis (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.1-5.2). There is a significant correlation that exists between the severity of hypertension and the type and recurrence of epistaxis. Patients with stage 2 hypertension are at higher risk of developing recurrent nasal bleeding episodes and may need aggressive management.",

This study aims to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and para-clinical profile of CHDs in children with trisomy 21 while highlighting the specific challenges encountered in the Oriental region of Morocco. Methods This is a retrospective descriptive study conducted over a nine-year period (January 2015 to December 2023) at the Mohammed VI University Hospital Center (CHU Mohammed VI) in Oujda. It included 167 children with trisomy 21 who were referred for cardiologic evaluation, whether symptomatic or screened systematically. All patients underwent echocardiographic assessment performed by a pediatric cardiologist following the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE). Data were collected from medical records and the Hosix software (SIVSA, Vigo, Spain), an electronic health record system. Results Among the 167 children, 103 (61.6%) had confirmed congenital heart defects. The average age at diagnosis was 14 months, with the majority being diagnosed after 24 months. Trisomy 21 was confirmed by karyotyping. Most children were referred due to clinical symptoms (feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, cyanosis, sweating, and malaise), while others were referred after an incidental murmur or systematic screening. The most common defects were complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), followed by ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), isolated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), and transposition of the great vessels (TGV), along with rarer anomalies. Pulmonary hypertension (PH), assessed via echocardiographic criteria, was found in 17 patients, with six being deemed inoperable. Of the 103 children with CHDs, 28 underwent surgical correction, 63 received medical follow-up, and 12 were under palliative care. The low surgical intervention rate was due to various factors: late diagnosis, parental refusal, or limited access to specialized care. Postoperative follow-up was incomplete, limiting outcome evaluation. Conclusion This study highlights the challenges of the early diagnosis and optimal management of CHDs in children with trisomy 21 in a resource-limited region. It emphasizes the need to strengthen neonatal screening programs, unify evaluation protocols, and improve access to surgical care to enhance outcomes and long-term survival for these patients.",

This study aims to systematically evaluate the current evidence on the safety and efficacy of elective intracranial stenting in adult patients with symptomatic ICAD using Onyx drug-eluting balloon-mounted stents (Onyx DES).MethodsA meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Five studies were initially identified, with one excluded due to overlapping cohorts, resulting in four final studies included for analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted utilizing random-effects models for pooled event rates (95% CIs) and weighted means.ResultsOf 153 articles initially identified, four high-quality studies encompassing 314 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean (±SD) age was 64.6 (±12.4) years, with a predominance of males (70.7%) and common vascular comorbidities such as hypertension (85.7%) and diabetes (60.0%). Lesions were nearly equally distributed between the anterior and posterior circulations. Periprocedural complications were infrequent (1.0%), including one hemorrhagic stroke and one fatal aneurysm rupture. The 30-day complication rate remained low at 5%, involving strokes, deaths, and TIAs. However, follow-up at six months and beyond revealed rising rates of strokes, TIAs, and in-stent restenosis, reaching 9% at six months and persisting through one year.ConclusionThis descriptive meta-analysis suggests that Onyx DES may offer promising results in the treatment of symptomatic ICAD, with lower early complication rates reported.

While the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear, inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as vascular-related factors have been hypothesised as being involved.ObjectiveThis systematic review aimed to investigate these factors as potential mediators between particulate matter air pollution and dementia or related cognitive outcomes.MethodsThis review was registered with PROSPERO. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and grey literature was conducted in May 2024, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines.ResultsOf 1098 articles retrieved, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 143,124 participants. The majority of studies investigated vascular-related factors (n = 12), a smaller number examined inflammation and oxidative stress (n = 5). A meta-analysis was not performed due to high study heterogeneity in terms of exact exposures, mediators, and outcomes. Some evidence suggested that hypertension may partially mediate the association between indoor air pollution and cognitive decline, and stroke may contribute to the impact of air pollution on dementia risk. However, the evidence for both was conflicting and limited. No consistent evidence supported the involvement of other mediators.ConclusionsDue to the limited studies undertaken, there is insufficient evidence about whether inflammation and oxidative stress, or vascular-related factors mediate the effects of air pollution on dementia and related cognitive outcomes. Further longitudinal studies are needed to address this research gap, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, enhance disease understanding, and inform prevention and risk reduction strategies.",

We aimed to map the current knowledge of PAH treatments and evaluate the methodological quality of published systematic reviews. An overview with literature searches in PubMed and Embase (May 2025) was performed (CRD42023414469). The methodological and reporting quality of the eligible records was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist, respectively. Association analyses between tools' scores with key variables (article publication date, journal impact factor, country/region) were performed (SPSS v.28). An evidence map summarizing the most reported treatments and outcomes was also built. Overall, 57 systematic reviews (n = 52; 91.2% with meta-analysis) published between 1997 and 2025 (median year 2017), authored mostly by countries from Asia (n = 35; 61.4%) and North America (n = 12; 21.1%), were included. The classes of phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, and prostanoids and combination therapies were each assessed in one-third of the studies each. Over 20 different outcomes were reported, with the most common surrogate endpoints being 6-min walking distance (n = 42; 73.7%) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (n = 33; 57.9%). Most studies were classified as having critically low methodological quality (n = 48; 84.2%), with only three presenting high-quality methodology according to AMSTAR 2. The mean PRISMA score was 21.3 ± 2.9, indicating an adherence rate of 78.9% to the checklist among authors. Although there was an improvement over time in the quality of the reviews (p = 0.016 for AMSTAR; p = 0.002 for PRISMA), no correlations were found based on country nor journal impact factor. Methodological weaknesses remain common in systematic reviews of PAH; therefore, enforcing compliance with guidelines and standardizing outcome measurements through a core outcome set is crucial for improving data comparability and clinical application.

The pathophysiology of DD involves alterations in cardiac structure and function, neurohormonal activation, and vascular stiffness. Diagnosis is primarily based on echocardiography, and there are no specific treatment guidelines. Recently, treatments such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), GLP-1 receptor agonists, and finerenone have emerged, which may offer benefits in diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF. This review aims to present the pathophysiological mechanisms of DD in hypertension (HTN), its diagnosis, and its treatment.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) plays an increasingly important role in non-invasive assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). This systematic review aimed to assess the utility, accuracy and clinical applications of CMR flow techniques in evaluating pulmonary arterial blood flow in patients with suspected or confirmed PH. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched on 10 December 2024, utilising the following key terms: 'cardiac MRI', 'flow', and 'pulmonary hypertension'. Eligible studies were screened, and data extraction included study design, cohort characteristics, CMR flow techniques and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. 38 studies (mean sample size: 30 [20-57]) published between 2012 to 2024 were included. These utilised 2D flow (19 studies), 4D flow (15 studies), black blood imaging (one study) and combined flow techniques (three studies). Vortex duration derived by 4D flow demonstrated the strongest correlation (r = 0.96) with mean pulmonary artery pressure and the highest diagnostic accuracy in identifying PH patients (area under the curve 0.99). Risk of bias rated 14 studies as good/very good and 13 as unsatisfactory, with none justifying their sample size selection. CMR flow parameters correlate strongly with right heart catheterisation (RHC) measurements and demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy in identifying patients with PH, with 4D flow potentially adding greater value. This systematic review reinforces the potential benefit of CMR flow techniques in the investigation, prognostication and monitoring of PH patients. This systematic review is the first to evaluate the role of CMR flow techniques in PH and should inform guidelines on flow assessment in pulmonary hypertension.",

        "abstract": "A common complication of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is pulmonary hypertension (PH), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and worsened quality of life. In ILD, evaluating for PH is recommended prior to lung transplantation. However, this is not standardized or routinely performed in earlier stages of ILD, and guidelines lack an evidence-based approach for PH screening in this population. Furthermore, right-heart catheterization (RHC) access can be limited in many settings. The objective of PHINDER (Pulmonary Hypertension Screening in Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease for Earlier Detection) is to prospectively develop screening strategies for PH in patients with ILD. PHINDER is a prospective, non-interventional study that will enroll approximately 200 patients with ILD treated in a variety of settings in the United States (community centers, academic institutions, etc.). Patients must be diagnosed with ILD by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and must not have a previously reported mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg. To enrich the population for PH, patients must meet additional criteria on Pulmonary Function Tests, HRCT, signs/symptoms, 6-min walk test, or echocardiography. Patients will undergo a variety of routine ILD clinical assessments. Lastly, patients receive a RHC to assess for PH, defined as mPAP > 20 mmHg with pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance > 2 Wood Units. All treatment decisions are at the discretion of the provider and not influenced by study participation. Following study completion, statistical tools will be used to derive a practical model for a screening algorithm using the variables identified in the study as most predictive of PH in patients with ILD. Using a previously developed list of clinical assessments from PH and ILD experts, the PHINDER study aims to be the first prospectively enrolled study to evaluate prognostic screening strategies that can be used to develop an algorithm to predict the risk of PH in patients with ILD.

        "abstract": "The central variant of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (cvPRES) is an atypical subtype of PRES. Although no unifying definitions exists, it is most often characterized by vasogenic edema involving \"central\" structures, such as the brainstem, subcortical nuclei, and spinal cord, with relative sparing of the parieto-occipital lobes. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines and was pre-registered on PROSPERO [CRD42023483806]. Both the Joanna Briggs Institute and New-Castle Ottawa scale were used for case reports and cohort studies, respectively. The meta-analysis was completed using R-Studio and its associated \"metafor\" package. A comprehensive search in four databases yielded 70 case reports/series (<i>n</i> = 100) and 12 cohort studies. The meta-analysis revealed a pooled incidence rate of 13% (95% CI: 9-18%) for cvPRES amongst included cohort studies on PRES. Significant heterogeneity was observed (I<sup>2</sup> = 71% and a <i>τ</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.2046). The average age of affected individuals was 40.9 years, with a slightly higher prevalence in males (54%). The most common etiological factor was hypertension (72%). Fifty percent had an SBP >200 mmHg at presentation and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 217.6 ± 40.82. Imaging revealed an increased T<sub>2</sub> signal involving the brain stem (88%), most often in the pons (62/88; 70.45%), and 18/100 (18%) cases of PRES with spinal cord involvement (PRES-SCI). Management primarily involved blood pressure reduction, with adjunctive therapies for underlying causes such as anti-seizure medications or hemodialysis. The MAP between isolated PRES-SCI and cvPRES without spinal cord involvement did not show significant differences (<i>p</i> = 0.5205). Favorable outcomes were observed in most cases, with a mortality rate of only 2%. cvPRES is most often associated with higher blood pressure compared to prior studies with typical PRES. The pons is most often involved. Despite the severity of blood pressure and critical brain stem involvement, those with cvPRES have favorable functional outcomes and a lower mortality rate than typical PRES, likely attributable to reversible vasogenic edema without significant neuronal dysfunction.",

This study aims to examine the role of the Big Five personality traits in predicting hypertension risk in a Japanese cohort over a four-year period. Longitudinal data from the Human Information Database managed by NTT Data Institute of Management Consulting were analyzed. The final sample included 7,321 individuals (4,069 males, 3,252 females; mean age = 51.98, SD = 13.47). Personality traits were assessed using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory-Japanese (TIPI-J), and hypertension status was monitored annually from 2019 to 2022. A hierarchical multinomial logistic regression was employed to identify significant predictors of sustained and incident hypertension. Higher conscientiousness was associated with a lower risk of both sustained and incident hypertension, whereas greater openness was linked to an increased risk of sustained hypertension. In addition to personality traits, demographic factors such as age, gender, and income were significant predictors of hypertension risk. Personality traits, particularly conscientiousness and openness, play a crucial role in hypertension outcomes. These findings suggest the importance of personalized interventions that consider both psychological and demographic factors to improve hypertension prevention and management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Wilms tumour is the second most common extracranial solid tumour in paediatric patients. It is frequently associated with hypertension due to renal artery compression and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This study aimed to identify predictors of hypertension, assess therapeutic factors and evaluate its impact on renal function. We retrospectively analysed 67 patients treated for Wilms tumour following International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) guidelines at our institution between 2005 and 2024. Clinical records, radiological reports and laboratory data were collected. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hypertension, tumour characteristics, treatment and renal function. Hypertension was strongly associated with central tumour localisation (p=0.0003) and younger patient age (p=0.024). Prolonged postoperative antihypertensive therapy correlated with the need for combination therapy before surgery (p=0.01136). Younger age (p=0.02994) and higher hypertension grade (p=0.03884) were linked to the requirement for multidrug antihypertensive therapy. Hypertension at presentation did not affect renal function at the end of follow-up. Central tumour localisation and younger age are significant predictors of hypertension in children with Wilms tumour. The need for combination antihypertensive therapy before surgery predicts prolonged postoperative treatment. These findings underline the importance of early identification and management of hypertension in affected patients.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the impact of using electronic case report forms (eCRFs), automated blood pressure (BP) measurements, and reminders to healthcare professionals for improving BP control in treated hypertensive patients in clinical practice. Primary care and hospital outpatient clinics were randomized to assess consecutive treated hypertensives at baseline and after 8-12 weeks using a standard eCRF (control) or an upgraded version with automated reminders to healthcare professionals for their patients with uncontrolled hypertension (active). At each visit triplicate office BP measurements (Microlife BPA3 PC) were automatically uploaded to a cloud platform. Physicians were encouraged to follow the European Society of Hypertension guidelines. The analysis included 1,344 patients (55% men, mean age 65.2±11.8 [SD] years, 38/39/20% on 1/2/3 antihypertensive drugs respectively, 49/51% in active/control arm). The control arm had slightly higher baseline BP by 2.2±1/0.3±0.6 mmHg (systolic/diastolic, p<0.05/NS) and lower control rate (33%) than the active arm (38%, p<0.05). Treatment was intensified in 50/48% of patients with uncontrolled BP in the control/active arm (p=NS). Systolic BP decline tended to be larger in the active arm (by 2.1 mmHg, p=0.06), with more frequent use of fixed-dose combinations (60/50%, p=0.02). Hypertension control was considerably improved at follow-up in both arms, especially in the active versus control (56/47%, p<0.01). However, almost half of the participants remained uncontrolled in both arms. eCRFs, automated BP measurements, and reminders to healthcare professionals can help in improving hypertension control.

        "abstract": "The prognosis of heart failure is comparable to that of some of the most prevalent cancers, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. This study aimed to assess whether a mobile phone application could assist in the screening and early identification of HF in primary care settings. The Echocardiographic Society of Serbia launched a multicenter screening program in which general practitioners used a custom-designed mobile application to assess patients without a prior HF diagnosis. The app recommended referral for echocardiography and natriuretic peptide testing in patients presenting with a combination of cardiovascular risk factors or symptoms suggestive of HF. HF diagnosis encompassed all left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) phenotypes following the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Among 1028 screened outpatients (mean age 66 ± 11 years, 55 % female), 351 (34.1 %) were diagnosed with HF. The majority of cases were classified as having HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (70.1 %), followed by HF with mildly reduced EF (14.2 %) and HF with reduced EF (15.7 %). Multivariate regression analysis identified advanced age, atrial fibrillation, established coronary artery disease, abnormal electrocardiogram, chronic kidney disease, and a long-standing hypertension as independent predictors of newly diagnosed HF. Furthermore, by refining the cutoffs of traditional HF risk factors, we introduce the new ECHOS3 score for HF screening in primary care which demonstrates high sensitivity (88 %), but suboptimal specificity (35 %). Mobile app-assisted screening in primary care, based on risk factors and symptoms, effectively identified de novo HF in approximately one-third of patients, with HFpEF accounting for the majority of cases. This innovative approach may serve as an effective strategy for the early detection of HF, particularly in outpatients with borderline natriuretic peptide levels.",

        "abstract": "Health inequalities remain one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary healthcare, with primary care serving as both a gateway to services and a potential source of disparities. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to address these inequities through enhanced diagnostic capabilities, improved access to care, and personalised interventions. This comprehensive narrative review aimed to synthesise current evidence on AI applications in primary care settings, specifically targeting health inequality reduction and identifying both opportunities and barriers for equitable implementation. Following PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we employed a systematic approach to literature identification, selection, and synthesis across seven electronic databases covering literature from 2020 to 2024. Of 1,247 initially identified studies, 89 met inclusion criteria with 52 providing sufficient data quality for evidence synthesis. The review identified promising applications such as AI-powered risk stratification algorithms that improved hypertension control in low-income populations, telemedicine platforms reducing geographic barriers in rural communities, and natural language processing tools facilitating care for non-native speakers. However, significant challenges persist, including algorithmic bias that may perpetuate existing inequities, the digital divide excluding vulnerable populations, and insufficient representation in training datasets. Current evidence suggests that whilst AI holds transformative potential for advancing health equity, successful implementation requires intentional co-design with affected communities, robust bias mitigation strategies, and comprehensive digital literacy programmes. Future research must prioritise equity-centred AI development, longitudinal outcome studies in diverse populations, and policy frameworks ensuring responsible deployment. However, careful consideration of unintended consequences, including potential overdiagnosis, erosion of human clinical judgement, and inadvertent exclusion of vulnerable populations, is essential to prevent AI from exacerbating existing health disparities. The paradigm shift towards equity-first AI design represents a critical opportunity to leverage technology for social justice in healthcare.",

The review assesses the results from 14 published studies, including randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The DASH diet was associated with significant benefits in reducing HbA1c levels, improving lipid profiles, and decreasing the rates of cesarean sections and macrosomia. Low glycemic index diets improved postprandial glucose levels and reduced insulin requirements, though findings regarding overall glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes were conflicting. Plant-based diets were associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation, offering substantial maternal and neonatal health benefits. The Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced GDM incidence and improved metabolic health. Energy-restricted diets did not outperform standard care GDM diets that were focused on balanced macronutrient intake to meet nutritional needs of the pregnant person and fetus. These findings highlight the importance of dietary composition and quality in GDM management. Among the diets assessed, DASH appears most effective for glycemic control and improved pregnancy outcomes. Although the Mediterranean diet shares features with DASH, evidence for its efficacy in treating GDM is limited. Low glycemic index and plant-based diets also show promise in glycemic control. Further research is needed to establish standardized dietary guidelines for GDM management. High-quality studies, particularly randomized controlled trials comparing dietary patterns, are essential to optimize nutritional guidance for individuals with or at risk of GDM.",

Malignant hypertension (MHT) represents a severe form of HE characterised by small vessel damage. Although international guidelines provide clear definitions and treatment strategies, real-world data have shown persistent fragmentation and heterogeneity in the diagnosis and management of these patients. A web-based, anonymous survey promoted by the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) was distributed among physicians from 18 European and 4 non-European countries. The questionnaire assessed definitions, diagnostic work-up, BP measurement practices, and therapeutic strategies for HU, HE, and MHT. Sixty-four participants in 56 centres completed the survey. HU was correctly defined as a severe BP elevation without acute clinically symptomatic hypertension-mediated organ damage (A-HMOD) by 45.3% of respondents. Small cuffs were available to 79.7% and extra-large cuffs to 70.3% of respondents.. Intravenous antihypertensive therapy was used for HE by 88.7% of participants, while 20.6% also used intravenous drugs for HU.

        "abstract": "To provide a comprehensive overview of current research on intensive care providers' awareness, knowledge, and practices regarding IAP/IAH/ACS, as well as barriers to IAP measurement. This scoping review was guided by the framework of Arksey and Malley. Eight databases were searched to identify research published after 2007, including MEDLINE Complete, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Complete, ProQuest Health & Medical Complete, CNKI, and WANFANG. Two researchers reviewed and screened potentially relevant studies based on title and abstract. Full-text articles were independently assessed for eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria. Nineteen articles were included. Overall, pediatric intensive care providers demonstrated a lower awareness and knowledge of IAH/ACS compared to adult intensive care providers, particularly regarding the consensus definitions of IAH/ACS in critically ill children. IAP measurement has not been adequately integrated into clinical practice, with 18.0-73.0% of intensive care providers reporting they have never measured it. The frequency of IAP measurements and the criteria for determining which patients necessitate such measurements exhibited significant variability across different hospitals. The most frequently mentioned barriers to IAP measurement include a lack of knowledge regarding IAP measurement among adult intensivists, an overreliance on physical examination among pediatric intensivists, uncertainty in interpreting IAP data among adult intensive care nurses, and challenges in identifying populations at high risk of IAH among pediatric intensive care nurses. Diuretics were mentioned most often in the management of IAH/ACS, followed by administration of vasopressors and inotropes, decompressive laparotomy, and judicious administration of fluids and blood products. 37.0-66.3% of adult intensivists would choose a decompressive laparotomy in cases of ACS, whereas pediatric intensivists were less inclined to opt for the same approach. Since the publication of the WSACS consensus in 2007, there has been an improvement in awareness and knowledge regarding IAP/IAH/ACS among intensive care providers. Nevertheless, the understanding of the consensus definitions regarding IAH/ACS remains inadequate, particularly among pediatric intensive care providers. It is imperative to advocate for the implementation of WSACS guidelines in hospitals through targeted training programs and to promote the routine practice of IAP measurement in clinical settings.",

From the electronic medical record system, we retrieved data on BW and systolic BP of LighTen Cohort Study participants (age ≥18 years), who were still in care. We modelled BW and systolic BP over time utilizing interrupted time series (ITS) considering repeated measurements and adjusting for age and sex. Incident hypertension was defined as office BP ≥140/90 mmHg using ≥2 measurements on ≥2 consecutive visits. Data of 543 PLHIV (317 females) were analysed. ITS showed an increase in BW of 1.24 kg/year on TLE with a minimal contribution (36.5 g/year) during DTG treatment, in contrast to the change in systolic BP: 0.33mmHg/year on TLE vs. 2.63mmHg/year on DTG. Incident hypertension in previously normotensive PLHIV was confirmed in 5.4% (while on TLE) versus 11.0% (while on TLD). Following the initial increase in BW on TLE, a larger increase in BP and a higher risk of incident hypertension was associated with switching antiretroviral therapy from TLE to TLD. Focussing on BP control while on DTG and timely initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy can help to reduce the burden of hypertension in PLHIV with their inherent increased cardiovascular risk.",

This review examines recent advancements in treating advanced HCC, referencing the updated 2022 HCC guidelines and the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer system. Historically, first-line systemic therapies included sorafenib and lenvatinib, with regorafenib, cabozantinib, or ramucirumab serving as second-line options. Since 2020, immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown superior overall survival than sorafenib, leading to the adoption of combination therapies such as atezolizumab with bevacizumab and durvalumab with tremelimumab as first-line treatments. The IMbrave150 study demonstrated that atezolizumab-bevacizumab significantly extended median overall survival and progression-free survival, with the longest survival reported in any phase 3 trial for advanced HCC. Similarly, the HIMALAYA study indicated that durvalumab combined with tremelimumab significantly improved survival rates. Second-line therapies now include regorafenib, cabozantinib, ramucirumab, nivolumab with ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, each offering benefits for specific patient populations. Nonetheless, these therapies are associated with side effects that require careful management. Traditional targeted therapies can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular events, and hand-foot skin reactions, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors may cause immune-related adverse events affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system. Clinicians must be well-versed in these treatments and their potential side effects to provide optimal patient care. The emergence of combination therapies targeting complex biological pathways signifies a new paradigm in HCC treatment, emphasizing the importance of continuous education and vigilant monitoring to optimize patient outcomes.",

Only 127 out of the 131 patients were analysed, four patients were excluded, 3 patients died within 48 hours, and 1 patient left against medical advice. Pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders accounted for the majority of AKI as risk factors (57.1%), followed by haemorrhage (48.1%), which included abruption in 19.5%, placenta previa/accreta/percreta (10.4%), and PPH (14.3%).Patients who developed AKI had a substantially higher mean [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] on the day of admission (3.47±3.66 (ng/ml)<sup>2</sup>/1000) than those who did not (0.22±0.12 ng/ml)<sup>2</sup>/1000). ROC curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels on Day 1. [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] exhibited a sensitivity of 94.8% and specificity of 94% for predicting AKI at a cutoff value of ≥0.41(ng/ml)<sup>2</sup>/1000, with a 95% confidence interval and an AUC of 0.990. Patient risk of developing AKI was accurately predicted by the urine biomarker [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]. It also has good prognostic value.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disorders. Early detection and initiation of treatment have been identified as the most effective ways to reduce the burden of hypertension. The most common method for detecting hypertension is blood pressure measurement, typically performed with cuff-based devices, where systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) are measured through Korotkoff sounds. Although this method is accurate and non-invasive, it requires technical expertise and is often inaccessible in rural and remote areas. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using overt speech (random speech corpora) through multiple short recordings for hypertension screening based on two hypertension guidelines: (1) SBP ≥135 mm Hg OR DBP ≥85 mm Hg, and (2) SBP ≥140 mm Hg OR DBP ≥90 mm Hg. We incorporated speech recordings from 573 participants (197 women) with diverse ages and body mass index and extracted temporal, spectral, and nonlinear acoustic features through three different frameworks, all of which are based on classical and boosted machine learning models. The models were evaluated using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme. Our proposed pipeline achieved a balanced accuracy (BACC) of 61% for males and 70% for females under the relaxed criterion (SBP ≥135 OR DBP ≥85), and a BACC of 71% for males and 78% for females under the stricter European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines (SBP ≥140 OR DBP ≥90). These results demonstrate the potential of employing overt speech alongside acoustic analysis for hypertension screening.",

        "title": "Renal Denervation to Treat Hypertension: A Clinical State-of-the-Art Review.",
        "abstract": "Hypertension represents the leading risk factor for death globally, affecting one in two adults. Despite dozens of inexpensive medications and lifestyle changes that effectively lower blood pressure, hypertension control rates remain poor. Renal denervation (RDN) is a procedural therapy indicated as an adjunctive treatment for high blood pressure. FDA approval in late 2023 followed the publication of a series of rigorous, second-generation, randomized clinical trials that demonstrated safety and efficacy of the procedure. Two catheters employing radiofrequency (Spyral) and ultrasound (Paradise) are currently approved to ablate renal sympathetic nerves. In randomized sham-controlled trials, RDN lowered blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate and true resistant hypertension, and in patients both on and off anti-hypertensive medication. When evaluating patients for RDN, shared decision-making is a critical element, which should include potential benefits and that a minority may not respond to the therapy. There is only one constant predictor of magnitude of response: magnitude of baseline SBP, which is one reason why guidelines recommend prioritization of patients with resistant hypertension, together with patients whose BP cannot be effectively managed with medication. Before referring patients to a trained interventionalist, it is important to optimize medical therapy and adherence, and confirm uncontrolled hypertension out-of-office. Patients should be screened for primary aldosteronism and for other secondary causes of hypertension if clinically indicated, though sleep apnea is not a contraindication to RDN. A team approach is advised, with hypertension specialists and interventionalists collaborating. Data from global registries will augment our knowledge and guide future implementation.",

        "abstract": "Insulin resistance (IR) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and advancement of metabolic dysfunction-related steatosis liver disease (MASLD). Despite the recent proposal of the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) as a dependable indirect indicator of IR, limited research has delved into the correlation between METS-IR and MASLD risk. Consequently, the objective of this study was to examine the relationship between METS-IR and MASLD within the U.S. population and evaluate its predictive capacity for MASLD risk. Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional study was carried out on 2764 participants. The laboratory measurements and clinical data, which are risk factors for MASLD, were analyzed. After adjustment for confounders, a significant, stable, and positive association was demonstrated between METS-IR and MASLD risk (Odds ratio (OR) increase of 2.28 per standard deviation (SD)), 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.58 to 3.30, P for trend = 0.001). Consistently, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) showed that METS-IR (AUC (95% CI) 0.823 (0.807-0.838)) better predicted the risk of MASLD than homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), triglyceride glucose index (TyG), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL), visceral adiposity index (VAI), and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Not only that, the AUC of METS-IR on the risk of MASLD remained the greatest in the subgroups of sex, age, race, overweight status, hypertension status, and diabetes status. Furthermore, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), decision curve analysis (DCA), and net reclassification index (NRI) also showed satisfactory predictive power of METS-IR. In this dataset, METS-IR was found to be linked to an increased risk of MASLD and can be a useful tool for identifying individuals at high risk of MASLD.",

This study aimed to identify factors contributing to perceived handling difficulty, using data from harmo<sup>®</sup>, a nationwide electronic medication notebook system. A questionnaire was distributed to adult users who had been prescribed oral medications, and the responses were linked with personal health records to analyze medication characteristics and patient backgrounds. Among the 1,230 respondents, 24% reported difficulty with small tablets or capsules. A size threshold was identified: a combined long and short diameter of 13.3 mm or less was most associated with handling problems (ROC-AUC = 0.834). Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that difficulty in applying force with the hands (OR = 2.64), prescription of small tablets or capsules (OR = 2.52), and medical histories of hypertension (OR = 1.69) and osteoporosis (OR = 4.99) were significantly associated with reported difficulty. These results suggest that both the physical characteristics of formulations and individual patient factors influence medication usability.

Data collected by examining the results of more than 50 studies published during the past years by directly quantifying, via microneurography, the sympathetic nerve traffic responses to non-pharmacological and pharmacological antihypertensive treatment have shown that no normalization of the sympathetic cardiovascular function is achieved. Recently, a study by our group carried out in 219 hypertensive patients under monotherapy or combination drug treatment confirmed these results, by showing that, despite achieving an optimal blood pressure control, antihypertensive treatment fails to restore the normal sympathetic neural function detected in the normotensive healthy subjects. The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in blood pressure regulation and hypertension pathophysiology. Recent findings document its involvement also in determining the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensive agents. However, the available data show the inability to achieve during treatment a full sympathetic normalization, a finding which may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for the residual cardiovascular risk of the treated hypertensive patient.",

Cutaneous manifestations are common but typically limited to hyperpigmentation, hemangiomas, and sclerodermoid changes. We herein report the first case of POEMS syndrome presenting with skin lesions closely resembling those of <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> infection. A 65-year-old woman was admitted with malignant hypertension, refractory ascites, symmetrical thigh ecchymoses evolving into tense hemorrhagic bullae, and progressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Laboratory workup revealed thrombocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, acute kidney injury, an IgA-λ monoclonal band on serum immunofixation, and a markedly elevated VEGF level (729.7 pg./mL, reference range: 9-86 pg./mL). Electromyography confirmed a demyelinating neuropathy. Infectious, autoimmune, hepatic, renal, and malignant etiologies were systematically excluded. A multidisciplinary team reached the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome based on two mandatory criteria (polyneuropathy and monoclonal plasma cell disorder), one major criterion (elevated VEGF), and multiple minor criteria (extravascular volume overload, endocrinopathy, skin changes, thrombocytosis, organomegaly). The patient received bortezomib plus dexamethasone, leading to gradual resolution of skin lesions, improvement of neuropathic symptoms, and reduction of VEGF levels. After six cycles, ascites resolved and neurological function partially recovered. This case expands the spectrum of POEMS-associated skin changes to include <i>V. vulnificus</i>-like bullous lesions. \"<i>V. vulnificus</i>-like\" refers purely to morphological similarity and not microbiological confirmation. Awareness of such atypical presentations is essential for early recognition. Clinicians should consider POEMS syndrome in patients with unexplained multisystem involvement and vascular skin changes.

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease, the world's leading cause of death, could be significantly reduced through sodium reduction strategies; however, the implementation of such strategies has had limited impact in Australia and globally. Switching to potassium-enriched salt is a highly promising intervention, but uptake by the food industry and consumers remains limited. This study investigated the barriers and enablers for scaling up potassium-enriched salt use in Australia. A qualitative, theory-informed study design was used to conduct 24 semi-structured interviews with representatives from civil society, government, and industry. Interviewees discussed scaling up potassium-enriched salt in relation to their interests, ideas, existing policies and guidelines, and perceived challenges and opportunities within the Australian context. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Minimal knowledge and awareness of potassium-enriched salt among all stakeholder groups was the most prominent finding. The key perceived barriers were low consumer demand for potassium-enriched salt products and little incentive for industry to invest in supply. Further, government stakeholders expressed hesitancy to implement policies due to perceived health risks such as hyperkalaemia. Interviewees identified increased awareness, support for industry research and development, and leveraging current policies and initiatives (such as the Australian Health Star Rating system) as potential enablers. Improving stakeholder understanding of the benefit of switching to potassium-enriched salt in Australia may require a coordinated advocacy strategy that disseminates the evidence and addresses misconceptions. Efforts to drive increased supply and demand could be advanced using a multi-sectoral approach that focuses on supporting industry uptake, encouraging consumer demand, and informing policy implementation.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is a major health problem and is the leading cause of death worldwide. Accumulation studies confirm that exosomes derived from stem cells have been shown to effectively repair MI injury-induced cardiomyocyte damage. However, the cardioprotective benefits of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC)-Exos remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of exosomes from ADSC on the hearts of MI-treated mice and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Cellular and molecular mechanisms were investigated using cultured ADSCs. On C57BL/6 J mice, we performed myocardial MI model. HMEC-1 was used to identify the regulatory mechanism. ELISA was used for inflammatory factor expression detection. Luciferase report analysis detection showed the relationship among miR-138-5p, Sirt1 and circ-Hipk3. ADSCs exosome treatment significantly alleviates MI induced myocardial damage by promotion autophagy and inhibits inflammatory response. Circ-Hipk3 play an important role in ADSCs exosome mediated protective effect on MI induced myocardial damage. Luciferase report analysis confirmed that miR-138-5p and SIRT1 were at circ-Hipk3 downstream. Downregulation SIRT1 or upregulation miR-138-5p reversed the regulation effect of circ-Hipk3 on autophagy and inflammatory factor expression. Overexpression circ-Hipk3 increased the protective effect of ADSC-Exo on MI induced myocardial damage. In summary, these findings show that circ-Hipk3 from ADSC-Exos can alleviate cardiac injury in MI-treated mice via the miR-138-5p/Sirt1 axis mediated autophagy signaling pathway. ADSC-Exos containing circ-Hipk3 has a promising therapeutic potential in MI induced cardiac injury.",

Several low-cost surrogate markers have been proposed to assess IR, such as the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-BMI, TG/HDL-C, metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), and single-point insulin sensitivity estimator (SPISE). This study aimed to develop nomogram models integrating these indices with clinical data to predict MCI in patients with T2DM. A total of 600 patients diagnosed with T2DM were recruited. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were documented, and cognitive performance was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of MCI, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluated their predictive accuracy. Two nomogram models were constructed: Model 1 included METS-IR, age, sex, education level, and hypertension; Model 2 substituted SPISE for METS-IR, retaining other clinical variables. All IR surrogate indices were significantly associated with MCI and reduced MMSE scores (P < 0.001). METS-IR and SPISE exhibited higher predictive accuracy (AUC: METS-IR = 0.809, SPISE = 0.805) compared to TyG, TyG-BMI, and TG/HDL-C, particularly among female participants. Nomogram models demonstrated robust predictive performance (AUC: Model 1 = 0.846; Model 2 = 0.838). Nomogram models incorporating METS-IR or SPISE alongside key clinical parameters effectively predicted the risk of MCI among patients with T2DM.

Since 2015, large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or high-risk profiles. These findings-originating from landmark trials such as EMPA-REG OUTCOME, LEADER, and SUSTAIN-6-have led to substantial revisions in international guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology, and American Heart Association, which now recommend the use of SGLT2i or GLP-1 RAs, often in conjunction with metformin. SGLT2i have shown robust effects in reducing heart failure hospitalization and slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease, while GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing atherothrombotic events, particularly non-fatal stroke. Additionally, emerging data supports the complementary use of both drug classes, revealing additive benefits on cardiovascular and renal outcomes without increased toxicity. This narrative review summarizes the mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, safety profiles, and sex-specific outcomes associated with SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs. It also highlights key evidence supporting their combined use and underscores their critical role in optimizing long-term outcomes in patients with T2DM and cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Evaluate and compare the results of weight loss outcomes, associated medical problems resolution, and complications in the short and long term between SADI-S and RYGB. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing SADI-S and RYGB as primary surgery were included if they reported weight loss (total weight loss (TWL), excess weight loss (EWL), or body mass index (BMI) changes), associated medical problems remission (diabetes and hypertension), and postoperative outcomes (complications, hospital stay, and operative time). A meta-analysis of mean differences (MD) was conducted to assess continuous outcomes, and a meta-analysis of odds ratios (OR) was performed to evaluate the categorical variables; a random effects model was used. Eight studies, including 4259 patients (1625 SADI-S; 2634 RYGB), were analysed. Six studies with over 2 years of follow-up (mean 3.93 years (1.79)) were included for long-term outcomes, while all eight were considered for short-term outcomes. SADI-S resulted in a statistically significant higher total weight loss (MD 10.03; 95% CI 4.7-15.35; p < 0.001), excess weight loss (MD 10.15; 95% CI 5.2-15.1; p < 0.01), diabetes remission (OR 3.48; 95% CI 2.02-6.02; p < 0.001) with a similar number of long-term complications (OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.03-1.36; p = 0.10). Short-term complications were inferior in the subgroup of patients undergoing SADI-S with < 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> of BMI (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.61; p < 0.01) as well as hospital stay (MD = -0.69; 95% CI -1.03 to -0.36, p < 0.01) and severe complications (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.80; p = 0.01).

        "abstract": "Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.",

        "abstract": "Arterial hypertension (AH) and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The extent to which the coexistence of AH and FH amplifies the ASCVD risk is not well known. We aimed to explore the effect of AH on the prevalence of ASCVD in patients with FH. This was a cross-sectional analysis from the HELLAS-FH registry. A total of 2367 adults with heterozygous FH were studied. Out of these, 602 (25.4%) patients had AH. Patients with AH were more likely to have additional ASCVD risk factors (diabetes, smoking, obesity, elevated triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) compared with patients without AH. Patients with AH had significantly higher prevalence of established coronary artery disease (CAD) (44 vs 14%, p < 0.001), premature CAD (39 vs 13%, p < 0.001), stroke (6 vs 2%, p < 0.001), and peripheral artery disease (6 vs 1%, p < 0.001) compared with those without after adjustment for major ASCVD risk factors. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly associated with increased odds of established CAD per 1 mmHg [odds ratio (OR) 1.075; 95% CI 1.001-1.153; p = 0.048], stroke (OR 1.023; 95% CI 1.004-1.042; p = 0.019) and PAD (OR 1.022; 95% CI 1.002-1.041; p = 0.028), while diastolic blood pressure showed no significant association with these outcomes. In conclusion, AH is associated with higher ASCVD risk factor burden and increased prevalence of ASCVD in patients with FH.",

This study investigates associations between childhood cancer and multiple maternal comorbidities. A population-based case-control study was conducted using Danish national registers, with maternal health conditions identified from the National Patient Register and Medical Births Registry. We employed the Obstetric Comorbidity Index using ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes. The study population (1977-2013) included 6419 cases and 160484 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression estimated pediatric cancer risk. A maternal comorbidity score of one or more was linked to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.03-1.12), retinoblastoma (OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 0.94-1.23), and rhabdomyosarcoma (OR = 1.11, 95%CI: 0.98-1.26).

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health concern with significant mortality rate associated with comorbidities like diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Thus, treatment guidelines recommend first-line treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is) and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists for T2DM with comorbidities. However, in patients when these treatments are not tolerated, contraindicated, or considered expensive, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4Is) serve as an add-on or alternative for glycemic control without hypoglycemia risk. This study aimed to understand patients' preferences in three South Asian countries between SGLT2I (medication A) and DPP4I (medication B) and the reasons influencing their preference for effective management of T2DM. In this cross-sectional study (November 2021 to November 2022) across India, Taiwan, and the Philippines, patients with T2DM on both SGLT2I and DPP4I or neither completed the survey to identify their medication preferences. Differences in baseline characteristics and preferred medication (chi-squared/Fisher's exact tests) and potential attributes influencing preferences (logistic regression) were analyzed. Among 1224 participants, SGLT2I (64.5%) was significantly preferred over DPP4I (35.5%). Mean age of participants was 59.3 years and the majority were female patients/individuals (52.5%), overweight/obese (56.6%), with glycated hemoglobin levels ≥ 7% (57.6%). Common comorbidities included hypertension (62.7%) and dyslipidemia (75.5%); the majority were without history of CVD (83.7%) or CKD (84%). The most prescribed T2DM medication was biguanide (83.9%), followed by combination of SGLT2Is and DPP4Is (51.3%). The most influential attributes were blood sugar reduction (56.9%), reduced heart failure hospitalization (14.4%), and kidney disease risk reduction (12.1%). SGLT2I users showed a higher preference for heart failure hospitalization reduction (16.5%) or weight reduction (11.1%). Country of residence, thiazolidinedione use, and SGLT2I/DPP4I use were significant factors in logistic regression analyses. Asian patients with T2DM preferred medication profile resembling SGLT2Is over DPP4Is.

        "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) remains the cornerstone in the treatment of psoriasis. However, concerns about its potential to contribute to liver fibrosis or cirrhosis have remained. We aimed to define the relationship between MTX exposure or other risk factors with liver fibrosis in patients with psoriasis. We examined the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in patients with psoriasis from a single center between 2019 and 2024. At the time of LSM, baseline clinical, demographic, comorbidities, laboratory, and medication information were obtained. Psoriasis patients were stratified into two groups: one that had not been exposed to MTX (no MTX), and another that had been exposed to MTX for more than 6 months. Liver fibrosis was measured by transient elastography (TE) and FIB 4. We used a cut-off of ≤7.9 kPa to rule out advanced fibrosis and ≥11.5 kPa to rule in cirrhosis, respectively. Of the 483 individuals with psoriasis, 101 (21%) patients showed TE values ≥ 7.9 kPa. Sixty-five (22.3%) of MTX-exposed group showed TE ≥ 7.9 kPa compared to thirty-six (19.3% with no-MTX (<i>P</i> = 0.33). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only significant factor linked to stiffness <b>≥</b> 7.9 was type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8; 95% CI 1.44-5.43; <i>P</i> = 0.002). Liver fibrosis did not correlate with age, MTX cumulative dose, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or hypertension in multivariate analysis, despite some of these factors showing significance on univarite analysis. T2DM, not cumulative methotrexate dose, was associated with liver stiffness. These findings reinforce the need to revise methotrexate monitoring guidelines to incorporate transient elastography, particularly for patients with metabolic risk factors.",

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures and is necessary for the treatment of most forms of hydrocephalus. The aim of the study was to determine demographic indicators, comorbidities, complications and outcome of patients with hydrocephalus after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation. This is a retrospective study. Data on the subjects' age, gender, symptoms, degree of disability, complications, comorbidities and outcome after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation were recorded. All patients were clinically examined by neurologists and neurosurgeons and diagnosed through unified and standardized algorithms according to established guidelines for hydrocephalus. Cognitive functionality was assessed according to the Mini Mental State Test. Urinary incontinence was assessed based on patients' subjective feelings. Data on comorbidities and complications were collected from the patients' medical records. The degree of disability was assessed using the modified Rankin scale. The average age of the subjects was 58.7 years, and the highest frequency of subjects was in the age group over 61 years (62.2%). There was no statistically significant difference in age in men (X=54.69, SD=18.77), or women (X=60.88, SD=19.96); t (35)=0.8, p=0.3. A statistically significant number of patients with hydrocephalus had a lower degree of disability after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation (p<0.05). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity with hydrocephalus (35.1%). Pneumonia was the most common general complication in patients with hydrocephalus (8.1%). Females had a statistically significantly worse survival (p=0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome of hydrocephalus patients in relation to age groups, comorbidities, general and complications after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation (p>0.05). Patients with hydrocephalus after ventriculoperitoneal shunt implantation have a lower degree of disability, and female patients have statistically significantly worse survival. Hypertension is the most common comorbidity, and pneumonia the most common complication in patients with hydrocephalus.

Fasting cFBG levels were measured prior to FDG PET/CT and classified according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of cFBG levels. Sensitivity analyses were performed on patients examined before 11 AM and fasting for 8 h as well as patients without known diabetes. The cohort included 336 melanoma patients with a median age of 67 years (IQR 57-76), 36 % female (122/336), and 12 % (40/336) with known diabetes mellitus.

It is classified into primary and secondary forms, with secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis often resulting from factors such as obesity, hypertension, or genetic mutations. The management of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis remains challenging due to the lack of standardized therapeutic guidelines. This case report describes a 21-year-old male diagnosed with biopsy-proven secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, likely due to obesity-related hyperfiltration, who exhibited significant improvement in proteinuria following cyclosporine therapy. Despite initial treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and prednisone, the patient continued to have persistent proteinuria. Low-dose cyclosporine therapy was introduced, leading to a marked reduction in proteinuria without deterioration in renal function. This case highlights the potential role of cyclosporine in the management of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, particularly in cases with suspected genetic predisposition. Further research is needed to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of cyclosporine in secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis management.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Controlling blood pressure can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. The patients with hypertension are mainly treated with antihypertensive drugs. For the patients who can't achieve the target blood pressure with a single drug, comprehensive treatment strategies become particularly important. Chinese patent medicines are prepared by modern extraction and processing technology based on the basic theory of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Due to the stable antihypertensive effect, target organ protection, and synergistic effect with western medicine, Chinese patent medicines are becoming one of the effective options for the treatment of hypertension. At present, there are many systematic reviews on the treatment of hypertension with Chinese patent medicines, which makes it difficult for health policy makers and health service providers to choose the best evidence for the treatment. Umbrella review can integrate multiple systematic reviews to comprehensively assess the quality of evidence and potential bias, thereby providing high-quality evidence-based medicine basis for formulating clinical guidelines and optimizing treatment strategies. In this study, the systematic reviews/Meta-analysis of Chinese patent medicines in the treatment of essential hypertension were systematically searched. Sixty-nine articles were included for the umbrella review. Literature information was extracted, and the corrected covered area(CCA) was calculated to quantitatively evaluate the overlap degree of original studies in systematic reviews/Meta-analysis. The risk of bias in systematic reviews(ROBIS) tool and Cochrane RoB tool 2.0 were used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. A Measure Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2(AMSTAR 2) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of systematic reviews/Meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was evaluated based on the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation(GRADE). The results showed that the Chinese patent medicines in the categories of treating wind, resolving stasis, and reinforcing healthy Qi were effective in lowering blood pressure. The Chinese patent medicines for resolving stasis combined with conventional treatment can lower blood pressure and the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and total cholesterol in the treatment of hypertension complicated with coronary heart disease and hypertension complicated with left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, the combined therapy can recover the interventricular septal thickness, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left ventricular mass index, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and left ventricular ejection fraction in the case of left ventricular hypertrophy. The Chinese patent medicines for resolving stasis and for replenishing Qi and restoring pulse can be used in combination with conventional treatment for hypertension complicated with arrhythmia, which can lower blood pressure while improving the outcome indicators such as the P-wave dispersion of arrhythmia, left atrial diameter, ejection fraction, heart rate, and recurrence time. Due to the heterogeneity, the efficacy evidence obtained by the umbrella review needs to be further verified through precise clinical studies and long-term follow-up.",

The patient declined surgery and was treated with spironolactone as an alternative. Despite optimized medication over 3 months, her blood pressure remained poorly controlled, and she continued to experience hypokalemia and muscle weakness. The patient subsequently underwent right-sided superselective adrenal artery embolization (SAAE). The procedure led to significant reductions in aldosterone and cortisol levels, achieving long-term blood pressure control and biochemical remission with minimal doses of antihypertensive drugs and no need for potassium supplementation. Two years of follow-up confirmed sustained clinical and biochemical improvements, along with evidence of ameliorated target organ damage.

        "title": "Interdisciplinary recommendations for recurrent hyperkalaemia: Insights from the GUARDIAN-HK European Steering Committee.",
        "abstract": "Recurrent hyperkalaemia (HK) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and is common among patients with cardiorenal disease. Many of these patients require renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapies that further enhance the risk of HK. Every acute HK episode constitutes an opportunity to treat and prevent recurrent HK. This report aims to support multidisciplinary team efforts in managing patients who may be affected by recurrent HK. A panel of nine European experts in the management of HK (four nephrologists, four cardiologists, one internist) reviewed existing guidance and evidence on the diagnosis and management of HK at a face-to-face (26th September 2023) and two virtual meetings (24th January and 14th March 2024). The panel develop 10 consensus recommendations and a management algorithm across three domains: duty of care, identifying patients at risk of HK recurrence and managing the risk of HK recurrence. Early identification and management of those at risk of recurrent HK will improve clinical outcomes but requires an interdisciplinary, co-ordinated approach. Disease-modifying therapies such as RAASi should no longer be considered reversible causes of HK, and efforts should be taken to up-titrate these to guideline-directed target doses even in the setting of an acute HK event. Every acute HK episode constitutes an opportunity to treat and prevent recurrent HK, contributing to long-term clinical benefits. The recommendations, intentionally broad in scope, complement existing management guidelines and plans, fostering a collective responsibility among healthcare professionals managing patients with HK.",

        "title": "Practical Management of Cardiovascular Adverse Events with BTKi Treatment in Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: A Consensus Report by Hematologists and Cardiologists.",
        "abstract": "Cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs), especially atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension, have been reported in patients receiving treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis). Although these AEs are managed effectively in most cases and AE management guidelines exist, practical management approaches are inconsistent across regions and practices. We aimed to address these inconsistencies by developing consensus recommendations. A European expert panel was assembled comprising eight hematologists and six cardiologists. Literature analysis, expert interviews, and the Delphi method were used to gain consensus on screening, monitoring, and treatment of AF and hypertension statements. Maintaining BTKi treatment is paramount to maximize time to next treatment; for patients at high risk of progression, this can be achieved by appropriately treating hypertension and AF and adjusting the BTKi dose. Patients should be risk-stratified as low, moderate, high, or very high risk of cancer therapy-related CV toxicity and treated according to their disease status so that CLL treatment can be maintained. Patient education on symptom monitoring, home blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiograms (baseline, every 3 months) are recommended to detect/monitor AF and hypertension. Close collaboration between hematologists and cardiologists is vital to achieve optimal patient outcomes.",

        "title": "Preeclampsia in twin pregnancies: time for differential approaches?",
        "abstract": "Twin pregnancies carry a 2-3 times higher risk of hypertensive disorders compared to singleton pregnancies. Despite this, clinical guidelines do not differentiate between the two. Compare the onset, progression, and incidence of preeclampsia (PET) in twin versus singleton pregnancies, both antepartum and postpartum. This retrospective single-center cohort study analyzed maternal and neonatal outcomes related to hypertension (HTN) in twin and singleton pregnancies from January 2008 to July 2021. Patients with pre-existing chronic HTN, kidney disease, or intrauterine fetal demise were excluded. Primary outcome was the gestational age at the diagnosis of severe PET. Secondary outcomes included rates of mild and severe HTN-related complications, gestational age and mean blood pressure at diagnosis, incidence of eclampsia, antihypertensive treatment requirements, and maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. A total of 403 twin and 3096 singleton pregnancies were included. Severe PET rates were significantly higher in twin pregnancies compared to singletons (34.0 % vs. 19.3 %, p < 0.001). Both mild and severe PET presented significantly earlier in twin pregnancies (35.7 ± 2.1 vs. 38.1 ± 2.6 weeks, p < 0.001; and 35.5 ± 2.3 vs. 37.5 ± 3.1 weeks, p < 0.001, respectively). Twin pregnancies also demonstrated increased antihypertensive treatment use and required multiple medications more frequently. Preeclampsia in twin pregnancies develops earlier and presents more severely compared to singleton pregnancies. These findings highlight distinct clinical courses, underscoring the need for tailored management strategies. Enhanced monitoring and more aggressive interventions, including earlier delivery, may improve outcomes in twin pregnancies.",

        "title": "Elranatamab for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma With Severe Renal Impairment Requiring Hemodialysis.",
        "abstract": "Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients with dialysis-dependent renal impairment face limited therapeutic options due to exclusion from clinical trials, a lack of evidence-based guidelines, and inferior outcomes. Bispecific antibodies targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) have shown promise in RRMM treatment but remain understudied in this vulnerable population. To illustrate this issue, we introduce the case of a 68-year-old female with triple-class RRMM and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, treated with elranatamab as a second line treatment following progression after therapy with daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Despite experiencing grade I cytokine release syndrome during the initial administrations, symptoms were managed effectively with tocilizumab and dexamethasone, allowing treatment continuation. The patient achieved a very good partial remission within 7 weeks. Although hemodialysis dependence persisted, the therapy was well-tolerated with manageable adverse events. According to the literature, BCMA-directed immunotherapies, including teclistamab, belantamab mafodotin, and idecabtagene vicleucel, have shown efficacy in dialysis-dependent RRMM patients, though data remain limited. Pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild or moderate renal impairment does not have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of elranatamab. Although no retrospective studies or case series have investigated the use of elranatamab in dialysis-dependent patients, a single case report suggests that its administration is both feasible and well-tolerated in this population despite the absence of comprehensive pharmacokinetic data. This review highlights feasibility, safety, and encouraging efficacy of elranatamab in managing RRMM in a dialysis-dependent patient, representing the second case report in the literature. By providing real-world evidence for the use of bispecific antibodies in end stage renal disease patients, this review emphasizes the potential for expanding therapeutic options to this vulnerable population while highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring of infection prevention and management. Prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and optimize therapeutic strategies for patients with RRMM and severe renal impairment.",

        "title": "Prognostic value of albumin-corrected anion gap in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated liver injury: a retrospective study.",
        "abstract": "Albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) is closely associated with the prognosis of many critical illnesses. However, the prognostic value of ACAG in sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is poorly understood. We explored the association between ACAG and patient prognosis in individuals diagnosed with SALI. Data from patients with SALI admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2008 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. ACAG was calculated based on the first measurement of the anion gap and albumin level within 24 h of admission. The optimal cutoff value for ACAG was established using R statistical software. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare mortality risks between the two groups, while multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to examine the association between ACAG and mortality risk in SALI patients. To assess a potential dose-response relationship, restricted cubic splines (RCS) were applied. Lastly, subgroup analyses were carried out to investigate the correlation between ACAG levels and prognosis across different patient populations. A total of 443 critically ill patients with SALI were included in the lower (n = 342) and higher ACAG (n = 101) groups based on ACAG levels. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding age, sex, or ethnicity (P = 0.12, 0.84, and 0.85, respectively). However, patients in the higher ACAG group exhibited a greater propensity for developing respiratory failure. The rates of ICU, in-hospital, 14-day, 28-day, and 90-day mortality were significantly elevated in the higher ACAG group (all P < 0.001). Higher ACAG levels were significantly associated with an increased mortality risk at multiple time points (all P < 0.001). ACAG levels and mortality showed a significant linear relationship. The impact of ACAG on mortality risk remained consistent across subgroups defined by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory failure, with no significant interactions observed (all P for interaction > 0.05). ACAG serves as a significant independent predictor of mortality risk in patients with SALI. ACAG predicts both short-term mortality risk (such as ICU mortality) and long-term mortality risk (such as 90-day mortality). ACAG may serve as a valuable tool for prognostic assessment in patients with SALI with broad applicability.",
