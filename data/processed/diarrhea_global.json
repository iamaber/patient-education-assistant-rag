        "abstract": "Among the many <i>Entamoeba</i> species that infect humans, only <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i> is considered pathogenic, being responsible for amoebiasis or amoebic dysentery. Between June and October 2022, a total of 106 stool samples were collected from children under six years of age presenting with diarrhea at Paiji Hospital in the city of Paiji, Iraq. DNA was extracted from all stool specimens to detect the presence of parasitic organisms. Of the 106 fecal samples, 4 (3.7%) tested positive for <i>Entamoeba</i> spp. using an initial PCR amplification targeting approximately 900 bp of the 18S rRNA gene. Among these, only one sample tested positive for <i>E. histolytica</i> using a nested multiplex PCR assay. In this study, neither <i>E. moshkovskii</i> nor <i>E. dispar</i> was detected. Sequence analysis of the partial 18S rRNA gene revealed that 0.9% of samples were positive for <i>E. histolytica</i>, while 2.8% were positive for <i>E. coli</i>. The sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers OP868733.1 for <i>E. histolytica</i> and OP868730.1, OP868731.1, and OP868732.1 for <i>E. coli</i>. Children were infected with different species of <i>Entamoeba</i>. Molecular methods are essential for distinguishing between <i>Entamoeba</i> species due to their significance in accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "A 43-year-old man presents to the hospital with two weeks of persistent fevers, accompanied by myalgias, hematochezia, and abdominal pain. Acute infectious causes were ruled out, and elevated inflammatory markers suggested inflammatory diarrhea or autoimmune conditions. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were negative. Further testing showed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), ribonucleoprotein (RNP), rheumatoid factor (RF), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, suggesting an HCV-associated autoimmune process. Hematuria and neuropathic pain raised suspicion for mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to HCV, supported by low complement levels. Treatment started with prednisone. Cryoglobulins came back positive, confirming mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to HCV. The patient was referred to the hepatology clinic for antiviral treatment, where he completed treatment, with symptoms resolving, except for his neuropathy.",

        "abstract": "Characterized by weight loss, intestinal ulcerations, and diarrhea with blood or mucus, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a chronic gastrointestinal condition. The rising incidence of IBD is placing pressure on healthcare systems globally. Although the precise etiology remains elusive, the dysregulation between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a crucial determinant in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Though 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is effective in the early-stage of IBD, restoring intestinal environmental balance, its use is limited by off-target problem and toxicity. This study introduces a novel oral nano-drug delivery system that improves efficacy and reduces side effects by coordinating 5-ASA with Zn<sup>2+</sup> to form nanozymes (5-ASA-Zn<sup>2+</sup>, A-Z) and encapsulating them in nanoplatform (A-Z@cHP), which made from chitosan (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA), pectin (PC) and calcium chloride. The nanozymes displayed uniform particle size, stability, and ability to regulate ROS and H<sub>2</sub>S. The nanoplatform showed the characteristic of acid resistance, pectinase responsive drug release, low cytotoxicity, and effective targeting <i>via</i> CD44 receptors. In a DSS-induced mouse colitis model, A-Z@cHP significantly improved body weight, disease activity index, colon length, and colonic barrier while reducing inflammation by restoring the balance of ROS and H<sub>2</sub>S. Furthermore, the balance restoration of intestinal flora also benefits from the above regulatory effect of nanoparticles. Biosafety evaluations confirmed no significant side effects. In conclusion, this targeted nanoplatform provides a promising new approach for improving the efficacy of 5-ASA against IBD.",

        "abstract": "Since iron is an essential mineral for both host and microbial communities, how to scientifically replenish the iron in the context of bacterial infection has become a critical issue. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of intramuscular and oral iron supplementation on the progression of bacterial infection. Weaned piglets served as an experimental model for iron supplementation following enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) K88 infection. Piglets in control and oral iron supplementation groups received FeSO<sub>4</sub> orally, while those in the intramuscular iron supplementation group were administered iron dextran (FeDex) via intramuscular injection. After challenge, piglets were euthanized, and serum and small intestinal tissues were collected for biochemical analysis, histological examination, inflammatory response assessment, gut microbiota profiling, and iron metabolism evaluation. Intramuscular iron supplementation alleviated the clinical symptoms of bacterial infection, decreasing the diarrhea rate by 53% and mitigating the inflammatory response with lower serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. Compared to oral iron supplementation, intramuscular iron supplementation significantly mitigated the intestinal damage caused by ETEC K88 infection by increasing the ratio of villus length to crypt depth, and repairing epithelial tight junction. Furthermore, intramuscular iron supplementation also protected the function of intestinal goblet cells and improved iron metabolism of infected piglets. Intramuscular iron supplementation is more effective during infection than oral iron supplementation.",

Currently, M2 ion-channel inhibitors, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors have been applied clinically as therapeutics against IAVs. However, IAVs possess adaptive mutations to these inhibitors, especially M2 ion channel and NA inhibitors. Thus, novel antiviral agents should be developed. In the present study, we screen approximately 5500 compounds and identify an IAV inhibitor, nanchangmycin, which possesses a robust antiviral activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, it exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity for additional virus infections, including pseudorabies virus, herpes virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Most importantly, it has antiviral activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains in sub-μM ranges and promotes the survival of MDCK cells infected with the oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus strain. Further studies reveal that it blocks the nuclei migration of viral nuclear proteins (NPs), resulting in NP accumulation in the cytoplasm, particularly within perinuclear endosomes. Also, it inhibits IAVs by blocking endosomal acidification. Overall, nanchangmycin has the potential to be developed as an anti-influenza agent.",

In recent years, the incidence rate of KD has increased year by year worldwide, so it is particularly important to strengthen the diagnosis of KD and identify CAL early. This retrospective cohort study included a total of 436 children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and aimed to develop a predictive model for CAL using early clinical symptoms and laboratory features. To reduce potential confounding, propensity score matching (PSM) was applied, and both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of CAL. Subsequently, through machine learning, a predictive column chart model was constructed using clinical features and routine laboratory blood indicators, and the model was evaluated using ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA curves. This study found that gender, medical history, cough, diarrhea symptoms, and high CRP levels were independent risk factors for concurrent CAL. To further predict CAL risk, a column chart model was constructed based on LASSO regression and ten fold cross validation. The ROC curve in the training queue showed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.879), while the ROC curve in the validation queue showed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.859). This model exhibits good discriminative ability, high accuracy, and potential clinical benefits in both training and validation sets. Through this study, we provide clinicians with a new tool to more accurately predict and manage CAL risk in children with KD, which can help optimize treatment strategies and improve efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem inflammatory disease with a broad range of clinical and serologic presentations. The heterogeneity of presentation poses diagnostic challenges for the clinician, and a high index of suspicion is required. Classification systems exist for both clinical and immunologic criteria; however, they may lack sensitivity in assisting with diagnosis of atypical presentations. We present a case of an initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus consisting of nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms with clinical and immunologic findings that fluctuated with menstrual cycles. A 15-year-old Hispanic female initially presented with 2 days of epigastric abdominal pain, non-bloody and non-bilious emesis, and diarrhea. There was no fever, rash, weight loss, arthralgias, or dysuria. Menses started 1 day prior to presentation. She was persistently hypertensive throughout her admission. She developed respiratory distress with supplemental oxygen requirement due to pleural effusions identified on chest x-ray. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed large-volume ascites. Extensive evaluation was negative for malignancy and cardiac, gastrointestinal, or infectious etiologies. She demonstrated hypocomplementemia, which self-resolved without intervention. She initially had proteinuria, which resolved after menstruation. She was discharged without a specific diagnosis as her clinical status improved. She presented 2 weeks later for recurrent symptoms at the start of her next menstrual cycle with hypocomplementemia and proteinuria that persisted after menses. Elevated 24-hour urine protein led to a kidney biopsy, which showed mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis class II. The patient was formally diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. We present a case of new onset systemic lupus erythematosus with initial gastrointestinal symptoms occurring and receding concomitantly with the patient's menstrual cycle. Interpretation of the urinalysis was complicated by active menses, and both hematuria and proteinuria initially resolved at the completion of her menstrual cycle. In addition, her symptoms and hypocomplementemia resolved without intervention, making the diagnosis more challenging with insufficient clinical criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for autoimmune disorders, as symptoms may unfold over time. Although rare, systemic lupus erythematosus may initially present with gastrointestinal symptoms without other classic clinical findings. Absence of serologic criteria and spontaneous resolution of hypocomplementemia also add to the novelty of this case.",

The study was conducted to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of onychomycosis patients undertaken combined treatment with ciclopirox 8% hydroxypropyl chitosan (CPX 8% HPCH) nail lacquer and oral antifungal agents (terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole). Data were extracted and analyzed using the EHRead<sup>®</sup> technology based on natural language processing and machine learning and using SNOMED CT terminology. The mean age was 51.1 years, with 54.4% females. Repeated nail trauma was the most common risk factor (7.1%). More than half of the patients (56.6%) underwent fungal culture. Terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole were used in 67.7%, 20.8%, and 11.5% of patients, respectively. Treatment synchronicity distribution revealed that 59.1% of patients started concomitant treatment with CPX 8% HPCH and oral antifungals, 27.9% had initial oral antifungals, and 13% had initial nail lacquer. The response to treatment (positive response 15.7%, presumed positive 59.8%) was unrelated to treatment synchronicity or type of antifungal agent.

        "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is a pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with enteritis and diarrhea in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). The standard therapy at the California National Primate Research Center is oral azithromycin, a second-generation macrolide, given daily for 5 d. Oral treatment administration can be difficult with some animals. Poor oral compliance for antibiotics can result in treatment failure and potentially select for antibiotic resistance. Tulathromycin, a newer-generation macrolide, may offer an injectable alternative to azithromycin. The aim of the current study is to quantify the pharmacokinetics of tulathromycin in plasma in rhesus macaques. Six rhesus macaques were each given a single 2.5 mg/kg dose SC of tulathromycin, and serial blood samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 h, to quantify the concentration of tulathromycin in plasma over time. Results show that Cmax = 1,280 ± 395 ng/mL, Tmax = 1.25 ± 0.5 h, t1/2 = 77.2 ± 15.4 h, and AUC0-168 = 6,557.4 ± 875.4 h·ng/mL. There are no published Clinical and Laboratory Sciences Institute breakpoints for tulathromycin against C. jejuni, but based on an independently established minimum inhibitory concentration of 500 ng/mL, these data suggest that 2.5 mg/kg tulathromycin can be given subcutaneously to achieve potential therapeutic levels in rhesus macaques, possibly providing an alternative to oral azithromycin.",

Although clinically used for over 40 years, its anti-senescence and anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain unclear. Experiments confirmed that MCZ significantly reduces DSS-induced SA-β-Gal-positive cell proportion and P16/P21 expression. In animal models, MCZ ameliorated DSS-induced weight loss, bloody stools, and colonic tissue damage. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that MCZ specifically modulates microbiota composition (enriching beneficial bacteria Adlercreutzia, Lactobacillus, Ligilactobacillus, and Limosilactobacillus, while suppressing the relative abundance of Mycoplasma, Oscillibacter, and Streptococcus), and inhibits inflammatory progression by blocking the phosphorylation cascade of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Bangladesh, with high poverty rates and a large population, faces significant WASH challenges. This study examines the association between hygiene-related factors and communicable diseases in two Bangladeshi municipalities. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to July 30, 2021, in Savar and Satkhira municipalities, chosen for their diverse socioeconomic and geographic characteristics. A stratified random sampling method targeted poor, marginalised, and socially excluded populations. A total of 607 interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire, collecting data on socio-demographics, hygiene practices, and disease history. Participants were included if they were adults (aged 18 or older), had resided in the municipality for at least one year, and provided informed consent to participate. Data were analysed using SPSS, employing chi-square tests and logistic regression to assess associations between variables. The study revealed that 24.1% of participants had a communicable disease, with diarrhoea being the most common. Significant predictors of communicable diseases included gender, with females being more likely affected (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.19 to 8.66, p = 0.003), and the source of drinking water, with tube well users at higher risk (OR: 2.81, 95% CI: 1.13 to 7.02, p = 0.015). Poor hand hygiene significantly increased disease risk (OR: 12.31, 95% CI: 2.86 to 53.03, p < 0.001). Communicable diseases are prevalent in Bangladeshi municipalities, primarily driven by poor WASH conditions. Enhancing access to safe drinking water and implementing community-based WASH interventions, such as hygiene education campaigns, improved sanitation infrastructure, and school-based awareness programs, are vital for reducing the disease burden. Further research should explore the effectiveness and scalability of these targeted strategies.",

Ensitrelvir, a new antiviral targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, has reduced viral replication and disease severity. This meta-analysis and systematic review assessed Ensitrelvir's efficacy and safety in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Embase, and CENTRAL up to July 2024 to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Ensitrelvir to placebo in adults with mild to moderate, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Outcomes were assessed at standardized time points, with viral RNA measured at day 4. Mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) for binary outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model. Efficacy outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, while safety outcomes included HDL, triglycerides, bilirubin, AST, headache, diarrhea, TEAEs, TRAEs, serious TEAEs, and treatment discontinuation. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (ROB2) tool. The analysis included six RCTs with 2,793 participants: 1,860 received Ensitrelvir and 933 were given a placebo. Ensitrelvir gave significant results for reduced viral RNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 [MD: - 1.35; 95% CI - 1.58 to - 1.13; p < 0.01] and the incidence of lower cholesterol levels [RR: 8.83; 95% CI 4.05 to 19.27; p < 0.01] compared to the placebo group. However, it was associated with increased risks of decreased HDL levels, elevated triglycerides, increased bilirubin, more headaches, and a higher overall occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Ensitrelvir effectively reduces viral load in COVID-19 patients, but its safety profile raises concerns due to significant adverse effects. The benefits must be carefully weighed against the risks, and further research is needed to confirm its role in treatment and to find ways to mitigate these adverse effects.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) has become a significant pathogenic virus in the swine industry, causing huge economic losses globally. However, the impact of PCV2 on the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg) remains unclear. In this study, we noticed that PCV2-infected piglets exhibited several clinical symptoms, including slow weight gain, diarrhea, and lethargy. In addition, we observed significant changes in the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17A during the early stages of infection, while the inhibitory cytokine IL-10 exhibited a significant increase in the later stages. Furthermore, the overall count of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells was significantly reduced, and the Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg immune balance was disrupted, with a shift towards Treg cells. What is more, we revealed that TGF-β, a cytokine that induces Treg cell differentiation, was highly expressed after PCV2 infection. This cytokine recruited and phosphorylated Smad3, which subsequently translocated into the nucleus to facilitate Foxp3 transcription. Besides, we also investigated the association between the changes in the intestinal microbiota caused by PCV2 infection and the immune balance of T cells. Overall, our findings enriched the mechanism of PCV2 promoting Treg cell differentiation and provided valuable insights for the prevention and treatment of immunosuppressive diseases. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection can cause immunosuppression-related diseases in pigs. Currently, it is still recognized as an important infectious pathogen of the swine industry in the world. In this study, we discovered that PCV2 infection disrupted the Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg immune equilibrium, and the differentiation capacity of Treg cells increased significantly. Briefly, PCV2 infection promoted the secretion of cytokine TGF-β, recruited Smad3, and phosphorylated it. Subsequently, the phosphorylated Smad3 transmitted the signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus and bound to the enhancer of Foxp3, thereby enhancing the transcription level of Foxp3 and facilitating the differentiation of Treg cells. This study enriches the pathogenic mechanism of PCV2 persistent infection and provided a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of immunosuppressive diseases.",

TS-1 for 1 year (8 courses) is highly recommended. We investigated the efficacy and safety of an adjuvant 3-weekly TS-1 regimen for AGC. We analyzed 93 patients with stage II/III AGC who started 3-weekly adjuvant TS-1 therapy between Feb 2017 and May 2022 post-gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. The 3-weekly regimen was TS-1 at 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest for 1 year (16 courses). Among 93 patients, 12 (13%) had disease recurrence during follow-up (median 24.6 months, range 4.2%-63.3%). Seven (9.5%) with stage II (n = 73) and five (25%) with stage III (n = 20) experienced recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated that Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS) rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 92.0% (95% CI; 86.5%-97.9%), 84.7% (95% CI; 76.4%-93.9%), and 78.6% (95% CI; 65.8%-94.0%), respectively. Eighty patients (86%) completed the treatment; 25 (26.9%) needed dose reduction. Adverse events, mostly grade 1 or 2 diarrhea (28%) and nausea (20%), were manageable. Our study revealed that the 3-weekly TS-1 regimen as adjuvant therapy exhibited good efficacy and manageable toxicity. This regimen as an adjuvant therapy for AGC should be evaluated in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Newborns with low-birth-weight may lag behind those with normal-birth-weight in terms of growth, development, and nutritional status, which increases mothers' concerns about the child's future health and leads to anxiety and depression. Providing nutritional support to newborns with low-birth-weight to facilitate optimal growth and development may help alleviate maternal anxiety and depression. To explore the effects of nutritional support timing on the growth and development of newborns born under 2 kg and their mothers' anxiety and depression. A total of 64 newborns born under 2 kg and their mothers who received treatment at the neonatology department of Suzhou Ninth Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2023 to October 2024 were selected and retrospectively evaluated. Newborns were then divided into the following two groups according to the start time of enteral nutrition support: Group S (32 cases, receiving enteral nutrition support within 24 hour of birth) and Group L (32 cases, receiving enteral nutrition support after 24 hour of birth). Thereafter, we compared the baseline data, as well as the milk intake and total bilirubin (TBIL) values, between the two groups at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after nutritional support. We also compared the occurrence of adverse digestive reactions (vomiting, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and residual symptoms), complications (neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and infection), growth and development indicators (weight, length, and head circumference) before and after nutritional support between the two groups of patients, as well as their mother's anxiety [evaluated using the Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)] and depression [evaluated using the Self Rating Depression Scale (SDS)]. No significant difference in baseline data was observed between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Milk intake and TBIL levels in Group S were significantly better than those in Group L at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after nutritional support (<i>P</i> < 0.05). No significant differences in vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation, diarrhea, and residual adverse reactions were observed between the two groups during nutritional support (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Group S had a significantly reduce of fewer complications (<i>i.e.</i>, neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and infection) than did Group L during nutritional support (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Before nutritional support, no significant differences in developmental indicators (weight, length, and head circumference) were noted between the two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). However, after nutritional support, the weight, length, and head circumference of both groups were higher than those before intervention, with Group S having significantly higher values than did Group L (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Mothers of children who received nutritional support had decreased SAS and SDS scores, with Group S mothers having significantly lower scores than did Group L mothers (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Enteral nutrition support had significant effects on newborns weighing < 2 kg within 24 hours of birth. In particular, it promoted the maturation of gastrointestinal function, enhanced nutrient absorption, promoted optimal short-term growth and development, and alleviated the mother's anxiety and depression.",

This retrospective study evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and patient outcomes associated with active CRE surveillance in the hematology department. The study identified 23,832 hematological patients between 2019 and 2021. Propensity score matching was used to align underlying diseases and admission times in a 1:1:1 ratio across three groups: detected CRE, undetected CRE, and non-active CRE surveillance. The positivity rate of active CRE surveillance was 2.1% (141/6,735), with an incidence of 4.8% (85/1,789) among patients who underwent active CRE surveillance. The distribution of the 141 isolates was as follows: <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (66.7%), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (22.6%), and others (10.7%). Independent risk factors associated with a positive result for active CRE surveillance included hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, hospital length of stay (LOS) ≥ 18 days, use of central venous catheters, steroid treatment within the past 3 months, antibiotic exposure (ß-lactam/ß-lactamase inhibitor, Echinocandins) within the last month, perianal skin ulceration within the previous 3 days, albumin < 33.4 g/L, and neutropenia lasting ≥ 7 days. In the detected CRE group, 26.5% of patients developed a CRE infection. Cox regression analysis identified diarrhea within 3 days prior to active CRE surveillance and interleukin-6 levels ≥ 39.35 pg./mL within 24 h of CRE surveillance as independent predictors of 90-day mortality. <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> were the predominant pathogens identified in active CRE surveillance. The incidence of CRE infection was notably higher in the detected CRE group. Our study provides real-world evidence on the role of active CRE surveillance in survival outcomes, especially in regions like China, where CRE infections are highly prevalent. The findings suggest that active CRE surveillance could serve as an early indicator of 90-day mortality in hematology patients and should be considered for routine implementation in this population.",

        "abstract": "Acute gastroenteritis is a leading global health concern among children, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in treatment, effective management remains a challenge. Probiotics aim to restore gut homeostasis by correcting intestinal dysbiosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea in children with acute gastroenteritis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across four major databases using the keywords \"acute diarrhea,\" \"pediatric,\" and \"probiotics,\" among others. Only double-arm randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, focusing on the efficacy of probiotics in treating pediatric acute diarrhea. Data analysis was performed using Stata 16.0, with a random-effects model applied to account for study variability. Out of 1470 studies screened, 25 RCTs involving 5170 patients (2552 in the probiotic group and 2618 in the placebo group) met the inclusion criteria. Probiotics significantly reduced the overall duration of diarrhea (mean difference [MD]: -7.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -14.60 to -0.91; p = 0.03). Diarrhea frequency was notably reduced on Day 2 (MD: -1.03; 95% CI: -2.06 to 0.00; p = 0.05) and Day 5 (MD: -0.51; 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.18; p = 0.002). Probiotics also significantly reduced the duration of vomiting (MD: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.28 to -0.09; p < 0.01), with a nonsignificant trend in fever reduction. This meta-analysis demonstrates the clinical efficacy of probiotics in reducing the duration of diarrhea and vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis. Future trials are recommended to further explore the role of specific probiotic strains and combinations to enhance treatment outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gluten intake in foods and cereals. Weight loss, persistent diarrhea, and starvation are all possible outcomes. A lack of awareness about CD and malnutrition among medical students and healthcare professionals can result in inadequate nutritional guidance and delayed diagnoses, ultimately compromising patient outcomes and treatment adherence. Greater education and training programs for medical students can help alleviate these concerns and enhance patient outcomes. This study aims to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding nutritional deficiencies related to celiac disease among medical students and healthcare providers in Egypt. The secondary outcome is to identify knowledge gaps and potential barriers to effective implementation. This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. The targeted population included students enrolled in any Egyptian medical institution during the academic year 2024-2025, as well as healthcare providers. The questionnaire included sections on demographic information, knowledge about celiac disease and nutritional deficiencies, and attitudes towards nutritional management of celiac disease. Using a convenient sampling method, it was distributed electronically in the English language. A total of 1233 people participated in the study. The median knowledge of celiac disease was 13, indicating that only 11% of individuals had adequate understanding of the condition (8-19). The median knowledge of women and those who lived in cities was higher (p = 0.003 and ←0.001, respectively). Physicians in internal medicine had a greater median level of expertise than pediatricians, indicating a significant difference in specialty among healthcare practitioners (p = 0.01). Only 11.9% of participants demonstrated sufficient understanding of the nutritional inadequacies linked to a gluten-free diet. The median knowledge of women and non-Egyptian individuals was higher (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Different governorate regions had significantly different knowledge medians (p = 0.002), with Delta governorates having a higher median than Greater Cairo (p = 0.004).

This study evaluated the impact of routine MVM use on AURI prevalence and symptom severity in a community-based Chinese cohort. This retrospective study was conducted among community-based populations across China (n=3,415). Using a structured questionnaire, participants self-reported epi-sodes of AURIs over three months. Based on regular use of MVM for at least 3 months, eligible participants were categorized into the MVM group and the control group. The impact of MVM on the frequency and severity of AURIs was assessed. Rigorous methodological approaches were applied to minimize potential biases. The period prevalence of AURIs was significantly lower in the MVM group (29.9%) compared to controls (45.6%), odds ratio (OR) =0.508 (p<0.001). After propensity score matching, demographic and lifestyle factors were comparable between groups. The period prevalence of AURIs was 31.7% and 44.8% in the MVM and control groups (OR=0.572, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated the protective effect of MVM supplementation was particularly significant among participants aged ≥45 years (OR=0.407, p<0.001).

        "abstract": "Eimeria primarily infects the intestinal epithelial cells of livestock and poultry, disrupting gut microbiota and metabolism, which can result in diarrhea and weight loss. In severe cases, it can lead to hematochezia and even mortality. Modern intensive and large-scale farming practices, combined with the fecal-oral transmission of coccidia, create environments conducive to coccidial infections. Chemical control methods may lead to drug residues, drug resistance, toxic side effects, and other related issues. In contrast, Chinese herbal medicines typically exhibit multi-target, multi-pathway, and synergistic properties in disease resistance. In this study, the McMaster counting method was employed to assess the anti-coccidial effects of Houttuynia cordata (H. cordata) in its untreated forms (raw, water extract, and alcohol extract). The impact of these treatments on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites of lambs was examined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology and non-targeted metabolomics. The findings indicated that H. cordata reduced the excretion of intestinal coccidian oocysts in lambs. Notably, the alcohol extract of H. cordata (HA) significantly enhanced the average daily weight gain (ADG) and increased the abundance of unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Christensenellaceae R_7 group, and UCG_005. Additionally, metabolites such as 6-Deoxyerythronolide B, Parthenolide, and Bacilysin were highlighted for their potential significance. Overall, HA demonstrated superior anticoccidial effects and improved weight gain, likely due to the enhancement of beneficial microbiota and metabolites. This study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which Chinese herbal medicine combats coccidiosis through the modulation of intestinal microbiota and metabolism.",

The study population comprised 49 calves (42 with diarrhea and 7 healthy controls). Blood samples were collected from the diarrheic calves on the 7th and 10th days following diagnosis. Treatment was initiated after the first round of blood sampling. In within-group comparisons, the initial measurements revealed significantly elevated levels of endocan and PCT in the E. coli group compared to the measurements taken on the 7th and 10th days. In between-group comparisons, significant differences were observed between the E. coli and control, rotavirus and control, and C. parvum and control groups. The infected groups exhibited markedly higher levels of endocan on days 1, 7, and 10, and elevated IL-6 levels on day 1. Additionally, E-selectin levels were significantly elevated in the infected groups on day 1, with statistically significant differences noted between the E. coli and control groups, as well as the C. parvum and control groups. PCT level was higher in the infected groups on day 1, but there was a significant difference between E. coli and Control, Rotavirus and Control groups. In conclusion, inflammation and endothelial damage were determined in calves infected with E. coli, Rotavirus, and C. parvum. There was also a positive correlation between inflammation and endothelial damage. According to the data obtained, it was concluded that endocan and E-selectin may be useful biomarkers in determining endothelial damage in calves with diarrhea.",

Patients aged ≥65 years with previously untreated CLL/SLL without del(17p) were randomly assigned to receive either single-agent ibrutinib (420 mg/day; n = 136) or chlorambucil (0.5-0.8 mg/kg ≤12 cycles; n = 133) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. With a median follow-up of 9.6 in the ibrutinib arm, median PFS was 8.9 years (95% CI, 7.0-NE) versus 1.3 years (95% CI, 0.9-1.6) for the chlorambucil arm. Among patients with unmutated IGHV, del(11q), mutated TP53, or complex karyotype median PFS was 8.4 years (95% CI, 6.8-NE) with ibrutinib and 0.7 years (95% CI, 0.4-1.2) with chlorambucil.

At study completion, 27% of patients remained on first-line ibrutinib treatment. With the longest follow-up to date from a phase 3 study of any targeted CLL/SLL therapy, this landmark RESONATE-2 study defines median PFS and demonstrates continued OS benefit of first-line ibrutinib treatment for patients with CLL/SLL, including those with high-risk genomic features.

        "abstract": "Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) is a severe disease that occurs weeks to months after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, often occurring in children (MISC). Symptoms include high fever, rash, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Children with MISC can develop cardiovascular injury including ventricular failure, coronary artery aneurysms, or shock. Current treatment strategies for these postacute sequelae of COVID-19 primarily target the hyperinflammatory response. However, a potential role for viral spike protein translocated via zonulin-mediated trafficking from gastrointestinal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 into the circulation has been suggested. Here, we report results from a phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial testing the zonulin antagonist larazotide in 12 children with MISC with a median age of 5.7 years. Children were enrolled during hospitalization for acute MISC and were treated with adjuvant larazotide therapy four times daily for 3 weeks. Patients were monitored for 24 weeks for safety follow-up. No larazotide-related adverse events were reported. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen in blood samples correlated with inflammatory markers, including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (<i>P</i> = 0.004) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and with gastrointestinal symptoms as assessed by the PedsQL GI symptom score (<i>P</i> = 0.003). Children treated with larazotide displayed faster resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, faster clearance of spike antigen, and a faster return to usual activities. Our findings suggest that larazotide treatment may be safe in children and may improve resolution of symptoms when used as an adjuvant therapy for MISC.",

        "abstract": "Diarrheal pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium, impose a heavy burden of disease in resource-limited regions. Cryptosporidiosis often causes chronic infection in immunocompromised people and gastrointestinal injury in malnourished children, leading to wasting, stunting, and cognitive impairment. Current treatment for cryptosporidiosis fails in these vulnerable populations, highlighting the need for new medicines. Here we describe the anti-Cryptosporidium efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of a bumped kinase inhibitor BKI-1708. BKI-1708 inhibits the essential molecular target, calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1), which is highly expressed in the major proliferative stages of the parasite life cycle. Efficacy was demonstrated in the Cryptosporidium parvum IFNγ-KO mouse infection and calf diarrhea models. Dose response in the mouse model demonstrated oral doses as low as 15 mg/kg administered daily for 3 days completely suppressed oocyst shedding. Metabolite profiling in pre-clinical species and human hepatocytes identified an active metabolite, M2, which retains sub-micromolar activity against C. parvum. Pharmacokinetic analysis of BKI-1708 and M2 in mice demonstrates good systemic exposure, important for treating biliary and upper respiratory infections in some cases of cryptosporidiosis. In mice, M2 reaches 7-fold and >3-fold higher levels over BKI-1708 in plasma and the gastrointestinal tract, respectively. Oral administration of M2 completely suppressed oocyst shedding in the mouse model at doses as low as 8 mg/kg for 3 days. Wide safety margins are demonstrated in mice, rats, and dogs. BKI-1708 has characteristics of a safe and effective drug for treating Cryptosporidium infections in animal models and shows promise for use in humans. Moreover, BKI-1708 and M2 formed in vivo, offer an attractive prospect of a dually active preclinical candidate for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.",

        "abstract": "Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS), a frequent postoperative complication of rectal resection, has been shown to significantly impact patients' quality of life. Electroacupuncture (EA), a non-pharmaceutical treatment, ameliorates gastrointestinal symptoms and promotes bowel movement. However, high-quality clinical evidence is lacking. This study aimed to determine whether EA can improve LARS symptoms compared with sham electroacupuncture (SA). This multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial will be carried out across the outpatient clinics of three tertiary medical centers in China. A total of 136 patients with LARS who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated, in equal proportions (1:1), to either the EA or SA group. Each patient will undergo treatment three times weekly during the first four weeks and twice-weekly sessions over the subsequent four weeks. After the intervention, a 24-week follow-up period will be conducted. The primary outcome is the change in the LARS score from baseline to the end of week 8. Secondary outcomes include changes in the LARS score at other time points, response rate of patients showing reduced defecation dysfunction, subjective distress related to intestinal symptoms, Wexner Diarrhea score, Bristol Bowel Diary, EORTC-QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Questionnaire, and Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale. This study will provide evidence of EA from multiple perspectives, investigate its potential application in LARS after rectal cancer surgery, and guide the development of therapy tailored to meet specific individual health needs. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (No. 2024BZYLL0402).

Among enrolled patients, 95 (71.9%) were females, the mean age was 48.8 ± 13.5 years, and the mean PAI duration was 14.9 ± 11.8 years. The most frequent cause of PAI was autoimmune adrenalitis (92.4%), mainly associated with other autoimmune comorbidities. The 65.9% of patients experienced at least one AC, with an incidence of 10.5/100 patient-years. A significant number of AC (116/206) occurred in patients already undergoing glucocorticoid therapy. The most frequent features of AC were fatigue (96%), gastrointestinal symptoms (85%), and hyponatremia (77%). The most frequent triggers were vomiting and/or diarrhoea (65%), infections (38%), and emotional stress (29%). Patients with more autoimmune comorbidities and those with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) were at higher risk of AC (p < 0.02). AC is still a frequent complication of patients with PAI, particularly in those with additional autoimmune comorbidities or with POI.

        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea, caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is one of the most devastating diseases in the global pig industry due to its high mortality rate in piglets. The host factors required for PEDV replication, including receptors, remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a porcine membrane-protein-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (PigMpCKO) library and performed two rounds of PEDV infection. Ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), the known receptor of dengue virus, was found to be a potent host factor. Moreover, our research revealed that RPSA is involved in the replication stage of PEDV and not in the entry stage. Inhibitor and activator experiments demonstrated that knockout (KO) of RPSA downregulates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to impair PEDV infection. Additionally, RNA sequencing data indicated that cellular lipid biosynthesis and lipid transport processes were significantly inhibited in the absence of RPSA during PEDV infection. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, resulting from RPSA KO, was partially mediated by the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to impaired lipid accumulation during PEDV replication. Interestingly, RPSA KO also significantly downregulated the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN) and inhibited infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), both of which belong to the swine enteric coronavirus group. In summary, our results establish RPSA as a novel host factor that is critical for coronavirus replication. This provides new insights into the mechanisms of virus-host interactions and paves the way for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. Swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs) cause severe economic losses to the global swine industry and pose a potential threat to public health. Identification of receptors required for PEDV infection could develop novel targets for drug therapy and disease-resistant breeding. We conducted a CRISPR/Cas9 screen targeting membrane proteins in porcine kidney cells infected with PEDV to identify possible receptors and discovered numerous novel candidate host factors. Considering RPSA's known role as a receptor for multiple viruses, we focused on investigating its potential in coronavirus infection. Our results revealed that RPSA does not contribute to the entry stage but to the replication stage of coronavirus infection. We first reported the role that RPSA plays in the regulation of APN expression and lipid metabolism. RPSA is essential for PEDV and other SeCoVs replication, providing a novel insight into the search for the receptor of PEDV and identifying potential therapeutic targets for coronaviruses.",

However, the long-term outcomes of EUS-CE remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of EUS-CE, focusing on long-term outcomes. This retrospective cohort study consecutively included patients who underwent EUS-CE for the palliative treatment of MSBO between July 2022 and December 2023 at a tertiary care hospital in China. The longest follow-up period was 362 days. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and symptom recurrence-free survival (SRFS) period. Secondary outcomes included technique success, clinical success, and adverse events (AEs). A total of 15 patients underwent EUS-CE for MSBO. Technical success was 100%, and clinical success was 93.3%. AEs occurred in 4 (26.7%) patients: one leak, one bleed, and two cases of diarrhea. The median OS period was 65 days, with a 60.0% rate of 60 days survival. The median SRFS period was 165 days, with a 41.7% rate of symptom recurrence at 60 days. All patients survived 30 days, and no symptom recurrence was observed within 30 days. A prolonged OS period was observed in patients without peritoneal carcinomatosis and those who received additional chemoradiotherapy.

However, the active components and in vivo metabolism of the Coptidis Rhizoma-Aucklandiae Radix herb pair (CR-AR) in the treatment of AAD remain unclear. This study aimed to (1) investigate the prototype components, metabolites, and potential metabolic pathways of CR-AR in AAD mice and (2) compare the concentration of six active components between healthy and AAD mice. AAD model mice received oral administration of the CR-AR extract. UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-HRMS was used to analyze the prototype components and metabolites in serum, feces, and intestines of AAD mice. A prototype components-targets-pathways-AAD network was developed using network pharmacology to identify active components and effective targets of CR-AR in treating AAD, based on prototypes detected in serum, fecal, and intestinal samples. Additionally, a comparative analysis of the concentration of six active components was conducted between healthy and AAD mice using UPLC-QqQ-MS. A total of 45 components were identified in the extract of CR-AR. Among them, 16 prototype compounds and 47 metabolites were identified, and potential metabolic pathways (including hydroxylation, demethylation, reduction, hydrolysis, hydrogenation, and glucuronidation) were proposed. Based on the 16 prototype components, six potentially active components (berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine, columbamine, epiberberine, and dehydrocostus lactone) were screened from the prototype components-targets-pathways-AAD disease network. Targeted quantitative analysis showed that alkaloid-based active components were significantly more concentrated in the intestines of AAD mice than in healthy mice after 6 h (p < 0.05).",

Clinical manifestations such as altered bowel habits (e.g., constipation, diarrhea, or pencil-thin stools), rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain or bloating may indicate CRC. A hallmark of CRC is metabolic reprogramming, which enables tumor cells to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of rapid proliferation and survival. This reprogramming encompasses dysregulated glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism, collectively driving tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and therapeutic resistance. Targeting metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a promising strategy in CRC therapy. Inhibitors of key metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways involved in glycolysis have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical and early clinical studies. Additionally, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has attracted increasing interest for its potential to modulate tumor metabolism. This review examines current evidence on marketed drugs, TCM, and the underlying metabolic mechanisms implicated in CRC treatment. While TCM shows promise as a complementary therapeutic approach, further research is essential to validate its clinical utility and mechanistic underpinnings.",

        "abstract": "This study assessed the cost-effectiveness (CE) of a specialised formula versus standard oral nutritional supplements (ONS) for the dietary management of paediatric mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease (CD), from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. We developed a Markov model with five health states (remission, mild-to-moderate, moderate-to-severe, surgery and death), using 8-week cycles and a one-year horizon. A systematic literature review identified treatment effectiveness (clinical remission rates) and health state utilities (Child Health Utility-9 Dimension). Costs were sourced from the British National Formulary and National Tariff Payment System (2024 prices) and included costs of intervention and healthcare resources such as primary and outpatient care, diagnostic tests, accident and emergency care and hospitalisations. Clinical experts validated the model structure and inputs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) assessed the robustness of findings. The base case results demonstrated that specialised formula saves £591 per patient annually while maintaining similar quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared to standard ONS. Additionally, in a cohort of 1,000 patients, 552 would achieve remission with the specialised formula compared to 496 with standard ONS. DSA identified the 8-week intervention costs and utility scores as key drivers of CE. PSA indicated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY, specialised formula has a 78% likelihood of being CE compared with standard ONS. The main limitation is the lack of published clinical trials comparing specialised formula with standard ONS, along with the overall scarcity of published data on standard ONS. Meta-analysis would be beneficial to validate and strengthen the comparative data; however, due to the limitations of the published data, meta-analysis is not possible at present. Specialised formula is a less costly and more effective treatment compared to standard ONS in mild-to-moderate paediatric CD patients over one year.",

        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a highly contagious enteric disease caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, leading to high mortality in newborn piglets and significant economic losses in the swine industry. The shortage of effective PED vaccines emphasizes the need to explore potent natural compounds for therapeutic intervention. It has been shown that glycerol monolaurate (GML) effectively inhibits PEDV replication in vivo and in vitro. Further investigation is needed to assess whether complex medium-chain triglycerides (CMCTs), composed of glyceryl tricaprylate/caprate (GTCC) and GML, offer an efficient anti-PEDV activity. In this study, piglets were orally infected with PEDV and exhibited typical clinical signs, including diarrhea and vomiting, accompanied by intestinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue damage. CMCTs were administered orally twice daily for one week. In vivo findings indicate that CMCT treatment alleviated clinical signs and prevented weight loss. It significantly increased serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA) and intestinal mucosal sIgA and MUC-2 levels, while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17) and increasing antiviral interferons (IFN-α and IFN-γ), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and IL-22. Antioxidant enzyme activities (T-AOC, SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT) were elevated, whereas oxidative stress markers (iNOS, NO, and MDA) were decreased. Expression of intestinal tight junction proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 was restored. Moreover, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations increased, and the functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) were restored. Gut microbiota analysis showed increased beneficial genera (<i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Ligilactobacillus</i>) and decreased pathogenic <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. These results demonstrate that CMCTs mitigate PEDV infection by enhancing anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and intestinal barrier function, as well as modulating gut microbiota composition. This study improves the understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV and highlights CMCTs as a promising therapeutic candidate for PED.",

In this study, it was demonstrated that ethanol eluates with 20% (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) and 60% (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) ethanol exhibited activity against PEDV. Phytochemical characterization revealed 66 distinct compounds, including 36 flavonoids and 13 organic acids identified as possible antiviral constituents. Among these, taxifolin-7-O-rhamnoside and quercetin-7-rhamnoside were identified as the most potent anti-PEDV components. Notably, neither compound exhibited significant antiviral efficacy as monotherapy. However, co-administration produced a reduction in PEDV-G2 titers. This study mechanistically links taxifolin-7-O-rhamnoside and quercetin-7-rhamnoside as core anti-PEDV phytochemicals in HJT extract. These findings support the further development of HJT as a potential therapeutic for PED.",

        "title": "Challenges in the Investigation of Therapeutic Equivalence of Locally Applied/Locally Acting Drugs in the Gastrointestinal Tract: The Rifaximin Case.",
        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Locally acting gastrointestinal (GI) drugs present challenges for generic drug development because traditional bioequivalence measures, which rely on systemic drug levels, do not reflect local efficacy. This review examines regulatory guidelines for establishing therapeutic equivalence for such drugs, using rifaximin-a minimally absorbed, gut-localized antibiotic-as a case study. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed bioequivalence guidelines from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), along with the literature on rifaximin's biopharmaceutical and clinical properties, to identify strategies and challenges for establishing equivalence for locally acting GI drugs. <b>Results:</b> Rifaximin exemplifies the limitations of standard bioequivalence methods: as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class IV drug with minimal absorption and low solubility, in vitro dissolution may not predict local drug availability. Clinical endpoint trials (e.g., traveler's diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, IBS-D) are resource-intensive and insensitive to formulation differences. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in healthy volunteers show low, variable plasma levels, which may inaccurately discriminate between formulations. The EMA requires evidence of non-saturable absorption to accept PK data, a difficult-to-establish but potentially irrelevant criterion. Differences between FDA and EMA approaches highlight a lack of harmonization, complicating global generic development. <b>Conclusions:</b> A tailored, multifaceted approach is needed to demonstrate bioequivalence for GI-localized drugs like rifaximin. This case underscores the need for more sensitive surrogate methods (e.g. advanced in vitro or pharmacodynamic models) and flexible regulatory criteria. Harmonization across international guidelines and innovative bioequivalence study designs are key to facilitating the approval of safe and effective generic alternatives in this drug class.",

The re-emergence of the disease, in recent years, is mainly due to the ban of the usage of antibiotics as growth promoters in the EU. The aim of this study was to establish a reliable, robust challenge model. Ross hybrid broilers were divided into randomized groups: a positive and a negative control group, a group receiving antibiotic treatment and three groups fed with assorted feed supplements, all receiving the same basal diet. The birds in the treatment groups were vaccinated twice using a 10-times dose of an Infectious Bursitis live vaccine and the animals were challenged four times with a NetB toxin producing <i>C. perfringens</i> strain. The presence of clinical signs and body weight gain were monitored. At the end of the study necropsy was performed and the gut lesions were scored. During the experiment, clinical signs were absent in the negative control group and in the antibiotic treated group. The other animals displayed diarrhea and feather loss. These symptoms were the most pronounced in the positive control group. The gut lesion scores showed significant differences between the negative and positive control groups, with the former scoring the lowest. Based on these results, the challenge model establishment was successful and in this setup the assessment of the potency of feed additives is also possible.",

        "abstract": "<i>Clostridioides difficile</i> is a leading pathogen involved in healthcare-associated diarrhea. With its increasing incidence, mortality, and antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to address the infection and prevent its recurrence. Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD) is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of diarrhea, but its main active ingredient is not known. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the biological activity of berberine (BER) and baicalein (BAI), key components of GQD, against <i>C. difficile</i>. Time-kill curves and scanning electron microscopy were employed to assess their effects on <i>C. difficile</i> growth, while Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbnent Assay (ELISA) and cytotoxicity assays were used to examine their impact on toxin production. We also employed Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to examine how BER and BAI influenced the expression of toxin-associated genes. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, these compounds exerted antibacterial activity against <i>C. difficile</i> by disrupting the integrity of the cell membrane and cell wall. Furthermore, BER and BAI also suppressed toxin production, demonstrating effects comparable to those of vancomycin. This suppression likely resulted from their bactericidal activity and the inhibition of toxin gene expression. This study not only highlights the potential application of GQD in treating <i>C. difficile</i> infections but also offers promising options for developing drugs targeting the growth and virulence of this pathogen. <i>C. difficile</i> infection (CDI) is a leading cause of severe diarrhea, and its treatment remains challenging due to limited drug options and its high recurrence rate. BAI and BER, the main active components of the traditional Chinese medicinal formula GQD, inhibited the growth of <i>C. difficile</i> by disrupting its cellular structure and significantly reduced the production of toxins associated with disease severity. Furthermore, the effects of BAI and BER on <i>C. difficile</i> were comparable to those of conventional antibiotics, suggesting that these compounds could be potential alternative therapies for CDI. This study not only highlights the therapeutic potential of GQD in treating CDI but also provides a replicable research strategy for the development of novel anti-CDI agents.",

        "abstract": "Cancer remains a major global health burden driven by complex biological mechanisms, and while targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized treatment, their efficacy and safety are significantly influenced by drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Tyrosine-kinase receptors (RTKs) regulate critical cellular processes, and their dysregulation through mutations or overexpression drives oncogenesis, with TKIs designed to inhibit these aberrant signaling pathways by targeting RTK phosphorylation. Pharmacokinetic DDIs can critically impact the efficacy and safety of TKIs such as erlotinib, gefitinib, and pazopanib by affecting their absorption, distribution, and metabolism. The modification of pH can influence drug absorption; furthermore, the inhibition or induction of metabolizing enzymes may affect biotransformation, while distribution can be altered through the modulation of transmembrane transporters. Additionally, ensuring quality of life during TKI treatment requires vigilant monitoring and management of adverse events, which range from mild (e.g., rash, diarrhea, fatigue) to severe (e.g., hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity). Drug-specific toxicities, such as hyperlipidemia with lorlatinib or visual disturbances with crizotinib, must be assessed using specific criteria, with dose adjustments and supportive care tailored to individual patient responses. Thus, optimal TKI therapy relies on managing drug interactions through multidisciplinary care, monitoring, and patient education to ensure safety and treatment efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Waterborne gastrointestinal infections remain a global health concern, with approximately 1.7 billion diarrhea-related illnesses annually attributable to protozoan parasites. These pathogens are transmitted through contaminated water and exhibit high resistance to chlorination, posing substantial challenges to effective water treatment. This study focused on the most prevalent intestinal parasites in the Los Ríos Region of Chile: <i>Blastocystis</i> sp., <i>Giardia duodenalis</i>, and <i>Entamoeba coli</i>. The objectives were to assess the prevalence of eukaryotic parasites in water samples-covering both drinking and recreational sources-to describe the circulating subtypes of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. and to identify ecological factors associated with parasite presence. Water samples were analyzed using conventional PCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was employed for <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. subtype identification, and the environmental predictors were evaluated using a multivariable logistic regression model. A total of 132 water samples were analyzed, of which 15.2% were positive for <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. and 1.5% for <i>E. coli</i>, while no samples tested positive for <i>G. duodenalis</i>. We identified subtypes ST1-ST4 of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp., along with ST7, ST10, ST14, ST21, and ST23-ST26, the latter being reported for the first time in Chile. Ecological factors significantly associated with <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. presence included higher water temperature and greater rainfall at positive sites. Potable water was associated with significantly lower odds of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. infection (aOR = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00-0.87; <i>p</i> = 0.041), while precipitation increased infection odds by 3% per additional millimeter (aOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.06; <i>p</i> = 0.036). Greater distance to the nearest farmhouse was also significantly associated with reduced infection risk, suggesting that proximity to livestock environments may influence <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. transmission. These findings help explain the high prevalence of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. observed in humans in the Los Ríos Region and highlight the pivotal role of ecological conditions in driving waterborne transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first environmental study in Chile to clearly demonstrate the association between human infection, environmental factors, and the transmission dynamics of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder with diverse subtypes. Recent evidence has suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and IBS; however, the associations between vitamin D levels, IBS subtypes, and hematological-biochemical parameters remain unclear. The aim of this research was to investigate the associations between vitamin D status, IBS subtypes, and sex, along with their relationships with biochemical and hematological parameters. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This retrospective study included 240 patients diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome IV criteria at Van Yüzüncü Yıl University Medical Faculty Hospital. The patients were classified as diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), constipation-predominant (IBS-C), or mixed-type (IBS-M). The patients' serum vitamin D levels and hematological (hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts, and mean corpuscular volume) and biochemical (ferritin, iron, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B12 levels) parameters were evaluated at baseline and after vitamin D supplementation. Sex-related differences were assessed. <i>Results:</i> Baseline vitamin D levels were low in all IBS subtypes, with no significant differences between the groups. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in a significant increase in serum vitamin D levels across all subtypes (<i>p</i> = 0.001). No significant correlations were identified between vitamin D levels and hematological or biochemical parameters. Sex differences in vitamin D levels were only significant in the IBS-M group, both at baseline and post-treatment (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among all IBS subtypes and significantly improves with supplementation, independently of the subtype. Although no associations were found between vitamin D levels and laboratory parameters, the observed sex differences in patients with IBS-M highlight the need for further research into potential sex-related pathophysiological mechanisms. These findings support the integration of routine vitamin D assessment and supplementation into the clinical management of IBS, especially in patients with the IBS-M subtype and female sex, to potentially improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Rifaximin (RFX) has recently been suggested as an alternative treatment option for Clostridioides difficile infection. This study reports the survey on RFX susceptibility within a C. difficile test cohort that represents the five clinically relevant phylogenetic clades. Agar dilution assays were conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of RFX for 129 clinical C. difficile isolates from Germany (86), Indonesia (29), and Ghana (14). Genome sequence data were obtained for 50 representative isolates, including all those with a minimum inhibitory concentration MIC[RFX] of ≥ 32.0 µg/mL, to identify the underlying rpoB gene resistance alleles, determine the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types (STs), and infer phylogenetic relatedness. 10.1% of the isolates were found to be resistant to RFX. The resistance rate varies by region, with 4.7% in Germany, 27.6% in Indonesia, and 7.1% in Ghana. Three distinct rpoB alleles were associated with RFX resistance. The presence of a specific rpoB allele correlates with the MLST-based ST of the isolate, indicating that the rifaximin-resistant isolates belong to phylogenetic clades 1, 2, and 4. These isolates are represented by six different ribotypes: 010, 017, 027, 046, 084, and 131. Furthermore, we identified seven amino acid substitutions resulting from SNPs in the rpoB gene through alignment analysis. These substitutions are found in both RFX-resistant and susceptible isolates, suggesting that they are neutral mutations in relation to RFX susceptibility. These observations also indicate that RFX resistance arose independently in different clades. A substantial rate of RFX resistance, particularly among Indonesian isolates, was observed. This may be attributed to the prolonged use of rifampicin, especially in the treatment of tuberculosis. RFX resistance has been linked to specific amino acid substitutions in the β-subunit of RNA polymerase encoded by the rpoB gene. To the best of our knowledge, one of the identified RFX resistance-associated rpoB alleles (H502N, R505K, I750M) has not been previously described, whereupon, the amino acid substitutions I750M as well as I750V, E1037Q, A1205V, N1207A, A1208T, and D1232E were identified as neutral mutations that do not confer resistance to RFX.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this review is to summarize the prevalence, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatments currently available for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in children. SIBO is a clinical entity characterized by the presence of an excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel leading to several nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms due to malabsorption and malnutrition, such as bloating, flatulence, belching, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, steatorrhea, fatigue and stunted growth. Initially thought to develop specifically in the context of abnormal or postsurgical gastrointestinal anatomy, it has then been recognized that it can be associated with other nonsurgical conditions, such as gastrointestinal dysmotility, disorders of gut-brain interactions and chronic use of drugs. The uncertainty regarding the exact cut-off of excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel has led to the absence of a universally accepted definition of SIBO making well-designed research to assess the best diagnostic and therapeutic approaches challenging. Current available diagnostic tools includes duodenal/jejunal aspirate with culture and hydrogen breath tests, which all have some limitations and pitfalls that prevent accurate sampling. The treatment goal should be to treat the underlying causes, restore the healthy intestinal microflora, relieve the symptoms and address the associated complications. The use of antibiotics represents the treatment cornerstore. However, they are commonly used despite the scarce published evidence and the absence of agreement on the dose and duration of the treatment. Currently, data on best diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in children remain lacking. Novel diagnostic approaches for SIBO are emerging and may facilitate further research.",

        "title": "Patient Preferences for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Treatment: A Multi-method Approach Using Discrete Choice Experiments and Best-Worst Scaling.",
        "abstract": "Treatment decisions for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) require patients to balance survival benefits, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and potential risks of side effects while also factoring in their own preferences for different treatment options. Despite growing interest, quantitative patient preferences are not yet integrated into health technology assessments (HTAs) for drug reimbursement recommendations. The Colorectal Cancer Canada's Patient Values Project aims to explore approaches to incorporate quantitative patient preferences into cancer treatment HTA decision-making processes. As a first step, we elicited the treatment preferences and risk tolerance of patients with mCRC in Canada using a multi-method approach. We developed a preference survey that included two discrete choice experiments (DCEs) and case 1 best-worst scaling (BWS-1) to estimate preferences for mCRC treatments. DCE1 included change in HRQoL and overall survival as attributes, and treatment attributes in DCE2 were administration and frequency, side effects (nausea, pain, diarrhea), and progression-free survival. The BWS-1 included 25 attributes of potential mCRC treatment side effects based on the cancer-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. The survey was administered across Canada to patients with mCRC aged ≥ 18 years with a self-reported diagnosis of mCRC through patient organizations, cancer centers, and an online panel. Data were analyzed using mixed logit and latent class models (DCEs) and count-based analysis (BWS-1). Overall, 127 patients with mCRC completed the full survey (n = 143 fully completed DCE1, n = 108 fully completed DCE2, n = 127 fully completed BWS-1). Relative preferences for the treatment attributes in the study were consistent with the expectation that better clinical outcomes were preferred over worse clinical outcomes. In DCE1, patients valued both overall survival (24 vs. 12 months) and HRQoL (improvement to 90 vs. worsens to 50 out of 100) as almost equally important. In DCE2, patients preferred better outcomes (longer progression-free survival and no side effects) over worse outcomes, with a disutility for oral capsules/pills compared with intravenous infusions. Significant preference heterogeneity was observed depending on experiences with CRC treatments, treatment side effects, and health status. In the BWS-1, \"need help with eating, dressing, washing yourself or using the toilet\", \"vomiting\", and \"pain\" were ranked as the least and \"need to rest\", \"trouble doing strenuous activities\", and \"feel tired\" as the most tolerable side effects. This study highlights the value of a multi-method approach in comprehensively assessing treatment preferences and risk tolerance in mCRC. By triangulating multiple preference-elicitation methods, our findings offer a more robust foundation for integrating patient perspectives into Canada's HTA framework. These results will inform the next step of the Colorectal Cancer Canada's Patient Values Project, which aims to explore approaches to explicitly incorporate patient preferences alongside clinical and economic evidence into the cancer treatment HTA decision-making process in Canada.",

Acute exacerbations pose a diagnostic challenge due to the difficulty in distinguishing active Crohn's disease from other causes, particularly infections. While Clostridium difficile infection is well-documented and typically screened for in symptomatic Crohn's patients, other enteric infections are often under-recognized and lack sufficient evidence. We report the case of a 17-year-old male with known colonic Crohn's disease who presented with a five-day history of fever and diarrhea. Initial treatment with ciprofloxacin was ineffective, suggesting a quinolone-resistant pathogen. Traditional diagnostic approaches, including stool cultures, failed to identify the pathogen. However, subsequent multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing of stool samples identified Campylobacter species, and signi-ficant clinical improvement was observed following azithromycin therapy. This case underscores the importance of considering non-Clostridium difficile infections in the differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease flares and highlights the clinical utility of multiplex polymerase chain reaction in rapidly identifying resistant pathogens. Implementing such molecular diagnostics is crucial for improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Weaning is a stressful event that is often accompanied by anorexia, risk of diarrhea, and development of intestinal disorders, making it crucial to provide highly digestible and palatable diets. Novel functional protein sources are being developed to be included in diets fed to weanling pigs. We evaluated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> the properties of a recently developed hydrolyzed yeast protein source (Yela ProSecure; YPS; Lallemand SAS, Blagnac, France). The objectives were (1) to evaluate <i>in vitro</i> amino acids (AA) digestibility; (2) to assess, <i>in vitro,</i> the impact of the product's insoluble fraction (YPSi) on the fermentative activity of piglet fecal microbiota; and (3) to test the effects of two inclusion levels (2.5 and 6%) on growth performance and fecal microbiota in weanling piglets. The total AA availability after 3 h of digestion was 76.6%, reaching 89.8% after 48 h. YPSi induced high gas and short-chain fatty acids production. In the <i>in vivo</i> experiment, a significant difference in body weight was observed on day 18 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) post-weaning and on day 40 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with piglets in both YPS treatments being heavier than control piglets. A higher average daily feed intake was observed between weaning and day 18 (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and overall (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in both YPS treatments, and an improved feed conversion ratio was observed in both YPS treatments between weaning and day 18 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, YPS significantly modulated the fecal microbiota composition after 2 days and 16 days of treatment, whereas no lasting effect was evidenced on day 40, namely after 19 days of withdrawal from the diet. Lower relative abundance (RA) of <i>Campylobacterota</i> (<i>p</i> adj. < 0.05) was evidenced in YPS groups compared to the control group. Furthermore, several members of the <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> family, annotated as <i>L. amylovorus</i>, <i>L. mucosae,</i> or <i>L. reuteri,</i> as well as <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, showed higher RA in YPS groups. To conclude, adding YPS to the diet of weanling piglets increased growth performance, probably due to nutrient absorption in the small intestine and its functional role on gut microbiota. Those results suggest complex interconnections between host and microbiota and emphasize the need to consider the holobiont theory when formulating a diet.",

        "title": "The role of probiotic supplementation in reducing <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> recurrence after classic quadruple therapy.",
        "abstract": "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) infection remains a global public health issue, closely linked to peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and MALT lymphoma. Although classic bismuth-containing quadruple therapy achieves high eradication rates, recurrence after treatment is still a significant concern. Recent evidence suggests that probiotics may support gastrointestinal homeostasis, modulate immune responses, and help prevent <i>H. pylori</i> reinfection. This study aimed to evaluate whether probiotic supplementation reduces <i>H. pylori</i> recurrence following classic quadruple therapy. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from 305 adult patients with confirmed <i>H. pylori</i> infection treated at Kunshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Jinxi People's Hospital of Kunshan between January 2023 and December 2023. All patients received standard quadruple therapy for 14 days. Among them, 127 patients additionally received probiotic supplementation during and for 4 weeks following eradication therapy, while 178 did not. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline covariates, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, dietary habits, and prior <i>H. pylori</i> infection history. The primary outcome was <i>H. pylori</i> recurrence within 12 months post-treatment, confirmed by 13C-urea breath test. Secondary outcomes included treatment-related gastrointestinal symptoms, medication adherence, and adverse events. After PSM, 120 matched pairs were analyzed. The recurrence rate of <i>H. pylori</i> was significantly lower in the probiotic group (9.2%) compared to the control group (19.2%) (P = 0.021). Patients in the probiotic group also reported a lower incidence of gastrointestinal discomfort, including bloating and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (P < 0.05), and demonstrated higher treatment adherence (91.7% vs. 83.3%, P = 0.038). No serious adverse events were reported in either group. Probiotic supplementation is associated with a reduced risk of <i>H. pylori</i> recurrence after classic quadruple therapy. In addition to improving gastrointestinal tolerance and adherence, probiotics may contribute to maintaining gut microbial balance and enhancing eradication durability. These findings support the integration of probiotics as an adjunct to standard therapy. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy and identify optimal probiotic formulations and duration.",

        "abstract": "Due to the undesirable cumulative toxicity of multiple drugs, de-escalated neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategies are needed for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Pyrotinib, a small-molecule irreversible pan-HER receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, shows promising efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting. We aimed to determine the efficacy, safety and predictive biomarkers of the de-escalated neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel combined with pyrotinib and trastuzumab in intrinsic HER2-enriched breast cancer. In this multicenter phase 2 study (NCT05659056), patients who were histologically diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer (clinical stage ⅡA-ⅢC) were deemed suitable to participate in this study. Participants received pyrotinib (400 mg once), trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose), and nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 of each 3-week cycle for six cycles. The primary endpoint was the rate of total pathological complete response (tpCR) among BluePrint HER2-enriched breast cancers, which was defined as complete disappearance of invasive tumor in breast specimen and all sampled axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/is, ypN0). This study has been completed. Between 3 December 2022 and 6 June 2024, 74 participants were finally enrolled in the study. Of all enrolled participants, 66 had baseline BluePrint and MammaPrint results. Among the 43 participants with BluePrint HER2-enriched breast cancer, 23 achieved tpCR (53%, 95% CI 38%-69%), and 28 achieved breast pathological complete response (bpCR) (65%, 95% CI 49%-79%). Among the 23 participants with non-HER2-enriched subtypes, 7 achieved tpCR (30%, 95% CI 13%-53%), while 10 achieved bpCR (43%, 95% CI 23%-66%). Of 66 participants with MammaPrint risk score index, the tpCR rate in MammaPrint ultra-high group (24/39) was significantly higher than that in high group (6/27, <i>P</i> = 0.0024). With the median follow-up of 19.9 months (IQR, 15.5-25.4), no cases of recurrence, metastasis, or mortality events were observed. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (23%) participants. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was diarrhea (10/74). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Of all enrolled participants, no treatment discontinuations occurred due to disease progression during the neoadjuvant therapy period. De-escalated neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen is promising for BluePrint HER2-enriched breast cancer. Our results provide critical references for the efficacy and biomarkers of de-escalated neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer.

The aim is to present this case study on the mutation spectrum of the <i>CA12</i> gene to help clinicians better recognize autosomal recessive isolated hyperchlorhidrosis disorder caused by <i>CA12</i> gene mutations. An eight-month-old Jordanian boy presented with vomiting and diarrhea, initially treated for gastroenteritis with IV fluids and oral rehydration.

Recently, a relationship between these agents and gastrointestinal disease has been described, namely, enteropathy, gastropathy, and microscopic colitis. The mechanism is unknown, but it is thought that a cell-mediated immune reaction is involved and does not appear to be a class effect. Treatment consists of stopping the drug and rechallenge can confirm the diagnosis. An 85-year-old man with a history of hypertension treated with olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide for 12 years presented to the emergency department with months of epigastric pain, without vomiting, blood loss, diarrhea, or weight loss. A recent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) showed congested mucosa, irregular erosions, and friability in the distal body, notch, and antrum. Histology revealed moderate chronic gastritis, severe inflammatory activity, abundant eosinophils, intestinal metaplasia with low-grade dysplasia, and marked atrophy, with no signs of malignancy or <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (Hp). The patient had previously been treated by his family doctor with lansoprazole and sucralfate, without improvement, and was subsequently discharged on esomeprazole with a referral for a gastroenterology consultation. Three months later, a follow-up UGE showed persistent erosions despite good adherence to esomeprazole. Hp serology was positive, and the patient was started on bismuth-based quadruple therapy. A post-treatment urea breath test confirmed Hp eradication. Six months later, UGE still showed multiple ulcers in the distal body and antrum. Olmesartan was switched to lisinopril, and after another 6 months, a follow-up UGE showed no ulcers or erosions. Biopsies revealed reduced inflammation and no dysplasia, indicating histological improvement. Olmesartan-induced gastropathy was diagnosed.

Cryptosporidiosis, a gastrointestinal zoonotic disease, causes diarrhoea in dairy and beef production systems worldwide. Infected calves shed <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. oocysts in faeces, posing risks of contaminating surface water sources. Understanding the dynamics of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> contamination is crucial for effective water quality management. This study investigated <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. prevalence in neonatal calves and its potential impact on water quality before abstraction and treatment. The study analysed faecal samples from 1-3-week-old calves on two English dairy farms upstream of a water abstraction point. Initial screening used <i>C. parvum</i> immune chromatographic assays (ICT) on 47 faecal samples. This was followed by DNA extraction and species identification, with <i>gp60</i> subtyping. Raw and treated water quality data were analysed to determine <i>Cryptosporidium</i> oocyst counts. <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> was the predominant species in calves at both farms, with <i>gp60</i> subtype IIaA17G2R1 being the only subtype detected.

        "abstract": "Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a significant challenge in oncology, particularly when accompanied by distant metastases or when surgical resection is not feasible. These conditions are typically associated with poor prognosis and variable responses to treatment. Traditional chemotherapy, while commonly used, has limited efficacy and is often associated with substantial adverse effects, which can compromise survival outcomes. In recent years, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have emerged as promising alternatives for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, or gefitinib in patients with advanced NSCLC. A total of 312 patients, diagnosed and treated between January 2019 and December 2023, were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into non-epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation group (Group A + Group B) and epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation group (Group C + Group D) according to gene mutation. The treatment regimens were divided into 4 groups: Group A (carboplatin + paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab treatment), Group B (carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment), Group C (carboplatin + paclitaxel combined with gefitinib treatment), and Group D (carboplatin + paclitaxel treatment). The results demonstrated that the experimental groups (A and C) exhibited significantly superior short-term efficacy compared to the control groups (B and D), with notable improvements in both the objective response rate and disease control rate (P < .05). Survival analysis further revealed that the median progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly longer in Groups A and C than in Groups B and D (P < .001). While the experimental groups experienced a higher incidence of adverse events, particularly hypertension, diarrhea, constipation, and rash, most of these were manageable. In conclusion, the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab, or gefitinib significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC, offering superior efficacy over conventional regimens, with manageable side effects. These findings warrant further investigation to confirm the long-term benefits and optimize treatment strategies for advanced NSCLC.",

A systematic search was performed across PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Google databases for studies published from January 1975 to May 2025. Search terms included variations of \"synchronous,\" \"simultaneous,\" \"concurrent,\" and \"coexistence\" combined with \"appendicitis,\" \"appendectomy,\" \"cholecystitis,\" and \"cholecystectomy.\" Reference lists of included studies were screened. Studies reporting human cases with sufficient patient-level clinical data were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by pairs of reviewers, with discrepancies resolved through consensus. No meta-analysis was conducted due to the descriptive nature of the data. <b>Results</b>: A total of 44 articles were included in this review. Of these, thirty-four were available in full text, one was accessible only as an abstract, and one was a literature review, while eight articles were inaccessible. Clinical data from forty patients, including two from our own cases, were evaluated, with a median age of 41 years.

        "abstract": "Natural products have emerged as potential alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial diarrhea, due to their multi-targeting effects, low potential for inducing resistance, and favorable safety profiles. Currently, the search for natural product-based therapies has become an emerging focus in medical research. This growing interest is driven by the increasing awareness that the widespread and irrational use of antibiotics has contributed to the alarming rise in antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, which in turn diminishes the efficacy of conventional drugs. Among these concerns, the limitations of antibiotics in managing bacterial diarrhea and the potential mechanisms by which natural products exert therapeutic effects are the main focus of this paper. Natural products, containing a wide array of bioactive compounds, can not only directly inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, disrupt bacterial membrane synthesis, and reduce toxin production, but also modulate inflammatory responses, enhance immune function, repair intestinal barriers, and restore gut microbial ecology-highlighting their systemic and multi-targeted therapeutic potential. Therefore, this paper will elaborate on how natural products combat bacterial diarrhea from three aspects: the pathogen and pathogenesis of bacterial diarrhea, natural product-based therapeutic studies, and the underlying mechanisms of action, thereby proposing natural products as viable alternatives to antibiotics.",

In Trial I, 270 piglets (21-63 days) received six treatments: control (PC), PC with 100 g/ton protease A (PC+A), CP reduced by 1.0% (NC1) or 1.5% (NC1.5), NC1.5 with 50 g/ton protease A (NC1.5+A), and NC1.5 with 50 g/ton protease B (NC1.5+B). PC+A improved weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion compared with NC1.5+A. The incidence of diarrhea was reduced in animals fed protease-supplemented diets (PC+A, NC1.5+A and NC1.5+B). PC had greater ileal villus height than NC1.5+B, and PC+A showed a higher jejunal villus-to-crypt ratio than reduced CP groups. NC1.5+B increased jejunal expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and haptoglobin. In Trial II, 12 ileal-cannulated piglets received diets with or without protease A. Protease improved the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of methionine+cysteine and tryptophan but reduced the SID of glycine and proline. While protease supplementation can improve some amino acids (Met+Cys and Thr) protein digestibility, our findings suggest it cannot fully replace careful amino acid balancing in CP-reduced diets.

        "title": "What Cachexia-Related Outcomes Are Measured in Lung Cancer Chemotherapy Clinical Trials?",
        "abstract": "Cachexia worsens prognosis, quality of life and chemotherapy treatment compliance of patients with lung cancer. Chemotherapy-induced cachexia has also been implicated in lowered mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of cachexia-related measures and symptoms as outcomes in lung cancer chemotherapy trial protocols and to examine how key trial characteristics influence them. We conducted a cross-sectional data analysis of randomised controlled chemotherapy trials of lung cancer registered in four public trial registries between 2012 and 2023. Trial outcome measures included overall survival, treatment toxicity/side effects and cachexia-related indicators such as physical activity, weight/body mass index (BMI), dietary limitations, caloric intake and lean muscle mass. Symptom-related outcomes, including appetite loss, diarrhoea, pain, fatigue/insomnia, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, dyspnoea and oral mucositis, were also extracted. Additionally, the number and type of performance status and assessment tool were recorded. Data were summarised descriptively. Chi-square tests were used to examine associations between trial outcomes and characteristics including cancer type, trial location, lead investigator/funding source, assessment tools and trial commencement year. A <i>p</i> < 0.05 was considered statistically significance. Of the 335 trial protocols (non-small cell (87.2%) and small cell (12.8%)), most were from Europe (50.4%). The trial lead investigator was from industry (56.7%) followed by academia (25.1%). Allied health professional involvement was minimal (0.6%). Trial protocols mostly recorded overall survival (96.4%) and toxicity (83.9%). However, physical activity, weight/BMI, dysphagia, dyspnoea and oral mucositis were recorded in <30%, with dietary limitations, caloric intake and lean muscle mass recorded in <3% of the trials. Measures and symptoms were not associated with cancer type. Trial location was associated with the measures toxicity, physical activity and caloric intake and all symptoms. Lead investigator was associated with the measures toxicity and weight/BMI and all symptoms except for dyspnoea. Performance status and assessment tools were mentioned in 93.4% and 41.8% of the trials, respectively, with significant associations between assessment tools and outcomes, except for weight/BMI, dietary limitations, lean muscle mass, dysphagia and oral mucositis. There was a significant trend with trial commencement year for the measures physical activity (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and weight/BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.000) and all symptoms, except for appetite loss (<i>p</i> = 0.115) and pain (<i>p</i> = 0.433). While the reporting of measures and outcomes was generally higher compared to gastrointestinal chemotherapy cancer trials, it still faced significant under-reporting. Assessment tools should include cachexia-specific symptoms to accurately assess the quality of life in patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The treatment options for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer include targeted therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapies, and immunotherapy. However, limited specificity and inevitable resistance highlight the need for novel agents. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) and sacituzumab govitecan (SG), represent a breakthrough by selectively delivering cytotoxic agents to tumor cells, potentially improving the therapeutic index. Despite demonstrated efficacy, ADCs present toxicity profiles similar to conventional chemotherapy, alongside unique adverse events. In clinical practice, oncologists may face scenarios where both T-DXd and SG are treatment options in HER2-negative mBC. To enable shared decision-making, it is crucial to present a comprehensive overview that includes both efficacy data and detailed toxicity profiles. Our objective was to provide a pooled and informative synthesis of toxicities from pivotal studies, including graphical representations, to support informed, patient-centered medical decisions. We reviewed safety data from phase 3 clinical trials in HER2-negative mBC: DESTINY-Breast04/DESTINY-Breast06 for T-DXd and ASCENT/TROPICS-02 for SG. Adverse event (AE) profiles, including frequency and severity, were extracted, and weighted means were calculated. Emerging ADCs such as datopotamab deruxtecan and patritumab deruxtecan were considered to contextualize future therapeutic decisions. Tables, bar plots and radar plots were generated. T-DXd demonstrated high rates of nausea (69.2%), fatigue (47.2%), and neutropenia (35.6%), with 52.7% experiencing grade ≥ 3 AEs. Notably, pneumonitis occurred in 10.7%, with grade ≥ 3 in 2.6%. SG showed a distinct AE profile, with higher incidences of neutropenia (67.1%), with grade ≥ 3 in 51.3%, and diarrhea (60.8%). The choice between ADCs in HER2-negative metastatic BC when both T-DXd and SG are treatment options should consider toxicity profiles to optimize patient-centered treatment strategies. Tailoring ADC selection based on individual tolerance and preferences is critical for shared decision-making, and future research should focus on assessing the utility and acceptability of such clinical tools to guide treatment selection.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Infantile hemangioma (IH) is a common vascular tumor in neonates, influenced by multiple prenatal and perinatal factors. This study aimed to identify risk factors in both infants and mothers, assess their link to clinical characteristics and severity, and evaluate treatment outcomes when systemic propranolol therapy was administered. <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a retrospective observational study analyzing 43 infants under 12 months, including 11 neonates (<28 days) diagnosed with IH. Maternal and neonatal factors, diagnostic timelines, clinical presentation, and treatment efficacy were examined. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, focusing on gestational age, birth weight, Apgar scores, and the Infantile Hemangioma Referral Score (IHReS). <b>Results</b>: The study found a female predominance and a correlation between IH and pre-term birth (50%) and low birth weight (<2760 g, 51.16%). Maternal anemia (23%) and gestational hypertension (9%) were present in the cohort, but no statistical association with IH severity was found. A significant number (44.18%) were diagnosed within the first two weeks postpartum. The IHReS was inversely correlated with Apgar scores, with newborns scoring above 8 having a lower IHReS. Treatment with propranolol (1-3 mg/kg/day) was highly effective, resulting in significant lesion regression in most patients. Mild complications included sleep disturbances (12%) and diarrhea (9%). The most affected areas were the face/eyelid (32.55%), limbs (18.6%), and anterior thorax. Additionally, 42% of cases had an IHReS above 4, with multiple hemangiomas increasing severity. <b>Conclusions:</b> IH was common in pre-term and low-birth-weight infants, whereas the maternal comorbidities observed in this small cohort did not show a definitive association, underscoring the need for controlled studies. Early diagnosis, risk stratification, and timely propranolol therapy are crucial in achieving favorable outcomes. Further research is needed to assess long-term effects and evaluate risks of treatment rebound.",

Increasing evidence now suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of MC. In this narrative review, we summarize evidence from nine case-control studies examining microbial composition using sequencing technology. The research presented here illustrates reduced alpha diversity, high dysbiosis, and pro-inflammatory oral-associated taxa enrichment, such as <i>Veillonella dispar</i>, and loss of protective microbes such as <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and <i>Bacteroides stercoris</i>. These microbial changes have the potential to be non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers that can differentiate MC from other etiologies. In addition, the characterization of gut microbiota in MC can guide personalized therapeutic strategies, such as directed probiotic therapy or fecal microbiota transplantation, to help restore microbial balance. These microbial patterns can be applied to guide the creation of diagnostic biomarkers and personalized therapy. Despite differences in sample types and sequencing methods, general microbial trends highlight the need for further longitudinal and standardized investigations.",

        "abstract": "Cancer treatment itself and particularly chemotherapy unavoidably affects host cells, often producing a variety of side effects, e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever, and further decreases in appetite, physical activity, and body weight. These effects, combined with biochemical and histological injuries to major organ systems, may result in a profound nutritional insufficiency. This study aimed to determine the nutritional status of patients receiving chemotherapy. A prospective study was conducted among 64 adults newly diagnosed cancer patients of various sites, admitted to the Oncology Department at European Gaza Hospital (EGH), and scheduled for the first cycle of chemotherapy. The nutritional status of each patient was assessed using the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and anthropometry before commencing the first cycle of the chemotherapy regimen (pre) and after completing the chemotherapy regimen (post). Additionally, biochemical and dietary intake assessments were also performed. Nutritional status worsened after the completion of a chemotherapy regimen. It has been found that 80.3% of patients suffered from malnutrition (moderate and severe) after the completion of the chemotherapy regimen based on SGA in comparison to 35.9% who were malnourished before commencing the first cycle of chemotherapy. The results reported the presence of a functional vitamin B12 deficiency, such that there is a drastic reduction in serum vitamin B12 levels (355.0(IQR 115.0) to 219.0(IQR 177.0) pg/mL, P < 0.001), accompanied by a significant increase in it is related metabolites methylmalonic acid (MMA) (3.9(IQR 3.0) to 49.7(IQR 32.0) ng/mL, P < 0.001), and homocysteine (Hcy) (3.90(IQR 0.85) to 12.60(IQR 7.05) ng/mL, P < 0.001) after the completion of chemotherapy regimen. Dietary intake in terms of macronutrients and micronutrients changed significantly after the completion of chemotherapy regimen. Cancer patients who received chemotherapy were at risk of malnutrition hence it is a wise practice to conduct thoroughly and deep nutritional assessment for each patient at the baseline, during treatment and after the completion of chemotherapy regimen.",

        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of global child mortality continues to be diarrhoea where rotavirus contributed to about 24% of deaths among all diarrhoeal deaths, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Rotavirus vaccination programmes have contributed to the reduction of mortality from 24% to 19% in rotavirus infections among hospitalised children, but the burden of rotaviral diarrhoea remains high, especially in settings with undernutrition. We aimed to determine the association of rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology with prior vaccination, socioeconomic status and clinical factors in children to see their utility in clinical settings. We analysed secondary data from a multicentre clinical trial on antibiotic impact in children with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We used stored stool samples of 6697 children aged 2-23 months old, presenting to a health facility with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We determined rotavirus aetiology prevalence using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and looked at its association with the patient's rotaviral vaccination status, clinical symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models; if they did not converge, log-Poisson models were used. Rotavirus prevalence of 21.1% was observed. There was a weak and statistically non-significant inverse association between rotavirus vaccination and rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology (adjusted PR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03). Of the five tested clinical symptoms, shorter diarrhoea duration was associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.45). Of the seven tested socioeconomic characteristics, only maternal and paternal secondary education compared with no formal education were associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, PR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00 respectively). Rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology cannot accurately be determined with prior receipt of rotavirus vaccination among children presenting to facilities with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. Short diarrhoea duration and parental secondary education were associated with increased prevalence of rotaviral aetiology; however, their utility in clinical care remains unclear.",

In the present study, we conducted a living pharmacovigilance study, integrating data from clinical trials and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, to assess the safety profile of nivolumab-relatlimab. Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) in trials of nivolumab-relatlimab available in electronic databases were systematically searched. The outcomes included were all-grade (grades 1-5) and high-grade (grades 3-5) TRAEs, considering both overall and individual aspects. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the incidence and risk ratio of TRAEs associated with nivolumab-relatlimab. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. Adverse events reports were extracted from the FAERS database, and a disproportionality analysis was carried out to estimate the safety signals of AEs associated with nivolumab-relatlimab. A total of 12 trials were included, the incidence of all-grade and high-grade TRAEs for nivolumab-relatlimab was 74.11 % and 38.05 %, respectively. Compared with nivolumab monotherapy, therapy with nivolumab-relatlimab was associated with a significantly increased risk of high-grade TRAEs, and some individual specified all-grade TRAEs, including hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, rash, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, arthralgia and myalgia. Disproportionality analyses of FAERS pharmacovigilance data identified 39 positive signals, with 18 AEs not mentioned in the drug label. Nivolumab-relatlimab showed significantly higher reporting frequencies for 15 AEs than nivolumab monotherapy. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential safety profile of nivolumab-relatlimab, the results of this living study will be updated to incorporate new, robust evidence as it becomes available.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic apicomplexan that causes moderate-to-severe watery diarrhea in children, immunocompromised patients, and neonatal ruminants, yet no fully effective drug is available. We show that the parasite's eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (CpeIF4A; a DEAD-box RNA helicase in the eIF4F translation-initiation complex) can be exploited as a fast-killing therapeutic target. Rocaglamide A (Roc-A), a plant-derived rocaglate, binds the CpeIF4A-RNA-ATP complex with high affinity (Kd = 33.7 nM) and blocks protein synthesis in excysting sporozoites (IC50 ≈ 3.7 µM). In host-cell culture, Roc-A suppresses intracellular growth with nanomolar potency (EC50 = 1.77 nM) and a selectivity index exceeding 56,000 in HCT-8 cells and 1,400 in HepG2 cells. A five-day oral regimen (0.5 mg/kg/d) reduced oocyst shedding by >90% within 48 h in interferon-γ-knockout mice and by 70-90% from day 2 onward without rebound during a 15-day follow-up in NCG mice. Two amino-acid differences at the Roc-A binding surface (D165 and V192 in CpeIF4A vs. N167 and D194 in the human ortholog) offer a foothold for medicinal optimization toward greater parasite selectivity. These findings establish translation initiation as an unexplored but tractable pathway for anti-cryptosporidial drug discovery and position Roc-A as a promising lead compound.",

This was a randomized, double-blind, three-arm parallel-group study. Healthy participants aged 18-55 years were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single subcutaneous injection (45 mg) of either DMB-3115, EU-Stelara, or US-Stelara. Participants were stratified into two body weight groups (< 80 vs. ≥ 80 kg). Participants were followed for 16 weeks. The primary pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>), AUC from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub>), and maximum serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>). Immunogenicity was tested using antidrug antibody (ADA) assays. A total of 296 participants (n = 99 in the DMB-3115 group, n = 99 in the EU-Stelara group, and n = 98 in the US-Stelara group) received the study drug and were included in the safety analysis. Of these, one participant in the DMB-3115 group had no valid PK data and was excluded from the PK analysis. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the ratios of geometric least squares means (DMB-3115/EU-Stelara and DMB-3115/US-Stelara) of the primary PK endpoints (AUC<sub>inf</sub>, AUC<sub>last</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub>) were within the prespecified bioequivalence range of 80-125%. Originally this study was designed for the comparison of EU and US Stelara with two formulations of DMB-3115. To avoid multiplicity, a 95% CI was chosen. After that, only one formulation was selected. However, overall design was not changed. Using a 95% CI provided a more stringent level for the bioequivalence evaluation and was acceptable for European Medical Agency and US Food and Drug Administration. The proportions of participants reporting any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were similar among the three groups. The most common TEAEs were headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, diarrhea, and oropharyngeal pain. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and no TEAEs led to study discontinuation. The incidences of participants with post-dose ADAs and neutralizing antibodies in DMB-3115 tended to be lower among the groups. DMB-3115 was bioequivalent to both reference ustekinumab in terms of pharmacokinetic profile and showed similar safety and immunogenicity profile after a single subcutaneous injection in parallel groups of healthy adult participants.

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) in pediatric patients often results in corticosteroid (CS) dependency, with many individuals developing resistance to conventional treatments such as anti-TNF agents. Vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting α4β7 integrin, has shown promise in adult populations, but data on its efficacy and safety in children and adolescents are limited. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in treating UC in pediatric patients. The PRISMA statement's guidelines were followed in conducting this systematic review. Up until December 2024, a thorough search was carried out using keywords associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), vedolizumab, and pediatric populations in the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed. Case series of children and adolescents (less than 18 years old) with UC or unclassified IBD who were treated with vedolizumab were included in the research. Data on clinical response, mucosal healing, corticosteroid-free remission, clinical remission, and adverse events were extracted. Descriptive statistics were used in the statistical analysis. A total of 14 papers were considered in the current evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab. Nearly one-third (36%) of patients with UC/IBD-U experienced clinical remission at 6 weeks, half of the patients at 14 weeks (50%), and 48% and 53% of patients at 22 weeks, respectively. Forty-five percent of patients maintained clinical remission after 1 year. Less than 8% of UC/IBD-U patients experienced serious side effects, while 15%-34% of patients experienced mucosal healing. Vedolizumab exhibits promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile in treating pediatric UC, with a sizable portion of patients achieving both clinical and corticosteroid-free remission. However, due to the limited sample sizes and lack of investigations, more randomized controlled trials and long-term research are needed to confirm these findings and develop more reliable clinical guidelines for its use in children and adolescents with UC. This means that even if the initial findings are promising, additional and better testing is required to ensure that vedolizumab is both effective and safe for young patients with UC.

        "abstract": "Eimeria tenella is recognized as the most pathogenic species of chicken coccidia. Infection with E. tenella results in digestive disorders and hemorrhagic diarrhea in chickens. Furthermore, E. tenella has recently shown high incidence and mortality rates. Therefore, developing effective vaccines is vital for controlling this disease. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is recognized as a key upstream cytokine that mediates innate and adaptive immune responses, drawing significant attention. In this study, we amplified the E. tenella MIF (EtMIF) gene sequence, constructed the pET-28a-EtMIF prokaryotic expression vector, and expressed and purified the recombinant EtMIF (rEtMIF) protein. The rEtMIF protein localization was determined using immunofluorescence staining, and its immunoprotective efficacy at three different doses (50 µg, 100 µg, and 150 µg) was subsequently evaluated through animal trials. The rEtMIF protein was approximately 12 kDa in size and primarily existed in a soluble form. The optimal induction conditions were 37°C for 4 hours, and the optimal imidazole elution concentration was 500 mmol/L. The rEtMIF protein was recognized by 6×His-tagged monoclonal antibodies, infection-positive chicken serum, and rabbit anti-rEtMIF polyclonal antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the rEtMIF protein was localized both on the surface and within the merozoites of E. tenella. Evaluation of immune protection showed that weight gain in the immunized groups was significantly higher than in the non-immunized group (P < 0.05). Additionally, intestinal lesion scores and oocyst output were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Among all groups, the 50 µg rEtMIF group achieved the highest anticoccidial index (ACI) value of 161.48. Levels of serum antibodies and cytokines, including IL-1, IL-8, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, were significantly elevated in the immunized groups, indicating that recombinant rEtMIF can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses in chickens. This study support the potential of recombinant rEtMIF as a promising candidate for developing vaccines against chicken coccidiosis.",

        "title": "Ocular Insights: Exploring Uveitis as a Manifestation of Celiac Disease.",
        "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the small intestine and often leads to issues with nutrient absorption. People with CD commonly experience symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, stomach pain, fatty stools, unintended weight loss, and low iron levels. In addition to its intestinal manifestations, CD is also associated with a range of extraintestinal features and comorbid conditions. Although uveitis is a rare manifestation of CD, we report, to our knowledge, the first documented case from Pakistan of posterior uveitis secondary to CD in an 11-year-old girl. The patient presented to the OPD with complaints of a gradual, painless loss of vision in both eyes over a four-month period. Notably, she exhibited no associated ocular, GI, or malabsorptive symptoms. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/24 in the right eye and hand movement only in the left eye. Ocular findings included bilateral +1 anterior chamber cells without keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, or iris nodules. The anterior segment inflammation was accompanied by bilateral vitritis, vasculitis, choroiditis, and optic disc atrophy. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to rule out other potential causes of uveitis and to develop a treatment plan. Despite oral and topical corticosteroids, there was no significant control of intraocular inflammation. Immunosuppressive therapy was initiated, but disease progression continued, ultimately resulting in complete vision loss. Typically, children with CD who present with classic symptoms, such as bloating and diarrhea, are promptly diagnosed and treated. However, patients without these hallmark intestinal symptoms may remain undiagnosed, potentially leading to irreversible complications like severe vision loss. This case, along with previous reports in the literature, highlights the importance of considering CD in the differential diagnosis of uveitis, even in the absence of GI symptoms, particularly in patients who are unresponsive to standard steroid therapy and after exclusion of other known causes of uveitis.",

        "abstract": "Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a severe complication of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), leading to fibrotic degeneration of right-sided heart valves. A 38-year-old male presented with progressive dyspnea, fatigue, abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and facial flushing. Imaging revealed hepatic metastases and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and biochemical markers confirmed a NET of likely gastrointestinal origin. Echocardiography showed torrential tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary insufficiency, right ventricular dilation, and a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient was started on long-acting lanreotide for carcinoid syndrome and optimized on heart failure therapy. Due to severe valvular dysfunction, he underwent tricuspid and pulmonic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves and PFO closure under perioperative octreotide infusion. The patient also underwent transthoracic liver debulking and ablation, small bowel resection, and mesenteric dissection. Postoperatively, he showed symptomatic improvement and remains under multidisciplinary surveillance. This case highlights the importance of early recognition, multidisciplinary management, and surgical intervention in CHD to optimize outcomes. Early initiation of somatostatin analog therapy, guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, and timely surgical intervention can significantly improve symptom burden and survival.",

        "title": "Diagnostic Dilemma of a Neuroendocrine Tumour Complicated by Simultaneous Retroperitoneal Fibrosis and Carcinoid Heart Disease in a Perimenopausal Woman.",
        "abstract": "Carcinoid tumours are rare, slow-growing neuroendocrine neoplasms that often remain asymptomatic until metastatic spread or the development of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is characterised by flushing, diarrhoea, and bronchospasm due to the secretion of vasoactive hormones. These tumours commonly arise in the gastrointestinal tract but can also occur in other organs, namely, the lungs, genitourinary tract, and pancreas. Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF), a rare inflammatory disease, involves chronic inflammation leading to fibrous scarring and compression of surrounding structures like the ureters and blood vessels. Carcinoid heart disease secondary to fibrous valve thickening can also occur and causes high morbidity and mortality. This case report highlights a 52-year-old woman who developed a rare complication of RPF along with carcinoid heart disease secondary to a carcinoid tumour. Her symptoms, initially misdiagnosed as menopausal, included a four-year history of diarrhoea, uncontrolled hypertension, and flushing. She was admitted with abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, and bilateral hydronephrosis. Imaging and biochemical tests revealed a primary ileocecal carcinoid tumour with hepatic metastases, RPF causing ureteric obstruction, and elevated chromogranin A/B and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels. Cardiac involvement included severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired left ventricular function, consistent with carcinoid heart disease. Management involved nephrostomy placement following failed bilateral ureteric stenting, octreotide infusions to prevent carcinoid crisis, and symptomatic control with lanreotide. The patient continues to receive multidisciplinary care from cardiology, urology, and oncology. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing carcinoid tumours with atypical presentations and rare complications like RPF.",

        "abstract": "A 1-year-old spayed female mixed-breed cat presented with chronic large bowel diarrhoea. The cat was treated with various antibiotics, prednisolone and dietary supplements without significant improvement. Endoscopic examination revealed an irregular colonic mucosa with multifocal erosion and haemorrhage. Impression smears of the colonic mucosa contained large numbers of unicellular round-to-oval organisms and macrophages. Histologically, granulomatous inflammation with numerous organisms was observed in the lamina propria of the colonic mucosa. The organisms had a cell wall and internal segmentation, which were positive on periodic acid-Schiff and Grocott's methenamine silver staining. Immunohistochemically, CD204-positive macrophages had accumulated in the lesions. Ultrastructural examination revealed dense bodies and starch granules, and the absence of chloroplasts in the cytoplasm of the organisms. PCR and a sequence analysis detected the <i>Prototheca bovis 18S rRNA</i> gene in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colonic mucosa tissue. Based on these findings, the cat was diagnosed with granulomatous colitis associated with <i>P bovis</i> infection. This first report of feline intestinal protothecosis suggests that <i>Prototheca</i> species infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cats with treatment-resistant chronic large bowel diarrhoea.",

        "abstract": "Chengdu hosted the 31st Summer World University Games in 2023. The movement and gathering of attendees from other cities and countries posed challenges to local public health, including an increased risk of infectious diseases or outbreaks. To manage these risks, a syndromic surveillance system targeting infectious diseases was established. This system aimed to identify suspicious cases and outbreaks early, enabling timely measures and minimizing their impact. This article reviews the surveillance mechanism, analyzes the surveillance data, and evaluates the system's effectiveness. The mechanism of the syndromic surveillance system was described, and surveillance data were collected to evaluate strategies for infectious disease prevention and control during the Universiade. Epidemiological distributions of diseases were described, and differences were tested using chi-squared tests. Surveillance was carried out among athletes, coaches, entourages, and staff from 1 week before the competition to 1 week after. The surveillance focused on symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, jaundice, conjunctival redness, and sore throat, supported by a self-developed <i>Cloud Health Information System for Health Care Support</i> and <i>Syndromic Surveillance System for Infectious Disease</i>. A total of 351 subjects with disease-related symptoms, mainly including sore throat, cough, and fever, were reported. A total of 33 events of clustered symptoms were detected, none of which met the criteria for an outbreak. Fifty cases were confirmed with infectious diseases, comprising 43 cases of COVID-19, 3 cases of influenza, and 1 case each of infectious mononucleosis, chikungunya, malaria, and another infectious diarrhea. Throughout the event, reports of disease-related symptoms were sporadically distributed, with no secondary cases or outbreaks detected and no health-related risks arising that would impact the continuation of the event. The syndromic surveillance system was sensitive and effective for the early detection and control of infectious disease outbreaks and could be implemented in other mass-gathering events.",

Acute presentations in patients treated with ICI therapy and combined chemotherapy/ICI therapy can be challenging and have significant resource implications. A prospective analysis was performed at a specialist oncology hospital in England from December 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The primary outcome measure was whether the acute presentation was due to an ICI-related toxicity. Secondary outcome measures were number of inpatient bed days and the proportion of patients with grade ≥3 diarrhoea or transaminases that were diagnosed with ICI-related toxicity. During the study period, 285 patients were treated with neoadjuvant PC-EC/Pembro for triple negative breast cancer with 210 emergency presentations in 168 patients to the acute floor. Fifty-three (25.2 %) patients were diagnosed with an ICI-related toxicity of which 5 were a relapsed/recurrent presentation. One hundred and nine patients (51.9 %) were discharged on the day of presentation. A total of 576 inpatient bed days were used in the management of the cohort. Sixteen (7.6 %) patients had grade 3 diarrhoea at presentation; only 5 (31.3 %) of these were ICI-mediated. Eleven (5.2 %) patients had a grade ≥3 ALT rise at presentation; only 3 (27.2 %) of these were ICI-mediated. In triple negative breast cancer being treated in the neoadjuvant setting with chemotherapy/immune checkpoint inhibition only 25.2 % of acute presentations had an ICI-related toxicity driving their attendance.

This field study was conducted to confirm the clinical effectiveness and field safety of a novel, chewable tablet (Credelio Quattro<sup>™</sup>) containing lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel (as pamoate salt) as compared with a control product containing sarolaner, moxidectin, and pyrantel (as pamoate salt) for the treatment of naturally occurring gastrointestinal nematode infections in dogs. In this multicenter field study, 158 dogs were enrolled with an evaluable safety population of 155 dogs and an evaluable effectiveness population of 109 dogs. Dogs were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the investigational veterinary product (IVP) Credelio Quattro containing lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel or the control product (CP) containing sarolaner, moxidectin, and pyrantel. On Day 0, after confirmation of infection, enrolled dogs were randomized, dispensed, and administered IVP or CP. Enrolled dogs returned to the study site on Day 10 (± 2 d) to quantify the concentration of nematode eggs post-treatment. Post-treatment fecal egg counts performed on Day 10 demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in A. caninum eggs per gram in both IVP-treated dogs and CP-treated dogs. In addition, a 98.7% and 96.6% reduction in T. canis fecal egg counts were observed in IVP- and CP-treated dogs, respectively. Adverse events were reported in both treatment groups. The most common adverse events reported in the IVP group included gastrointestinal signs, such as diarrhea and emesis, as well as lethargy. This field study demonstrated that Credelio Quattro, a novel oral combination chewable tablet administered at the labeled dose ranges of 20-40 mg/kg lotilaner, 0.02-0.04 mg/kg moxidectin, 5-10 mg/kg praziquantel, and 5-10 mg/kg pyrantel (as pamoate salt), is safe and effective for the treatment and control of naturally occurring A. caninum and T. canis infections in dogs.",

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) typically resolves within 14 days, but probiotics are increasingly used to restore gut microbiota balance and counteract pathogenic organisms. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a novel multistrain probiotic formulation in managing AGE and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). This observational, real-world study included 683 patients from 239 sites across India, assessing the effects of a multistrain probiotic formulation in AGE and AAD. The study adhered to ICH-GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, with Ethics Committee approval. Clinical outcomes were assessed based on stool frequency, consistency, and Clinician's Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scores after 7 days of treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 29.0.1.0 to evaluate significant changes in these parameters. Among AGE patients (mean age: 45.91 ± 11.77 years; 68.92% male), 56.42% had no comorbidities. The most common symptoms were diarrhea (96.70%) and abdominal cramps (37.67%). Probiotics were prescribed to 93.92% of patients, with 93.23% achieving diarrhea resolution. Stool frequency significantly declined from 5.63 ± 1.43 to 1.65 ± 0.65 per day (68.94% reduction, p < 0.0001), and 95.31% of patients achieved normal stool consistency. CGI-I scores improved in 99.83% of cases. Among AAD patients (mean age: 43.32 ± 11.64 years; 60.75% male), diarrhea (97.20%) and vomiting (30.84%) were predominant symptoms. Probiotics were prescribed to 99.07% of patients, with an equal proportion achieving diarrhea resolution. Stool frequency significantly decreased by 67.94% (p < 0.0001), and Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) use declined from 54.21% at baseline to zero by Day 7. No treatment-related adverse events were reported. The multistrain probiotic formulation significantly improved stool frequency and consistency in AGE and AAD patients within 7 days. Additionally, it effectively reduced ORS dependence and exhibited a strong safety profile, with no reported adverse events. These findings support the probiotic's potential as a safe and effective adjunct in managing AGE and AAD.

        "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) infections in children is becoming a growing global concern. AMR poses a significant challenge in pediatric diarrhea, where multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae threaten treatment efficacy. This study investigates the prevalence, resistance mechanisms, and genetic characteristics of carbapenem-, tigecycline-, and polymyxin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from pediatric diarrhea cases , in 2017 (n=1059) and 2023 (n=367). The prevalence of mcr-1-positive strains declined significantly from 2.36% (25/1059) in 2017 to 0.82% (3/367) in 2023, while tet(X4)-positive strains rose from 0% to 1.91% (7/367). Carbapenemase-producers remained rare (0.28% in 2017; 1.63% in 2023), with bla<sub>NDM</sub> as the dominant carbapenemase gene. Whole genome sequencing revealed diverse antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and evolving plasmid types. Notably, by 2023 all mcr-1 were carried on IncI2 plasmids. Conjugation experiments confirmed plasmids carrying mcr-1, bla<sub>NDM-5</sub>, and tet(X4) are transferable to a recipient strain, highlighting the potential for horizontal gene transfer. Our findings demonstrate a significant shift in pediatric diarrhea-associated Enterobacteriaceae resistance profiles from 2017 to 2023. The decline in mcr-1 mirrors the impact of reduced polymyxin use, whereas the rise of tet(X4) signals a new challenge. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of AMR in pediatric Enterobacteriaceae and emphasize the need for stringent antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance. A One Health approach, integrating clinical, agricultural, and environmental efforts, is crucial to mitigating AMR spread and protecting pediatric health globally.",

On acetamide agar at the same temperature and duration, the colonies appeared flat with irregular edges and a faint pink periphery, while the medium changed to rose-red; in LB broth at 37 °C for 24 h, the medium became turbid and yellowish-green. Gram staining revealed that it was negative and rod-shaped, without sporulation characteristics. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the sequence identity of the strain shared more than 98.4% similarity with 11 strains of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> from various sources in GenBank. The animal toxicity test showed that it had a strong pathogenic effect on mice. The results of drug sensitivity tests showed that strain PA/CM-101101 was sensitive to amikacin, azithromycin, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and polymyxin B; however, it displayed resistance to ampicillin, cefadroxil, cefazolin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. The research findings provide valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment strategies for cynomolgus monkeys. It also provides a reference for molecular epidemiological studies. To our knowledge, this is the first time <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolated from the diarrhea feces of cynomolgus monkey has been reported.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Clinical Significance:</b> Pancreatic cancer was the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States in 2020 after lung and colorectal cancers. The prevalence of pancreatic cancer has been increasing and is projected to continue rising through 2040, with an estimated 355,317 additional cases expected. We present the case of an 81-year-old patient with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who tolerated NALIRIFOX for a year with grade 1 adverse events. <b>Case presentation:</b> An 81-year-old Asian male presented with abdominal pain associated with weight loss and fatigue. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass in the body of the pancreas measuring 3.5 cm with an infiltrative appearance invading the retroperitoneum and encasing the splenic artery. A biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated PDAC. The patient received 13 cycles of NALIRIFOX in a palliative setting over the course of one year, demonstrating excellent tolerance aside from minor toxicities, including worsening of pre-existing macrocytic anemia, treatment-related grade 1 neuropathy, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia. A subsequent CT scan revealed disease progression, and the patient was switched to second-line therapy. However, per his preference, the patient was referred to hospice care and passed away a few days later. <b>Conclusions:</b> This case highlights the excellent tolerability of NALIRIFOX in an elderly patient, with minimal adverse events observed, which is uncommon among similar patient populations.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Diarrhea induced by an excessive amount of fat is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder. Currently, there are limited animal models and treatment options for diarrhea associated with fat. This study aims to develop a mouse model of high-fat-associated diarrhea using glyceryl-trioleate (GTO) and evaluate the potential of montmorillonite clay (MMT) in mitigating this condition. <b>Methods:</b> GTO was administered to mice at different doses through oral gavage to induce diarrhea. Clay was treated through oral gavage to evaluate its anti-diarrhea effect. Fecal conditions were monitored. Intestinal tissues were subjected to histological examination to assess structural integrity. The total fecal bile acids were evaluated using a bile acid assay kit to determine the mechanism of action. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that a diarrhea model was established by administering GTO at 2000 mg/kg. When the animals were treated with clay, diarrhea incidence and severity were decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to the untreated group receiving GTO alone, clay co-administration at 2000 mg/kg reduced diarrhea scores by approximately 48%, while the higher dose of 4000 mg/kg achieved an 83% reduction. Fecal bile acid analysis showed that diarrhea is associated with total bile acid levels in the feces. Histological exams showed that diarrhea is associated with tissue inflammation in the colon. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study showed that GTO administration induced diarrhea in mice, and clay effectively alleviates fat-induced diarrhea through modulation of fecal bile acid composition. These findings suggest that this model can be used to evaluate diarrhea associated with excessive amounts of fat and clay that can be further tested for diarrhea attenuation.",

        "abstract": "Non-cholera Vibrio species are rare waterborne pathogens that can cause severe infections. Among these, few cases of <i>Vibrio metschnikovii</i> infections have been reported, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, with no cardiac tissue involvement as a result. Following the PRISMA checklist, we conducted a literature review, and thirteen articles for twenty-two cases overall were included: seven cases of sepsis (in three cases, the echocardiographic results were negative), seven cases of pneumonia, two skin infections, eleven cases of diarrhoea, and a gastroenteritis outbreak. This report documents the expanding clinical spectrum and the role played by <i>V. metschnikovii</i> in infective endocarditis. A 28-year-old male patient was referred to the cardiac surgery unit for urgent mitral valve replacement due to suspicion of infective endocarditis. Microbiological tests yielded negative results. Following recovery and discharge with antimicrobial therapy for 6 weeks, the patient experienced prosthesis detachment, necessitating re-hospitalisation for an emergency valve replacement. <i>Vibrio metschnikovii</i> was identified on the prosthesis valve through PCR and successfully treated with ciprofloxacin. However, a spontaneous rupture of the ascending thoracic aorta led to a neurological injury. This case represents the first case of valve infection caused by <i>Vibrio metschnikovii</i>, characterised by diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and the involvement of the great vessels. Also considered in this case, for a disease with a median age of 58 years (11-83) and a male-to-female ratio of 2.2, were one male neonate and six cases for whom neither sex nor age was indicated. Excluding gastrointestinal cases, the septic forms are associated with high morbidity, although the single case described involved a young and healthy subject. Risk factors for the pathogen or predisposing/pathological conditions for endocarditis did not emerge. The routes and the time of infection could not be determined, deepening the possibility of occupational exposure via the patient's position as a boat worker. Poor sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporins has been reported in the literature: the absence of an antibiogram does not allow for a comparison, although resolution was achieved with ciprofloxacin. The rising global incidence of non-cholera Vibrio infections, driven by environmental changes, calls for urgent research into the factors behind their pathogenicity and infection routes. Diagnostic complexities have emerged together with clinical severity.",

        "abstract": "Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS) is a rare, non-hereditary disorder characterized by diffuse, non-neoplastic gastrointestinal polyposis along with ectodermal abnormalities, such as alopecia, skin hyperpigmentation, and nail dystrophy. It typically affects individuals aged >50 years and can lead to severe complications, including protein-losing enteropathy, chronic diarrhea, and malnutrition, if not diagnosed early. We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented with a 2-month history of diarrhea, weight loss, and hair loss. Endoscopic and histopathological examinations revealed diffuse polyposis throughout the gastrointestinal tract, consistent with CCS findings. The patient was treated with a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which led to marked clinical and endoscopic improvements. No recurrence was observed during 1 year of follow-up period. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the typical clinical and diagnostic features of CCS. Owing to its nonspecific presentation, diagnosis may be delayed, potentially worsening the prognosis. Therefore, CCS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of middle-aged or older patients who present with multiple gastrointestinal polyps accompanied by ectodermal symptoms. Early recognition and appropriate immunosuppressive therapy are essential for improving patient outcomes and preventing complications. Long-term surveillance is necessary because of the potential for polyp recurrence or malignant transformation.",

        "abstract": "A healthy gut depends on a balance of commensal and probiotic bacteria, and prolonged and inappropriate clinical use of antibiotics can cause an imbalance in the gut flora, resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Macrofungal polysaccharides are rich in bioactivities and have attracted much attention for their good performance in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-obesity and anti-tumor properties. Therefore, we explored the role of <i>Dictyophora indusiata</i> water-insoluble polysaccharides (DIPY) in modulating the gut flora to improve AAD. We initially prepared the water-insoluble polysaccharides derived from <i>Dictyophora indusiata</i>. Subsequently, by comprehensively evaluating multiple parameters including the body weight, dietary patterns, cecal histomorphological characteristics, intestinal microbiota composition, concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the levels of inflammatory factors in the antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) model animals, we delved into both the action mechanisms of these polysaccharides and their impacts on the intestinal flora and metabolites within C57BL/6J mice. Our results showed that DIPY effectively ameliorated AAD in mice by modulating the intestinal flora, increasing microbial diversity, the Shannon and Ace index was significantly higher in the DIPY group than in the NR group after the DIPY intervention (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Also, compared with the NR group, DIPY increasing the relative abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i> and <i>Blautia</i>, increasing the production of acetic acid (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and decreasing the levels of LPS, MCP-1, TNF-<i>α</i>, and IL-6 (<i>p</i> < 0.05) which attenuating inflammatory responses.

        "abstract": "Objective The objective of this study was to assess health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving injectable chemotherapy using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at the Oncology Department of a teaching hospital in Lahore, Pakistan. Methods This cross-sectional observational study was carried out at the Department of Medical Oncology, Nawaz Sharif Social Security Teaching Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, between January and April 2025. A total of 150 patients receiving injectable chemotherapy were enrolled using a non-probability consecutive sampling method. Inclusion criteria required participants to be 18 years or older, of either gender, with a confirmed cancer diagnosis of any stage for at least three months, a life expectancy exceeding six months, and the ability to provide informed consent. Life expectancy exceeding six months was estimated by the treating oncologist based on clinical judgment, considering cancer type and stage, performance status, treatment response, and overall health condition. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing radiotherapy; were bedbound, disabled, or too unwell to participate as judged by the clinical team; had coexisting chronic conditions such as chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, or congestive heart failure; had psychiatric comorbidities; or declined to participate. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (v3.0) was used to assess health-related QoL. Following institutional ethical approval and written informed consent, demographic and clinical data, including age, gender, cancer type, presence and location of metastases, and number of injectable chemotherapy cycles, were collected. Data analysis was performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, v23; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY). Group comparisons were conducted using independent t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with a p-value ≤0.05 considered statistically significant. Results The mean age of the patients was 52.7±12.5 years, with 114 (6.0%) females. The most common malignancy was breast carcinoma, seen in 74 (49.3%) patients, followed by hematological malignancies (21, 14.0%) and periampullary cancer (17, 11.3%). Metastatic disease was reported in 42 patients (28.0%), with 24 (10.0%) having bone metastasis. Seventy-four (49.4%) had received three to four injectable chemotherapy cycles, whereas 62 (41.3%) had received ≥5 injectable chemotherapy cycles at the time of assessment. Age was notably linked to multiple domains of EORTC QLQ-C30, including physical functioning (p=0.017), social functioning (p=0.006), nausea/vomiting (p=0.029), appetite loss (p=0.035), constipation (p=0.040), and financial difficulties (p=0.045). The presence of metastasis significantly affected physical functioning (p=0.037), fatigue (p=0.025), pain (p=0.019), and financial difficulties (p=0.022), while the type of cancer showed a significant association with diarrhea scores (p=0.015). No significant association of gender and number of chemotherapy cycles was seen with QoL parameters. Conclusion This study highlights that health-related QoL in chemotherapy patients was significantly influenced by age, presence of metastasis, and type of cancer. These findings underscore the importance of individualized supportive care strategies, particularly for older patients and those with advanced disease, to improve their overall well-being.",

        "abstract": "Enteric virus infections around time of weaning have always been related to pig diseases such as postweaning diarrhea. Little, however, is known about the virus infection pattern (species, timing and viral load) in clinically healthy pigs. Virus infections may help to train and shape the immune system and presumably only lead to clinical disease when uncontrolled. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a relatively new technique that can uncover the composition of the enteric virome. This study describes the dynamics of the enteric virome in clinically healthy pigs using NGS and qPCR until 10 weeks of age. Seven farms were selected based on the following criteria: diarrhea after weaning was visible in less than 5% of the pens, piglets reached 25 kg of body weight before 10 weeks of age and no antimicrobial batch treatment had been used on the farm for the last six months. Rectal swabs were taken in five different age groups: 2, 3.5, 5, 7 and 10 weeks of age, 10 piglets per age group, in a cross-sectional setup. Two NGS platforms were used to detect enteric viruses. Eleven virus-specific qPCRs were used to corroborate the results of the NGS analyses. Rotavirus A, Porcine Kobuvirus, Enterovirus G and Porcine Astrovirus 3 and 4 were first detected at two weeks of age, followed by detection of Porcine Astrovirus 5 at 3.5 weeks of age, just before weaning. One week after weaning, at 5 weeks of age, Porcine Astrovirus 3 was undetectable, but now Porcine Astrovirus 1 and 2 had successively made their entry. Although Rotavirus B & C, Porcine Sapelovirus and Porcine Sapovirus were already detected just before weaning, the amount of virus peaked one week after weaning. Rotavirus H was first detected one week after weaning and peaked at 7 weeks of age. Many viruses were cleared by the age of 10 weeks. The timing and magnitude of subclinical enteric virus infections across farms were remarkably similar. Our study offers insight into the dynamics of enteric virome development in healthy pigs and provides essential context to NGS-based diagnostics.",

ICU nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in ENAD management significantly influence patient outcomes. We evaluated ICU nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in ENAD management and explored their interrelationships using a social cognitive and behavior change framework. From June 2022 to March 2023, 371 ICU nurses from 11 Chinese ICUs completed a validated questionnaire. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics, regression, and structural equation modeling. Knowledge (mean = 63.57, SD = 15.04), attitudes (mean = 44.19, SD = 4.76), and behaviors (mean = 56.32, SD = 9.15) were moderate. Knowledge was positively correlated with attitudes (ρ = 0.42, p < 0.001) and behaviors (ρ = 0.58, p < 0.001), and attitudes strongly correlated with behaviors (ρ = 0.65, p < 0.001). Attitudes mediated the knowledge-behavior relationship (β = 0.14, 95% CI [0.08, 0.21], p < 0.001). Master's Degree (β = 0.10, p = 0.049), training participation (β = 0.18, p = 0.002), and frequent training (4 times/year, β = 0.22, p < 0.001) predicted better knowledge, while training and age (31-35 years) enhanced attitudes (p < 0.05). Knowledge gaps hinder ICU nurses' ENAD management, with attitudes critically mediating the translation of knowledge into practice. Targeted interventions, such as quarterly workshops and scenario-based simulations, are recommended to enhance knowledge, foster positive attitudes, and standardize behaviors, thereby improving patient care quality.",

        "title": "Nutrition Interventions in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal Symptoms during Cancer Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
        "abstract": "Modern cancer therapy is effective at reducing tumor burden and extending lifespan. However, cancer therapy also induces various gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that are dose-limiting, reduce quality of life, and potentially lead to treatment failure. Standard medical nutrition therapy for patients undergoing cancer treatment focuses on preventing weight loss and malnutrition but not reducing GI symptoms. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess efficacy of nutrition therapy to reduce GI side-effects during cancer treatment via systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search was conducted in Scopus and PubMed databases. A meta-analysis was performed on articles meeting inclusion criteria to estimate the pooled effect size on GI symptoms, separated by nutrition intervention type (nutrient supplementation, oral nutrition supplement, or dietary counseling). Further Subgroup analyses were conducted based on cancer type, cancer therapy, and nutrient intervention. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata/MP version 17.0 using 2-sided tests with p < 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance. 15,556 articles were captured by the search algorithm, and 139 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Articles reported 12 different GI symptoms, resulting in 151 total meta-analyses across symptom, cancer treatment, and nutrition intervention subtypes. Meta analyses indicated that collectively (all interventions combined), nutrient supplementation reduced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea incidence (all p < 0.001). Oral nutrition supplements had no effects on GI symptoms (all p > 0.05). Dietary counseling reduced constipation and diarrhea incidence. While 9 individual nutrient supplementation interventions reduced 8 symptoms, probiotic supplementation had some of the strongest effects on abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea incidence. This meta-analysis supports implementation of specific medical nutrition therapies to treat GI symptoms during cancer therapy and identifies those requiring additional investigation. Given the large variation in responses within and across studies, future experiments should explore personalized nutrition-based strategies to optimize treatment efficacy.

        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute, highly contagious intestinal disease caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which has devastating effects on the global swine industry. Currently, no effective therapeutic agents have been identified for treating PEDV infections. <i>Saxifraga stolonifera</i> (<i>S. stolonifera</i>), valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, remains poorly studied regarding its efficacy against PEDV. This study demonstrated the dose-dependent inhibition of PEDV nucleocapsid expression by <i>S. stolonifera in vitro</i>. <i>S. stolonifera</i> strongly inhibited the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using the network pharmacology, key components such as gallic acid, quercetin, coumarin, and caffeic acid were identified. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that <i>S. stolonifera</i> mainly targeted pathways including p53, MAPK, and TNF to exert anti-PEDV effects. <i>S. stolonifera</i> treatment disrupted the interaction of PEDV N protein and p53. It also modulated the p53-DREAM signaling pathway by reducing p53 and p21 protein levels, while enhancing p130 (Ser672) phosphorylation, E2F4, and Cyclin A protein expression levels. Molecular docking revealed stable hydrogen bonding between the seven core components and the PEDV N protein, with quercetin exhibiting the lowest binding energy. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that quercetin and other components share conserved binding sites with the PEDV N protein. These findings underscore the potential of <i>S. stolonifera</i> as a natural antiviral agent against PEDV infection.",

        "title": "The Efficacy of Pelvic Floor Therapy in Enhancing Muscular Function and Providing Colorectal Symptom Relief: A Case Report.",
        "abstract": "The pelvic bowl is lined by a network of muscles that provide structural organ support and assist with bodily functions. Like other muscles of the human body, pelvic floor muscles may hold tension or exhibit diminished or excessive tone due to various causative factors. This deviation is comprehensively referred to as Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD). Approximately one in five individuals in the United States will experience some manifestation of symptomatic Pelvic Floor Dysfunction. Furthermore, an estimated 10% of female-bodied patients in the United States will undergo surgery for PFD symptoms such as incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, or both, with 30% of this subgroup undergoing multiple surgeries. These statistics underscore the substantial burden of PFD imposed on individuals within the United States and highlight the importance of exploring less invasive treatments, such as Pelvic Floor Therapy (PFT), which aim to address muscular dysfunction without the risks associated with surgical intervention. In July 2023, a 47-year-old female presented to the NUNM Clinic for a pelvic floor consultation for a 1.5-year history of episodic fecal incontinence, fecal urgency, and diarrhea with previous work-up yielding unremarkable results. Pelvic floor muscular assessment was conducted via digital intravaginal palpation and graded utilizing the Modified Oxford Scale. During this physical examination,markedly hypotonic pelvic floor muscles were identified as well as several areas that were tender to palpation. Subsequent pelvic floor therapy (PFT) sessions and at-home Kegel and core exercises were initiated. The PFT sessions were held weekly for 3 visits, and biweekly for the following 2 months. By the end of the first month of treatment, the patient exhibited noteworthy improvements in muscle tone andstrength as graded by a Modified Oxford Scale. She also demonstrated enhanced voluntary control of initating, holding, and releasing contractions. The patient reported no episodesof fecal incontinence after the third PFT session. These improvements remained consistent throughout the 2 month follow-up period during which PFT continued on a biweekly basisAt a follow up visit 3 months later, the patient reported no episodes of fecal incontinence since last PFT session. This case highlights the pivotal role of PFT in improving hypotonic pelvic floor musculature and associated symptoms. The patient's marked improvements suggest that conservative management with targeted PFT and guided exercises can offer a valuable alternative or adjunct to surgical intervention for PFD, not only for fecal incontinence but also for other symptoms that result from a hypotonic pelvic floor including, but not limited to, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and pelvic pain. This case study has limitations including the absence of a control group and limited long-term follow-up data, which restricts the ability of the findings to be generalized. Future research should involve larger patient cohorts, RCTs, and extended monitoring in order to further validate the efficacy of PFT for managing symptoms caused by imbalanced pelvic floor musculature. Additionally, investigation into standard assessment protocols and optimal treatment timing is essential in order to establish best practice guidelines.",

        "title": "Long-term effects of ustekinumab in children with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody used in adults, is increasingly employed in children and adolescents with refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review aimed to analyze its long-term efficacy and safety in the pediatric population. To this end, a systematic review was registered under PROSPERO (CRD42024555896). Articles indexed in PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to May 30, 2024, were screened. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. From 563 articles, 11 observational studies were included, analyzing 444 pediatric IBD patients. Remission rates varied: 47% at Week 16, 57%-59% at Week 26, and 40%-64% at Week 52. In addition, clinical improvements included better Z-scores, body mass index, reduced inflammation, and healing of mucosal and perianal disease. Five studies standardized doses by weight: 260 mg (<55 kg), 390 mg (55-85 kg), and 520 mg (>85 kg), with maintenance doses typically 90 mg every 8-12 weeks. Some patients received concomitant therapies (e.g., methotrexate, corticosteroids, and 5-aminosalicylic acid). While adverse effects were reported, including worsening psoriasis, cutaneous and neurological reactions, infections, elevated transaminases, and lymphopenia. Severe adverse events were rare, though anaphylaxis and one death from acute diarrhea were reported. Overall, ustekinumab shows promising clinical and laboratory outcomes in pediatric IBD. However, long-term studies are essential to solidify evidence regarding remission rates and adverse effects.",
