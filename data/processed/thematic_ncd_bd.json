        "abstract": "Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan. UPF consumption varied across South Asia by sociodemographic factors including age, gender, and education. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial when designing interventions aimed at reducing UPF consumption. Our findings of regional variations in the types of UPFs consumed provide valuable insights for targeted interventions. The South Asia Biobank is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",

        "abstract": "Current strategies to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes focus primary prevention in high-risk groups and secondary prevention in people with known cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine the proportion of events occurring in lower-risk groups globally. We included people aged 40 years to younger than 75 years who were enrolled in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which is an ongoing, international, prospective, population-based cohort study that started recruiting adults from households selected to be broadly representative of the sociodemographic composition of their communities. We prospectively documented fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or any other fatal cardiovascular event stratified by history of cardiovascular disease and by the 10-year predicted disease risk scores based on WHO 2019 laboratory risk tables (<10% [low], 10% to <20% [intermediate], and ≥20% [high]) in people without previous cardiovascular disease from 26 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Outcome event rates were standardised for the cohort's age and sex distribution. Between July 11, 2000, and May 6, 2019, 128 973 participants were included from 26 countries (mean age 53·6 years [SD 8·2]; 75 858 [58·8%] were female and 53 115 [41·2%] were male). We observed 11 483 outcome events affecting 8·9% of the cohort during a median follow-up of 12·3 years (IQR 9·8-14·6). Among participants, 89 508 (69·4%) had a low cardiovascular disease risk, 22 363 (17·3%) had an intermediate cardiovascular disease risk, and 5529 (4·3%) had a high cardiovascular disease risk, while 11 573 (9·0%) had known cardiovascular disease. The age-standardised and sex-standardised cardiovascular disease incidence rates per 1000 person-years was 4·1 (95% CI 4·0-4·2) in the low-risk group, 17·7 (15·2-20·2) in the intermediate-risk group, and 40·8 (25·1-56·4) in the high-risk group. Overall, 41% of outcome events occurred in cardiovascular disease-naive participants at low risk. The proportion of adverse cardiovascular outcomes occurring in this low-risk group was inversely related to country income level (32% in high-income, 38% in middle-income, and 54% in low-income countries) and was higher in women (51%) than in men (32%). To achieve a substantial population-level reduction in cardiovascular disease, a fundamental change is needed, so that preventive strategies for cardiovascular disease extend beyond those at high or even intermediate predicted risk to include those at considered to be at low risk.

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), due to their chronic nature, lead to long-term and significant health burdens that result in catastrophic expenses for individuals and communities. This study explores the socioeconomic effects of catastrophic health costs on households with family members experiencing NCDs and their coping mechanisms in rural areas of Bangladesh. Qualitative study. Case studies were conducted with ten NCD patients who had experienced catastrophic events and their close contacts. Purposive sampling strategies were used to recruit participants from two sub-districts in areas with a high prevalence of NCDs. In-depth interviews and observations were conducted, and documents (e.g. hospital and diagnosis bills, medicine purchase receipts) were reviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Data revealed that the treatment costs of NCDs are multifaceted and long-term. This catastrophic health expenditure has many economic effects, such as compromising food, housing, living standards and quality of life. It also has non-economic effects, including social stigmatisation, adjusting wishes and dreams, hampering children's education, disrupting family relationships and undermining social dignity. Households' adaptive strategies include loaning and borrowing, selling assets, using savings, seeking assistance from friends and relatives, reconciling living standards and even adopting alternative medicines. Thisstudy highlights the socioeconomic impact of catastrophic health costs associated with NCDs and how households adapt and cope with these expenses. The results increase understanding of the impact of NCDs and the importance of managing the economic burden. Results highlight the necessity for a strategic plan to aid families affected by chronic NCDs.",

        "abstract": "Identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for dementia prevention, a global health concern. Depression is considered a risk factor for dementia, but the temporal dynamics across the life course remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess the relationship between the timing of depression assessment and risk of all-cause late-life dementia. We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis to assess incident dementia in individuals with non-current history of depression. PubMed and Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched from inception up to February 17, 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between depression and incident late-life dementia were included. From eligible reviews, we also extracted data from studies reporting dementia risk as hazard ratios (HRs), analysing the timing of depression measurement using random-effects models for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021249706. Of the 7763 records identified, nine reviews were eligible for inclusion of the umbrella review. One review was judged to be of moderate quality, while the others were either low (<i>n</i> = 3) or critically low (<i>n</i> = 5). For our meta-analyses, 18 studies reporting depression onset in later life (<i>n</i> = 901,762 participants, <i>n</i> = 7595 incident dementia cases) and seven studies on depression assessed during midlife (<i>n</i> ≥ 2,501,269 participants, <i>n</i> ≥ 276,929 incident dementia cases) were included. All studies in the meta-analyses were deemed to be of good quality, with no strong evidence of publication bias. Pooled HRs indicated depression present in late-life (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68-2.26; <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 77.5%) and midlife (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12-2.18; <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 97.5%) significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia. The findings suggest that depression across the life course may increase dementia risk; however, substantial heterogeneity and review quality should be considered when interpreting the strength of this evidence. A life course approach to the treatment and prevention of depression may help reduce the burden of dementia, but this will require scaling up access to effective mental health care for vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to clarify if the stronger late-life association reflects depression as an immediate risk factor or an early manifestation of neurodegenerative processes.

        "abstract": "The high burden of blood pressure-related cardiovascular diseases in Bangladesh is potentially caused by excessive dietary sodium and insufficient potassium intake. Our objective is to estimate dietary salt and potassium intake among Bangladesh rural and urban adults from urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. We conducted a cross-sectional study between December 2017 and June 2018, including participants aged 30-59 years from three urban and three rural sites in Bangladesh. Data included urinary excretion of sodium and potassium estimated from one 24-hr urine collection and blood pressure measurements. Among 840 enrolled participants, complete data was available in 509 individuals. Mean age was 43.0 (SD ±7.9) years; 20.9% had hypertension, 50.9% were women, and 50.9% resided in urban areas. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 118.6 (SD ± 16.6) mmHg and 76.3 (SD ± 11.3) mmHg, respectively. Overall, the mean urinary sodium excretion was 3.9 g/day (95% CI = 3.8 to 4.0), corresponding to a mean salt intake of 9.7 g/day (95% CI = 9.4-10.1). Mean urinary potassium excretion was 1.4 g/day (95% CI = 1.3-1.4), corresponding to an estimated mean dietary potassium intake of 2.0 g/day. Men and urban residents had slightly but non-significantly higher sodium and potassium excretion than women and rural residents. In Bangladesh, salt intake exceeded WHO's recommended <5g/day limit, while potassium intake was substantially lower than the recommended intake of ≥ 3.5g/day for adults. Promoting low-sodium and potassium-rich diets through nationwide campaigns and policies, including advocating for accessible low-sodium and potassium-enriched salt substitutes, is recommended to mitigate cardiovascular disease risks.",

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

        "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 60% of annual global deaths, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

        "title": "Does raising tobacco taxes reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases? A panel data analysis of 152 countries.",
        "abstract": "Globally, about 74% of deaths are attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Tobacco use is one of the key risk factors of NCDs. Tobacco taxes can discourage the use of tobacco. However, how increasing tobacco taxation may reduce the burden of NCDs is not well studied. This study examines whether higher cigarette taxes are associated with reduced premature deaths-death before the age of 70-from NCDs using multicountry panel data. The study analysed country-level panel data of 152 countries from 2008 to 2020 collected from various sources. The annual burden of NCDs was measured by the proportion of deaths due to NCDs before age 70 in each country. The tax rate on cigarettes-both specific and total-was used as a key explanatory variable. Other covariates include MPOWER score net of taxes, tobacco prevalence and other country-level characteristics. Panel data regressions with various combinations of country and year fixed effects were used to estimate the association between tobacco taxation and the burden of NCDs. Cigarette tax was significantly (p<0.05) associated with the burden of NCDs, with an increase in tobacco tax as a per cent of retail price from the current average 47%-75% being associated with a 2-percentage point decrease in the proportion of deaths due to NCDs before age 70 years. A Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations confirmed the robustness of this effect, estimating an average reduction of 1.09 percentage points (95% uncertainty interval: -1.76 to -0.42, i.e. reduction by 0.42 to 1.76 percentage points) in premature NCD mortality. Access to healthcare, obesity, and clean fuel and cooking technology were also found to be associated with the burden of NCDs. The results are robust to various model specifications. The study provides important evidence that increasing tobacco taxation could be an effective tool in reducing the burden of NCDs. Countries aiming to curb the burden of NCDs could consider raising tobacco taxes.",

        "abstract": "Meta-analysis of trials of multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) compared with iron-folic acid (IFA) suggests an overall benefit of 12% on low birth weight (LBW). Building on prior work showing that MMS is more effective in anemic and higher body mass index females; this paper explores whether dietary quality modifies the effect of MMS on birth weight. A 7-d food frequency questionnaire was administered in late pregnancy to 19,160 pregnant participants in the JiVitA-3 cluster-randomized controlled trial of MMS compared with IFA supplementation in Bangladesh. A 10-item dietary diversity score (DDS) was created by summing the number of food groups consumed ≥4 times/wk. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of MMS compared with IFA on LBW were estimated by DDS. The interaction between DDS and MMS was tested using a generalized estimating equations log-binomial regression model to account for the cluster randomization. Point estimates and 95% CI for the effect of MMS on LBW were estimated at each DDS. Models were adjusted for confounders. We used P < 0.1 to determine the statistical significance of the interaction. The median DDS was 3 (interquartile range: 2, 4), and 18.6% of PW had a score ≥ 5. The fully adjusted protective effect of MMS on LBW was inversely associated with dietary diversity [MMS×DDS RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.04), P-interaction = 0.05]. The effect was greatest at the lowest DDS [DDS= 1, RR LBW: 0.86 (0.81, 0.91)] and decreased at higher scores [DDS = 7, RR: 0.92 (0.84, 1.00)]. In rural Bangladesh, where maternal dietary diversity was generally low, MMS (compared with IFA) supplementation had the strongest effect on reducing low birth weight among pregnant females with the least diverse diet, possibly reflecting the additional benefit of supplementation in this vulnerable group.

Older age and obesity notably increased significantly (p < 0.05) the odds of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, while urban residence increased the odds of diabetes. Several factors, mostly age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category are responsible for higher prevalence of NCD diseases.

Accurate etiological diagnosis is essential. This study used postmortem diagnostics to investigate the contribution of diarrhea to under-5 mortality and examine co-morbidities and co-infections in Africa and South Asia. Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) generates data on child deaths through minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical record review, and verbal autopsies. Multidisciplinary panels assign cause(s) of death using WHO International Classification of Diseases. This analysis included deaths among children aged 1-59 months enrolled from 18 December 2016-31 December 2023 across six African sites (Ethiopia, Mali, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Africa) and Bangladesh. Of 1517 deaths assessed, diarrhea was in the causal pathway in 240 (15.8%). The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%). No pathogen was identified in 49.6% (119/240) of diarrhea-related deaths; among these, diarrhea was underlying cause in 42.9%. Among the 121 pathogen-attributed deaths, the most frequent were EAEC (34.7%), typical EPEC (15.7%), Shigella/EIEC (14.0%), ST-ETEC (12.4%), rotavirus (26.4%), and adenovirus (non-40/41: 19.0%; 40/41: 5.0%).

This paper explores the differences in hypertension by sex and age among the Bangladeshi adult population throughout their life span. We conducted the secondary analysis using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. This nationally representative survey involved a two-stage stratified sample of 675 households in urban (250) and rural (425) enumeration areas (EAs). The analytical sample comprised 12 476 individuals aged 18 or older (6955 women and 5521 men). We performed univariate and bivariate tests to investigate variations in hypertension across sex, age, and other factors. We applied multivariable logistic regression models and logit-based marginal probabilities to explore age and sex differences as well as their interactions in hypertension while estimating the marginal effects of sex for each age group to assess the significance of sex differentials in hypertension throughout the life course. Our study revealed a noteworthy trend: Women have a hypertension prevalence that is five percentage points lower than that of men in their early twenties. However, this trend reverses in their early thirties, with women exhibiting a five-percentage point higher prevalence than men. After adjusting for confounders and age-sex interactions in women, the odds of hypertension were significantly higher (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-6.6) in the 35-39-year-old age group, which may contribute to a combined burden of chronic and reproductive morbidity. With rising hypertension and stagnant maternal health in Bangladesh, women of reproductive age face higher risks of chronic and reproductive complications. The complex health system in Bangladesh, which starts at the community level, primarily focuses on maternal and child health; however, some recent initiatives show a shift in focus to address significant non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through public health facilities. Considering that more women seek health care from public facilities, recognising common factors contributing to early hypertension in Bangladeshi women enables targeted interventions, model testing, and strategic adjustments to the primary health care-focused national non-communicable disease management pathway.",

        "title": "Re-Striking the Indications in the Improvement of Avoidable Caesarian Section: A Cluster Randomized Control Trial.",
        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) are effective in addressing undernutrition and improving child development. As momentum builds to scale up SQ-LNS for children aged 6-24 months in the Global South, a key concern is achieving equity in its distribution and outcomes. We performed equity analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials in nine countries (N=37,707 children) to assess SQ-LNS effects on child growth, development, and anemia across levels of an international wealth index. Benefits of SQ-LNS were consistent across the wealth spectrum, leading to similar improvements in child growth, development, and anemia regardless of wealth. However, such equal benefits of SQ-LNS did not erase large inequities in child growth and development between the poorest and wealthier households.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses through effective pain management with opioids. Despite its global importance, opioid use in palliative care faces significant challenges, particularly in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, opioid use is notably low, with disparities between urban and rural areas. Cultural stigmas, strict regulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training further obstruct effective pain management. This study aims to explore the challenges healthcare providers face regarding opioid use in both hospital and home-based palliative care settings. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using face-to-face semistructured interviews with 135 licensed healthcare providers from August to September 2022. The respondents, predominantly young (57% aged 20-39) and female (68.9%), primarily manage late-stage cancer patients (98.5%), with pain (100%) being the primary symptom treated. Morphine syrup is commonly used (68.1%), whereas oxycodone and buprenorphine are unavailable. Side effects such as deep sedation (43.7%) and addiction (34.1%) highlight the need for careful monitoring. Limited awareness (10.4%) of national opioid policies results in inconsistent practices (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Prescribing restrictions (60.7%) and dispensing rights issues contribute to operational challenges, affecting patient access to pain management. Misconceptions about palliative care (32.6%) and inter-departmental non-cooperation (38.5%) hinder patient referrals (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and continuity of care. Inconsistent awareness of opioid policies causes varied practices and attitudes. Addressing referral challenges and prescribing restrictions requires interdisciplinary solutions, enhanced education, better policy dissemination, and standardized guidelines for effective palliative care opioid management.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to explore the knowledge and attitudes regarding seafood safety and consumption, along with preferences and environmental issues in coastal Bangladesh. A cross-sectional, consumer-based survey was conducted in Bangladesh from September to November 2023, targeting 1100 participants aged 18 years and older across seven coastal districts. Convenience sampling and in-person interviews were used for the data collection. The average knowledge and attitude scores toward seafood safety and consumption were 48.2% and 63.5%, respectively. Several factors influenced seafood safety and consumption knowledge, including age, education level, family size, religion, and residence in coastal areas (all P < 0.05). In contrast, attitudes toward seafood safety and consumption were shaped by education level, family size, employment status, seafood allergies, and history of seafood poisoning (all P < 0.05). The most commonly consumed seafood was rupchanda, followed by shrimp. Most participants consumed seafood for its health benefits, with no significant seasonal impact on seafood consumption. Overfishing and climate change were recognised as the most alarming environmental dangers identified by the participants. Coastal communities in Bangladesh have demonstrated moderate attitudes, but relatively low knowledge of seafood safety and consumption. Targeted educational programmes, including community workshops on safe handling and storage, school-based programmes on marine conservation, and digital campaigns via SMS/social media, are needed to improve seafood safety knowledge, while promoting sustainable consumption practices is crucial for addressing environmental concerns like overfishing. Additionally, improving market accessibility and highlighting the health advantages of seafood can drive more informed and healthier consumption choices.",

        "abstract": "The built environment around schools that are regularly accessed by young people is determined by governments, national and regional policies in each country or region. Zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol sales are expected to restrict availability and access by young people. This study aimed to examine (non) compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations around schools in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a representative sample of geographic locations in Bangladesh, India North (Delhi) and India South (Chennai), Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the built environment was mapped by systematically walking all streets within the site boundary to collect data on different types of tobacco and alcohol retailers and schools. Data was collected on KoboToolBox, and the maps indicating zoning compliance were created using ArcGIS. Descriptive analysis of outlet compliance to the zoning laws was conducted at the national and school levels, with heterogeneity analyses done by school type, income level and outlet type for tobacco and alcohol. The zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol differed among the settings ranging from 50 to 100 m for tobacco and absolute bans to 500 m for on-premise alcohol. Among the five different settings within the four countries, 441 areas were studied, including 3615 schools. Non-compliance with the zoning laws is evident in all jurisdictions for both tobacco and alcohol. Within restricted zones around schools (location non-compliant with zoning laws), 12-38% of outlets selling tobacco and 16% to 100% of outlets selling alcohol were identified. For supply non-compliance, 3-70% of shops within the school buffer zones were selling tobacco, while only 0.2-1% of shops were selling alcohol. Non-compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations has been observed around schools in Bangladesh, India (North and South), Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Within each country, there was a higher percentage of alcohol outlets that were location non-compliant than for tobacco, except for South India. In India and Sri Lanka, there was a higher percentage of supply non-compliance for tobacco than alcohol. This study calls for governments to strictly enforce existing zoning regulations that are expected to restrict access to tobacco and alcohol for young people.",

        "abstract": "Poor diets are associated with all forms of malnutrition and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Data on dietary patterns are scarce in South Asia. We sought to describe overall diet quality and intake of foods and food groups at different eating occasions among adults in rural South Asia. We collected cross-sectional data from 5 districts across Bangladesh (n = 2802 individuals), India (n = 1672), and Nepal (n = 1451). The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) application was used to measure food intake on the previous day, with each food tagged to an eating occasion. Diet quality and risk of dietary inadequacy and diet-related NCDs were assessed using GDQS total (0-49 points), GDQS positive (0-32), and GDQS negative (0-17) metrics for overall, healthy, and unhealthy food group intake, respectively. Diet quality was low, with similar scores across countries for GDQS total (17-19), GDQS positive (7-8), and GDQS negative (10-12). Over 90% of adults had levels of GDQS scores associated with moderate/high risk of nutrient inadequacy and diet-related NCDs, with the proportion at high risk in Bangladesh being 2-3× higher than that in other countries. One-third of adults skipped breakfast in Nepal, and snacking was twice as common in males (63%) vs females (33%) in Bangladesh. Lower GDQS total scores (worse diets) were associated with female gender and lower household wealth but not with household production of crops or livestock. These findings may help inform interventions to improve diets in South Asia, focusing on increasing intake of healthy fresh foods, while limiting intake of processed foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat.",

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "abstract": "Predator-prey models in ecology typically focus on direct predation without considering other interactions, such as hunting behaviors on qualitative impact and numerous diseases, which has led researchers to explore the intersection of ecology and mathematics, resulting in the development of mathematical models. This paper introduces a novel eco-epidemiological model that integrates the dynamics of infectious diseases within predator-prey interactions, factoring in direct predation, the roles of infected prey, and the influence of behavioral dynamics. By utilizing evolutionary game theory, this study explores the effects of cooperation and non-cooperation strategies on disease spread and population stability. Numerical simulations reveal that disease transmission rates and the Allee effect significantly impact population stability. Low transmission rates favor stability, while higher rates provoke periodic oscillations that can destabilize the population. The associated controlling cost reduces the risk of infection in prey populations, affecting the predator population. Moreover, the Allee effect exacerbates prey vulnerability, increasing the risk of predator extinction unless disease transmission is curtailed. Findings underscore the importance of considering behavioral dynamics and epidemic factors in conserving species and managing infectious diseases, offering valuable insights into the complex interactions that govern ecosystem health and stability.",

Previous studies investigating healthcare utilization by the patients with NCDs lack nationally representative data. The present study examined healthcare utilization and factors associated with utilizing different types of health facilities (public/private/medicine shop /others/multiple providers). This study further tried to find out the linkage between utilizing different types of health facilities and the receipt of at least one lifestyle behaviour or more, and patient-related medication non-adherence. We analysed nationally representative cross-sectional STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPS) Survey 2018 in Bangladesh. Following Andersen's conceptual framework and applying multinomial logistic regression, we examined multiple types of healthcare utilization to estimate and identify predictors associated with the types of healthcare facilities accessed. Further relationships with the receipt of at least one lifestyle behaviour or more, and patient-related medication non-adherence were investigated using binary logistic regression. The majority of the participants used private facilities (41.0%) for curative care. For accessing medicine for NCDs, participants mostly used medicine shop (81.2%). In the fully adjusted model comparing public facilities vs. medicine shop respondents with no formal education (vs. university education or higher) were more likely to use medicine shop (adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR):3.9; confidence interval (CI):1.1,13.5). While comparing public facilities vs. other healthcare options (village doctor, alternative medicine practitioner (Homeo, Ayurveda, Unani) and traditional healer), respondents from rural area (vs. urban) more likely to utilize other healthcare options (aRRR: 3.5; CI: 1.8,6.8). The study findings are crucial for Bangladesh's ongoing effort to strengthen NCDs care. Further elucidation of the factors influencing the decision between types of health facility use could be provided by future mixed-method studies.",

More than half of the students were involved in low physical activity ( < 600 metabolic equivalent tasks [MET] minutes/week). Insufficient fruit and vegetable intake (< 5 servings daily) was more prevalent (80%) among the respondents. Approximately two-fifty of the participants were overweight/obese (Body mass index [BMI] ≥ 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The prevalence of elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, and raised cholesterol was 24.1%, 8%, and 10.2%, respectively.

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "title": "Prevalence of prehypertension and undiagnosed hypertension among urban bankers of Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Bankers live a sedentary and highly stressful life that often leads to developing noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, diabetes, mental disorders, etc. The study aims to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and prehypertension among urban bankers in Bangladesh. Data from 365 bankers from five public and private banks in Bangladesh were collected using a pretested semistructured questionnaire. The Seventh Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC 7) guideline was followed to define prehypertension and undiagnosed hypertension. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to investigate the associated factors. The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and prehypertension were 22.5% and 55.3%, respectively. Most of the bankers were males and 35-44 years of age. The risk of hypertension and prehypertension was significantly higher among males (Odds ratio [OR], 16.6; OR, 6.4), longer service duration (F, 3.6), prolonged working hours (OR, 3.8; OR, 3.1), smoking (OR, 6.2; OR, 3.4), overweight (OR, 6.8; OR, 2.4) and obese (OR, 8.9; OR, 3.4) bankers, respectively. After controlling for confounders, the predictors of hypertension were males (Adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 12.8; 95%CI, 2.7-60), current smokers (aOR, 2.9; 95%CI, 1-8), overweight (aOR, 5.1; 95%CI, 1.5-17.9), and obesity (aOR, 9.6; 95%CI, 2.4-38.2). For prehypertension, males (aOR, 9.7; 95%CI, 3.1-30.9) and obesity (aOR, 3.9; 95%CI, 1.5-10.3) were found as predictors. More than three-fourths of bankers in Bangladesh have either prehypertension or undiagnosed hypertension. Although this study included only urban banks, a large-scale study is recommended to understand the overall NCD risk factors burden among this professional group- bankers in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Soybean and palm oils are widely consumed in Bangladesh. The study aimed to investigate the levels of heavy metals and estimate their health risks in nationally representative samples of branded and unbranded soybean and palm oils sold in retail stores in Bangladesh. A total of 1,521 soybean and palm oil samples were collected from eight administrative divisions. National composites of branded oil were prepared by combining at least 12 samples for each brand. In the case of unbranded oil, composites were prepared for each administrative division. A total of 44 composite samples, including 23 soybean oil samples (19 branded and 4 unbranded) and 21 palm oil samples (13 branded and 8 unbranded), were tested. Twenty-five individual samples (11 crude and 14 refined) collected from the refineries were also analyzed to trace the origin of the heavy metals. Market samples were analyzed for arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb) and only mercury (Hg) in both market and refinery samples using various atomic absorption spectrophotometric techniques. The possible adverse health effects of exposure to heavy metals content in edible oil were estimated using the tools of daily exposure ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow> <mrow> <msub><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow> <mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mrow> </math> ) and noncarcinogenic risk assessment hazard quotient (HQ).

The differences in heavy metal contents between branded and unbranded oils were not statistically significant.

The present study evaluated the level of heavy metal contamination in soybean and palm oils and conducted risk assessments associated with their consumption in Bangladesh. It appears that the source of this contamination is the imported crude oil.

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundAppropriate infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices, including early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF), are necessary for the optimal development of children and the reduction of child mortality and morbidity. There is a paucity of IYCF data from the ultra-poor children living in the slums of Bangladesh.AimTo explore IYCF practices in slums in Bangladesh and identify factors associated with EIBF.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study and interviewed 682 ultra-poor mothers with 0-23-months-old children living in the slums of Dhaka and Saidpur. The interview questionnaire (adapted from Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey and World Health Organization tools) included sociodemographic, dietary, and healthcare utilization variables. We conducted a descriptive analysis to report the prevalence of IYCF practices. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with EIBF.ResultsAbout 99.3% of children were ever breastfed; 89.4% of women breastfed their newborns within an hour; 63.5% of 0-5-months-old children were exclusively breastfed; 78.2% of mothers fed their 6-8-months-olds solid, semisolid, or soft foods; and 34.2% of 0-23-months-olds were bottle fed. Secondary or higher maternal education (≥grade 6) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.59, <i>p</i> = 0.001), previous history of two or more live births (aOR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.38-4.61, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and cesarean delivery (aOR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.18-0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.002) were significantly associated with EIBF.ConclusionIn the urban slums of Bangladesh, exclusive breastfeeding needs further improvement, and bottle feeding needs to be reduced. Moreover, special attention should be provided to the children delivered through C-sections as they are at greater risk of late initiation of breastfeeding.",

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021, we estimated age-standardized incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs for four major NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases from 2010 to 2021. Gender and age-specific estimations were conducted across all NCDs, with 95% uncertainty intervals and a decomposition analysis was employed to estimate change in death and DALYs attributable to NCDs. The burden of NCDs in South Asia increased by 3.00% in incidence from 2010 to 2021, while overall prevalence decreased by 1.00%, yet the age-standardized prevalence rate remains above the global rate (91,570 per 100,000 population). Incidences of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases declined by 3.00% and 13.00%, respectively, whereas diabetes and cancer rose by 21.00% and 13.00% in South Asia. Nepal faced the highest environmental impact (23.4% of DALYs), Bangladesh the greatest metabolic impact (25.62%), and India the highest from behavioural factors (23.95%). Population growth and aging were primary drivers of changes in deaths and DALYs across the region. This finding emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions addressing environmental, metabolic, and behavioral risks for NCDs in South Asia, alongside strategies to support healthy aging and effective disease management across diverse demographic groups.",

However, there has been limited focus on identifying essential data science skills for health researchers, gaps in capacity building provision, barriers to access, and potential solutions. This review aims to identify essential data science skills for health researchers and key stakeholders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as well as to explore gaps and barriers in data science capacity building and share potential solutions, including any regional variations. An online survey was conducted in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, gathering both quantitative and qualitative responses. Descriptive analysis was performed in R V4.3, and a thematic workshop approach facilitated qualitative analysis. From 262 responses from individuals across 54 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), representing various institutions and roles, we summarised essential data science skills globally and by region. Thematic analysis revealed key gaps and barriers in capacity building, including limited training resources, lack of mentoring, challenges with data quality, infrastructure and privacy issues, and the absence of a conducive research environment. Respondents' consensus on essential data science skills suggests the need for a standardised framework for capacity building, adaptable to regional contexts. Greater investment, coupled with expanded collaboration and networking, would help address gaps and barriers, fostering a robust data science ecosystem and advancing insights into global health challenges.",

It is a growing public health issue worldwide, predominantly in low-resource countries like Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of multimorbidity among the adult population in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 504 respondents who were 18 years or older. The generalised linear mixed model was used to identify the risk factors. Among the respondents, 65.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.0 to 69.3) had multimorbidity. The most common chronic conditions were allergic disorder (34%, 95% CI: 30 to 39), gastritis (31%, 95% CI: 27 to 35), low back pain (28.4%, 95% CI: 24.6 to 32.5), oral diseases (27%, 95% CI: 23 to 29) and arthritis (21%, 95% CI: 18 to 25). Middle-aged adults (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.97; 95% CI: 3.35 to 18.92) and older adults (AOR = 8.44; 95% CI: 1.90 to 36.64) had significantly higher odds of multimorbidity than young adults. Employed respondents had an 86% (AOR = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.36) lower odds of multimorbidity than non-working individuals. Higher sleeping duration (6 to 8 h: AOR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.80; 8 to 10 h: AOR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.60), regular vegetable consumption (AOR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.80) and adequate water intake (AOR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.79) were protective factors against multimorbidity, whereas obesity increased the odds (AOR = 3.32; 95% CI: 1.06 to 10.43).

Addressing this data gap is crucial to understanding and improving the nutritional condition of the third-gender community. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate their nutritional status, dietary protein intake, lifestyle, social behavior, nutritional knowledge, and prevalence of diseases. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Fifty participants from the third-gender community were selected. Study subjects were individually interviewed through a structured questionnaire to gather specific data. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Logistic Regression, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Chi-square tests were carried out to measure the associations among the variables. The average age of the participants was 32.74 ± 9.30 years, with 26% lacking formal education and 72% engaged in money collection as a primary occupation. 36% earned less than BDT 5,000 monthly, with only 2% exceeding BDT 20,000. The mean height and mean body weights were 163 ± 5.21 cm and 60.64 ± 13.61 kg (mean ± SD) respectively. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.02 ± 5.04 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, among whom 14% were underweight, 56% were normal, 20% were overweight, and 10% were obese. 48% of the participants had poor nutritional knowledge, and 46% had average. 50% of the participants had smoking habits and 34% of the participants consumed alcohol. Nutritional intake was skewed towards plant proteins (72%), with inadequate access to healthcare reported by 56% of subjects. Two-thirds (66%) of the respondents had no illness, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affected 34% of participants, with diabetes (12%) and low pressure (8%) prevalent. Smoking significantly correlated with lower normal BMI (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07-0.84, p < 0.05). Unhealthy food intake was significantly associated with underweight risks (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.92, p < 0.05). When compared with male and female Bangladeshi populations, third-gender individuals had higher overweight prevalence, moderate normal BMI rates, and lower malnutrition than males. The research identified suboptimal nutritional status among the third-gender population in Bangladesh, highlighting higher rates of both obesity and underweight, as well as a prevalence of non-communicable diseases, particularly diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Declared as one of the ten most pressing threats to global health in 2019, the complexity around vaccine acceptance and hesitancy has once again gained great momentum following the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of vaccine acceptance may endanger the mission of improving vaccine uptake globally to tackle pandemics, reduce morbidity and mortality of preventable diseases and to prevent antibiotic resistance worldwide. Countries of the global south, including South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries are especially affected by the dangers of low vaccination uptake and continue to show decreases in coverage in recent years. This paper examines factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy in south Asia and the extent to which they are context and disease specific, guided by a modified version of the WHO SAGE 5 C model by Razai et al. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles by using a comprehensive search strategy. Results from 44 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies were included in the systematic review and appraised for quality, thematically analyzed and mapped onto the 5 C model. findings from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed vaccine hesitancy to be context and vaccine-specific within different settings of the countries. The main factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy can be identified as narrow confidence in vaccines, miscommunication, and lack of knowledge embedded into overarching constraints and contexts. To tackle vaccine hesitancy in SAARC countries, interventions need to be co-created by communities and mutual trust needs to be ensured, for instance through increased equity in knowledge distribution.",

        "abstract": "One of the most catastrophic non-communicable diseases in the world is type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). It results in financial loss, incapacity, and death. Fasting blood sugar is one of the diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes. Cholesterol is necessary for overall health but high cholesterol can be harmful leading to atherosclerotic disease. This study intended to determine the relationship between fasting plasma glucose and serum total cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Mymensingh locality. This cross-sectional analytical study was carried out in the department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh, from July 2023 to June 2024. A total 200 subjects age ranged from 30-65 years were selected and from them 100 were grouped as Control group, Group I (female without diabetes) and 100 were grouped as Study group, Group II (female with diabetes). The data were calculated and analyzed by using SPSS version 26. Laboratory analysis of fasting plasma glucose was done by GOD-POD method and serum total cholesterol by CHOD-POD method. Data were expressed in mean±SD and statistical significance of difference among the groups were calculated by unpaired Students 't' test. Correlation of serum total cholesterol with fasting plasma glucose was done by Pearson's correlation coefficient test. The mean value of fasting plasma glucose of control group and study group were 4.94±0.24 and 8.40±0.91 mmol/L respectively. The mean value of serum total cholesterol in control group and study group were 164.28±15.88 and 225.89±16.69 mg/dl respectively. In study group both values were significantly increased than control group. Fasting plasma glucose was positively correlated with serum total cholesterol. By this study we founded significant correlation of fasting serum glucose and serum total cholesterol in female with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

        "title": "Psycho-Spiritual Challenges Faced by Palliative Health Care Providers in Bangladesh: A Multicenter-Based Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Palliative care providers play a crucial role in supporting patients with life-limiting illnesses by emphasizing the alleviation of suffering and enhancing quality of life. The intrinsic nature of palliative care, which often involves confronting death and dying, places considerable emotional and spiritual demands on caregivers. Psycho-spirituality, an integration of psychological well-being and spiritual dimensions, is vital for these providers to maintain their mental health and provide holistic care to their patients. Despite its importance, empirical studies focusing on the psycho-spiritual experiences of palliative care providers are limited. This multicenter-based, descriptive cross-sectional study aims to explore the psycho-spiritual challenges faced by palliative care providers. Data was collected from 160 licensed healthcare providers, through face-to-face semi-structured interviews conducted from August to September 2022. The results indicate that younger healthcare providers (aged 20-39) report higher psychological stress compared to their older counterparts (<i>p</i> = 0.029). Males exhibited slightly higher stress levels than females (<i>p</i> = 0.036), and divorced individuals reported the highest stress levels (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Educational qualification (<i>p</i> = 0.017), and income levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001) showed significant correlations with spiritual status with higher educational attainment and income associated with better spiritual well-being. Doctors experienced higher psychological stress (<i>p</i> = 0.004) but also reported higher spiritual status compared to nurses and other healthcare workers. The findings depict significant associations between sociodemographic factors and the psychospiritual well-being of healthcare providers. Understanding these associations is crucial for developing targeted interventions to support the well-being of palliative care providers, ultimately leading to better patient care outcomes. Future research should focus on expanding the scope.",

Given the rising prevalence of DM and HTN and their significant public health burden, this research aims to identify key socioeconomic, demographic and lifestyle-related determinants to inform targeted interventions. The study used nationally representative cross-sectional data extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2017-2018. Bangladesh. The study included 8013 women and 6691 men aged 18 and older who were eligible for blood pressure and blood glucose measurements. Type 2 DM, HTN. HTN was significantly associated with higher odds of diabetes (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.28, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.43), while diabetes was associated with increased odds of HTN (AOR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.39). Individuals aged 40 years and older had 74.8% higher odds of diabetes (AOR=1.748, 95% CI: 1.58 to 1.993) and were 3.21 times more likely to have HTN (AOR=4.208, 95% CI: 3.781 to 4.685). Overweight individuals had 2.15 times higher odds of HTN compared with those with normal weight (AOR=2.154, 95% CI: 1.98 to 2.34). Wealthier individuals also showed significantly higher odds of both DM and HTN. This study highlights the strong association between DM and HTN and identifies age, overweight status and higher socioeconomic class as key risk factors. These findings underscore the need for integrated public health strategies targeting NCD prevention and management in Bangladesh.

        "title": "The rural food environment and its association with diet, nutrition status, and health outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs): a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "The food environment consists of external and personal domains that shape food purchasing decisions. While research on food environments has grown rapidly within high-income countries (HICs) in response to increasing rates of overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), critical research gaps remain. The role of food environment on diet, health and nutrition has been understudied in LMICs. To date, there has not been a systematic review specifically focusing on rural LMICs. This systematic review aims to synthesize findings from studies examining the association between rural food environment domains and diet, nutrition and health in LMICs or effects of food environment interventions on these outcomes. Searches were conducted from 9 databases: Medline (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Global Health (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), EconLit (EBSCOhost), Web of Science (Social Science Citation Index), Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ProQuest) to identify studies published between 2000 and 2023 that reported associations between this/these dimensions with diets, nutrition or health outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative studies that were published in English were included. Data extraction and quality appraisal was conducted independently by two authors, before the study findings were collated and summarized through a narrative data synthesis. Nineteen eligible studies were identified from 9 databases covering 11 LMICs. The included studies employed quantitative (n = 12), mixed method (n = 6) and qualitative (n = 1) designs in the neighbourhood food environment. In this review, availability dimension of the external food environment featured most prominently, followed by accessibility, affordability, desirability, and convenience dimensions of the personal food environment. Food availability was positively associated with diet (n = 10), nutrition (n = 7) and health (n = 1). There was good evidence regarding associations between food accessibility, diet (n = 7) and nutrition (n = 3). We identified some evidence that food price and affordability (n = 8) were considered key barriers to achieving healthy diets. Desirability (n = 4) and convenience (n = 2) dimensions were also associated with dietary outcomes, although we found only a few studies. Only one South African qualitative study was identified which highlighted limited availability and accessibility to local supermarkets and surrounding informal fruit and vegetable vendors to be a barrier to expensive, healthy foods consumption. Finally, evidence regarding health outcomes, sustainability dimension, impacts of food environment interventions on relevant outcomes and interactions between food environment dimensions was missing. Overall, seven out of nineteen studies were rated as good quality, six were rated as fair and six were rated as poor. Future interventions should consider improving availability and accessibility of nutritious foods to improve public health nutrition in rural LMICs. Evidence from studies assessing the workplace, home, and school food environments, food environment interventions, sustainability dimension and other key dimensions of the external food environment such as prices, vendor and product properties and marketing and regulation is needed to identify effective interventions to address malnutrition in all its forms characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition, overnutrition, undernutrition and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs).",

        "title": "Clinical characterisation, treatment outcomes, and case fatality risk of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves. We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves. Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99). Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of child and adolescent overweight and obesity, 1990-2021, with forecasts to 2050: a forecasting study for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Despite the well documented consequences of obesity during childhood and adolescence and future risks of excess body mass on non-communicable diseases in adulthood, coordinated global action on excess body mass in early life is still insufficient. Inconsistent measurement and reporting are a barrier to specific targets, resource allocation, and interventions. In this Article we report current estimates of overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence, progress over time, and forecasts to inform specific actions. Using established methodology from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, we modelled overweight and obesity across childhood and adolescence from 1990 to 2021, and then forecasted to 2050. Primary data for our models included 1321 unique measured and self-reported anthropometric data sources from 180 countries and territories from survey microdata, reports, and published literature. These data were used to estimate age-standardised global, regional, and national overweight prevalence and obesity prevalence (separately) for children and young adolescents (aged 5-14 years, typically in school and cared for by child health services) and older adolescents (aged 15-24 years, increasingly out of school and cared for by adult services) by sex for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Prevalence estimates from 1990 to 2021 were generated using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which leveraged temporal and spatial correlation in epidemiological trends to ensure comparability of results across time and geography. Prevalence forecasts from 2022 to 2050 were generated using a generalised ensemble modelling approach assuming continuation of current trends. For every age-sex-location population across time (1990-2050), we estimated obesity (vs overweight) predominance using the log ratio of obesity percentage to overweight percentage. Between 1990 and 2021, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents doubled, and that of obesity alone tripled. By 2021, 93·1 million (95% uncertainty interval 89·6-96·6) individuals aged 5-14 years and 80·6 million (78·2-83·3) aged 15-24 years had obesity. At the super-region level in 2021, the prevalence of overweight and of obesity was highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and the greatest increase from 1990 to 2021 was seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Taiwan [province of China], Maldives, and China). By 2021, for females in both age groups, many countries in Australasia (eg, Australia) and in high-income North America (eg, Canada) had already transitioned to obesity predominance, as had males and females in a number of countries in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) and Oceania (eg, Cook Islands and American Samoa). From 2022 to 2050, global increases in overweight (not obesity) prevalence are forecasted to stabilise, yet the increase in the absolute proportion of the global population with obesity is forecasted to be greater than between 1990 and 2021, with substantial increases forecast between 2022 and 2030, which continue between 2031 and 2050. By 2050, super-region obesity prevalence is forecasted to remain highest in north Africa and the Middle East (eg, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait), and forecasted increases in obesity are still expected to be largest across southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (eg, Timor-Leste and North Korea), but also in south Asia (eg, Nepal and Bangladesh). Compared with those aged 15-24 years, in most super-regions (except Latin America and the Caribbean and the high-income super-region) a greater proportion of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity than overweight by 2050. Globally, 15·6% (12·7-17·2) of those aged 5-14 years are forecasted to have obesity by 2050 (186 million [141-221]), compared with 14·2% (11·4-15·7) of those aged 15-24 years (175 million [136-203]). We forecasted that by 2050, there will be more young males (aged 5-14 years) living with obesity (16·5% [13·3-18·3]) than overweight (12·9% [12·2-13·6]); while for females (aged 5-24 years) and older males (aged 15-24 years), overweight will remain more prevalent than obesity. At a regional level, the following populations are forecast to have transitioned to obesity (vs overweight) predominance before 2041-50: children and adolescents (males and females aged 5-24 years) in north Africa and the Middle East and Tropical Latin America; males aged 5-14 years in east Asia, central and southern sub-Saharan Africa, and central Latin America; females aged 5-14 years in Australasia; females aged 15-24 years in Australasia, high-income North America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa; and males aged 15-24 years in high-income North America. Both overweight and obesity increased substantially in every world region between 1990 and 2021, suggesting that current approaches to curbing increases in overweight and obesity have failed a generation of children and adolescents. Beyond 2021, overweight during childhood and adolescence is forecast to stabilise due to further increases in the population who have obesity. Increases in obesity are expected to continue for all populations in all world regions. Because substantial change is forecasted to occur between 2022 and 2030, immediate actions are needed to address this public health crisis.

        "title": "Unraveling Gender Differences in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Focus on Key Micronutrients.",
        "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a persistent psychiatric condition that causes significant clinical and functional impairments. Recent research suggests a link between deficiencies in micronutrients, particularly vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid, and elevated homocysteine, and the development of OCD. This study investigates the blood levels of these micronutrients and their relationship to OCD severity, with an emphasis on potential gender differences. Methods This cross-sectional study included 300 drug-free OCD patients. Serum levels of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid, and homocysteine were measured using established biochemical methods. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was used to assess clinical severity. Data were examined to determine relationships between micronutrient levels and OCD severity and differences between male and female patients. Results This study found that women had higher levels of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (405.3 ± 15.1 vs. 360.4 ± 14.3) and folic acid (7.18 ± 0.27 vs. 5.76 ± 0.25) but lower levels of homocysteine (9.35 ± 0.64 vs. 14.4 ± 0.60) compared to men. Higher folic acid levels were linked to study participants having higher levels of education (at a college or university, where subjects are studied at an advanced level) compared to those with primary-level education. Lower vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were linked to family mental health history and noncommunicable diseases. Women exhibited lower levels of substance use but higher rates of self-harm and suicide attempts. Elevated homocysteine levels were linked to longer illness duration and more severe OCD symptoms. Conclusion These findings suggest that imbalances in micronutrients, particularly vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, folic acid, and homocysteine, may contribute to OCD severity and treatment resistance. Gender-specific variations in micronutrient levels could provide valuable insights into personalized OCD therapy choices. Further longitudinal studies are needed to understand these relationships and their potential as therapeutic targets.",

        "title": "Stroke in Bangladesh: A Narrative Review of Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Acute Stroke Services.",
        "abstract": "Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. It is one of the foremost non-communicable diseases and the third leading cause of death in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a developing country and as such, the prevalence, risk factors and management of the condition has some differences with more Westernised populations. In this review, we look at the epidemiology of stroke in Bangladesh and what barriers exist to improving stroke care in this country. A systematic search of the PubMed database, Mymensingh Medical Journal, Bangladesh Journal of Neuroscience and Google Scholar was conducted for articles relating to stroke in Bangladesh. The incidence of stroke in Bangladesh is 3 strokes per 1000 people. The prevalence of haemorrhagic stroke is higher than in Western populations, and novel risk factors such as sitting in a squatting position and betel nut chewing increase a Bangladeshi's stroke risk. A lack of education on stroke symptoms and a poor internal infrastructure are the main barriers to improving stroke care in this country. Stroke in Bangladesh is associated with traditional risk factors and non-traditional risk factors that are behaviourally ingrained into the local culture. Improved outcomes for these patients will rely on education programmes for the population, a regard for these risk factors and improving the availability of evidence-based treatments. Innovative approaches from policy decision makers to enhance equitable access to stroke services may help in providing stroke care in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "South Asia's diverse food supply, food preparations, and eating behaviors require dietary instruments that reflect the consumption patterns of South Asians to enable context specific dietary assessment. Such instruments are not readily available for detailed dietary assessment at scale in South Asia. We describe the adaptation, implementation, and performance evaluation of Intake24, an open-source digital 24-h dietary recall tool, for dietary assessment in South Asia. We adapted Intake24 for dietary assessment in the South Asia Biobank (SAB), a large population-based study in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Intake24 adaptation encompassed the development of a South Asian food database with commonly consumed foods, linked with corresponding portion sizes, food probes, and nutrient information. Trained interviewers conducted the 24-h recalls. Performance of Intake24 was evaluated in 29,113 South Asian adults. The South Asia Intake24 food database included 2283 items and demonstrated good coverage of foods consumed across SAB regions. Median recall completion time was 13 min. Quality control metrics showed 99% of recalls included >8 items and 8% had missing foods. Median energy intake was higher in younger individuals compared to older, and in males compared to females. Underweight participants reported lower energy intake, with no discernible difference across other BMI categories. Intake24 enables comprehensive dietary assessment in regions of South Asia and will facilitate the analysis of dietary patterns, food and nutrient intake, and their relationship with health outcomes among South Asians.",

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, numerous countries have enhanced their Universal Health Coverage (UHC), as indicated by the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI), alongside a global reduction in the disease burden measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This paper uses a cross-country panel of 190 countries from 2000 to 2019 to identify the association between UHC SCI and DALYs gain. We find that a one-unit increase in the UHC SCI was associated with a significant decrease in total DALYs. Furthermore, UHC SCI was mostly associated with lowering DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases but showed little to no significant association with non-communicable diseases or injuries. These results are robust to various robustness tests. Notable reasons include governments spending more on communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases than on non-communicable diseases and injuries, which is also the case for external aid. Our results also suggest that moving towards UHC helps lower-income countries more than higher-income countries, as developed nation-states have already established a well-functioning health system. Addressing non-communicable diseases and injuries will be essential to improve health outcomes and achieve SDGs in future.",

        "abstract": "Pediococcus pentosaceus has the potential to be used as probiotics and biologics amid rising trends of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and non-communicable diseases. This study analyzed the genome of P. pentosaceus MBBL4, isolated from healthy cow milk, to assess its probiotic properties and antimicrobial efficacy. The strain was subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS), assembly, and annotations, alongside phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, carbohydrate utilization, metabolic pathways, genomic safety, and probiotic potential of MBBL4 were assessed. Its in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against mastitis pathogens was also evaluated. The WGS analysis uncovered many important probiotic traits in MBBL4. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close genetic link with other 15 P. pentosaceus strains, sharing more than 99% of core genes within the pan-genome matrix. MBBL4 demonstrated extensive range of carbohydrate metabolism activity, supported by the presence of several genes encoded enzymes, including a complete elucidated lactose metabolism pathway along with 28 additional metabolic pathway modules. Notably, its genome contains regions associated with gallic acid metabolism and related genes. MBBL4 also harbored genes encoding immunity proteins like enterocin A and lactococcin, and antimicrobial compounds including penocin A, lysozymes, laccase, colicin V, and viguiepinol. Comparative analysis with other probiotic strains revealed seven novel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and one biofilm-related protein. Moreover, MBBL4 remained sensitive to 90% of the tested antibiotics and carried only a single lincosamide resistance gene (lnuA). It effectively inhibited the growth of two important bovine mastitis pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus D4C4 and Escherichia coli G1C5. These results, along with its low pathogenicity score, support the safety profile of MBBL4 and highlight its potential as bioactive natural therapeutic for mastitis and a promising probiotic candidate.",

        "abstract": "Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective and essential component of care for the increasing number of individuals with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs). Despite the benefits, it remains underutilised and poorly accessible in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to determine the feasibility of delivering PR in Bangladesh at home because of pandemic travel restrictions. Aligned with the Medical Research Council framework of development and evaluation of complex interventions, we recruited individuals with CRDs from the Community Respiratory Centre, Khulna, to a mixed-methods feasibility study. We assessed their functional exercise capacity and quality of life before and after an eight-week course of home PR, and conducted semi-structured interviews with PR providers and professional stakeholders by using a topic guide aligned with the normalisation process theory (NPT) and interpreting the findings within its constructs. We recruited 51 out of 61 referred patients with a range of CRDs, of whom 44 (86%) completed ≥70% of their home PR course. Functional exercise capacity, measured by the endurance shuttle walk test, improved in 78% of patients, with 48% exceeding the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Health-related quality of life, measured by the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test, improved by more than the MCID in 83% of patients. Through the interviews, we found that PR providers encountered challenges in remote video supervision due to unstable internet connections, forcing them to resort to telephone calls. The strength of support for NPT constructs varied; many participants understood and appreciated the role of PR and could make sense of the innovation (NPT-1), and most were assessing the potential of a PR service in Bangladesh to decide if it was worthwhile (NPT-4). Participants were not yet ready to endorse or actively support (NPT-2) or operationalise (NPT-3) the roll-out of PR. A home PR programme, supported by remote supervision and monitoring, is feasible in Bangladesh, but local evidence will be needed to promote implementation.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 400 elderly participants sought care at Noakhali General Hospital, Noakhali, Bangladesh. MetS was diagnosed based on National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria, while QOL was assessed using the brief version of the World Health Organization's QOL (WHOQOL-BREF) tool. Results revealed that over 70 % of the elderly participants had MetS, with a significantly higher prevalence among females (79.2 %) compared to males (66.7 %). Gender disparities were also evident in QOL scores, with males reporting better outcomes across all domains-physical, psychological, social, and environmental. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that MetS negatively impacted the overall QOL for both genders, with more pronounced effects observed in females.

        "abstract": "There are few data on the treatment of children and adolescents with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis, especially with more recently available drugs and regimens. We aimed to describe the clinical and treatment characteristics and their associations with treatment outcomes in this susceptible population. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. Databases were searched from Oct 1, 2014, to March 30, 2020. To be eligible, studies must have included more than five children or adolescents (0-19 years of age) treated for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed MDR or RR tuberculosis within a defined treatment cohort, and reported on regimen composition and treatment outcomes. Abstracts were screened independently by two authors to identify potentially eligible records. Full texts were reviewed by two authors independently to identify studies meeting the eligiblity criteria. For studies meeting eligiblity criteria, anonymised individual patient data was requested and individiual level data included for analysis. The main outcome assessed was treatment outcome defined as treatment success (cure or treatment completed) versus unfavourable outcome (treatment failure or death). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associations between clinical and treatment factors and treatment outcomes. This study is registered with Prospero (CRD42020187230). 1417 studies were identified through database searching. After removing duplicates and screening for eligibility, the search identified 23 369 individual participants from 42 studies, mostly from India and South Africa. Overall, 16 825 (72·0%) were successfully treated (treatment completed or cured), 2848 died (12·2%), 722 (3·1%) had treatment failure, and 2974 (12·7%) were lost to follow-up. In primary analyses, the median age was 16 (IQR 13-18) years. Of the 17 764 (87·1%) participants with reported HIV status, 2448 (13·8%) were living with HIV. 17 707 (89·6%) had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis. After adjusting for significant factors associated with treatment outcome, the use of two (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·41 [95% CI 1·09-1·82]; p=0·008) or three (2·12 [1·61-2·79]; p<0·0001) WHO-classified group A drugs (bedaquiline, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and linezolid) compared with the use of no group A drugs at all was positively associated with treatment success. Younger and clinically diagnosed children are underrepresented among those treated for MDR and RR tuberculosis and should be a focus for case-finding efforts. Overall treatment outcomes in our analysis were better than in adults but lower than the international targets of 90% or more individuals successfully treated. Treatment with more group A drugs was associated with better treatment outcomes in children and adolescents, highlighting the need for more rapid access to these drugs and improved regimens.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has experienced a rapid epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in recent decades. There is, however, limited evidence about multidimensional determinants of NCDs in this population. The BangladEsh Longitudinal Investigation of Emerging Vascular and nonvascular Events (BELIEVE) study is a household-based prospective cohort study established to investigate biological, behavioural, environmental and broader determinants of NCDs. Between January 2016 and March 2020, 73 883 participants (aged 11 years or older) were recruited from 30 817 households across urban, urban-poor ('slum') and rural settings in Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was administered by trained personnel recording participants' demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural, medical, environmental and other factors. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded for each participant. Biological specimens were collected and aliquoted for long-term storage and analysis. Of the 73 883 study participants (mean [SD] baseline age: 39 [15] years), 43 470 (59%) were females, and 38 848 (52%) had no or only primary-level education. Focusing only on the 65 822 adult participants aged 20-79 years at baseline, 15 411 (23%) reported being diagnosed with hypertension; 10 578 (16%) with type 2 diabetes and 7624 (12%) with hypercholesterolaemia. Age and sex-standardised prevalences of these conditions were much higher in urban than slum and rural settings. Overall, the mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 25 (5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with 10 442 (16%) participants aged 20-79, classified as obese (ie, BMI≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Mean BMI was also higher in urban than slum and rural areas. The collection of information during the baseline visit was completed in 2020. Regular longitudinal follow-up is ongoing for ascertainment and adjudication of a range of fatal and non-fatal health outcomes among participants. This cohort will provide a powerful resource to investigate multidimensional determinants of incident NCDs across diverse settings in Bangladesh, helping to advance scientific discovery and public health action in an archetypal low-middle-income country with pressing public health needs.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, data related to the future risk of dementia and its associated factors are scarce. Furthermore, no dementia risk prediction tool has yet been applied to estimate the risk in any population in Bangladesh. Therefore, our objective was to assess the risk of dementia and its associated factors among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This cross-sectional study conveniently recruited 280 stable patients with CAD who were admitted for coronary revascularization at a tertiary cardiac hospital situated in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Data were collected face-to-face using a pretested questionnaire adapted from the WHO STEP-wise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) of Noncommunicable Diseases Risk Factors questionnaire (Version 3.2). The questionnaire included background information (sociodemographic, comorbidity), behavioral and metabolic risk factors, physical and biochemical measurements. The next 20 years' risk of dementia was estimated using the \"Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia\" score. The risk score, risk levels, and risk factors were presented descriptively. The associated factors of dementia risk were elucidated using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The mean ( ± standard deviation) risk score for dementia was 6.26 ± 2.28. The predicted \"at-risk\" population was 63.6%. The prevalent risk factors were unhealthy diets (84.3%) presented by inadequate fruit/vegetable consumption (70%) and added salt intake (46.4%). In the final model of hierarchical multiple regression, the risk score showed a significant association with several risk factors: family history of diabetes (<i>p</i> = 0.03), alcohol intake (<i>p</i> = 0.03), current smoking (<i>p</i> = 0.03), estimated glomerular filtration rate (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (<i>p</i> = 0.02). A substantial proportion of patients with CAD had a future risk of dementia which demands an urgent risk reduction strategy in Bangladesh.

It included a non-institutionalized adults' population of 6189 men and women aged 18-69 years. Their daily salt consumption was estimated using the spot urine sodium concentration following the Tanaka equation and reported according to the standard nomenclature proposed by the World Hypertension League and partner organizations involved in dietary salt reduction. Out of a total of 6189 participants, 2.4% consumed the recommended amount of salt (<5 g/day), 67.8% consumed a high amount of salt (≥5-10 g/day), 27.2% consumed a very high amount of salt (>10-15 g/day), and 2.6% consumed an extremely high amount of salt (>15 g/day). In univariate analysis, a higher than recommended level of salt intake (≥5 g/day) was significantly prevalent among rural residents (high = 78.4%, very-high = 81.6%, extremely-high = 84.9%, p = 0.01), literates (high = 51.6%, very-high = 57.9%, extremely-high = 59.1%, p = 0.02), newly diagnosed hypertension (high = 20.6%, very-high = 23.6%, extremely-high = 24.1%, p = 0.008), and overweight/obese (high = 25.9%, very-high = 33.3%, extremely-high = 29.8%, p = 0.000). Similarly, in ordinal logistic regression analysis, the categories of daily salt consumption showed a significant association with rural residence (OR: 1.300, CI: 1.109-1.524, p = 0.001), literates (OR: 0.777, CI: 0.671-0.900, p = 0.001), newly diagnosed hypertension (OR: 1.204, CI: 1.022-1.419, p = 0.026), and overweight/obesity (OR: 1.353, CI: 1.145-1.598, p = 0.000).

About 27 milk samples, such as raw milk from collection centers, processed milk from processing plants, pasteurized, UHT, and flavored milk from retail stores, were examined using RP-HPLC against five veterinary antibiotics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The correlation between antibiotics was analyzed using Pearson's correlation test. OTC was prevalent in 100 % of the analyzed samples, while CTC, ENR, TC, and DOX were found in 29.63 %, 22.22 %, 18.52 %, and 7.41 % of the samples, respectively. Only OTC residues were detected in both raw and soon-after-processed milk. However, most of the UHT and flavored milk samples showed the occurrence of multiple antibiotic residues. Among the detected samples, 37.04 % exceeded the MRLs, while 44.44 % were near the limit. The mean concentration of TC was higher than others. The correlation test revealed a significant moderate to strong positive correlation between TC, CTC, DOX, and ENR, while OTC showed no significant correlation with the other antibiotics. Risk analysis showed no immediate risk from detected antibiotics but can raise concern due to continuous exposure.

Identifying modifiable risk factors for MI in these populations could inform prevention strategies. We have, therefore, studied conventional risk factors and other characteristics in relation to occurrence of first MI in Bangladesh. In a case-control study involving 8133 first-onset MI cases and 8124 controls recruited in Bangladesh, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for MI adjusted, for age, sex, smoking status, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, family history of MI, and LDL-cholesterol. We assessed the potential public health impact of risk factor modification using population attributable fractions (PAFs). The median (IQR) age of first MI was 53 (45-60) years. Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were 2.80 (2.57-3.05) for cigarette smoking, 2.17 (1.94-2.43) for family history of MI, 2.27 (2.07-2.48) for history of hypertension, 1.91 (1.72-2.13) for history of diabetes, and 1.53 (1.47-1.58) per 1-SD higher LDL-cholesterol. The highest PAFs (95% CIs) were with current cigarette smoking (49% [46%-52%]), higher LDL-cholesterol (31% [29%-33%]) and history of hypertension (15% [13%-16%]). As for regionally distinctive practices, ORs were 4.02 (3.13-5.17) with <i>biri/hukkah</i> smoking, 2.09 (1.52-2.87) with chewing tobacco, and 1.26 (1.05-1.51) with parental history of first-cousin marriage. Our results confirm the relevance of several conventional risk factors to risk of first MI in Bangladesh, and identify associations with MI of practices distinctive to South Asia, including indigenous modes of tobacco consumption and parental first-cousin marriage. These findings suggest opportunities for cardiovascular disease prevention in Bangladesh that embrace both conventional and regionally distinctive risk factors.

        "abstract": "The incidence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is increasing in low- and middle-income countries and represents a major public health challenge. Herein, we present Japan's experience in training medical coordinators to combat NCDs, with a focus on hepatitis, early-onset dementia, and children with medical complexity. Coordinators play an important role in bridging the gap between patients and healthcare services. We examined the training and roles of the coordinators. In the Japanese model, medical coordinators, including both medical and non-medical personnel, have successfully strengthened the delivery of healthcare services for specific diseases. However, challenges persist, including the uneven distribution of coordinators, inconsistencies in training programs, the program's relatively recent establishment, and limited awareness of coordinators' roles and activities. Training medical coordinators can strengthen comprehensive patient support in managing NCDs. Despite its limitations, this model provides valuable insights for developing interventional strategies in other Asian countries facing similar medical human resource shortages. Collaboration among governments, hospitals, and related organisations in training coordinators holds promise in addressing the growing prevalence of NCDs in these regions.",

        "abstract": "Digital data sources such as mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) are increasingly being used to estimate population mobility fluxes and to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks. Differences in mobile phone operators' geographic coverage, however, may result in biased mobility estimates. We leverage a unique dataset consisting of CDRs from three mobile phone operators in Bangladesh and digital trace data from Meta's Data for Good program to compare mobility patterns across these sources. We use a metapopulation model to compare the sources' effects on simulated outbreak trajectories, and compare results with a benchmark model with data from all three operators, representing around 100 million subscribers across the country. We show that mobility sources can vary significantly in their coverage of travel routes and geographic mobility patterns. Differences in projected outbreak dynamics are more pronounced at finer spatial scales, especially if the outbreak is seeded in smaller and/or geographically isolated regions. In some instances, a simple diffusion (gravity) model was better able to capture the timing and spatial spread of the outbreak compared to the sparser mobility sources. Our results highlight the potential biases in predicted outbreak dynamics from a metapopulation model parameterized with non-population representative data, and the limits to the generalizability of models built on these types of novel human behavioral data.",

        "abstract": "Legumes are widely considered one of the most beneficial food groups to consume. They are high in fibre and plant-based protein as well as naturally low in sodium, saturated fats, and sugars. However, legumes do not feature prominently in the modern diet, and previous evidence syntheses show inconsistent results on cardiometabolic risk profile when increasing legume intakes. This review examines the impact of legume intake on cardiometabolic profile and gut microbiome. EMBASE, OVID Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to 15 May 2024 with checking of relevant reference lists and bibliographies. Relevant data were extracted into pre-tested forms and risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane RoB2. Searches, screening, and risk of bias assessment were done independently by two reviewers. We have considered trials where legumes were provided to adults, with and without pre-existing conditions (i.e. type 2 diabetes, heart disease or dyslipidaemia), in randomised controlled trials of at least six weeks duration on cardiometabolic risk factors and gut microbiome outcomes. Trial data were pooled using random effects models. Prespecified regression analyses were then performed to identify the factors influencing pooled results. Certainty of evidence was assessed with GRADE. We identified 30 papers of 24 trials with 33 eligible comparisons where legumes (daily average 86 g (range 2-251)) were provided to 1,938 participants. No eligible studies reported on microbiome outcomes. There was moderate certainty evidence that higher legume intakes improved total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.23mmol/L, 95%CI -0.33 to -0.13), LDL cholesterol (MD -0.16mmol/L (-0.24 to -0.08)), and fasting blood glucose (MD -0.18mmol/L (-0.30 to -0.06)). The majority of trial comparisons (70%) provided an isoenergetic control food. Pooled results were influenced by underlying differences between trials such as type and format of legumes provided, but not consistently across multiple outcomes. Increasing legume intakes improved some blood lipid and glucose parameters, but not all. Isoenergetic comparisons in trials may obscure changes in cardiometabolic risk factors due to greater satiation or reduced intake, and no trials greater than six weeks duration were identified to consider the microbiome-mediated health effects with greater legume intakes. Future trials in these areas are necessary. Prospero ID CRD42023456953.",

Participants were 3507 preschoolers from 37 countries. Nighttime sleep characteristics and nap duration (accelerometer: n = 1950) and family practices (parental questionnaire) were measured. Mixed models were used to estimate the marginal means of sleep characteristics by region and examine the differences. Geocultural region explained up to 30% of variance in sleep characteristics. A pattern of short nighttime sleep duration, low sleep efficiency, and long nap duration was observed in Eastern Europe, Northeast Asia, and Southeast Asia. The second pattern, with later sleep midpoints and greater night-to-night sleep variability, was observed in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. Compared to the Minority World, less optimal sleep characteristics were observed in several Majority World regions, with medium-to-large effect sizes (∣d∣=0.48-2.35). Several Majority World regions reported more frequent parental smartphone use during bedtime routines (Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia: 0.77-0.99 units) and were more likely to have electronic devices in children's bedroom (Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Asia: OR = 5.97-16.57) and co-sleeping arrangement (Asia, Latin America: OR = 7.05-49.86), compared to the Minority World.

        "abstract": "Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) that are ten-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) became available in 2010. We evaluated their global impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in all ages. Serotype-specific IPD cases and population denominators were obtained directly from surveillance sites using PCV10 or PCV13 in their national immunisation programmes and with a primary series uptake of at least 50%. Annual incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated comparing the incidence before any PCV with each year post-PCV10 or post-PCV13 introduction using Bayesian multi-level, mixed-effects Poisson regressions, by site and age group. All site-weighted average IRRs were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression, stratified by product and previous seven-valent PCV (PCV7) effect (none, moderate, or substantial). Analyses included 32 PCV13 sites (488 758 cases) and 15 PCV10 sites (46 386 cases) in 30 countries, primarily high income (39 sites), using booster dose schedules (41 sites). By 6 years after PCV10 or PCV13 introduction, IPD due to PCV10-type serotypes and PCV10-related serotype 6A declined substantially for both products (age <5 years: 83-99% decline; ≥65 years: 54-96% decline). PCV7-related serotype 19A increases before PCV10 or PCV13 introduction were reversed at PCV13 sites (age <5 years: 61-79% decline relative to before any PCV; age ≥65 years: 7-26% decline) but increased at PCV10 sites (age <5 years: 1·6-2·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 3·6-4·9-fold). Serotype 3 IRRs had no consistent trends for either product or age group. Non-PCV13-type IPD increased similarly for both products (age <5 years: 2·3-3·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 1·7-2·3-fold). Despite different serotype 19A trends, all-serotype IPD declined similarly between products among children younger than 5 years (58-74%); among adults aged 65 years or older, declines were greater at PCV13 (25-29%) than PCV10 (4-14%) sites, but other differences between sites precluded attribution to product. Long-term use of PCV10 or PCV13 reduced IPD substantially in young children and more moderately in older ages. Non-vaccine-type serotypes increased approximately two-fold to three-fold by 6 years after introduction of PCV10 or PCV13. Continuing serotype 19A increases at PCV10 sites and declines at PCV13 sites suggest that PCV13 use would further reduce IPD at PCV10 sites.

        "abstract": "The global health concern regarding the low prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) is evident, but the prevalence of DDM is increasing. This is attributed to the frequent underestimation of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM). Given the limited research on this matter in Bangladesh, there is a need to investigate sex differences in both the prevalence and risk factors of DDM among Bangladeshi adults. This study utilizes the latest data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) conducted between 2017 and 2018, involving 11,911 adult participants. The research focuses on exploring sex-specific differences in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM). Multinomial logistic regression models are applied to examine the sex effect after adjusting socio-demographic, household, and community-related factors associated with these conditions. In the group of 5127 (43%) males, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DDM) and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM) stood at 344 (7%) and 94 (2%), respectively. Among 6784 (57%) females, these figures were slightly lower at 424(6%) for DDM and 138 (2%) for UDM. In males aged 30-39, UDM exhibited significantly (RRR: 6.83, 95% CI: 2.01-23.18), associations, in contrast to the nonsignificant association observed for DDM. Unemployed female had a high risk of diagnosed (RRR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.6) and undiagnosed (RRR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.01-2.31) diabetes. Age, hypertension, wealth, overweight status, and residing in Dhaka had significant relationship with DDM and UDM for both males and females. This study reveals that diabetes prevalence in Bangladesh is influenced by various risk factors, with distinct impacts on men and women. Women living in Dhaka who are unemployed are at a significantly higher risk of both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compared to men. To effectively combat the rising diabetes rate, we must implement targeted interventions that address these sex-specific disparities. These interventions should focus on age, wealth, regional variations, and especially on unemployed women in Dhaka, considering their heightened risk.",

Using a semi-structured discussion guide, we asked consumers for their perceptions of the healthfulness of nutrients and foods, two common FOPLs (a color-coded guideline daily allowance [GDA] label and a warning label), and different visual elements of the warning label (e.g., shape, icon, text). <b>Results:</b> Participants understood the health harms of sugar and salt consumption but were less clear on saturated fat. Both FOPLs were perceived as helpful for identifying unhealthy foods, but the warning labels were perceived as easier to understand and more likely to influence behaviors than the GDA. Regarding the design of warning labels, participants perceived warning devices, holding straps, and octagonal shapes as effective but had mixed reactions to which icons or textual statements were most effective. <b>Conclusions:</b> FOPLs are likely to facilitate Bangladeshi consumers' ability to identify unhealthy products. Further research is needed to understand the impact on food choices as well as the most effective design in this population.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated the dietary impact of complementary food supplements (CFSs) designed to deliver macro- and micronutrients to children at risk for undernutrition. In a randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh, we previously reported that CFSs increased children's micronutrient adequacy. To longitudinally characterize energy and macronutrient intakes and inadequacies and evaluate the extent to which CFSs fill intake gaps. Children were enrolled at 6 mo and received 1 of 4 CFSs plus caregiver nutrition counseling or counseling alone for 1 y. A semi-quantitative diet questionnaire was administered at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 mo. Energy and macronutrient intakes were estimated by age and arm; protein adequacy was adjusted for protein quality and infection. We estimated the proportion meeting intake requirements set by FAO and the Institute of Medicine and compared group-wise differences using log binomial regression models with generalized estimating equations. We used multivariate analysis of variance models to evaluate if CFSs substituted home foods. Across groups, most children did not meet energy or protein requirements at enrollment (74.6%-81.3% and 77.4%-79.2%, respectively). Estimated energy and macronutrient intakes from home foods increased from 6 to 24 mo. Energy inadequacy was lower in the supplemented groups compared with the control at all ages (e.g. 10.5%-13.8% compared with 31.4% at 18 mo). In the control group, protein inadequacy dropped from 78.4% at 6 mo to 8.3% at 9 mo to 2.8% by 18 mo; adjusted protein estimates were 25.1% at 9 mo and 7.0% at 18 mo. Protein inadequacy was the highest in the control group at all timepoints. CFSs did not substitute home foods. CFSs can significantly bridge energy and protein intake gaps. With earlier trial findings that CFSs filled micronutrient gaps and improved growth, these findings strengthen evidence supporting using CFSs for improved health outcomes.

With an increasing global burden of NCDs, understanding the dynamics in lower-educated populations becomes crucial for targeted interventions and achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3.4-curtailing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030 through prevention and treatment. Utilizing data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (2017-2018), a two-stage stratified sampling design identified 7287 lower-educated individuals. Bayesian logistic regression was applied for risk factor analysis. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes among lower-educated people was 31% and 9.3%, respectively. NCD prevalence (37.3%) underscored a significant health burden. Factors such as gender, age, wealth status, working status, residence and region showed significant associations with NCDs. Bayesian analysis revealed that females were 1.30 times more likely to develop NCDs, while older age groups demonstrated 4.30 times greater likelihood. Employed individuals exhibited a 43% lower risk. Wealthier households showed higher NCD likelihood and residence in the central region was associated with an 11% lower risk. This study highlights the high risk of developing NCDs among lower-educated females, particularly those ≥35 y of age in Bangladesh. Therefore, targeted interventions for this group are critical to reducing NCD risks, supporting national health objectives and advancing progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.",

        "abstract": "The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78·3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78·1-78·5) in 2022 to 79·9 years (79·5-80·2) in 2035, and to 80·4 years (79·8-81·0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19·5% [6·9-34·1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3·8 additional years (3·6-4·0) of life expectancy and 4·1 additional years (3·9-4·3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0·4 additional years (0·3-0·6) of life expectancy and 0·6 additional years (0·5-0·8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0·4-0·5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12·4 million (11·3-13·5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1·4 million (0·7-2·2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2·1 million (1·3-2·9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1·2 million (0·9-1·5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

        "abstract": "South Asian Association for Regional Collaboration (SAARC) countries, home to 24% of the world's population, are facing the double burden of disease (ie, where a population experiences both an increasing incidence of cancers typically associated with affluence and a sustained or rising burden of cancers linked to infections and poverty) with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) attributing to 47% of the global burden of disease and to about 60% of all deaths. In 2022, cancer in this region accounted for approximately 9·3% of incidence worldwide and 12% of global mortality. Cancer is one of the major NCDs affecting South Asia, accounting for a large proportion of disability-adjusted life-years lost in this region. The most common cancers are lung, head and neck, and gastrointestinal cancers in both sexes, and cervix and breast cancers in females. The cancer burden is high in SAARC countries, although there are differences among countries and within urban and rural regions of each country, depending on the level of available resources, development, and epidemiological shift. Here we discuss various cancer care issues and challenges throughout the cancer care continuum in the SAARC region. We make an urgent call for regional collaboration to develop, modify, and implement a holistic cancer control plan and formulate a systematic approach directed to address the growing burden of cancer in this region. It is crucial to establish strong political will and commitment to take forward the recommended actions outlined in this Series to overcome and address the cancer crisis in the SAARC region, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 2030 targets.",

        "abstract": "Rising childhood obesity rates in Asia are adding risk for the future adult burden of obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Weak policies across most Asian countries enable unrestricted marketing of obesogenic foods and beverages to children. Television is the common medium for food marketing to reach this audience. This study aimed to assess the extent and nature of television food and nonalcoholic beverage marketing in 9 Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam) with capacity building support from the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-Communicable Disease Research, Monitoring and Action Support, who enabled harmonization of data collection method and content analyses. Advertised foods were categorized as permitted or not permitted based on the nutrient profile models established by the World Health Organization regional offices for South-East Asia (SEARO) and the World Health Organization regional offices for Western Pacific (WPRO). Overall rates of food advertisements (advertisements per hour per channel) and persuasive strategy use were analyzed along with comparisons between children's peak viewing time (PVT) and non-PVT. Cross-country comparisons, irrespective of country income level, indicated that not permitted food advertising dominated children's popular television channels, especially during PVT with rates as per WPRO or SEARO criteria ranging from 2.40/2.29 (Malaysia) to 9.70/9.41 advertisements per hour per channel (the Philippines). Persuasive strategy rates were also comparatively higher during PVT. Sugar-sweetened beverages, sugar-containing solid foods, and high salt- and fat-containing snacks and fast foods were frequently advertised. Evaluation of the application of WPRO and SEARO nutrient profile models identified inconsistencies due to regional taste and cuisine variations across Asia. This study clearly showed that unhealthy food marketing through popular children's television channels is widely occurring in Asia and is a clear breach of child rights. Evidence outcomes will benefit advocacy toward stronger policy regulations to control unhealthy food marketing and strengthen strategies to promote a healthier food environment for Asia's children.",

        "abstract": "Dementia is a leading cause of disability and death globally. Individuals with diseases such as cardiovascular, cardiometabolic and cerebrovascular disease are often at increased dementia risk. However, while numerous models have been developed to predict dementia, they are often not tailored to disease-specific groups. Yet, different disease groups may have unique risk factor profiles and tailored models that account for these differences may have enhanced predictive accuracy. In this review, we synthesise findings from three previous systematic reviews on dementia risk model development and testing to present an overview of the literature on dementia risk prediction modelling in people with a history of disease. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Currently, disease-specific models have only been developed in people with a history of diabetes where demographic, disease-specific and comorbidity data were used. Some existing risk models, including CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc and CHADS<sub>2</sub>, have been externally validated for dementia outcomes in those with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. One study developed a dementia risk model for their whole population, which had similar predictive accuracy when applied in a sub-sample with stroke. This emphasises the importance of considering disease status in identifying key predictors for dementia and generating accurate prediction models for dementia.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a major public health concern in Bangladesh. The pattern of diabetic care and control of blood sugar among diabetic patients are not well described. We assessed the pattern of diabetic care among ambulatory diabetic patients attending tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh, and explored the relationship of glycemic control with behavioral and metabolic risks. Any patient 18 years and older attending the medicine outpatient department (OPD) at randomly selected three government tertiary hospitals in three divisions in Bangladesh were examined by hospital doctors. If a patient who was diagnosed as having diabetes and produced any medical document to support the diagnosis was recruited following an informed consent. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, diabetic care plan and behavioral risks, including tobacco use, physical activity, healthy diet (daily fruits and vegetable consumption) and salt intake were obtained from study participants by recall. Three milliliters of venous blood were tested to determine uncontrolled diabetes by measuring glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C > 7.0), and hyperlipidemia by measuring total cholesterol (> 200 mg/dL), high density lipoprotein/HDL (< 40 Mg/dL, low density lipoprotein/ LDL (> 200 mg/dL), and Triglyceride (> 160 mg/dL). A Total of 465 patients were enrolled. The Mean age was 49 years (SD:11) and 58% were women. Sixty percent patients were on a treatment plan of anti-diabetic drugs (drug), healthy diet (diet) and physical activity (PA), 13.3% diet and drug, 9.7% on drug only, 6.4%  on diet and PA, 3.9% on PA and drug, 1.3% on PA only and 0.9% on diet only. Two- third of the patients (68.6%) had uncontrolled diabetes, which was three times higher, if a patient had diabetes for more than five years than otherwise (OR: 3.31, 95% CI 2.06-5.33), two times higher if a patient did not consume fruits  (OR: 2.28, 1.34-3.87), or three times higher, if a patient did not consume vegetables (OR: 3.70, 95% CI 1.80-7.59) than otherwise, 78% higher, if a patient had taken extra salt in meal than otherwise (OR: 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.80) and nine times higher, if a patient had a raised total cholesterol level (> 200 mg/dL) than otherwise (OR: 9.60, 95% CI 2.60-35.40) and three times higher, if a patient had a raised LDL level compared than otherwise (OR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.93-5.70). Diabetic patients seeking care at tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh follow diverse diabetic care plans and the majority of them do not have diabetes under control. Unhealthy dietary practice and hyperlipidemia among diabetic patients contribute to uncontrolled diabetes. Routine monitoring of blood glucose and enforcing lifestyle modifications could promote effective control of diabetes among diabetic patients in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "A smartphone is a device with various functions, including wifi, application functions, mobile networks, ease of mobility, and the capability of using mobile data. Because of the aforementioned functions, people may use smartphones frequently. The Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS) is a six-item questionnaire assessing smartphone addiction with promising psychometric properties. However, it is unclear if the SABAS possesses the strong psychometric properties across Asian regions. The present study aimed to examine the factor structure of the SABAS across nine Asian regions. Using datasets collected from Asian regions of Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, data from 10,397 participants (mean age = 22.40 years; 44.8% men) were used for analyses. All participants completed the SABAS using an online survey or paper-and-pencil mode. Findings from confirmatory factor analysis, Rasch analysis, and network analysis all indicate a one-factor structure for the SABAS. Moreover, the one-factor structure of the SABAS was measurement invariant across age (21 years or less vs. above 21 years) and gender (men vs. women) in metric, scalar, and strict invariance. The one-factor structure was invariant across regions in metric but not scalar or strict invariance. The present study findings showed that the SABAS possesses a one-factor structure across nine Asian regions; however, noninvariant findings in scalar and strict levels indicate that people in the nine Asian regions may interpret the importance of each SABAS item differently. Age group and gender group comparisons are comparable because of the invariance evidence for the SABAS found in the present study. However, cautions should be made when comparing SABAS scores across Asian regions.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of digital technologies, particularly in big data analytics (BDA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), is reshaping the global health care system, including in Bangladesh. The increased adoption of these technologies in health care delivery within Bangladesh has sparked their integration into health care and public health research, resulting in a noticeable surge in related studies. However, a critical gap exists, as there is a lack of comprehensive evidence regarding the research landscape; regulatory challenges; use cases; and the application and adoption of BDA, AI, ML, and DL in the health care system of Bangladesh. This gap impedes the attainment of optimal results. As Bangladesh is a leading implementer of digital technologies, bridging this gap is urgent for the effective use of these advancing technologies. This scoping review aims to collate (1) the existing research in Bangladesh's health care system, using the aforementioned technologies and synthesizing their findings, and (2) the limitations faced by researchers in integrating the aforementioned technologies into health care research. MEDLINE (via PubMed), IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched to identify published research articles between January 1, 2000, and September 10, 2023, meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) any study using any of the BDA, AI, ML, and DL technologies and health care and public health datasets for predicting health issues and forecasting any kind of outbreak; (2) studies primarily focusing on health care and public health issues in Bangladesh; and (3) original research articles published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings written in English. With the initial search, we identified 1653 studies. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria and full-text review, 4.66% (77/1653) of the articles were finally included in this review. There was a substantial increase in studies over the last 5 years (2017-2023). Among the 77 studies, the majority (n=65, 84%) used ML models. A smaller proportion of studies incorporated AI (4/77, 5%), DL (7/77, 9%), and BDA (1/77, 1%) technologies. Among the reviewed articles, 52% (40/77) relied on primary data, while the remaining 48% (37/77) used secondary data. The primary research areas of focus were infectious diseases (15/77, 19%), noncommunicable diseases (23/77, 30%), child health (11/77, 14%), and mental health (9/77, 12%). This scoping review highlights remarkable progress in leveraging BDA, AI, ML, and DL within Bangladesh's health care system. The observed surge in studies over the last 5 years underscores the increasing significance of AI and related technologies in health care research. Notably, most (65/77, 84%) studies focused on ML models, unveiling opportunities for advancements in predictive modeling. This review encapsulates the current state of technological integration and propels us into a promising era for the future of digital Bangladesh.",

To assess the attributable burden of injury risk factors, the data of interest on data sources were retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and analyzed. Cause-specific death from injuries was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model in the GBD 2019. The burden attributable to each injury risk factor was incorporated in the population attributable fraction to estimate the total attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) was used to evaluate countries' developmental status. Globally, there were 713.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 663.8 to 766.9) injuries incidence and 4.3 million (UI: 3.9 to 4.6) deaths caused by injuries in 2019. There was an inverse relationship between age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate and SDI quintiles in 2019. Overall, low bone mineral density was the leading risk factor of injury deaths in 2019, with a contribution of 10.5% (UI: 9.0 to 11.6) of total injuries and age-standardized deaths, followed by occupational risks (7.0% [UI: 6.3-7.9]) and alcohol use (6.8% [UI: 5.2 to 8.5]). Various risks were responsible for the imposed burden of injuries. This study highlighted the small but persistent share of injuries in the global burden of diseases and injuries to provide beneficial data to produce proper policies to reach an effective global injury prevention plan.",

        "title": "Genetic insights into the connection between pulmonary TB and non-communicable diseases: An integrated analysis of shared genes and potential treatment targets.",
        "abstract": "Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) is a significant global health issue due to its high incidence, drug resistance, contagious nature, and impact on people with compromised immune systems. As mentioned by the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is responsible for more global fatalities than any other infectious illness. On the other side, WHO also claims that noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people yearly worldwide. In this regard, several studies suggest that PTB and NCDs are linked in various ways and that people with PTB are more likely to acquire NCDs. At the same time, NCDs can increase susceptibility to active TB infection. Furthermore, because of potential drug interactions and therapeutic challenges, treating individuals with both PTB and NCDs can be difficult. This study focuses on seven NCDs (lung cancer (LC), diabetes mellitus (DM), Parkinson's disease (PD), silicosis (SI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)) and rigorously presents the genetic relationship with PTB regarding shared genes and outlines possible treatment plans. BlueThis study aims to identify the drug components that can regulate abnormal gene expression in NCDs. The study will reveal hub genes, potential biomarkers, and drug components associated with hub genes through statistical measures. This will contribute to targeted therapeutic interventions. Numerous investigations, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), gene regulatory network (GRN), enrichment analysis, physical interaction, and protein-chemical interaction, have been carried out to demonstrate the genetic correlation between PTB and NCDs. During the study, nine shared genes such as TNF, IL10, NLRP3, IL18, IFNG, HMGB1, CXCL8, IL17A, and NFKB1 were discovered between TB and the above-mentioned NCDs, and five hub genes (NFKB1, TNF, CXCL8, NLRP3, and IL10) were selected based on degree values. In this study, we found that all of the hub genes are linked with the 10 drug components, and it was observed that aspirin CTD 00005447 was mostly associated with all the other hub genes. This bio-informatics study may help researchers better understand the cause of PTB and its relationship with NCDs, and eventually, this can lead to exploring effective treatment plans.",

        "abstract": "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are public health threats globally and recognized impediments to socioeconomic development. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and clustering of NCDs risk factors among Bangladeshi men and women aged 20-59 years using nationally representative data. This study was conducted in 82 rural, nonslum urban, and slum clusters across all eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh using multistage cluster sampling. A total of 4917 men and 4905 women aged 20-59 years were included in the study. Descriptive analyses were performed to report the prevalence and distribution of behavioral and clinical risk factors. Multivariable binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with the coexistence of three or more NCD risk factors. The prevalence of tobacco use (any form), insufficient physical activity, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, overweight and obesity, and central obesity were 38.3%, 13.6%, 87.1%, 42.3%, and 36.0%, respectively. Furthermore, 21.9% and 4.9% participants had hypertension and self-reported diabetes, respectively. Regarding the clustering of risk factors, 37.1% men and 50.8% women had at least three NCD risk factors. Only 3.0% men and 1.8% women reported no NCD risk factors. Age, place of residence, education, and wealth status were associated with the presence of at least three risk factors for both sexes. Since a large proportion of Bangladeshi 20-59 years old population had multiple risk factors, population-based programs with multisectoral approaches are essential to reduce NCDs among Bangladeshi women and men.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic comorbidities are involved in the development and progression of noncommunicable diseases. There is convincing evidence that lifestyles are important contributors to metabolic comorbidities. This study measured the metabolic comorbidity score of South Asian adults and identified its relationship with lifestyles. The authors studied 5 South Asian countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, using the World Health Organization's STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance data between 2014 and 2019. This was a nationally representative and cross-sectional survey on participants aged 15-69 years. The sample size was 27,616. The outcome was metabolic comorbidity score, calculated on the basis of total cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, and abdominal obesity. Total metabolic comorbidity score of each participant varied between 0 and 8. It was then divided into 3 ranges: the lowest range (total metabolic comorbidity score <3), medium range (total metabolic comorbidity score ≥3 and ≤5), and the highest range (total metabolic comorbidity score ≥6). On the basis of the outcome of nonparametric receiver operating characteristics analysis, the medium and the highest ranges together were considered as higher metabolic comorbidity score. The lowest range was considered as lower metabolic comorbidity score. The higher metabolic comorbidity score was coded as 1, and the lower metabolic comorbidity score was coded as 0. Thus, the outcome variable, metabolic comorbidity score, became a binary variable. Exposures included physical inactivity (<150 minutes of medium-to-vigorous physical activity/week), high daily sedentary time (≥9 hours/day), use of tobacco (present or past smoking or daily use of smokeless tobacco products), and consumption of alcohol (at least once per month in the last 1 year). Binomial logistic regression model produced the OR with corresponding 95% CIs. The prevalence of higher metabolic comorbidity score was 34% among South Asian adults, 25% among the male respondents, and 41% among the female respondents. Participants who were physically inactive (OR=1.26; 95% CI= 1.17, 1.36), had high sedentary time (OR=1.24; 95% CI=1.11, 1.33), and consumed alcohol (OR=1.40; 95% CI=1.23, 1.53) showed higher metabolic comorbidity score than participants who were physically active, had low sedentary time, and did not consume alcohol respectively. However, the authors found an inverse association (OR=0.75; 95% CI=0.71, 0.81) between the use of tobacco and metabolic comorbidity score. One third of South Asian adults had higher metabolic comorbidity score. Physical inactivity, daily sedentary hours, and minimal alcohol consumption were associated with higher metabolic comorbidity score.",

        "title": "Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

Therefore, new strategies to mitigate risk are urgently needed. However, despite the high burden of disease associated with dementia in LMICs, research into dementia risk profiling and risk prediction modelling is limited. Further, dementia risk prediction models developed in high income countries generally do not transport well to LMICs suggesting that context-specific models are instead needed. New prediction models have been developed, in China and Mexico only, with varying predictive accuracy. However, none has been externally validated or incorporated variables that may be important for predicting dementia risk in LMIC settings such as socio-economic status, literacy, healthcare access, nutrition, stress, pollutants, and occupational hazards. Since there is not yet any curative treatment for dementia, developing a context-specific dementia prediction model is urgently needed for planning early interventions for vulnerable groups, particularly for resource constrained LMIC settings.",

        "abstract": "Studies have shown that abnormal temperature at night is a risk factor for respiratory health. However, there is limited evidence on the impact of hot and cold nights on cause-specific diseases such as pneumonia, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. We collected daily data on pneumonia hospitalisations in children under five years from 2011 to 2017 in three low-, middle- and high-income countries (Bangladesh, China, and Australia). The intensity of hot and cold nights was measured by excess temperature. A space-time-stratified case-crossover analysis was used to estimate the association between hot and cold nights and childhood pneumonia hospitalisations. We further estimated the fraction of childhood pneumonia hospitalisations attributable to hot and cold nights. Both hot and cold nights were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, with a greater disease burden from hot nights. Specifically, the fraction of childhood pneumonia attributable to hot nights was the largest in Australia [21.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 11.8%-28.1%], followed by Bangladesh (15.2%, 95% CI: 4.1%-23.8%) and China (2.7%, 95% CI: 0.4%-4.7%). Additionally, the fraction of childhood pneumonia attributable to cold nights was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.4%-2.0%) in Bangladesh and 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1%-0.7%) in China. This multi-country study suggests that hot and cold nights are not only associated with a higher risk of pneumonia hospitalisations in children but also responsible for substantial fraction of hospitalisations, with a greater impact from hot nights.",

PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were systematically searched for population-based studies testing the associations of GLDs with liver-related outcomes in individuals with T2D and no liver disease other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from inception to 23 February 2024. GLDs included SGLT2is, TZDs, insulin, GLP-1 RAs and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4Is). Ten cohort studies, comprising 1,274,641 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up period ranged from 8.9 to 76 months. Of all the GLDs under investigation, SGLT2is were associated with the strongest reduction in NAFLD incidence, cirrhosis, and composite liver-related events compared to other medications. TZDs were associated with a reduced risk of developing NAFLD and cirrhosis but were not significantly associated with a lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. GLP-1 RAs demonstrated a significant association with reduced liver-related mortality. Observational data from population-based studies suggest that GLDs such as SGLT2is are associated with beneficial long-term liver-related outcomes in T2D patients with NAFLD. Additional studies, including randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up, are needed to confirm these findings. PROSPERO CRD442024536872.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care is paramount in the modern clinical field worldwide. However, in Bangladesh, its acceptance is limited compared to other related sectors, despite the country suffering from a huge burden of life-limiting diseases. Besides, PC teams and their approach to care are entirely different from the conventional clinical approach. This study aimed to explore the challenges faced by healthcare providers working in the palliative care unit in Bangladesh, including all groups. This was a cross-sectional descriptive survey involving palliative care providers. A self-administered pre-tested questionnaire was used for data collection. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Chi-square at p <0.05. The mean age of the respondents was 33.59 ± 8.05 years, and barely most (82.5%) had served for 7-9 years. More than half (51%) of doctors and 31% of nurses claimed patient agitation as a challenge. Almost all groups of respondents exhibit ethical dilemma as a barrier, although a significant relationship was found between professional level and ethical dilemma. More than half of doctors (51%), 41.5% of nurses, and 29.5% of PCA-ward staff mentioned the lack of telemedicine facilities as a challenge. Nearly half (47.1%) of doctors and nurses claimed that patients' families had made patient care difficult, on the other hand, PCA-ward staff (70%) group ignorance of family did the same thing. Opioid phobia of other health professionals restricted the growth mentioned by the majority of all four groups of respondents. A significant relationship was found between limited dose formulation and experience of HPs (p<0.07). At the institutional level, 93.3% of nursing staff agreed that the lack of supporting staff was a drawback. A significant relationship was also found between the type of institution and the lack of a support system to conduct home-based care (p<0.002). Moreover, the majority (83.3%) of PCA-WS exhibit a lack of career development opportunities (p<0.001) as a barrier, besides, more than 7 out of 10 doctors (7.2%) felt social discrimination as a challenge(p<0.001). Introducing new concepts comes with obstacles, but proper planning and awareness can make it necessary. Incorporating it into primary healthcare can create new job opportunities and increase familiarity among the general population. Training healthcare professionals on opioid handling can also increase its acceptance.",

        "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

To examine CHW programs in the region, we conducted a narrative review of the peer-reviewed and grey literatures, as well as eliciting opinions from experts. Common roles of CHWs include health education, community mobilization, and community-based services, particularly related to reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. Some countries utilize CHWs for non-communicable diseases and other emerging health issues. To maximize the potential contribution of CHWs to achieving Universal Health Coverage, we recommend future research and policy focus on strengthening existing health systems to support the expansion of CHWs roles and better integrating of CHWs into national PHC systems.

        "abstract": "Despite being initially perceived as a local infectious disease, COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most perilous global health threats, significantly impacting the psychological well-being of individuals worldwide. This cross-sectional descriptive study investigates the psychological distress, fear, and coping mechanisms among Thai people residing in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. This online cross-sectional survey targeted Thai individuals during the first and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants aged 18 and above who provided consent self-reported their responses to the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Data collection occurred between November 2020 and January 2021 across four regions of Thailand. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses explored associations between contextual factors and the variables of interest. Out of 498 survey respondents, with an average age of 43.07 (SD = 13.69) years, 81.9% were female, and 61.6% self-identified as healthcare workers, with 47.59% identified as frontline healthcare workers. Findings revealed that 46% of participants experienced moderate-to-very high levels of psychological distress, 14.3% reported high levels of fear of COVID-19, and 35.1% exhibited low resilient coping. Factors such as changes in employment status or financial situations, comorbidities, contact with known or suspected COVID-19 cases, recent healthcare utilization for COVID-19-related stress, and elevated fear of COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Conversely, being nurses and perceived better mental health status were linked to more effective coping strategies. These results emphasize the critical importance of government interventions to safeguard the psychological well-being of healthcare workers and the broader Thai population. Urgent measures to bolster resilience among these groups during and after the pandemic are imperative.",

The latest STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPS) report of WHO member states studied on overweight/obesity from 2000 to 2020 were reviewed and related data were assessed further. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was pooled using the random effects model. The subgroup analysis and <i>meta</i>-regression were performed based on countries' economic status obtained from the World Bank's country development index 2019. Study heterogeneity and publication bias were also observed. Out of 73 studies with 469,766 participants analyzed, the highest overweight/obesity prevalence was found in American Samoa (93.5 %), while Democratic People's Republic of Korea had the lowest prevalence (4.4 %). The overall weighted pooled prevalence of overweight/obesity regardless of countries economic status was 37.0 % [95 % CI: 33 %-42 %]. There was significant heterogeneity in the prevalence of overweight/obesity (I2 = 99.91 %; p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed a higher prevalence in high-income countries [60 %; 95 % CI: 47 %-72 %]. Meta-regression revealed a significant (p = 0.001) association and a 14 % increase chance of having overweight/obesity with increasing economic status. The prevalence of overweight/obesity is high worldwide, especially in high-income countries that demands a large-scale awareness campaigns and effective initiatives to control overweight/obesity and the associated risk factors of adults of these countries.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity throughout the world. Increased life expectancy leads to increase prevalence of non-communicable diseases among the elderly people including Bangladesh. However, different studies reported high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension ranging from 52.6% to 67.9% among the elderly people in different countries. With this view, we aimed to assess the frequency of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) among the elderly hypertensive people and its associated risk factors and treatment pattern in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional type of observational study recruited 246 eligible hypertensive elderly patients attending in 250 Bedded General Hospital, Jashore, Bangladesh dated from 1st July to 31st December 2022. A structured questionnaire was developed and data on associated risk factors, treatment pattern and current blood pressure (BP) measurement were collected by face-to-face interview for the purposive sampling technique. The mean age of our study patients was 72 ± 7 years with a male and female ratio nearly 1:1. Of the total hypertensive patients aged over 65 years or more, 56.5% remained with uncontrolled hypertension even on their prescribed antihypertensive medications. The mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were significantly high (<i>P</i> < 0.001) as 167 ± 22 mm Hg and 95 ± 11 mm Hg, respectively, among the uncontrolled hypertensive patients. However, we noticed the mean SBP and DBP among the total hypertensive patients were also significantly high (<i>P</i> < 0.001) as 148 ± 27 mm Hg and 87 ± 13 mm Hg, respectively. In this study, we reported that the mean number of last prescribed antihypertensive medications used by the total patients was 2 ± 1 (<i>P</i> =0.224) which was similar among the controlled and uncontrolled hypertensive patient groups. Among the elderly hypertensive patients, the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications were Amlodipine 39.8% (<i>P</i> =0.006), Olmesartan 29.3% (<i>P</i> = 0.186), Losartan 24.4% (<i>P</i> = 0.127), Bisoprolol 15.0% (<i>P</i> = 0.266) and Atenolol 14.6% (<i>P</i> = 0.224).

        "abstract": "In the south Asian region, delivering non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and control services through existing primary health-care (PHC) facilities is urgently required yet currently challenging. As the first point of contact with the health-care system, PHC offers an ideal window for prevention and continuity of care over the life course, yet the implementation of PHC to address NCDs is insufficient. This review considers evidence from five south Asian countries to derive policy-relevant recommendations for designing integrated PHC systems that include NCD care. Findings reveal high political commitment but poor multisectoral engagement and health systems preparedness for tackling chronic diseases at the PHC level. There is a shortage of skilled human resources, requisite infrastructure, essential NCD medicines and technologies, and dedicated financing. Although innovations supporting integrated interventions exist, such as innovations focusing on community-centric approaches, scaling up remains problematic. To deliver NCD services sustainably, governments must aim for increased financing and a redesign of PHC service.",

        "abstract": "Undernutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a small vulnerable newborn. Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) contain both macro- and micronutrients and can help prevent multiple nutritional deficiencies. We examined the effects of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy compared with 1) iron and folic acid or standard of care (IFA/SOC) or 2) multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) and identified characteristics that modified the estimates of effects of SQ-LNSs on birth outcomes. We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 4 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy (n = 5273). We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with IFA/SOC or MMS and pooled the estimates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether the results differed depending on methods for gestational age dating, birth anthropometry, or study design. SQ-LNSs (compared with IFA/SOC) increased birth weight [mean difference: +49 g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 26, 71 g] and all birth anthropometric z-scores (+0.10-0.13 standard deviation); they reduced risk of low birth weight by 11%, newborn stunting by 17%, newborn wasting by 11%, and small head size by 15%. Only 2 trials compared SQ-LNSs and MMSs; P values for birth outcomes were >0.10 except for head circumference (e.g., z-score for gestational age: +0.11; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.23). Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with IFA/SOC were greater among female infants and, for certain outcomes, among mothers with body mass index <20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, inflammation, malaria, or household food insecurity. Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with MMSs were greater for certain outcomes among female infants, first-born infants, and mothers <25 y. SQ-LNSs had positive impacts on multiple outcomes compared to IFA/SOC, but further research directly comparing SQ-LNSs and MMSs is needed. Targeting SQ-LNSs to vulnerable subgroups may be worth considering. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021283391.",

The present study aims to explore the mental well-being status and its socio-economic determinants among the older adults living in the Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted among adults aged ≥ 60 residing in five sub-camps within the Rohingya refugee camp of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted between November and December 2021. The 14-item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale was used to assess mental well-being. A cumulated score was derived using the scale ranging from 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater levels of mental well-being. A generalized linear regression model was used to examine the socio-economic factors associated with the mental well-being of older adults. A total of 864 older adults participated in the study having a mean mental well-being score of 45.4. Regression analysis revealed that the difference in the logs of mental well-being score was expected to be significantly lower among participants aged 70-79 years (β: - 1.661; 95% CI: - 2.750 to - 0.572; p = 0.003), aged ≥ 80 years (β: - 3.198; 95% CI: - 5.114 to - 1.282; p = 0.001), and those with any non-communicable chronic conditions (β: - 2.903; 95% CI: - 3.833 to - 1.974; p < 0.001) when compared to their counterparts. Conversely, the difference in the logs of mental well-being score was expected to be significantly higher among individuals with formal schooling (β: 3.370, 95% CI: 1.855 to 4.886, p < 0.001) and those having additional income besides aid (β: 1.629; 95% CI: 0.642 to 2.615; p = 0.001), compared to their respective counterparts.

The National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh participated in May Measurement Month (MMM) campaigns in 2017, 2018, 2019, as well as in 2021 as a part of a global initiative aimed at raising awareness of high blood pressure (BP) and to act as a temporary solution to the lack of nationwide screening programmes. This opportunistic screening of voluntary participants aged ≥18 years was carried out from May to July 2021. Data were collected from more than 150 screening sites in all 64 districts in Bangladesh. Blood pressure measurement, the definition of hypertension, and statistical analysis followed the MMM protocol. Data on 28 355 individuals were finally analysed. Among the participants, 17 941 (63.3%) were female. After multiple imputation, 11 194 (39.5%) had hypertension. Among the 11 194 participants with hypertension, 78.8% were aware of having hypertension and 65.6% were on antihypertensive medication. Among 11 194 participants with hypertension, 7340 participants (65.6%) were on antihypertensive medication and 43.8% had controlled BP (<140/90 mmHg). Of those on antihypertensive medication, 66.8% had controlled BP.

Encouraging healthy diets requires stronger policies for healthier food environments. This study reviewed and assessed food environment policies in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka from 2020 to 2022 using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) and compared them with global best practices. Seven policy domains and six infrastructure support domains were considered, employing 47 good practice indicators to prevent NCDs. Stakeholders from government and non-governmental sectors in South Asia (n = 148) were invited to assess policy and infrastructure support implementation using the Delphi method. Implementation of food environment policies and infrastructure support in these countries was predominantly weak. Labelling, monitoring, and leadership policies received a moderate rating, with a focus on food safety, hygiene, and quality rather than obesity prevention. Key policy gaps prioritized for attention included front-of-pack labelling, healthy food subsidies, unhealthy food taxation, restrictions on unhealthy food promotion, and improvements in school nutrition standards to combat NCDs. Urgent action is required to expand food policies beyond hygiene and food security measures. Comprehensive strategies targeting NCD prevention are crucial to combat the escalating burden of NCDs in the region.

        "abstract": "Southeast Asia is undergoing an epidemiological transition with non-communicable illnesses becoming increasingly important, yet infectious diseases (tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, malaria) remain widely prevalent in some populations, while emerging and zoonotic diseases threaten. There are also limited population-level estimates of many important heath conditions. This restricts evidence-based decision-making for disease control and prevention priorities. Cross-sectional surveys can be efficient epidemiological tools to measure the prevalence of a wide range of diseases, but no systematic assessment of their coverage of different health conditions has been produced for the region. We conducted a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Index Medicus, and additionally Google Scholar. Our inclusion criteria were cross-sectional surveys conducted with community-based recruitment, in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, published between January 1, 2010 and January 27, 2021, and reporting the prevalence of any health condition. 542 publications from 337 surveys were included. Non-communicable conditions (n = 205) were reported by more surveys than infectious conditions (n = 124). Disability (n = 49), self-report history of any disease or symptoms (n = 35), and self-perceived health status (n = 34), which reflect a holistic picture of health, were studied by many fewer surveys. In addition, 45 surveys studied symptomatic conditions which overlap between non-communicable and infectious conditions. The most surveyed conditions were undernutrition, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, intestinal parasites, malaria, anemia, diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections. These conditions overlap with the most important causes of death and disability in the Global Burden of Disease study. However, other high-burden conditions (e.g. hearing loss, headache disorder, low back pain, chronic liver and kidney diseases, and cancers) were rarely studied. There were relatively few recent surveys from which to estimate representative prevalences and trends of health conditions beyond those known to be high burden. Expanding the spectrum of health conditions in cross-sectional surveys could improve understanding of evolving disease patterns in the region.",

The STEPwise Approach to the NCD Risk Factor Surveillance survey of 2018 was analyzed to evaluate the association between NCDs and sociodemographic factors, levels of physical activity, and behavioral measurements. Complex survey weight-adjusted logistic models were fitted. From 6875 samples, prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were 27.3%, 9.8%, and 30.2%, respectively. The prevalence of the three NCDs were higher among older respondents. Low occupational activity with obese-BMI status people was more prone to NCDs. Lower prevalence of hypercholesterolemia was observed in Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Mymensingh, whereas lesser diabetes in Khulna region. Likelihood of NCDs were higher among highly educated, urban residents with low physical activity. Lesser physical activity, and lack of weight maintenance were found to be key factors in higher rates of NCDs in Bangladesh. Greater education and less strenuous profession led to a higher chance of NCDs. Overall, physical activity and maintenance of weight seem to be factors driving higher rates of NCDs in Bangladesh.

Studies emphasize the importance of childhood adversity as a risk factor for developing non-communicable diseases, including type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adulthood. This case-control study involved 137 patients with T2DM and 134 non-diabetic adults of both genders (mean age 46.9 and 45.7 years, respectively). In addition to collecting socio-demographic, behavioral, and anthropological data, a 10-item ACE scale was utilized to gather information regarding childhood adversities, while perceived stress was assessed using the perceived stress scale-4. Fasting and 2-hour post glucose load blood sugar levels, HbA1c, and fasting lipid profiles were measured. Both univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate whether ACE is a potential risk factor for T2DM, with a significance level of 0.05. Around two-thirds of T2DM patients reported having ACE scores of 4 or higher, with the mean ACE score significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (3.96 vs. 3.34; p<0.0001). The logistic regression analysis found that T2DM was linked to female gender, hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of DM, higher perceived stress, and a higher ACE score of 4 and above. After adjusting for confounding factors, individuals with an ACE score of 4 or higher had a significantly greater risk of developing T2DM (OR: 2.24; 95% CI 1.238-4.061). The study revealed a significant association between higher ACE scores and an increased risk of developing T2DM.

        "title": "An innovative fractional-order evolutionary game theoretical study of personal protection, quarantine, and isolation policies for combating epidemic diseases.",
        "abstract": "This study uses imposed control techniques and vaccination game theory to study disease dynamics with transitory or diminishing immunity. Our model uses the ABC fractional-order derivative mechanism to show the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as personal protection or awareness, quarantine, and isolation to simulate the essential control strategies against an infectious disease spread in an infinite and uniformly distributed population. A comprehensive evolutionary game theory study quantified the significant influence of people's vaccination choices, with government forces participating in vaccination programs to improve obligatory control measures to reduce epidemic spread. This model uses the intervention options described above as a control strategy to reduce disease prevalence in human societies. Again, our simulated results show that a combined control strategy works exquisitely when the disease spreads even faster. A sluggish dissemination rate slows an epidemic outbreak, but modest control techniques can reestablish a disease-free equilibrium. Preventive vaccination regulates the border between the three phases, while personal protection, quarantine, and isolation methods reduce disease transmission in existing places. Thus, successfully combining these three intervention measures reduces epidemic or pandemic size, as represented by line graphs and 3D surface diagrams. For the first time, we use a fractional-order derivate to display the phase-portrayed trajectory graph to show the model's dynamics if immunity wanes at a specific pace, considering various vaccination cost and effectiveness settings.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to develop a prediction model for identifying a woman with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at high risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) post-birth. Utilising data from 1299 women in the Lifestyle Intervention IN Gestational Diabetes (LIVING) study, two models were developed: one for pregnancy and another for postpartum. Key predictors included glucose test results, medical history, and biometric indicators. Of the initial cohort, 124 women developed T2DM within three years. The study identified seven predictors for the antenatal T2DM risk prediction model and four for the postnatal one. The models demonstrated good to excellent predictive ability, with Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) values of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.80) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.88) for the antenatal and postnatal models, respectively. Both models underwent rigorous validation, showing minimal optimism in predictive capability. Antenatal model, considering the Youden index optimal cut-off point of 0.096, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were measured as 70.97%, 70.81%, and 70.82%, respectively. For the postnatal model, considering the cut-off point 0.086, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were measured as 81.40%, 75.60%, and 76.10%, respectively. These models are effective for predicting T2DM risk in women with GDM, although external validation is recommended before widespread application.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory diseases are the most common and severe health complication and a leading cause of death worldwide. Despite breakthroughs in diagnosis and treatment, few safe and effective therapeutics have been reported. Phytochemicals are gaining popularity due to their beneficial effects and low toxicity. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites with high molecular weights found at high levels in natural food sources such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and citrus seeds. Over recent decades, polyphenols and their beneficial effects on human health have been the subject of intense research, with notable successes in preventing major chronic non-communicable diseases. Many respiratory syndromes can be treated effectively with polyphenolic supplements, including acute lung damage, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and lung cancer. This review summarizes the role of polyphenols in respiratory conditions with sufficient experimental data, highlights polyphenols with beneficial effects for each, and identifies those with therapeutic potential and their underlying mechanisms. Moreover, clinical studies and future research opportunities in this area are discussed.",

        "title": "Adaptation of complex interventions for people with long-term conditions: a scoping review.",
        "abstract": "Adaptation seeks to transfer and implement healthcare interventions developed and evaluated in one context to another. The aim of this scoping review was to understand current approaches to the adaptation of complex interventions for people with long-term conditions (LTCs) and to identify issues for studies performed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Bibliographic databases were searched from 2000 to October 2022. This review involved five stages: (i) definition of the research question(s); (ii) identifying relevant studies; (iii) study selection; (iv) data charting; and (v) data synthesis. Extraction included an assessment of the: rationale for adaptation; stages and levels of adaptation; use of theoretical frameworks, and quality of reporting using a checklist based on the 2021 ADAPT guidance. Twenty-five studies were included from across 21 LTCs and a range of complex interventions. The majority (16 studies) focused on macro (national or international) level interventions. The rationale for adaptation included intervention transfer across geographical settings [high-income country (HIC) to LMIC: six studies, one HIC to another: eight studies, one LMIC to another: two studies], or transfer across socio-economic/racial groups (five studies), or transfer between different health settings within a single country (one study). Overall, studies were judged to be of moderate reporting quality (median score 23, maximum 46), and typically focused on early stages of adaptation (identification and development) with limited outcome evaluation or implementation assessment of the adapted version of the intervention. Improved reporting of the adaptation for complex interventions targeted at LTCs is needed. Development of future adaptation methods guidance needs to consider the needs and priorities of the LMIC context.",
