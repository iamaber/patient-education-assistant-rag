        "title": "Prevalence and Associated Factors of Prediabetes and Diabetes in Rural and Peri-Urban Bangladesh: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Background and objectives The global burden of prediabetes and diabetes is rising rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, where lifestyle and nutritional transitions are accelerating. Economically disadvantaged rural populations often lack awareness and access to care, making them highly vulnerable. Measuring the prevalence and identifying associated factors is essential for guiding public health strategies and resource allocation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi community to inform targeted prevention and control strategies. Methodology We recruited 891 adults for this cross-sectional study in January-June 2020 through random sampling from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System in Bangladesh, ensuring at least five years of residency. Trained Community Health Workers collected sociodemographic data using a semi-structured questionnaire and performed physical examination and anthropometric measurements. We used fasting blood sugar to screen patients for prediabetes and diabetes, and measured serum creatinine and urine albumin to creatinine ratio to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also collected blood samples to measure serum albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood and urine samples were tested in an accredited laboratory. Results Prevalence of prediabetes was 38% (n=343), and diabetes was 17% (n=151). Age-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 5%, 12% and 22%, and of diabetes were 1%, 3% and 13%, for the age groups of 18-30, 31-45, and ≥46 years, respectively. Sex-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 22% and 17%, and diabetes were 9% and 8%, for female and male participants, respectively. In multiple multinomial logistic regression, for prediabetes, significant risk factor was age ≥31 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.84, 95%CI 1.64-4.92), and protective factors were smokeless tobacco use (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.94) and hypoalbuminemia (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.24-0.99), and for diabetes, significant risk factors were age ≥31 years (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 1.37-11.95), abdominal obesity (aOR 2.80, 95%CI 1.49-5.30), CKD (aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.70-4.62), hypercholesterolemia (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.17-3.30) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.44-3.79), and protective factors were being female (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.066-0.68), and smokeless tobacco user (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.63). Conclusion This study reveals a high burden of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi population. The findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen community-based screening and targeted prevention strategies to address the growing diabetes burden in underserved areas.",

        "abstract": "Infectious disease research is essential for disease prevention and management within refugee camps and informal settlements. The objective of this study is to identify the characteristics of existing infectious disease research in these settings and to assess stated research challenges, ethical considerations, and studied interventions within these studies. This is a systematic review of forty primary studies focused on infectious disease research conducted among displaced populations. Included studies are published in English between 1995 and 2023. Three databases were searched, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, and this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023461567). The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. 85 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 34) researched an intervention for infectious disease prevention or control and 70 % of studies (<i>n</i> = 28) were randomized controlled trials. 75 % of studies were located in Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 15) or Pakistan (<i>n</i> = 15). 40 % of studies focused on diarrheal diseases (<i>n</i> = 16) and 28 % on malaria (<i>n</i> = 11). Common identified research challenges included population mobility, limited external validity, and low recruitment. No studies included the community in the initial study conception or investigated the research impact on the community. Community involvement was often through community health workers (45 %). Of the 18 studies that studied a resource-based intervention, 20 % explicitly noted that the intervention was unsustainable. While guidelines for conducting research in displaced settings exist, there are gaps in their utilization. We identified a disconnect between where displaced individuals reside and where research is conducted, as well as a prioritization of particular infectious diseases. Researchers identified numerous challenges in conducting research in these settings, though the community was rarely involved in the research. Context-specific considerations and community involvement are vital in research with displaced communities. Wellcome Trust (Contract Number C-010,656).",

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

        "title": "Analysis of ICU resistome dynamics in patients, staff and environment for the identification of predictive biomarkers of sepsis and early mortality.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis, posing a critical challenge to healthcare systems, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), where multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) threaten patient survival. This study offers a unique, real-world perspective on AMR dynamics by analyzing 96 metagenomic samples from three key sources: oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of deceased ICU patients (both postadmission and antemortem), healthcare workers, and high-touch ICU surfaces. Findings revealed the ICU environment as a major AMR reservoir, with oropharyngeal swabs carrying the highest AMR burden. While healthcare staff facilitated MDRO spread, they were not primary sources. Staff microbiomes' MDRO pattern closely resembled environmental samples. Key AMR species included B. fragilis, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, with P. aeruginosa persisting on high-touch surfaces. Tetracycline resistance was the most prevalent, with common resistances comprising 36.1% of all detected AMR markers. Staff microbial community exhibited higher resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, and cephamycins. A 10-day survival threshold distinguished early (EM) and late mortality (LM) groups. EM patients exhibited unique AMR species in the oropharynx, suggesting respiratory-driven infections, while LM patients showed greater gut-associated resistance. Higher rectal AMR counts correlated with prolonged survival. Notably, four key MDROs (L. monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis, S. haemolyticus, and S. agalactiae) were enriched in sepsis patients, suggesting early risk markers. Fewer new resistances emerged in rectal than oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to antibiotic selection pressure. Vancomycin and levofloxacin, frequently co-administered, exerted stronger selective pressure in the oropharynx, possibly explaining the high MRSA prevalence in patient and environmental samples.",

        "title": "The practice of gender and protection mainstreaming in health response in humanitarian crisis - A case study from the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The health system is required to be safe, equitable, and accessible to all ages, gender, and vulnerable groups, including older persons and persons with disability, and address their specific needs and concerns. However, limited evidence is available on the effectiveness and practicality of gender and protection mainstreaming interventions in health response in humanitarian crises. The overall objective of the research was to explore practices, gaps, and challenges and generate recommendations regarding gender and protection mainstreaming in health response to the Rohingya refugee crisis in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. The research employed a qualitative case study design to explore the practice of gender and protection mainstreaming in health response in Cox's Bazar. Data collection methods include an extensive literature review and in-depth interviews with professionals. The professionals interviewed from the area of health and protection, specifically gender, child protection, emergency health intervention, and primary health activities. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis related to gender and protection mainstreaming. Limitations were assessed as to researcher bias because the researcher did all the coding; however, an open recording process, inter-literature cross-potentiation, and ethical considerations of research helped add to the reliability of the research. Exclusion criteria were defined to ensure data consistency, removing insufficiently detailed responses not pertinent to the research objectives. The study found a range of good practices on gender and protection mainstreaming in health response, e.g., placement of a gender action plan, monitoring system for gender and disability inclusion, emergency preparedness and response system, availability of sex-segregated toilets and waiting spaces, availability of gender-based violence service and engagement of female community health workers. The study also revealed some best practices which have the potential to scale up, e,g. psychosocial spaces at health facilities for children, palliative care for terminally ill patients, integrated medical and protection services, and facilitation of community health facility support groups. Critical gaps were found in the areas of women's leadership, coordination, capacity building, targeted interventions for vulnerable groups, infrastructural adaptation and consultation with the community on their concerns. We urge policymakers, sector coordinators, health program management, healthcare workers, and global stakeholders to address the gaps and challenges, learn and scale up the best practices, and take action to implement the study's recommendations to maximise gender and protection mainstreaming in health response.",

        "abstract": "Forced displacement has reached unprecedented levels globally, with women and girls comprising over half of the refugee population. In South and Southeast Asia, transit refugee women face unique health challenges, yet their health experiences and needs remain underexplored and underserved. This review explores the existing evidence on the health experiences and healthcare access of transit refugee women in these regions. A search was conducted using PubMed [MEDLINE], Scopus, Google Scholar, alongside UNHCR, WHO, and IOM databases between October 2023 and January 2024. Peer-reviewed and grey literature published from 2013 to 2024 that analysed health outcomes and experiences of transit refugee women in South and Southeast Asia were included. A narrative synthesis was used to identify the major themes related to the health outcomes and healthcare access of transit refugee women. Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria, of which a majority of the studies were from Bangladesh, Thailand-Myanmar border, and Malaysia, mainly drawing insights from Rohingya, Karen, and Chin communities. Key health issues included sexual and reproductive health, including family planning, contraceptive use, HIV transmission, sexual and gender-based violence, and mental health. Distance and availability of health services, spousal consent for health-seeking, out-of-pocket health expenditure, cultural and religious beliefs, and stigmatization were barriers to accessing healthcare. These barriers may contribute to foregoing contraceptive usage, poor family planning, poor HIV-related health knowledge transmission, high psychological distress, and poor mental health outcomes. However, targeted interventions such as having the UNHCR card, the availability of health clinics within camps, recruiting female health workers, provision of counselling and health education programs, can positively influence health outcomes, healthcare seeking and utilization behaviours, and health knowledge transmission. Transit refugee women in South and Southeast Asia face significant challenges due to unmet health needs and limited healthcare access. These insights highlight the need for future health research, programs and policy action to better integrate targeted, gender-responsive interventions that can enhance health access of this vulnerable subgroup regionally.",

        "abstract": "The world is facing Covid-19 pandemic without any specific therapy against it. So, prevention of this highly contagious disease is still the key to success against it. The Health care workers (HCWs) are playing vital role to reduce death and sufferings. HCWs are at a high risk of getting the infection and the source of transmission in the community. Addressing the pitfalls in safety practice against Covid-19 pandemic and attempt to solve the issues will definitely improve the strength of fighters and overcome the situation. Therefore, the objective of the study was to assess the status of practice of safety tools toward Corona virus disease-2019 (Covid-19) among healthcare professionals. Findings of this study might be utilized for promulgation of policy and program for upcoming days. This cross-sectional survey was conducted among the adult Bangladeshi healthcare professionals of purposively selected three type of healthcare facilities- a Tertiary level hospital: Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University as well as District hospital and Upazila health Complex from highly infected district Narayangonj and low infected district- Brahmanbaria. A number of 241 HCWs were interviewed using semi structured self-administered questionnaire electronically via-email, Facebook Messenger or other social media communication. This study found that a good number (about 14.0%) of the HCWs do not practice frequent hand washing, as defined by at least 3 times during each duty period. Most of the doctors (46.8%) used soap water to disinfectant from Covid-19 which is followed by hexisol (27.9%) and sanitizer (26.5%), whereas more than 55.3% allied health professional used sanitizer for the same purpose which is followed by soap water (29.8%) and hexisol (14.9%). Doctors are more frequent in using all form of disinfectants.more than 90.0% are careful in using their protective equipment and dress. But a significant amount (about 25.0%) of them don't participate in health safety training after the outbreak till the study time. A significant number (30.0%) cannot maintain appropriate quarantine with their family.A significant number of respondents (46.0%) have no home isolation facility. More than 51.0% have no separate donning and doffing room at their workplace. The health care workers serving the Covid-19 diseased patients might be super spreader of this highly contagious disease. Awareness and appropriate safety practice is the burning issue. Organized training regarding protection, supply of safety logistics and strong monitoring are the keys to success to stop spreading of this disease.",

        "abstract": "The WHO's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) in young infants <2 months of age includes the identification and management of signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI). However, equal importance is given to all the PSBI signs, which signal the need for referral and hospital management, except for fast breathing in infants aged 7-59 days, for which outpatient treatment by clinical staff working at a health facility is recommended. Moreover, studies to validate the importance of clinical signs of PSBI have mostly used the need for hospitalisation as the outcome. There is a need to further examine the association of signs of PSBI individually and in combination with risk of mortality and to analyse global data to inform global recommendations. We will create a dataset that integrates data from population-based studies globally with similar designs that have examined the presence of signs of PSBI identified by frontline health workers throughout the young infant period (days 0 to <60) and that have also recorded infant vital status. We will conduct pooled, individual-level analyses of the frequency of identification of signs individually and in combinations and will conduct three types of analyses of association of signs of PSBI with mortality: (1) case fatality, which has been used in a multisite study of mortality risk associated with signs of PSBI in young infants in Africa; (2) Cox regression, which will enable time-varying analysis of exposure in relation to mortality, as has been done in a multisite study in Asia and (3) machine learning analysis, which has not previously been applied to any of the available data. All prior studies incorporated into our pooled analysis were approved by the independent local ethics committee/institutional review board (IRB) at each study site in each country, and all study participants provided informed consent. This project was approved by the Stanford University School of Medicine IRB protocol 74456.

        "title": "Community views on mass drug administration for soil-transmitted helminths: a qualitative evidence synthesis.",
        "abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are amongst the most common infectious diseases worldwide, with an estimated 24% of the world's population currently infected. Mass drug administration (MDA) is the periodic medicinal treatment, without prior individual diagnosis, of at-risk people living in endemic areas. The World Health Organization currently recommends MDA for STHs. MDA programmes are complex health interventions; achieving adherence is important to their success. Adherence is influenced by the target population's perceptions of the drug, the programme, and those delivering it. To synthesize qualitative research evidence about community experiences and perceptions of mass drug administration programmes for soil-transmitted helminths. To assess whether our findings confirm, extend, enrich, or conflict with those of a 2022 Cochrane qualitative evidence review of mass drug administration programmes for lymphatic filariasis. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and four other databases up to 11 November 2024, together with reference checking, and citation searching. We synthesized qualitative and mixed-methods studies. We included studies exploring community experiences and perceptions of MDA programmes for STHs in any country, conducted between 2001 and 2024. We included all participants of MDA programmes, regardless of disease status, individual participation, or other demographic information. We also included lay healthcare workers and formally qualified healthcare workers, if their perspectives were clearly separated from those of the general population. We collected data on study characteristics and programme delivery, including country, endemicity, drug regimen, how the drugs were delivered, use of health education and sensitization, and adherence monitoring. We conducted thematic analysis using a 'best-fit' framework synthesis based on a framework developed in a 2022 Cochrane review exploring community views on mass drug administration for filariasis (a parasitic infection caused by filarial worms). We conducted a deductive phase, accommodating our data within the existing model, followed by an inductive phase, during which we explored data not accommodated by the framework. We used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess our confidence in the findings, and updated the filariasis review's conceptual model to display our findings. We included 17 studies, conducted in Bangladesh, Benin, India, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Turkey. Four themes emerged, three of which were identified in the review of MDA for lymphatic filariasis. People weigh up the benefits and harms in their decision to participate in MDA, though some may not have a choice. Outcomes of individual participation in MDA may be positive, negative, or both. The decision to partake is a careful balance of risk, benefit, and feasibility (high confidence). Unpleasant associations become part of the narrative and spread rapidly through the community (moderate confidence). Physical and social barriers prevent some people from being able to access MDA even if they want to participate (moderate confidence). Many people are suspicious of MDA programmes, although trust may be built over time. Factors such as historical legacies, rumours, and mistrust of people involved in the programme affect overall trust in drug distribution and influence whether people choose to participate. Past experiences can have a profound effect on people, and negative experiences are likely to deter people from future participation (high confidence). Careful management of the relationships between people implementing the programme and people receiving the programme is important to building trust over time (moderate confidence). The drug distributor's status in the community is often low, and they are not well-equipped to answer the communities' questions. People employed to distribute the drugs during STH treatment campaigns often lack a healthcare background and in-depth training around the drug or the disease itself (moderate confidence). Some community members prefer distribution from people they know or trust (high confidence). However, others place value on the knowledge or status of the drug distributors, and may not participate if the community drug distributors (CDDs) cannot answer their programme-related questions (moderate confidence). Many community members have ideas to improve delivery and want more involvement in the programme. Although some programmes conduct education and sensitization activities prior to drug distribution, many community members still lack awareness of the timing and purpose of the distribution (high confidence). People value distribution strategies that make it easy for everyone to participate, and express a desire for adults in the community to be included in the programme (moderate confidence). Many community members believe a more comprehensive health campaign, which includes improved sanitation, is necessary to tackle STH burden (moderate confidence). One theme that the filariasis review identified was not substantiated by the findings in this review (Programmes expect compliance: this can result in coercion and blame). Despite the prevalence and undoubted impact of MDA programmes over the past 10 years, endemic hotspots and continued transmission are common, due in part to poor community adherence. The 2022 Cochrane review outlined several key community concerns and doubts that hinder the effective implementation of MDA for lymphatic filariasis. This review shows that most of these concerns and doubts are shared by communities targeted for MDA for STHs, indicating that there are fundamental challenges in the overall conceptualization and design of MDA programmes that need to be addressed. TF, MT, RK, and the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group editorial base were funded by UK aid from the UK Government for the benefit of low- and middle-income countries (project number 300342-104).

        "abstract": "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading global cause of maternal deaths, with over 70,000 annual deaths. Low- and middle-income countries disproportionately bear this burden, often due to compromised cold chains for oxytocin and insufficient staff training. This review synthesized thirty publications on heat stable carbetocin (HSC) published from January 2018-March 2025. Eligible studies include randomized trials, systematic and narrative reviews, cost or economic evaluations, and implementation studies. Study findings were categorized into clinical efficacy and safety of HSC, cost-effectiveness, and adoption barriers and facilitators from field implementation, and sustainability strategies. Several large-scale trials, especially the CHAMPION trial, demonstrated that HSC is clinically non-inferior to oxytocin. In a pilot study from Nigeria (n = 18,364 deliveries), 56% of women received HSC for PPH prevention and PPH incidence dropped to 0.8%. Cost models from India estimated that HSC could prevent about 5,500 additional PPH cases and save five maternal lives per 100,000 births when priced comparably to oxytocin. Programs in Kenya and conflict-affected South Sudan achieved >90% coverage of HSC by implementing WHO policy updates, pooled procurement, simulation drills for frontline health workers, and appointing \"PPH champions\". Awareness of uterotonics and PPH danger signs among postpartum women increased from 48% to 81% after community-based intervention in Kenya. The thermostability of HSC (up to three years without refrigeration at a temperature of ≤30°C) addresses gaps in cold chain associated with oxytocin and reduces wastage from degradation. Integrating HSC with tranexamic acid and other postpartum haemorrhage bundle elements further improved maternal outcomes. Heat-stable carbetocin offers a viable, cost-effective uterotonic strategy in LMIC settings. Consistent training, supportive supervision, regulatory oversight, and domestic funding, including private sector investment, are critical to achieving widespread adoption of HSC in LMIC. Expanding HSC across resource-limited settings could substantially reduce PPH-related deaths and accelerate maternal survival goals.",

        "title": "Growth monitoring and promotion program services utilization patterns between home-based and facility-based delivery methods: A comparative analysis.",
        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, utilization of government health facility-based growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services is notably low, prompting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate with the government to enhance GMP service utilization through home-based delivery. Despite this, there is limited information available on home-based GMP service utilization. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of GMP services between home-based and facility-based programs and identifying key factors and barriers to caregiver engagement with GMP services in rural Bangladesh. A descriptive mixed-method study was conducted across six sub-districts from August to December 2019. Three sub-districts with home-based GMP services provided by NGOs were compared with three neighboring sub-districts offering government facility-based GMP services. A total of 3038 randomly selected mothers and children under one year old were included in the quantitative part of the study. Quantitative surveys include information on household socio-demographic information, GMP service components, knowledge, utilization, barriers, and qualitative approaches were used for data collection on caregivers and service providers perspectives on GMP services. Descriptive statistics were conducted for sociodemographic characteristics, caregivers' knowledge, perception and barriers to utilization of GMP services. Student's t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare quantitative and qualitative variables between both GMP arms. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare GMP knowledge. Simple logistic regression identified GMP service use levels and related barriers. Multiple logistic regression was employed to determine statistically significant associations between GMP utilization and independent variables such as caregivers who heard about GMP or GMP cards, were members of an NGO, and lacked interest in GMP services at p-value <0.05 and adjusted risk ratio (ARR) values. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was performed. Results were triangulated across sources. Children's average age was 9.8 months, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio in both groups (home-based vs. facility-based: 51.9% vs. 50.0%). Home-based GMP services exhibited higher utilization rates, with more children receiving weight and length measurements and caregivers receiving counseling than facility-based services (40% vs. 0% utilization, respectively). Caregivers' utilization of GMP services in home-based areas was positively influenced by their knowledge of GMP or GMP cards (Adjusted risk ratio, ARR: 37.4) and their involvement with an NGO, association, or health program (ARR: 1.3). Caregivers in home-based GMP areas relied on NGO staff for service delivery, while those in facility-based areas reported no outreach from government health workers and lacked access to GMP cards due to supply issues. Across both areas, low awareness of GMP services and the absence of incentives contributed to limited utilization. GMP service utilization remains low in rural Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Home-based GMP service utilization was 40% but none of the caregivers utilized facility-based GMP services. Higher utilization in home-based areas was linked to caregiver awareness, access to GMP cards, and NGO involvement, while key barriers included lack of government outreach, supply gaps, and absence of incentives. To improve GMP coverage, government programs should enhance community level outreach, ensure consistent supply of growth cards, and consider integrating small incentives to motivate caregivers.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the influence of cultural practices on maternal health is crucial in addressing the nutritional challenges faced by pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. Despite improvements in maternal and child health indicators, food taboos remain prevalent, impacting nutritional and health outcomes of vulnerable populations. This qualitative study explored food taboos and factors related to their adherence or breaking, among rural pregnant women in Bangladesh, where a total of 90 participants, including 21 pregnant women, 23 mothers-in-law, 20 husbands, and 26 healthcare workers, were interviewed through 29 in-depth interviews and 11 focus group discussions. Nearly half of the participants adhered to food taboos, citing beliefs about their negative consequences on pregnancy and baby health. Commonly restricted animal source foods included white carp, trout, duck meat, and mutton, due to fears of convulsions, speech disorders, or undesirable traits in the baby. Raw papayas and pineapples were avoided due to beliefs they could cause miscarriage. Adherence to these taboos was related to the pregnant mother's desire to avoid harm to her child, preference for vaginal delivery, avoid financial stress of caesarean section, profound respect for her elders, early age at marriage, and primiparity. Factors enabling the breaking of food taboos included nutritional counselling by healthcare workers, increased family understanding of maternal nutrition, reduced reinforcement of taboos, and the lack of negative consequences from consuming tabooed foods. The findings underscore the need to use scientific evidence to challenge food taboos by enhancing nutritional counselling programmes and engaging family members and community elders to foster dietary changes for pregnant women.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood development (ECD) in low to middle-income nations has been a pressing concern for the last two to three decades. It is estimated that approximately 250 million children under the age of five are not reaching their full developmental potential due to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and insufficient home stimulation. It is estimated that in Bangladesh, 44% of the children under 5 years live in poverty and 31% are stunted, and both factors are risks for poor childhood development. We aim to develop a sustainable, scaled ECD programme using an evidence-based curriculum of psychosocial stimulation for disadvantaged Bangladeshi children. Approximately 10,000 malnourished children aged 6-24 months will be identified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 13.5 cm, assessed by government health staff in over 500 community clinics (CCs) in 21 sub-districts of Hobiganj, Brahmanbaria, Laxmipur and Narsingdi districts. The children and their mothers will participate in the psychosocial stimulation programme that will be delivered fortnightly for one year to small groups at the CCs by health workers. We will train approximately 1,500 health staff in rural CCs to deliver the ECD sessions. We will follow a cascade training model to train personnel at all levels of the primary health care system. A subsample will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 48 CCs (24 intervention and 24 control). From each CC, 10 children aged 6-24 months will be tested before and after the programme. The primary outcome is children's cognitive development and we will also measure language composite scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Secondary outcomes are children's growth, maternal knowledge and depressive symptoms, and stimulation in the home. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention effects. There are no existing ECD services for the children under three years delivered by the health care system in Bangladesh. This study will help policy makers to consider incorporating ECD activities into the treatment of malnourished children in rural CCs, under the government's primary health care system, thereby developing a sustainable structure for improving disadvantaged children's development. The findings will also provide information to facilitate scaling ECD in the primary health care systems in other low and middle-income countries.

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has re-classified \"Snakebite\" as a Neglected Tropical Disease in 2017, and estimated that as many as 5.4 million people suffer from snakebites every year. Out of this large number of snakebites, envenoming occurs in about 50 % of the cases, and the number of resulting deaths could be as high as 138,000. The genus Bungarus commonly known as kraits are medically important elapid snakes widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent, southern China and the Southeast Asian countries (except Philippines). The Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives) is home to 8-9 krait species, among which B. caeruleus and B. niger are highly venomous. This review presents the current state of knowledge on krait bites in the Indian subcontinent. The risk of envenomation by kraits, the venom lethality and krait bite management in the Indian subcontinent have been critically analyzed. Moreover, the issue of dry bites from kraits and their management has also been reviewed. Furthermore, critical aspects, such as knowledge of snakebite management among healthcare workers, clinical symptoms of snakebite patients, and treatment in healthcare facilities including antivenom administration and their clinical efficacy, have helped us in identifying the critical knowledge gaps. Proposed preventive measures will help to reduce krait bite associated mortality and morbidity. Moreover, development and accessibility to affordable treatment options may help in the effective management of krait bites.",

        "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a recognised global public health concern, substantially impacting women's well-being. While there is growing research on how IPV victim-survivors seek mental health support in the Global North, it remains understudied in the Global South, particularly for those residing in slums in low-income countries like Bangladesh. Through interviews and group discussions with different stakeholders, this study explored the mental healthcare-seeking behaviour of victim-survivors of IPV residing in urban slums, barriers to service utilisation, and recommendations to strengthen care pathways. Stakeholders perceived IPV as normalised in slums, indicating sociocultural norms and interpersonal causes as significant contributors to mental health issues and events of IPV. Seeking healthcare and moral support for IPV from local dispensaries and informal sources was common; however, IPV victim-survivors had no knowledge about mental-health-related services. Low mental health literacy and lack of financial support prevented them from seeking the necessary care. Social stigma regarding accessing mental healthcare, coupled with the absence of professional service providers and community-based services, represent critical systemic challenges. Recommendations included promoting community-level awareness of IPV and mental health issues, increasing mental healthcare services, training health workers, and fostering positive masculinities in community-based interventions. Stakeholders emphasised the need to adopt culturally relevant interventions for tackling IPV and improving mental healthcare pathways, especially for the low-income population of Bangladesh.",

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

        "abstract": "Inadequate dietary diversity is a significant challenge in public health for low-and middle-income countries, including rural communities in Bangladesh. These issues have intensified and become more tragic during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated the factors associated with household dietary diversity in rural Southwestern Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study used a structured questionnaire to collect data from 310 respondents using face-to-face interviews. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and sociodemographic characteristics were calculated from the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance III Project (FANTA) guidelines and related studies. A multinomial regression model was performed to identify factors associated with HDDS during the COVID-19 outbreak. The HDDS status of rural Southwestern households decreased (60.3%) during the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic factors including gender, level of education, occupation, household monthly income, and family size of the household head were significantly associated with dietary diversity. Additionally, income condition (RRR:5.46, 95% CI:2.73-7.47 and RRR:4.85, 95% CI:2.48-7.24), and dietary diversity knowledge of the household head (RRR:5.46, 95% CI:2.73-7.47, and RRR:4.85, 95% CI:2.48-7.24) were significantly associated with low and moderate HDDS during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study found that households become more vulnerable to inadequate dietary diversity due to poor socioeconomic status during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the findings, public health workers should ensure adequate food access and proper food distribution among rural households and communities in this crisis to mitigate these negative consequences.",

The knowledge level was assessed using eight questions aimed at exploring the workers' knowledge of healthy diets. 16 statements were used to assess attitude towards a healthy diet, which could be answered on a 5-point Likert scale. A 7-day food frequency questionnaire with foods arranged into eight food groups was used to assess healthy dietary practices. The KAP score was categorised as poor (within 0%-50% of the maximum possible score), fair (within 51%-75% of the maximum possible score) and good (above 75% of the maximum possible score). Overall, 39%, 18.2% and 42% of the workers had good KAP related to a healthy diet, respectively. Milk and fruit consumption frequency was low among the workers. The KAP score was significantly higher among workers with higher educational levels (p<0.001) and higher-income groups (p<0.01). Moreover, a significantly higher KAP score was found among the workers who used the internet (p<0.001) and watched television programmes (p=0.044). Programmes on nutrition education at the factory and community levels and broadcasting nutrition-related programmes on television and the internet for garment workers could be effective in augmenting their KAP towards healthy diets.",

        "abstract": "Timely support given to breastfeeding mothers can result in life-saving benefits for both mothers and infants. Progress in achieving results from existing efforts to improve breastfeeding practices can be accelerated with adequate investments in effective interventions. We aimed to document expenditures incurred by three diverse programs in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam that demonstrated improved breastfeeding outcomes. Based on expenditure records, we retrospectively calculated annual and per participant expenditures. The results represent the incremental financial needs of strengthening existing efforts in low- and middle-income countries to inform budget planning. The programs reached between 400,000 to 1.2 million pregnant women, infants, and mothers annually at an average expenditure of USD 0.55 to 1.90 per woman and infant. The largest proportion of expenditures were incurred for training frontline workers and delivering interpersonal communication or counseling. These ranged from 73.4% of total expenditures in Bangladesh to 63.9% in Ethiopia and 55.1% in Vietnam. Management and administration expenditures ranged from 13.3% and 19.6% across countries; the range in expenditures for planning and strategy development was 2.5%-9.9%; for materials development and production was 1.1%-15.1%; and for monitoring was 1.7%-18.7%. The results show that existing cadres of facility and community workers can deliver effective breastfeeding counseling on a large scale with substantial economies of scale. Budgetary needs will differ by country due to delivery system strengths and weaknesses, pre-existing coverage, and demand for counseling services. The study provides a basis for realistic budget estimates for strengthening breastfeeding counseling in large-scale programs.",

To date, it has mobilized over US$ 65 billion across 120 countries, contributing to saving more than 65 million lives. In Bangladesh, the Global Fund has played a pivotal role in expanding treatment coverage, enhancing case detection, and strengthening prevention efforts. Despite notable progress, significant challenges persist, particularly among high-risk populations such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, and transgender individuals. These groups face stigma and limited access to healthcare, both of which hinder disease control. Additionally, drug resistance presents a growing threat to the control of malaria and TB. Looking ahead, continued support from the Global Fund will be critical, particularly in scaling up diagnostic infrastructure, promoting community-led interventions, and enhancing cross-border collaboration. These efforts are essential to ensuring sustained progress and achieving the long-term goal of eliminating HIV, TB, and malaria in Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "Alleviating suffering and preserving dignity are essential components of healthcare. Patients in need of palliative care often require opioid medication to relieve breathlessness and pain. However, a lack of access to essential opioids, particularly morphine, remains a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is notably critical in the humanitarian context. We conducted two case studies to identify the barriers and facilitators of access to opioids, particularly morphine, for palliative care patients in humanitarian settings while exploring humanitarian healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences with opioids. Two case studies were conducted based on two Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) projects which integrated palliative care: advanced HIV care in Patna, Bihar, India, and paediatric and neonatal care in the refugee context in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with key MSF healthcare professionals. Interviews were conducted in English, video- and/or audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed using the grounded theory approach. Several barriers impeding access to and use of essential opioids in palliative care were reported by the participants. These included limited availability, accessibility obstacles, sociocultural challenges such as low awareness and misconceptions, lack of healthcare providers' training on opioid use, and burdensome regulatory processes. Most participants reported that clinical guidelines, familiarity with the use of opioids and interdisciplinary teamwork were important facilitators of opioid prescribing. Participants expressed the urgency for further educational and advocacy initiatives to improve access to essential opioids for patients requiring palliative care. Humanitarian healthcare workers face multiple challenges, leading to inadequate access to essential opioid medication, which undermines effective palliative care delivery. Further training on the use of opioids and strong advocacy efforts led by humanitarian organizations and the medical community are critical to improving access to these essential medicines for the relief of pain and suffering.",

Informal providers, particularly village doctors, fill this void by being a first point of care and a bridge to the formal health care system. This study explores formally trained physicians' perspectives on village doctors' role in the health care system. This qualitative study was conducted in southeast Bangladesh and included 12 individual in-depth interviews with physicians. Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis, focusing on both the contributions and shortcomings of village doctors. Three themes emerged for positive contributions of village doctors: 1) provision of essential services and resources in isolated areas, 2) enhanced accessibility and familiarity with the community, and 3) active involvement in public health education. Five themes emerged related to the shortcomings and negative impacts of village doctors: 1) insufficient education and training, 2) use of inappropriate treatments, 3) inappropriate referrals, 4) misuse and overuse of antibiotics, and 5) prioritization of financial gain. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between formal and informal health care providers, emphasizing both the contributions and shortcomings of village doctors in rural health care settings.",

        "abstract": "Child nutrition has serious long-term development implications. Evidence-based frameworks and models are urgently needed to reduce deficits in infants and young children's diets on a large scale. Our paper reviews 32 publications and five impact evaluations of programmes in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria and Vietnam to identify what worked and why; the quality of evidence, diversity of countries and multi-level interventions on a large scale were selection criteria. Key lessons are: the need for advocacy to prioritize complementary feeding; engagement of multiple stakeholders to reach national scale and to address diverse factors such as food access, harmful marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, knowledge gaps, social norms and maternal self-efficacy. Applying a behavioural science lens, monitoring intervention coverage, targeting to reduce inequalities, engaging community leaders, motivating frontline workers and leveraging mass media to reach multiple audiences worked synergistically to produce impacts at scale. Despite different contexts and dietary diversity levels at baseline, rigorous evaluations documented substantial improvements attributable to the interventions in all five countries. The expenditures incurred varied by programme complexity and showed that they are manageable if the interventions focus on priority issues, are streamlined to fit existing platforms and reach large populations. With evidence of impact in diverse contexts, an evidence-based conceptual framework and tools for implementation, insights into how to adapt to country contexts and knowledge of what to budget, decision-makers can invest confidently in improving complementary feeding programmes.",

        "abstract": "The extensive network of community health workers in rural Bangladesh has the potential to deliver maternal and child nutrition services, while promoting linkages with healthcare facilities. A strategy for strengthening community-based nutrition services was developed and tested. The three-phased strategy included review of existing community-based systems, co-designing service package with multi-sector government representatives, and testing implementation feasibility. Integrated health and nutrition service delivery, supportive supervision, and increased accountability of local government were core components of the service package being implemented in selected geographies since March 2023. The assessment followed a mixed-method design with household survey of 1,166 pregnant women, mothers of children under-6 months and 6-23 months, and observations of 965 service delivery points along with qualitative study. A higher proportion of children received growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services through expanded program on immunization (EPI) sessions, with better compliance to service delivery protocol in intervention areas compared with controls. Maternal nutrition services of gestational weight gain monitoring and distribution of supplements were better available in intervention areas. However, minimum dietary diversity among pregnant women (69% intervention, 72% control), early initiation of breastfeeding (55% intervention, 51% control), and complementary feeding practices were comparable in intervention and control areas. Nutrition services were successfully integrated in supervision which earlier covered EPI and family planning. The local government contributed to strengthening nutrition services but at a small scale. There is potential to scale-up GMP services through EPI and merging antenatal clinics with GMP and EPI such that all maternal and childcare services are available at the same place and same time. A coordinated investment and oversight from multiple national government departments is needed. At district and sub-district levels, scale-up requires joint annual planning of nutrition and EPI services, strengthened management of nutrition services, bridging health worker vacancies, introducing volunteers in sites with high EPI case load, capacity building, and supportive supervision. Replacement of multiple health and nutrition records with a single mother and child health and nutrition card is also feasible. However, behavior change interventions through home visits and courtyard meetings need more testing before recommending scale-up.",

The aim of this review was to identify existing studies on PPD and characterise any gaps in literature. We conducted a scoping review of 14 databases using a combination of search terms and phrases related to PPD and the respective Southern Asian countries. We applied the criteria from the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews to identify relevant articles from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka published between January 2004 and September 2024. We identified 20 studies conducted in only four of the South Asian countries: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Fifteen were studies with clear post-intervention outcomes; five had process outcomes. Intervention studies used trained community health workers in a variety of psychosocial programs, many with culturally specific content, including adoption of language and integration of local activities. Among the 15 intervention studies, six had positive maternal mental health outcomes and three had positive pediatric-related findings. The 20 articles identified address the important problem of PPD in South Asia. The positive findings in both the large randomised control trials and small pilot studies identified in this article, combined with the studies' use of the resource of community health workers, suggest that the gap in the literature is less on identifying effective interventions and more on securing the political and policy resolution to address the problem of PPD.",

We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study to characterise mortality risk of young infants based on their clinical signs. We conducted a population-based, prospective observational cohort study at five sites in Bangladesh (Sylhet, November 01, 2011-December 31, 2013), India (Vellore and Odisha, September 01, 2013-February 28, 2015), and Pakistan (Karachi, January 01, 2012-December 31, 2013; Matiari, March 01, 2012-December 31, 2013) to identify newborn infants who were followed-up by CHWs through 10 scheduled home visits over the first 60 completed days after birth to identify signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI). We determined the frequency of signs and conducted Cox regression to investigate the association of signs with mortality risk within 7 days of identification of the signs. CHWs made 522,309 visits to assess 63,017 young infants and found ≥1 sign(s) of PSBI at 14,245 visits (2.7%), including 5.8% (5568 of 96,390) and 1.8% (6635 of 365,769) of visits of infants 0-<3 and 7-<60 days of age, respectively. Each of the seven signs of PSBI when found alone was associated with significantly (p < 0.0001) increased risk for mortality, which increased further if any other additional sign of PSBI was found concurrently. Over the young infant period (days 0-<60) CHW identification of no movement or movement only on stimulation was associated with the highest risk for mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 73.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 44.4-119.9] followed by poor feeding (aHR 31.9, 95% CI 24.1-42.3) and hypothermia (<35.5 °C) (aHR 31.4, 95% CI 23.5-41.9). Hypothermia had particularly high risk for mortality during days 7-<60 (HR 45.1, 95% CI 27.6-73.4). WHO reconsideration of hypothermia as a sign of critical illness is warranted. Implementation research is urgently needed to reduce infant mortality by ensuring immediate referrals and interventions for children identified early by CHWs with no movement or movement only on stimulation, hypothermia, or poor feeding, especially in resource-poor settings.

While the magnitude of claim suppression is difficult to quantify, various reports have identified it as a significant concern. In response, several Canadian jurisdictions, such as Ontario in 2015, introduced legislation addressing claim suppression. This article first discusses the legislative and policy context that influences claim suppression in Ontario, including concerns concerning the scope, interpretation, and enforcement of the law. It then presents qualitative findings from a community-based study with members of the Toronto Bangladeshi immigrant community that documented varied forms of employer claim suppression in precarious work, as well as facilitators of claim suppression within the workers' compensation and health care systems. Our findings and those of other research suggest that the scope of claim suppression is broader than that contemplated by the legislation. Our article proposes recommendations for the conceptualization of claim suppression and for legislation, policies, practices, and interventions that are grounded in workers' lived experiences.",

        "title": "Improving diagnostics and surveillance of malaria among displaced people in Africa.",
        "abstract": "African communities that have been forced to leave their homes experience a considerably greater susceptibility to malaria as a result of densely populated living conditions, restricted availability of healthcare, and environmental influences. Internally displaced individuals frequently live in large settlements with restricted availability to drinking water, essential sanitation, and medical services, intensifying the spread of malaria. As a result, the occurrence of malaria is significantly more common among refugees and internally displaced individuals compared to those who are not displaced. This leads to greater rates of illness and death, especially among young people. Insufficient monitoring worsens the condition, leading to delayed identification and medical intervention, and contributing to a higher incidence of severe malaria and deaths. Furthermore, these communities are faced with economic consequences that contribute to the continuation of poverty and the worsening of socio-economic inequalities. Furthermore, the psychological impact of malaria, which is marked by feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, is particularly severe in vulnerable populations such as displaced children and pregnant women, aggravating the overall burden. Hence, addressing malaria in displaced populations in Africa requires comprehensive and well-coordinated strategies. Advanced diagnostic and surveillance technologies are essential for promptly identifying and treating malaria, providing chances to monitor and control its spread effectively. Collaboration among healthcare, policy, and humanitarian sectors is crucial for implementing comprehensive solutions that incorporate enhanced diagnostics, surveillance, and socio-psychological support. Active involvement of the community, usage of Community Health Workers, and regular collection of surveillance data are crucial in increasing awareness, directing control efforts, and tackling the specific difficulties encountered by displaced groups. Moreover, the implementation of environmental management, the incorporation of health services, and the utilization of adaptable healthcare interventions are essential for reducing the effects of malaria. To mitigate the impact of malaria and improve health outcomes among displaced populations in Africa, it is crucial to focus on these specific areas.",

        "abstract": "Women in rural Bangladesh encounter significant barriers to seeking mental healthcare, primarily due to stigmatization rooted in a lack of knowledge about mental health. To address this issue, community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been identified as a promising approach. CBPR involves the active collaboration of community members and stakeholders in the research process to tackle pressing community issues. This study examines the application of CBPR to enhance mental health awareness and education among women. The program described in this study leverages local technology centers and community health workers to boost participation in improving access to equitable mental healthcare and increasing health literacy. Implemented across three rural districts in Bangladesh, the program began with a needs assessment survey to evaluate participants' knowledge, experiences, and stigmatization of psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, suicide, and postpartum depression. This survey assessed baseline knowledge, personal experiences, and the perceived impact of mental wellness as a community issue. Additionally, five focus group discussions were conducted at local tech hubs with trained community health workers to explore participants' perceptions and attitudes toward mental health. These discussions highlighted the role of medical misinformation, the shortage of professionals, and other factors contributing to mental health stigmatization. The study's second phase would focus on developing digital medical content for screening at tech hubs, followed by live Q&A sessions with Bangladeshi health experts. This initiative aims to familiarize women with user-friendly telehealth services, fostering healthcare literacy and improving well-being in rural Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Nearly 80 % of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia cases are identified too late for medical treatment in lower-middle-income countries. Parents' understanding of neonatal jaundice is crucial for early detection and effective treatment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of prenatal sensitization in improving maternal knowledge and attitude toward neonatal hyperbilirubinemia management in Bangladesh. Cluster-randomized trial. Between September 2019 and March 2021, a prospective home-based intervention trial on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was conducted in 20 interventions and comparison clusters through community health workers (CHW). Participants were pregnant women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. Proportion-based difference-in-difference (DID) was calculated to determine changes in the mother's knowledge and attitude towards newborn jaundice. A total of 539 pregnant women were enrolled, 273 in the intervention, and 266 in the comparison arm. Following the intervention, participant's overall knowledge level about neonatal hyperbilirubinemia increased significantly (DID: 24.9, 95%CI: 19.2, 30.7) from baseline (33.2 %) to endline (70.5 %). Knowledge of newborn jaundice management showed the most improvement (DID: 60), followed by danger signs detection (DID: 40.0). The intervention also enhanced participants' positive attitudes regarding neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (DID: 13.1, 95%CI: 8.1, 18.0). Mothers with improved knowledge of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia were nearly five times more likely to have a favorable attitude toward it than those with counterparts. CHW-led home-based prenatal sensitization interventions substantially improved mothers' awareness and attitudes toward neonatal hyperbilirubinemia detection and management. Integrating such sensitization into prenatal care of the existing health system could be a practical approach to improve neonatal health outcomes in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of tobacco use is high in Bangladesh, with a cigarette being the most consumed tobacco product. Taxing tobacco is highly effective for tobacco control, raising costs and encouraging smokers to quit or reduce cigarette consumption. Garment workers are the major group of low-wage earners in Bangladesh. This study aims to determine the perceived effects of raising cigarette prices on smoking behaviors and their influences on quitting the decision of male garment workers in Bangladesh. Cross-sectional study. The Study adopted a cross-sectional method among 739 male garment workers from Gazipur and Savar, Dhaka, for six months, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors such as the prevalence of lifetime tobacco use and rising cigarette prices on smoking behaviors were analyzed. The study found that most participants began smoking before age 16, and increased tobacco prices influenced quitting decisions for both smoking and smokeless tobacco users, with reductions of 79% and 68%, respectively. Higher prices notably impacted smoking cessation among lower-income individuals, decreasing smoking frequency by 12-fold. Significantly changing their smoking behavior, on average, daily cigarette or biri consumption decreased from 7 to 5, with some participants switching to less expensive tobacco products. Findings from the study depict that imposing a high tax on tobacco products such as cigarette or biri has a desirable impact on the smoking behavior of low earning community. The price of all tobacco products should be increased to auspicate a considerable positive change in the community.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, people living with disabilities are one of the most vulnerable groups, as they receive little or no assistance. They face numerous challenges regarding financial, social, and access to basic education and healthcare, which contribute to experiences of distress and mental health issues. However, there is limited research on the mental health needs of people with disabilities and the accessibility of mental health services in Bangladesh. This qualitative study addresses this gap by examining the mental healthcare-seeking behaviours of people with disabilities and challenges in care-seeking pathways and recommendations for devising an inclusive system in existing mental health services through key informant interviews and focus group discussions with 55 participants from four stakeholder groups. Findings highlight that limited mental health, literacy, stigma, and financial and logistical challenges, such as inaccessible transportation and distant facilities, hinder access to care. System-level barriers, including a lack of specialists and inadequate community-based services, further exacerbate the issue. Stakeholders recommended strengthening social support systems by providing disability identity cards, allowances, and access to inclusive education and employment opportunities. They also emphasized the need for awareness campaigns, better transportation options, and training for healthcare workers. Policymakers are urged to design culturally relevant needs-based interventions to improve mental healthcare pathways for people with disabilities while promoting multisectoral collaboration.",

        "abstract": "Maternal post-natal depression is a global public health problem. Parenting interventions targeting children's development may also bring benefits to mothers, but few parenting interventions have been studied thoroughly. The study aimed to measure the effect of a parenting intervention using culturally appropriate and locally made toys, along with nutrition education and unconditional cash, on maternal depressive symptoms (MDS) and quality of life (QoL). The study was a cluster randomised controlled trial with two arms: i) intervention: parenting with nutrition education and unconditional cash and ii) comparison: unconditional cash in an urban setting in Bangladesh. Twenty clusters were randomised to either the intervention or control group. Community Health Workers (CHWs) delivered parenting and nutrition education sessions fortnightly in households for one year. The participants were mother-child (6-16 months) dyads. The MDS and QoL were measured using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 and a brief version of the QoL questionnaire. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the treatment effects. After one year of intervention, 547 mothers (93%) completed the study. The mothers in the intervention group had lower MDS [Regression coefficient (β)=-1.53, Confidence interval (95% CI)=-2.28, -0.80] and higher QoL scores in physical health [β = 4.21 (95% CI = 1.71, 6.73)], psychological health [β = 3.14 (95% CI = 1.10, 5.19)], social relationships [β = 3.21 (95% CI = 0.76, 5.66)] and environment [β = 3.40 (95% CI = 1.37, 5.44)] compared with the comparison group. Parenting interventions including nutrition education and unconditional cash, aimed at improving children's development, resulted in a reduction in maternal depressive symptoms and improvement in quality of life.",

        "abstract": "An Android platform-based customised app and web-linked system was developed to aid in implementing selected nutrition interventions by community health workers (CHWs) in a community-based cluster randomised trial (c-RCT) in rural Bangladesh. Here, we describe the architecture of the intervention delivery system, and explore feasibility of employing mHealth as CHWs' job aid, employing a mixed-method study design covering 17 visits per mother-child dyad. We analysed CHWs' real-time visit information from monitoring and documentation data, and CHWs' qualitative interviews to explore the advantages and barriers of using mHealth as a job aid. Intervention coverage was high across the arms (>90%), except around the narrow perinatal period (51%) due to mothers' cultural practice of moving to their parents' homes and/or hospitals for childbirth. CHWs mentioned technical and functional advantages of the job aid including device portability, easy navigability of content, pictorial demonstration that improved communication, easy information entry, and automated daily scheduling of tasks. Technical challenges included charging tablets, especially in power cut-prone areas, deteriorated battery capacity over continuous device usage, unstable internet network in unsupportive weather conditions, and device safety. Nevertheless, onsite supervision and monitoring by expert supervisors remained important to ensure intervention quality. With appropriate training and supervision, CHWs utilised the tablet-based app proficiently, attaining high coverage of long-term visits. mHealth was thus useful for designing, planning, scheduling, and delivering nutrition interventions through CHWs, and for monitoring and supervision by supervisors. Therefore, this application and job aid can be adopted or replicated into the currently developing national health systems platform for improving coverage and quality of preventive maternal and child nutrition services. In addition, continuous supportive supervision by skilled supervisors must be accompanied to ensure CHWs' task quality. Finally, future studies should rigorously assess undesirable health and environmental effects of mHealth before and after mainstreaming, effective interventions addressing device-induced health hazards should be designed and scaled up, and effective e-waste management must be ensured.",

        "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, persons with disabilities (PWDs) have faced additional disadvantages that have exacerbated their physical and mental health challenges. In Nigeria, where cultural, religious, and informational barriers persist, understanding these factors is critical for improving health interventions, including vaccine uptake among PWDs. This study employed a qualitative descriptive-interpretive design to explore the perceptions of PWDs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine, alongside social workers' views on their roles in facilitating vaccine uptake. We conducted in-depth semi-structured telephone interviews with 20 participants, comprising 16 PWDs and four social workers in Nigerian rehabilitation homes. Data were analyzed using critical thematic analysis to identify key themes influencing attitudes toward the pandemic and vaccine uptake. The study uncovered significant barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PWDs, primarily driven by mistrust in government initiatives, widespread conspiracy theories, and deeply held cultural and religious beliefs. Additionally, while social workers played crucial roles as community surveillance officers, in-house educators, and community referral agents, their interventions lacked specific strategies aimed at increasing vaccine uptake among PWDs. Their efforts were more focused on addressing the psychological impacts of the pandemic rather than fostering behavioral changes toward vaccine acceptance. To enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PWDs in Nigerian rehabilitation homes, targeted interventions that address the identified barriers are essential. These should include trust-building measures, culturally and religiously sensitive communication strategies, and tailored educational programs by social workers. Moreover, training social workers in specific, evidence-based strategies to increase vaccine uptake is crucial for mitigating the pandemic's impact on this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Community Health Workers (CHWs) play significant roles in various settings, with their motivations and retention strategies widely studied. Yet, literature is sparse on CHWs from Myanmar, who are key to primary health care in marginalized and conflict-affected areas. This study explores the unique challenges these CHWs face, using firsthand accounts. Life story interviews, enhanced with a lifeline tool, were conducted with 34 CHWs from conflict-affected regions in Myanmar and in Rohingya camps in Bangladesh. Additionally, eight key informant interviews were held with leaders from organizations that work with CHWs. Data analysis was facilitated by NVivo 14 software and four layers of influence adapted from Urie Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory of human development. The findings reveal that, CHWs primarily joined organizations to acquire skills and knowledge. In Bangladesh, the focus was on job-related skills, whereas in Myanmar, healthcare skills were prioritized. Despite remuneration being inadequate, it remained crucial for retention, as did the sense of being valued by the community in Myanmar. Mental health support emerged as a potential need for CHWs. Funding deficits and fragmented support presented organizational challenges, thereby impacting both program implementation and retention of CHWs. To address these challenges, effective, sustainable CHW programs in conflict-affected regions require a shift towards long-term support for organizations and health systems. This includes focusing on CHWs' mental health and stakeholder engagement. Short-term, fragmented solutions may revert to pre-existing situations once removed. Sustainability planning is key to break the CHW turnover cycle and maximize investments in these contexts.",

        "abstract": "The impact of rapid urbanization taking place across the world is posing variegated challenges. Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Community-based screening and socio-economic support, community-based vector control, behavior change communication, capacity building of the community health workers (CHWs), health education, and e- and m-health interventions were found as effective CBIs. Diversified CBIs were found to be effective for specific diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, dengue, influenza and ARI, and hepatitis B and C. Bundling of interventions were found to be effective against specific diseases. However, it was difficult to isolate the effectiveness of individual interventions within the bundle. The socio-cultural context was considered while designing and implementing these CBIs. The effectiveness of an intervention is inextricably linked to social context, stakeholder dimensions, and broader societal issues. System approach is recommended, emphasizing context-specific, multi-component interventions that address social determinants of health. Integrating these interventions with public health strategies and community involvement is crucial for sustainable outcomes. These findings can guide the design of future interventions for better prevention and control of communicable diseases in urban poor areas. PROSPERO CRD42021278689.",

DFCs and resultant amputations account for a considerable proportion of surgeries in Fiji, with very limited literature available to verify the factors that influence these alarming figures. This study aimed to explore Health Care Workers' (HCWs) perspectives on diabetic foot complications and challenges of foot care management in Fiji. An exploratory descriptive qualitative design was used among HCWs at the Sigatoka Sub Divisional Hospital (SDH), Fiji in 2021. HCWs at the SDH were required to have a minimum work experience of at least six months in public health. All participants who met the inclusion criteria were selected through purposive sampling. Data was collected using a focus group discussion guide composed of semi-structured open-ended questions to guide the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Focus discussions were audio recorded and transcribed with thematic analysis applied to derive the themes and sub-themes outlined in the study. Twenty HCWs participated in four FGDs with four major themes identified. The first theme was HCWs' perceptions and practice of foot care which revealed that all participants had adequate diabetic foot care knowledge. The second theme was factors affecting foot care which was mainly focused on identified barriers such as inadequate patient foot care knowledge, the lack of resources such as manpower, and health system challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. The third theme is creating awareness among patients and HCWs to improve foot care practices. The fourth theme is strengthening foot care practices at the different levels of health care that is aimed at optimizing diabetic foot outcomes. Various foot care barriers namely patient factors and the lack of resources is a concern depicted in this study. There is a need to address health system barriers and enforce diabetic foot education, screening and care for patients and the community.",

Led by regional thinkers, this series draws lessons from five countries in South Asia: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This is the last paper in the series that outlines points for future action. We call for action in three areas. First, the changing context in the region, with respect to epidemiological shifts, urbanisation, and privatisation, presents an important opportunity to appraise existing policies on PHC and reformulate them to meet the evolving needs of communities. Second, reorienting health systems towards PHC requires concrete efforts on three pillars-integrated services, multi-sectoral collaboration, and community empowerment. This paper collates nine action points that cut across these three pillars. These action points encompass contextualising policies on PHC, scaling up innovations, allocating adequate financial resources, strengthening the governance function of health ministries, establishing meaningful public-private engagements, using digital health tools, reorganising service delivery, enabling effective change-management processes, and encouraging practice-oriented research. Finally, we call for more research-policy-practice networks on PHC in South Asia that can generate evidence, bolster advocacy, and provide spaces for cross-learning. WHO SEARO funded this paper.

Common roles of CHWs include health education, community mobilization, and community-based services, particularly related to reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. Some countries utilize CHWs for non-communicable diseases and other emerging health issues. To maximize the potential contribution of CHWs to achieving Universal Health Coverage, we recommend future research and policy focus on strengthening existing health systems to support the expansion of CHWs roles and better integrating of CHWs into national PHC systems. This is Paper 4 in the Series on Primary Health Care in South Asia, addressing areas that have the potential to revitalize health systems in South Asian countries.

        "title": "Factors Associated with Psychological Distress, Fear, and Coping Strategies during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Thailand: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Despite being initially perceived as a local infectious disease, COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most perilous global health threats, significantly impacting the psychological well-being of individuals worldwide. This cross-sectional descriptive study investigates the psychological distress, fear, and coping mechanisms among Thai people residing in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. This online cross-sectional survey targeted Thai individuals during the first and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants aged 18 and above who provided consent self-reported their responses to the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Data collection occurred between November 2020 and January 2021 across four regions of Thailand. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses explored associations between contextual factors and the variables of interest. Out of 498 survey respondents, with an average age of 43.07 (SD = 13.69) years, 81.9% were female, and 61.6% self-identified as healthcare workers, with 47.59% identified as frontline healthcare workers. Findings revealed that 46% of participants experienced moderate-to-very high levels of psychological distress, 14.3% reported high levels of fear of COVID-19, and 35.1% exhibited low resilient coping. Factors such as changes in employment status or financial situations, comorbidities, contact with known or suspected COVID-19 cases, recent healthcare utilization for COVID-19-related stress, and elevated fear of COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Conversely, being nurses and perceived better mental health status were linked to more effective coping strategies. These results emphasize the critical importance of government interventions to safeguard the psychological well-being of healthcare workers and the broader Thai population. Urgent measures to bolster resilience among these groups during and after the pandemic are imperative.",

        "abstract": "Informally trained health care providers, such as village doctors in Bangladesh, are crucial in providing health care services to the rural poor in low- and middle-income countries. Despite being one of the primary vendors of antibiotics in rural Bangladesh, village doctors often have limited knowledge about appropriate antibiotic use, leading to varied and potentially inappropriate dispensing and treatment practices. In this study, we aimed to identify, map, and survey village doctors in the Sitakunda subdistrict of Bangladesh to understand their distribution, practice characteristics, clinical behaviours, access to technologies, and use of these technologies for clinical decision-making. Using a 'snowball' sampling method, we identified and mapped 411 village doctors, with 371 agreeing to complete a structured survey. The median distance between a residential household and the closest village doctor practice was 0.37 km, and over half of the practices (51.2%) were within 100 m of the major highway. Village doctors were predominately male (98.7%), with a median age of 39. After completing village doctor training, 39.4% had completed an internship, with a median of 15 years of practice experience. Village doctors reported seeing a median of 84 patients per week, including a median of five paediatric diarrhoea cases per week. They stocked a range of antibiotics, with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole being the most prescribed for diarrhoea. Most had access to phones with an internet connection and used online resources for clinical decision-making and guidance. The findings provide insights into the characteristics and practices of village doctors and point to the potential for internet and phone-based interventions to improve patient care and reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in this health care provider group.",

        "abstract": "Balanced energy protein supplementation (BEP) is recommended for contexts of high maternal undernutrition by the World Health Organization. Despite recent improvements in undernutrition, Bangladesh remains a context where BEP could help accelerate progress towards nutrition goals. In preparation for an effective trial testing a fortified BEP, a qualitative study was undertaken to better understand sociocultural factors influencing dietary behaviours in pregnancy. Married women of reproductive age (n = 23), their husbands (n = 6) and mothers-in-law (n = 6) were interviewed, and focus group discussions were conducted with women (n = 4). Women had a clear understanding of which nutritious foods are important to consume during pregnancy, including green leafy vegetables, dairy and other animal-source foods. Many explained affordability as a barrier to consuming those foods with the desired frequency. Women acquired information about diet and nutrition in pregnancy from community health workers as well as other women in the community. Most preferred to seek information from their own networks before formal health care providers. Women and husbands generally had positive views about micronutrient supplements, although some mothers-in-law were more hesitant. Some food taboos relating to the consumption of certain foods like duck and pigeon meat persist, mainly stemming from concerns for the unborn child. Opportunities exist to build on existing perceptions of healthy diets, potentially framing food or nutrient supplements as a beneficial 'add-on' to promote a healthy pregnancy. There is a scope to strengthen nutrition counselling, especially for the family members, to dispel myths and misconceptions and promote dietary and other support for pregnant women.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 was responsible for more than 7 million deaths globally, as well as numerous morbidities and social and economic effects. While COVID-19 vaccines were seen as a marvel of science by the scientific community, much of the public had concerns related to COVID-19 vaccines, with certain groups-such as pregnant and lactating women-having specific concerns related to vaccine effects on their pregnancy and breast milk. In this qualitative study, we interviewed stakeholders in Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 26) and Kenya (<i>n</i> = 94) who affect the decision-making process related to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant and lactating women. These included pregnant and lactating women themselves, community gatekeepers or family members, healthcare workers, and policymakers. Several themes related to confidence and vaccine preference emerged. Stakeholders indicated a lack of confidence related to non-mRNA vaccines due to safety concerns, number of doses, and media coverage; lack of confidence related to mRNA vaccines due to safety concerns; and preference for non-mRNA vaccines due to health system compatibility and availability. While COVID-19 vaccine availability in much of the world-particularly in low-and middle-income countries-affected the public's ability to have a choice in the vaccine they received, there were evident vaccine preferences. As the public health world will continue to face other infectious disease outbreaks, bolstering vaccine confidence broadly and specifically related to new technologies will be paramount to realize the individual-and population-level benefits of life-saving vaccines.",

        "title": "Accuracy of Mothers' Perception of Birth Size to Predict Birth Weight Data in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) is an important indicator of child health and wellbeing. However, in many countries, decisions regarding care and treatment are often based on mothers' perceptions of their children's birth size due to a lack of objective birth weight data. Additionally, birth weight data that is self-reported or recorded often encounters the issue of heaping. This study assesses the concordance between the perceived birth size and the reported or recorded birth weight. We also investigate how the presence of heaped birth weight data affects this concordance, as well as the relationship between concordance and various sociodemographic factors. We examined 4,641 birth records reported in the 2019 Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. The sensitivity-specificity analysis was performed to assess perceived birth size's ability to predict LBW, while Cohen's Kappa statistic assessed reliability. We used the kernel smoothing technique to correct heaping of birth weight data, as well as a multivariable multinomial logistic model to assess factors associated with concordance. Maternally-perceived birth size exhibited a low sensitivity (63.5%) and positive predictive value (52.6%) for predicting LBW, but a high specificity (90.1%) and negative predictive value (93.4%). There was 86.1% agreement between birth size and birth weight-based classifications (Kappa = 0.49, indicating moderate agreement). Smoothed birth weight data did not improve agreement (83.4%, Kappa = 0.45). Of the sociodemographic factors, early marriage was positively associated with discordance (i.e., overestimation). An important consideration when calculating the LBW prevalence is that maternally perceived birth size is not an optimal proxy for birth weight. Focus should be placed on encouraging institutional births and educating community health workers and young mothers about the significance of measuring and recording birth weight.",

        "abstract": "Construction workers are a population that is at risk for mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and even suicide due to the high stress and physical demands of their work. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for depression, anxiety, and stress among Bangladeshi construction workers. From February 2022 to June 2022, community-based cross-sectional research was conducted among construction workers. Survey data was gathered using interviewer administered questionnaires with 502 participants from the construction sites. Data were collected based on the information related to socio-demographics, lifestyle, occupation, health hazards, and mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). The results were interpreted using the chi-square test and logistic regression utilizing SPSS statistical software. The study revealed the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress among construction workers to be 17.9%, 30.3%, and 12%, respectively. Key findings indicate that construction workers who maintained a healthy sleep duration were 64% less likely to be depressed compared to those with poor sleep (AOR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.21-0.61, p<0.001). Workers who did not experience breathing issues upon starting construction work had a 45% lower likelihood of experiencing depression (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.97, p = 0.037) and an 82% lower likelihood of experiencing anxiety (AOR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.11-0.30, p<0.001). Bricklayer construction workers were 72% less likely to experience stress (AOR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.08-0.95, p = 0.041), and workers without breathing issues after starting construction work were 66% less likely to experience stress (AOR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17-0.66, p = 0.001). The study found that depression, anxiety, and stress are prevalent among construction workers in Bangladesh, with breathing issues as a significant risk factor. Thus, there is a need for effective measures to reduce these problems and provide a safe working environment for construction workers to ensure their productivity and the country's overall growth.",

        "abstract": "Despite established vaccination programs, vaccine-preventable diseases persist among about 900,000 Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN)/Rohingya refugees in the world's largest refugee settlement in Bangladesh. Health service providers (HSPs) play a key role in the delivery of childhood vaccination programs. This study explored their views on individual and context barriers and drivers to childhood vaccination in this setting. Informed by the theoretical framework of the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model for behavior change, this qualitative study collected data through eight focus group discussions (FGDs) with community health workers (CHWs) and vaccinators in selected camps with high or low vaccination coverage rates, and through 11 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with key informants working in strategic, management, and administrative roles. Barriers and drivers were evident across all COM factors for HSPs and caregivers. Among HSPs, knowledge around vaccination acted both as a barrier and driver, while communication skills and confidence in vaccination served as drivers. Caregivers' lack of awareness of vaccination, concerns and mistrust were described as main barriers. Context barriers included information system deficiencies, family dynamics, HSPs' working conditions, and vaccination site accessibility. Context drivers included effective communication, mobilization, and incentives. Differences between high and low coverage camps in Cox's Bazar included variations in HSPs' knowledge, communication strategies, incentive use, and stakeholder collaboration. For better vaccination coverage in the camps, context-related changes regarding collaboration, health workforce and the use of incentives seem necessary. Caregivers' mistrust toward vaccination needs to be considered under the social and historical background of the Rohingya community, and further addressed with targeted communication and campaigning.",

        "abstract": "Extreme hyperbilirubinemia leading to neurologic disability and death is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Bangladesh, and is largely preventable through timely treatment. In LMICs, an estimated half of all newborns are born at home and few receive screening or treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, leading to 6 million newborns per year who need phototherapy treatment for hyperbilirubinemia but are untreated. Household screening and treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy administered by a trained community health worker (CHW) may increase indicated treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in comparison to the existing care system in Bangladesh. 530 Bangladeshi women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy from the rural community of Sakhipur, Bangladesh will be recruited for a cluster randomized trial and randomized to the intervention arm - home screening and treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - or the comparison arm to receive usual care. In the intervention arm, CHWs will provide mothers with two prenatal visits, visit newborns by 2 days of age and then daily for 3 days to measure transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and monitor for clinical danger signs. Newborns without danger signs but with a TcB above the treatment threshold, but >15 mg/dL will be treated with light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy at home. Newborns with danger signs or TcB ≥15 mg/dL will be referred to a hospital for treatment. Treatment rates for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in each arm will be compared. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of CHW-led home phototherapy to increase neonatal hyperbilirubinemia treatment rates in rural Bangladesh. LMICs are expanding access to postnatal care by using CHWs, and our work will give CHWs a curative treatment option for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Similar projects in other LMICs can be pursued to dramatically extend healthcare access to vulnerable newborns with hyperbilirubinemia.",

        "abstract": "Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) systems provide an opportunity for health systems to understand the determinants of maternal and perinatal deaths in order to improve quality of care and prevent future deaths from occurring. While there has been broad uptake and learning from low- and middle-income countries, little is known on how to effectively implement MPDSR within humanitarian contexts - where disruptions in health service delivery are common, infrastructural damage and insecurity impact the accessibility of care, and severe financial and human resource shortages limit the quality and capacity to provide services to the most vulnerable. This study aimed to understand how contextual factors influence facility-based MPDSR interventions within five humanitarian contexts. Descriptive case studies were conducted on the implementation of MPDSR in Cox's Bazar refugee camps in Bangladesh, refugee settlements in Uganda, South Sudan, Palestine, and Yemen. Desk reviews of case-specific MPDSR documentation and in-depth key informant interviews with 76 stakeholders supporting or directly implementing mortality surveillance interventions were conducted between December 2021 and July 2022. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Dedoose software. Thematic content analysis was employed to understand the adoption, penetration, sustainability, and fidelity of MPDSR interventions and to facilitate cross-case synthesis of implementation complexities. Implementation of MPDSR interventions in the five humanitarian settings varied in scope, scale, and approach. Adoption of the interventions and fidelity to established protocols were influenced by availability of financial and human resources, the implementation climate (leadership engagement, health administration and provider buy-in, and community involvement), and complex humanitarian-health system dynamics. Blame culture was pervasive in all contexts, with health providers often facing punishment or criminalization for negligence, threats, and violence. Across contexts, successful implementation was driven by integrating MPDSR within quality improvement efforts, improving community involvement, and adapting programming fit-for-context. The unique contextual considerations of humanitarian settings call for a customized approach to implementing MPDSR that best serves the immediate needs of the crisis, aligns with stakeholder priorities, and supports health workers and humanitarian responders in providing care to the most vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Research is available on improved coverage and practices from several large-scale maternal nutrition programmes, but not much is known on change in inequalities. This study analyses wealth and education inequality using Erreygers and Concentration indices for four indicators: adequate iron and folic acid (IFA) consumption, women's dietary diversity, and counselling on IFA and dietary diversity. A pre-test-post-test, control group design. Maternal nutrition intervention programmes conducted in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and Ethiopia during 2015-2022. Recently delivered women (RDW) and pregnant women (PW). Statistically significant reductions in education inequality were observed for adequate IFA consumption, counselling on IFA and dietary diversity in intervention areas of Bangladesh and for adequate IFA consumption in intervention areas of Burkina Faso.A significant decrease in wealth inequality was observed for adequate IFA consumption in the intervention areas of Bangladesh, whereas a significant increase was observed in the non-intervention areas for counselling on IFA in Ethiopia and for dietary diversity in Burkina Faso. The results can be attributed to the extensive delivery system at community level in Bangladesh and being predominantly facility-based in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia. COVID-19 disruptions (in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia) and indicator choice also had a role in the results.The main takeaways for nutrition programmes are as follows: (a) assessing inequality issues through formative studies during designing, (b) monitoring inequality indicators during implementation, (c) diligently addressing inequality through targeted interventions, setting aside resources and motivating frontline workers to reduce disparities and (d) making inequality analysis a routine part of impact evaluations.",

Despite this, few studies have explored delivery-related complications and factors contributing to these complications among the disadvantaged population. This study aimed to investigate the factors contributing to delivery-related complications and their consequences among the mothers residing in the HtR areas of Bangladesh. Data were collected using a cross-sectional study design from 13 HtR sub-districts of Bangladesh between September 2019 and October 2019. Data from 1,290 recently delivered mothers were analysed. Around 32% (95% CI: 29.7-34.8) of the mothers reported at least one delivery-related complication. Prolonged labour pain (21%) was the highest reported complication during the delivery, followed by obstructive labour (20%), fever (14%), severe headache (14%). Mothers with higher education, a higher number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, complications during ANC, employed, and first-time mothers had higher odds of reporting delivery-related complications. More than one-half (51%) of these mothers had normal vaginal delivery. Nearly one-fifth (20%) of mothers who reported delivery-related complications were delivered by unskilled health workers at homes. On the other hand, about one-fifth (19%) of the mothers without any complications during delivery had a caesarean delivery. Nine out of ten of these caesarean deliveries were done at the private facilities. Delivery-related complications are significantly related to a woman's reproductive history and other background characteristics. Unnecessary caesarean delivery is prominent at private facilities.",

        "abstract": "Children with disabilities face an increased risk of adverse health outcomes and poor anthropometric deficits, although the focus on them is limited in the South Asian context thus far and need newer and more evidence. This study investigates the effects of disability on adverse health outcomes and anthropometric deficits among 2-4 years aged children in South Asian countries. We analyzed data from 93,180 children aged 2-4 years across Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Afghanistan using Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2017-2023). Disability status was the primary exposure, and outcomes included adverse health outcome (acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, fever), anthropometric deficit (stunting, wasting, underweight), and healthcare service sources during adverse health events (care received from skilled healthcare personnel, care received from non-professional personnel, and care received from health facility workers other than skilled healthcare personnel). Using multilevel and multinomial logistic regression models, we examined associations between exposure and outcome variables, adjusting for covariates. We found average disability prevalence in South Asia was 8.7% (8.3-9.0; n = 8072), varying from 3.4% (3.0-3.8; n = 446) in Bangladesh to 12.3% (11.4-13.3; n = 1259) in Afghanistan. Common health issues included fever (n = 24,982, 26.8%, 26.2-27.4) and diarrhea (n = 14,081, 15.1%, 14.7-15.6), while prevalent poor anthropometric deficits were stunting (n = 39,766, 42.7%, 42.0-43.3) and underweight (n = 22,390, 24.0%, 23.5-24.5). Children with disability had 1.30 (95% CI: 1.21-1.40) to 1.60 (95% CI: 1.47-1.75) times and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.05-1.29) to 1.39 (95% CI: 1.30-1.48) times higher likelihoods of adverse health outcomes and anthropometric deficits, respectively, with variations observed among countries and different disability types. Individuals with disability were 1.16 (95% CI: 1.00-1.35) to 1.26 (95% CI: 1.01-1.58) times more likely to receive healthcare services from skilled healthcare personnel compared to health facility workers other than skilled healthcare personnel. This study findings emphasizes the need for community-level awareness programs to improve anthropometric well-being and healthcare of the children with disability.

        "abstract": "Globally, hepatitis B infection (HBI) poses a substantial public health concern and healthcare workers, including nursing students, are at a higher risk of contracting this disease. Thus, the study aimed to assess how knowledge, attitudes, and sociodemographic factors are associated with HBI prevention among a sample of Bangladeshi nursing students. A cross-sectional survey was performed among 737 nursing students from the nursing institutes of Khulna and Barishal divisions in Bangladesh from January to April 2023. The data were collected by providing questionnaires (structured questionnaire) in the classroom, following a stratified random sampling process. A model of multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors linked to HBI prevention practices. The mean (SD) scores were 11.42 (± 2.88) for knowledge, 4.33 (± 1.91) for attitude and 4.27 (± 2.056) for practice respectively. Participants' low knowledge (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.562, 95% CI: 1.29-5.07) and poor attitude (aOR = 5.730, 95% CI: 3.19-10.28) regarding HBI were significantly associated with higher likelihood of poor practice towards HBI prevention. Moreover, being 2nd year of nursing students (aOR = 2.147, 95% CI: 1.19-3.86), being aged 19-20 years (aOR = 3.038, 95% CI: 1.30-7.09), being married (aOR = 0.320, 95%CI: 0.13-0.82) and having a family history of HBI (aOR = 0.134, 95%CI: 0.05-0.36) were significantly associated with poor practices of HBI prevention among study participants. The knowledge, attitude and practice scores of the nursing students on HBI prevention were suboptimal. We advocate for implementing regular HBI prevention education and policies, free or subsidized services, skill development, proper HBI prevention enforcement and strict professional ethics within nursing colleges. Such efforts should predominantly focus on second-year, aged 19-20 and unmarried nursing students.",

        "abstract": "Citizen science (CS) is an emerging approach in public health to harness the collective intelligence of individuals to augment traditional scientific efforts. However, citizens' viewpoint, especially the hard-to-reach population, is lacking in current outbreak-related literature. We aim to understand the awareness, readiness and feasibility of outbreak-related CS, including digitally enabled CS, in low-income and middle-income countries. This mixed-method study was conducted in nine countries between October 2022 and June 2023. Recruitment through civil society targeted the general population, marginalised/indigenous groups, youth and community health workers. Participants (aged ≥18 years) completed a quantitative survey, and a subset participated in focus group discussions (FGDs). 2912 participants completed the survey and 4 FGDs were conducted in each country. Incorporating participants' perspectives, CS is defined as the practice of active public participation, collaboration and communication in all aspects of scientific research to increase public knowledge, create awareness, build trust and facilitate information flow between citizens, governments and scientists. In Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Cameroon and Kenya, majority were unaware of outbreak-related CS. In India and Uganda, majority were aware but unengaged, while in Nepal and Zimbabwe, majority participated in CS before. Engagement approaches should consider different social and cultural contexts, while addressing incentivisation, attitudes and practicality factors. Overall, 76.0% expressed interest in digital CS but needed training to build skills and confidence. Digital CS was perceived as convenient, safer for outbreak-related activities and producing better quality and quantity of data. However, there were concerns over non-inclusion of certain groups, data security and unclear communication. CS interventions need to be relatable and address context-specific factors influencing CS participation. Digital CS has the potential to facilitate collaboration, but capacity and access issues must be considered to ensure inclusive and sustainable engagement.",

        "abstract": "<b><i>Background:</i></b> Paid maternity leave benefits all of society, reducing infant mortality and providing economic gains. It is endorsed by international treaties. Paid maternity leave is important for breastfeeding, bonding, and recovery from childbirth. Not all mothers have access to adequate paid maternity leave. <b><i>Key Information:</i></b> Paid leave helps meet several of the 17 United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10), including fostering economic growth. A family's expenses will rise with the arrival of an infant. Paid leave is often granted with partial pay. Many low-wage workers earn barely enough to meet their needs and are unable to take advantage of paid leave. Undocumented immigrants and self-employed persons, including those engaging in informal work, are often omitted from maternity leave programs. <b><i>Recommendations:</i></b> Six months of paid leave at 100% pay, or cash equivalent, should be available to mothers regardless of income, employment, or immigration status. At the very minimum, 18 weeks of fully paid leave should be granted. Partial pay for low-wage workers is insufficient. Leave and work arrangements should be flexible whenever possible. Longer flexible leave for parents of sick and preterm infants is essential. Providing adequate paid leave for partners has multiple benefits. Increasing minimum wages can help more families utilize paid leave. Cash benefits per birth can help informal workers and undocumented mothers afford to take leave. Equitable paid maternity leave must be primarily provided by governments and cannot be accomplished by employers alone.",

We analyzed data from a cohort of pregnant women and their babies in Sylhet, Bangladesh, assembled between 2011 and 2014. Community health workers visited enrolled babies up to 10 times from birth to age 59 days. Survival status was recorded at each visit. Gestational age was estimated from mother's reported last menstrual period. Birth weights were measured within 72 hours of delivery. SGA was defined using the INTERGROWTH-21st standard. We estimated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs for babies born preterm and SGA separately for the first and second month of life using bivariate and multivariable weighted Cox regression models. The analysis included 17 643 singleton live birth babies. Compared with infants born at term-appropriate for gestational age, in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, infants born preterm-SGA had the greatest risk of death in the first (HR 13.25, 95% CI 8.65-20.31; adjusted HR 12.05, 95% CI 7.82-18.57) and second month of life (HR 4.65, 95% CI 1.93-11.23; adjusted HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.66-10.15), followed by infants born preterm-appropriate for gestational age and term-SGA. The risk of mortality in infants born preterm and/or SGA is increased and extends through the second month of life. Appropriate interventions to prevent and manage complications caused by prematurity and SGA could improve survival during and beyond the neonatal period.",

        "abstract": "There is a paucity of data on community perception and utilization of services for wasted children in Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN) and their nearest host communities. We conducted a qualitative study to explore community perceptions and understand the utilization of services for severely wasted children among the FDMN and their nearest host communities in Teknaf, Cox's Bazar. We carried out 13 focus group discussions and 17 in-depth interviews with the caregivers of the children of 6-59 months, and 8 key informant interviews. Caregivers' perceived causes of severe wasting of their children included caregivers' inattention, unhygienic practices, and inappropriate feeding practices. However, the context and settings of the FDMN camps shaped perceptions of the FDMN communities. Caregivers in both the FDMN and host communities sought care from healthcare providers for their children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) when they were noticed and encouraged by their neighbors or community outreach workers, and when their SAM children suffered from diseases such as diarrhea and fever. Some caregivers perceived ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) as a food to be shared and so they fed it to their non-SAM children. Caregivers of the children having SAM with complications, in the FDMN and host communities, were reluctant to stay in stabilization centers or complex respectively, due to their households' chores and husbands' unwillingness to grant them to stay. The findings of this study are expected to be used to design interventions using locally produced RUTF for the management of SAM children in the FDMN, as well as to inform the health sector working on SAM child management in the host communities.",

        "abstract": "There is an unmet need for phototherapy treatment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to prevent disability and death of newborns with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Home phototherapy deployed by community health workers (CHWs) in LMICs may help increase access to essential newborn postnatal care in a more acceptable way for families and lead to an increase in indicated treatment rates for newborns with hyperbilirubinemia. We aimed to investigate the operational feasibility and acceptability of a CHW-led home phototherapy intervention in a rural sub-district of Bangladesh for families and CHWs where home delivery was common and a treatment facility for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was often more than two hours from households. We enrolled 23 newborns who were ≥ 2 kg in weight and ≥ 35 weeks gestational age, without clinical danger signs, and met the American Academy of Pediatric treatment criteria for phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia. We employed a mixed-method investigation to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home phototherapy through surveys, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with CHWs, mothers, and grandparents. Mothers and family members found home phototherapy worked well, saved them money, and was convenient and easy to operate. CHWs found it feasible to deploy home phototherapy and identified hands-on training, mHealth job aids, a manageable workload, and prenatal education as facilitating factors for implementation. Feasibility and acceptability concerns were limited amongst parents and included: a lack of confidence in CHWs' skills, fear of putting newborn infants in a phototherapy device, and unreliable home power supply. CHW-led home phototherapy was acceptable to families and CHWs in rural Bangladesh. Further investigation should be done to determine the impact of home phototherapy on treatment rates and on preventing morbidity associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

However, studies on the usefulness of educational interventions run by non-healthcare workers in combating NCDs in resource-limited areas in rural parts of LMICs are limited. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of a community-based simple educational program run by non-healthcare trained staff for several outcomes associated with NCDs in a resource-limited area. Six villages in the Narail district in Bangladesh were selected, two each in the first and second intervention and the control groups, in the Narail district in Bangladesh were selected. Pre- and post-intervention survey data were collected. The first intervention group received the \"strong\" educational intervention that included a checklist poster on the wall, phone call messages, personalized advice papers, seminar videos, and face-to-face seminars. The second intervention group received a \"weak\" intervention that included only a checklist poster on the wall in their house. The outcome was the proportion of NCDs and changes in systolic blood pressure and blood sugar level. Confidential fixed-effects logistic regression and multiple linear regression were performed to identify the effectiveness of the intervention. Overall, 600 participants completed the baseline survey and the follow-up survey. The mean systolic blood pressure reduced by 7.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-9.9) in the first intervention group, 1.9 mm Hg (95% CI - 0.5-4.2) in the second intervention group, and 4.7 mm Hg (95% CI 2.4-7.0) in the control group. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the between-group differences in the decline in systolic blood pressure were significant for the first intervention versus control (p = 0.001), but not for the second intervention versus control (p = 0.21). The between-group differences in the reduction in blood glucose after the intervention, were not significant on multiple linear regression analysis.

A vast array of risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) interventions were implemented in Cox's Bazar with the intent of reducing disease transmission by empowering the community to adopt public health measures. The study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 preventive measures among the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar, and to identify their socio-demographic determinants. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 500 Rohingya individuals. Participants in the study were Rohingya refugees residing in five randomly selected camps where International Organization for Migration (IOM) Health was operating. Using a structured questionnaire, skilled community health workers surveyed the Rohingya population. In addition to the survey on knowledge, attitude, and practice, the study gathered information on the perspectives and relevance of sociodemographic factors that influence KAP. The study findings indicate that the mean scores for knowledge, attitude, and practice were 9.93, 7.55, and 2.71 respectively. Association was found between knowledge and practice level and age group-the elderly age group (>/ = 61 years) had less level of knowledge (AOR 0.42, P value = 0.058) and the late mid-age group (46-60 years) had better practice level (AOR 2.67, P value <0.001). Our study found that the Rohingya refugee community in Cox's Bazar has improved knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures. However, the practice level of these measures remains low compared to the knowledge and positive attitude. The reason behind the poor practice of preventive measures needs to be identified and addressed engaging the community in similar future outbreaks.",

        "title": "Impact of market-based home fortification with micronutrient powder on childhood anemia in Bangladesh: a modified stepped wedge design.",
        "abstract": "Anemia poses a significant public health problem, affecting 1.6 billion people and contributing to the loss of 68.4 million disability-adjusted life years. We assessed the impact of a market-based home fortification program with micronutrient powder (MNP) called Pushtikona-5 implemented by Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) on the prevalence of anemia among children aged 6-59 months in Bangladesh. We used a modified stepped wedged design and conducted three baseline, two midline, and three endline surveys to evaluate the Pushtikona-5 program implemented through three BRAC program platforms. We interviewed children's caregivers, and collected finger-prick blood samples from children to measure hemoglobin concentration. We also collected data on coverage of Pushtikona-5 and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. We performed bivariate and multivariable analysis and calculated adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) to assess the effect of program outcomes. A total of 16,936 households were surveyed. The prevalence of anemia was 46.6% at baseline, dropping to 32.1% at midline and 31.2% at endline. These represented adjusted relative reductions of 34% at midline (RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.62 to 0.71, value of <i>p</i> <0.001) and 32% at endline (RR 0.68, 95%CI 0.64 to 0.71, value of <i>p</i> <0.001) relative to baseline. Regarding MNP coverage, at baseline, 43.5% of caregivers surveyed had heard about MNP; 24.3% of children had ever consumed food with MNP, and only 1.8% had consumed three or more sachets in the 7 days preceding the survey. These increased to 63.0, 36.9, and 4.6%, respectively, at midline and 90.6, 68.9, and 11.5%, respectively, at endline. These results show evidence of a reduction in the prevalence of anemia and an improvement in coverage. This study provides important evidence of the feasibility and potential for impact of linking market-based MNP distribution with IYCF promotion through community level health workers.",

        "abstract": "A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2019 to August 2019 to determine the pattern of work-related respiratory problems among workers in ship breaking industry at Sitakunda, Chittagong, Bangladesh as many unskilled and semiskilled worker are working there without having minimum knowledge and idea about the possible adverse health effect of different pollutants which also pose threats to the ambient environment. Total 120 male respondents were selected purposively. Majority 80.8% (97) of the workers were below 30 years. About 71.0% (85) respondents were working for less than five years. Majority of respondents worked 8 hours daily. Most of them worked each of the days in a week. About 66.0% (80) had smoking habit. Among 120 respondents, 95.8% (115) had no previous respiratory problem. But 63.3% (76) felt that their respiratory problems were increasing day by day due to current job (ship breaking). There were 85.0% (102) respondents who felt cold or sneeze mostly in working place. About 80.0% (96) of respondents felt better during holiday. There were different respiratory symptoms among the respondents like nasal irritation, hoarseness of voice, cough during cold, cough without cold, bringing up phlegm when catch cold, bringing up phlegm without cold, tightness of chest where the prevalence was 54.2% (65), 85.0% (102), 93.3% (112), 28.3% (34), 70.0% (84), 39.0% (27) and 67.5% (81) respectively among the workers. Majority respondents 96.7% (116) were conscious about using PPE. Only 17.5% (21) used mask during work. Different pulmonary lung function test like forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1%, peak expiratory flow rate (PFER) was done. Mean of FVC, FEV1 was 3.76 and 1.09 respectively. According to pulmonary statuses of workers as per spirometric findings 20.83% (25) had normal pulmonary function, 58.33% (45) had obstruction and 20.83% (25) had combined obstructive parameters. So in light of the study it is clear that the work organization has not developed in this particular industry. In every steps of their work ship breaking workers are facing violations of industrial codes which correspond with safe working environment. In long run the workers have to pay with their health and life about which they are unaware.",

        "abstract": "Informal and unregulated rural medical practitioners (RMPs) provide healthcare services to about two-thirds of people in Bangladesh, although their service is assumed to be substandard by qualified providers. As the RMPs are embedded in the local community and provide low-cost services, their practice pattern demands investigation to identify the shortfalls and design effective strategies to ameliorate the service. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2015-16 using a convenient sample from all 64 districts of Bangladesh. Personnel practising modern medicine, without any recognized training, or with recognized training but practising outside their defined roles, and without any regulatory oversight were invited to take part in the study. Appropriateness of the diagnosis and the rationality of antibiotic and other drug use were measured as per the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guideline. We invited 1004 RMPs, of whom 877 consented. Among them, 656 (74.8%) RMPs owned a drugstore, 706 (78.2%) had formal education below higher secondary level, and 844 (96.2%) had informal training outside regulatory oversight during or after induction into the profession. The most common diseases encountered by them were common cold, pneumonia, and diarrhoea. 583 (66.5%) RMPs did not dispense any antibiotic for common cold symptoms. 59 (6.7%) and 64 (7.3%) of them could identify all main symptoms of pneumonia and diarrhoea, respectively. In pneumonia, 28 (3.2%) RMPs dispensed amoxicillin as first-line treatment, 819 (93.4%) dispensed different antibiotics including ceftriaxone, 721 (82.2%) dispensed salbutamol, and 278 (31.7%) dispensed steroid. In diarrhoea, 824 (94.0%) RMPs dispensed antibiotic, 937 (95.4%) dispensed ORS, 709 (80.8%) dispensed antiprotozoal, and 15 (1.7%) refrained from dispensing antibiotic and antiprotozoal together. Inappropriate diagnoses, irrational use of antibiotics and other drugs, and polypharmacy were observed in the practising pattern of RMPs. The government and other stakeholders should acknowledge them as crucial partners in the healthcare sector and consider ways to incorporate them into curative and preventive care.",

        "abstract": "Local humanitarian workers in low and middle-income countries must often contend with potentially morally injurious situations, often with limited resources. This creates barriers to providing sustainable mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to displaced individuals. Clinical supervision is an often neglected part of ensuring high-quality, sustainable care. The Caring for Carers (C4C) project aims to test the effectiveness and acceptability of online group-based supportive supervision on the well-being of MHPSS practitioners, as well as service-user-reported service satisfaction and quality when working with displaced communities in Türkiye, Syria, and Bangladesh. This protocol paper describes the aim, design, and methodology of the C4C project. A quasi-experimental, mixed-method, community-based participatory research study will be conducted to test the effectiveness of online group-based supportive clinical supervision provided to 50 Syrian and 50 Bangladeshi MHPSS practitioners working with Syrian and Rohingya displaced communities. Monthly data will be collected from the practitioners and their beneficiaries during the active control (six months) and supervision period (16 months over two terms). Outcomes are psychological distress (Kessler-6), burnout (the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and secondary traumatic stress (Professional Quality of Life Scale), perceived injustice, clinical self-efficacy (Counseling Activity Self-Efficacy Scale), service satisfaction, and quality (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and an 18-item measure developed in this project). A realist evaluation framework will be used to elucidate the contextual factors, mechanisms, and outcomes of the supervision intervention. There is a scarcity of evidence on the role of clinical supervision in improving the well-being of MHPSS practitioners and the quality of service they provide to displaced people. By combining qualitative and quantitative data collection, the C4C project will address the long-standing question of the effectiveness and acceptability of clinical supervision in humanitarian settings.",

Therefore, this study aims to describe the unique experiences of violence faced by Rohingya women who fled Myanmar and Bangladesh to seek asylum in Malaysia before, during, and after their transit. Primary data were collected from 33 participants comprising Rohingya women refugees and asylum seekers, medical social workers, medical officials, volunteer workers/activists, refugee organization officers, and a mental health care provider. Thematic analysis was used to identify the patterns in and relationships between the concepts in the collected data. Rohingya women were exposed to various forms of violence and trauma by various groups of men, including those from their own community, throughout their journey to and in Malaysia. The lack of recognition of refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia prevents them from having mainstream or legal access to jobs, education, and healthcare, and this predicament compounds their suffering from violence, especially for women and girls. Rohingya women and girls in Malaysia need better access to healthcare, resources, and support to identify and address violence, which has a significant impact on their health.",

        "title": "A Machine Learning Web App to Predict Diabetic Blood Glucose Based on a Basic Noninvasive Health Checkup, Sociodemographic Characteristics, and Dietary Information: Case Study.",
        "abstract": "Over the past few decades, diabetes has become a serious public health concern worldwide, particularly in Bangladesh. The advancement of artificial intelligence can be reaped in the prediction of blood glucose levels for better health management. However, the practical validity of machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting health parameters using data from low- and middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh, is very low. Specifically, Bangladesh lacks research using ML techniques to predict blood glucose levels based on basic noninvasive clinical measurements and dietary and sociodemographic information. To formulate strategies for public health planning and the control of diabetes, this study aimed to develop a personalized ML model that predicts the blood glucose level of urban corporate workers in Bangladesh. Based on the basic noninvasive health checkup test results, dietary information, and sociodemographic characteristics of 271 employees of the Bangladeshi Grameen Bank complex, 5 well-known ML models, namely, linear regression, boosted decision tree regression, neural network, decision forest regression, and Bayesian linear regression, were used to predict blood glucose levels. Continuous blood glucose data were used in this study to train the model, which then used the trained data to predict new blood glucose values. Boosted decision tree regression demonstrated the greatest predictive performance of all evaluated models (root mean squared error=2.30). This means that, on average, our model's predicted blood glucose level deviated from the actual blood glucose level by around 2.30 mg/dL. The mean blood glucose value of the population studied was 128.02 mg/dL (SD 56.92), indicating a borderline result for the majority of the samples (normal value: 140 mg/dL). This suggests that the individuals should be monitoring their blood glucose levels regularly. This ML-enabled web application for blood glucose prediction helps individuals to self-monitor their health condition. The application was developed with communities in remote areas of low- and middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh, in mind. These areas typically lack health facilities and have an insufficient number of qualified doctors and nurses. The web-based application is a simple, practical, and effective solution that can be adopted by the community. Use of the web application can save money on medical expenses, time, and health management expenses. The created system also aids in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in ensuring that everyone in the community enjoys good health and well-being and lowering total morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "The critical shortage of healthcare workers, particularly in rural areas, is a major barrier to quality care for non-communicable diseases (NCD) in low-income and middle-income countries. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to test a decentralised model for integrated diabetes and hypertension management in rural Bangladesh to improve accessibility and quality of care. The study is a single-cohort proof-of-concept study. The key interventions comprised shifting screening, routine monitoring and dispensing of medication refills from a doctor-managed subdistrict NCD clinic to non-physician health worker-managed village-level community clinics; a digital care coordination platform was developed for electronic health records, point-of-care support, referral and routine patient follow-up. The study was conducted in the Parbatipur subdistrict, Rangpur Division, Bangladesh. A total of 624 participants were enrolled in the study (mean (SD) age, 59.5 (12.0); 65.1% female). Changes in blood pressure and blood glucose control, patient retention and patient-visit volume at the NCD clinic and community clinics. The proportion of patients with uncontrolled blood pressure reduced from 60% at baseline to 26% at the third month of follow-up, a 56% (incidence rate ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.57) reduction after adjustment for covariates. The proportion of patients with uncontrolled blood glucose decreased from 74% to 43% at the third month of follow-up. Attrition rates immediately after baseline and during the entire study period were 29.1% and 36.2%, respectively. The proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for involving lower-level primary care facilities and non-physician health workers to rapidly expand much-needed services to patients with hypertension and diabetes in Bangladesh and in similar global settings. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of decentralised hypertension and diabetes care.",

This India-specific approach was contextualised to the Indian IMNCI programme based on 7 years of IeDA implementation learning from West Africa.The Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness pilot was implemented across 80 front-line workers, 70 ANMs and 10 medical officers) in 55 facilities of 3 blocks of Ranchi district, Jharkhand. This report evaluated the feasibility of its use by ANMs only. Based on the results, it can be concluded that it is possible to implement the newly developed application. A total of 2500 cases were managed by ANMs using the application till May 2020. All ANMs used it to provide treatment to the children. 63% of ANMs used it to provide medications, 83% for counselling and 71% for follow-up as per the recommendations. The app is highly acceptable to ANMs for use as a clinical case management tool for childhood illness. There were some improvements in case management in both the age group (0-59 days and 2-12 months) of children. 78% of caregivers responded with their desire to revisit the health facility in future, highlighting the contribution of an e-tool in improving the perception of the caregiver.",

To better understand rural communities' knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and barriers towards these vaccines, we conducted a qualitative cross-sectional study with adults in rural Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the rural areas of Sylhet and Natore in Bangladesh from August 2021 to February 2022. Our study involved 15 in-depth interviews with rural adults and 2 key informant interviews with health workers. We analysed data thematically, resulting in four main themes: (1) knowledge and perception aspects, (2) myths and misconceptions, (3) practice and attitude and (4) barriers and challenges of COVID-19 vaccines. The findings indicate that rural populations lack sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 vaccines but have a more favourable attitude towards them. Misconceptions, beliefs and personal experiences were found to be the main reasons for vaccine avoidance. To address these challenges and dispel the spread of misinformation, health education programmes play a pivotal role in improving vaccine management. Policy-makers should initiate these programmes without delay to create a well-informed and enlightened community, given that the COVID-19 is still spreading.",

There is insufficient evidence regarding what defines a good death for people living with dementia. Obtaining an understanding of what constitutes a good death could help improve dementia care. This study aimed to explore how multiple stakeholders perceive a good death for people living with dementia. This qualitative study was carried out across six prefectures in Japan. Enrollment of participants took place within dementia outpatient clinics, hospitals, daycare centers, and community centers. A total of thirty-three in-depth interviews with people living with dementia, physicians, and nurses were conducted. Six focus group discussions were performed with family caregivers and care workers. Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were prepared, and inductive content analysis was used to examine the data. Regarding the perception of a good death, the following themes were derived: (1) painless death; (2) dying in a preferred environment; (3) family's coping with loss; (4) maintaining regular life; (5) living with respect; and (6) preparation for death. All these themes are interrelated. Participants viewed a good death as a process rather than a single event. This study identifies crucial components of a good death for people living with dementia.

        "abstract": "Quality counseling can positively impact maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN) behaviors linked to poor nutrition outcomes. Global guidance includes 93 recommendations on MIYCN counseling. A desk review and key informant interviews sought to assess compliance to the recommendations, reach and quality, systemic gaps and opportunities for MIYCN counseling in seven South Asian countries. Ninety-three (93) policies and guidelines, 180 counseling materials and over 50 documents were reviewed; 115 key informant interviews were conducted. Information synthesis captured eight domains. Data from national surveys were analyzed to determine MIYCN counseling reach, quality and association with nutrition behaviors. Results showed that national guidelines were inconsistent with global recommendations for seven thematic areas. Coverage of contacts points like antenatal and postnatal care (ANC, PNC) with potential to deliver MIYCN counseling was highly variable. Having at least four ANC contacts was significantly associated with consumption of 100+ iron folic acid tablets in all countries. Rates of early initiation of breastfeeding (18% Pakistan to 90% Sri Lanka) were lower than institutional delivery rates, except for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. PNC contact within 48 h of birth was positively correlated with exclusive breastfeeding in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (OR 1.4, 3.1, 3.2). Health worker contacts and wealth status equally influenced child's dietary diversity in India. MIYCN services were add-on roles for community-based workers, except in India. Supervision mechanisms exist but were not focused on quality of MIYCN services. Counseling resources were predominantly paper based (>70%), had rural-focused messaging on diets and mainly targeted women. Platforms to engage men were largely missing. Health management information systems included indicators on maternal contact points in all countries but not for children. Assessing funding for MIYCN counseling was challenging as costs were subsumed across several budget line-items. The research findings can be used to (1) align country guidance with global recommendations, (2) review workforce responsibilities and capacity building with supervision, (3) assess the need for new counseling materials based on coverage of content, service providers and audience, (4) integrate MIYCN counseling indicators in information systems and (5) include MIYCN counseling services with activities and budget in country plans.",

The aims of this research were to: (1) describe A&T's SBC implementation processes and their impact based on a review of programme documents and peer-reviewed publications and (2) gather lessons learned from key informant interviews (N = 23) with A&T staff and stakeholders in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Vietnam. A&T's SBC approach used interpersonal communication, community mobilization and mass media to address knowledge gaps, strengthen self-efficacy and shift social norms. The initiative used data for design and evaluation and facilitated scale and sustainability through close collaboration with governments and other stakeholders. A&T's approach increased exclusive breastfeeding, minimum meal frequency of children and use of iron and folic acid tablets by pregnant women, but had mixed impacts on early initiation of breastfeeding and maternal and child dietary diversity. Multiple SBC channels and frequent contacts strengthened the impact of SBC on MIYCN practices. Lessons learned included: using existing large-scale platforms for interpersonal communication, improving counselling skills of health workers, delivering timely tailored messages, engaging key influencers to take specific actions, using research to address underlying behavioural concerns and maximize mass media reach and frequency, using simple memorable messages and employing additional channels to reach low media coverage areas. A&T developed and implemented at-scale MIYCN SBC in multiple countries, providing lessons learned about intervention strategies, engagement of influencers and mass media campaign development, which governments and other implementers can adapt and replicate.",

        "abstract": "To provide insights into the nature, risk factors, impact and existing measures for reporting and preventing violence in the healthcare system. The under-reporting of violence against healthcare workers (HCWs) globally highlights the need for increased public awareness and education. The Violence Study of Healthcare Workers and Systems study used a survey questionnaire created using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) forms and distributed from 6 June to 9 August 2022. Logistic regression analysis evaluated violence predictors, including gender, age, years of experience, institution type, respondent profession and night shift frequency. A χ<sup>2</sup> test was performed to determine the association between gender and different violence forms. A total of 5405 responses from 79 countries were analysed. India, the USA and Venezuela were the top three contributors. Female respondents comprised 53%. The majority (45%) fell within the 26-35 age group. Medical students (21%), consultants (20%), residents/fellows (15%) and nurses (10%) constituted highest responders. Nearly 55% HCWs reported firsthand violence experience, and 16% reported violence against their colleagues. Perpetrators were identified as patients or family members in over 50% of cases, while supervisor-incited violence accounted for 16%. Around 80% stated that violence incidence either remained constant or increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among HCWs who experienced violence, 55% felt less motivated or more dissatisfied with their jobs afterward, and 25% expressed willingness to quit. Univariate analysis revealed that HCWs aged 26-65 years, nurses, physicians, ancillary staff, those working in public settings, with >1 year of experience, and frequent night shift workers were at significantly higher risk of experiencing violence. These results remained significant in multivariate analysis, except for the 55-65 age group, which lost statistical significance. This global cross-sectional study highlights that a majority of HCWs have experienced violence, and the incidence either increased or remained the same during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in decreased job satisfaction.",

        "abstract": "Suicidal ideation is a complex phenomenon influenced by several predisposing, contextual, and mediating factors that seem more common among healthcare workers, especially nurses. We investigated the association of bullying and burnout with suicidal ideation among Bangladeshi nurses and identified the associated factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 1264 nurses in Bangladesh between February 2021 and July 2021. We applied a modified Poisson regression model with robust error variance to determine the association of bullying and burnout with suicidal ideation. Among 1264 nurses, the female was 882 (70.02%), and the mean age was 28.41 (SD = 5.54) years. The prevalence of high levels of suicidal ideation was 13.26%. In the Poison regression model, high risk bullying (RR = 6.22, 95% CI 3.13-12.38), targeted to bullying (RR = 7.61, 95% CI 3.53-16.38), and burnout (RR = 8.95, 95% CI 2.84-28.20) were found to be significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Furthermore, we found significant interaction between workplace bullying and burnout with suicidal ideation (p < 0.05). The high prevalence of bullying, burnout, suicidal ideation, and their association indicate an unsafe workplace for the nurses. Initiatives are needed to make a favorable work environment to improve nurses' overall mental health and reduce suicide ideation.",

        "abstract": "The vaccination of the Rohingya refugees and host communities against COVID-19 in Cox's Bazar started in August 2021. Government authorities and Non-Government Organisation partners implemented a project around the initial period of vaccination to improve awareness and access to target beneficiaries. We conducted formative research to understand the programmatic approach of this project and identify potential challenges and community perceptions regarding immunisation against COVID-19. This was formative research in which we used a qualitative method of data collection. Purposively chosen 12 key-informant interviews and conveniently chosen 20 in-depth interviews were conducted using semi-structured interview guidelines from August to September 2022 in the Rohingya camp and host communities of Cox's Bazar District, Bangladesh. Ethical approval was obtained from the North South University Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all the participants. We used a thematic analysis approach to analyse the data. The project neither provided any promotional or tailored messages regarding the COVID-19 vaccine nor conducted any vaccine hesitancy surveys before implementing the project. The project did not provide any storage facilities for the vaccines' cold chain management but provided transport support to carry the vaccines from the district to the sub-district level. Community leaders were included in the decision-making process during local-level planning of the vaccination programme. The project supported the reporting of any adverse effects following immunisation from community members to the government health authorities. Vaccine hesitancy among participants was high in the early stages, but mass campaigns and vaccination of frontline health workers increased their acceptance. The major challenges reported by the informants were low budget and lower salaries of field staff, stacking of the registration process at the beginning, reluctance of participants, inadequate transportation and manpower, and inadequate baby feeding corners at vaccination centers. The findings from our study will help policymakers from the Government, the UN, and other humanitarian agencies to adapt and better address the issue of vaccine acceptance and strengthen the vaccination programme.",

        "title": "Understanding the challenges and gaps in community engagement interventions for COVID-19 prevention strategies in Rohingya refugees: a qualitative study with frontline workers and community representatives.",
        "abstract": "Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh are vulnerable to infectious diseases such as COVID-19 due to the crowded living conditions with fragile shelters, and limited water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and practices. While risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) is the cornerstone of outbreak control, there is limited evidence available on the effectiveness of the RCCE strategies in this setting. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of RCCE strategies and to explore the challenges and community recommendations in relation to COVID-19 preventive measures in the context of Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh. It was a qualitative study. Methods used were (a) observation of RCCE intervention by 3 clinical supervisors accompanying 25 Community Health Workers (CHWs) and (b) 5 focus group discussions engaging 60 community representatives. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, separately for observation and focus group discussions. The study identified a number of good practices of RCCE, including selecting CHWs from the local community, engaging female CHWs, using local dialect, and collaborating with community/religious leaders. Certain good practices need scaling up, such as utilization of multiple communication methods and interpersonal communication skills. Some areas need improvement, such as CHWs being overburdened with multiple tasks, less effort to active listening, repeated delivery of same messages, inadequate linkage to culture, context, and resources, and less effort to empower the community. Engaging the community, five critical themes were identified in relation to poor COVID-19 preventive practices: culture, religion, and language; local context and resources; community trust and interaction with aid workers; communication methods; and gender and social inclusion. Religious misinterpretation, cultural barriers, physical barriers, lack of resources, breach of trust between the community and aid workers, inconsistent/complex messages, lack of gender and social inclusion, and stigmatization are among some key factors. Some key actions were recommended to improve COVID-19 RCCE strategy. We urge the RCCE partners to make use of the findings and recommendations to develop a robust RCCE strategy relevant to local culture and context, responsive to people's concerns and needs, and inclusive of gender, age and social vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is associated with a greater risk of maternal and newborn morbidity and maternal death. Bangladesh confirmed its first COVID-19 case in March of 2020, and vaccination rollout started in January of 2021. In Bangladesh, pregnant women are allowed to receive COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy with qualifications while lactating women are permitted to receive COVID-19 vaccines with no qualifications as of October 2021. There is limited evidence on how vaccine policies are disseminated, interpreted, and implemented from the national level to the community level in Bangladesh. We conducted in-depth interviews from April-August 2022 with policymakers and healthcare workers in Bangladesh to understand how different stakeholders understood and implemented COVID-19 vaccination policies related to pregnant and lactating women. We interviewed policymakers at three levels: national, divisional, and district, and interviewed healthcare workers from one one urban and three rural communities within one division. We found a gap between policies related to COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant and lactating women and policy interpretation among policymakers and healthcare workers. Policymakers and healthcare workers' perceptions differed related to policy dissemination, attitudes toward policies related to pregnant and lactating women, and eligibility of pregnant and lactating women. Our findings indicate the need for effective dissemination of and understanding of policies. Within the context of vaccine uptake and vaccine acceptance, policymakers play a critical role as they are charged with developing and disseminating policy related to vaccine eligibility. Healthcare workers rely on timely and accurate communication related to vaccine eligibility, including populations, timing, and locations. Efforts are needed to narrow the policy and policy implementation gap as doing so is crucial to controlling vaccine preventable disease.",

Estimates on mental health and suicide risk among male homosexuals in Bangladesh are needed to generate awareness and to plan services accordingly. We assessed mental health and suicidal behavior of 102 self-identified homosexual males from a community-based organization that works with the sexual minority population. One-third of the participants (32.4%) had experienced attempted suicide, and almost half (47.1%) had a history of suicidal ideation and self-harm (40.2%). Compared to a heterosexual sample, homosexual males had poorer mental health as they scored higher on Beck Hopelessness Scale (Cohen's d = 0.29) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (Cohen's d = 0.57). The results revealed positive correlations between self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt scores. Participants with history of suicide attempt, suicide ideation and self-harm reported worse general health, more social dysfunction, and severe depression than those without such history. Suicidality and mental health conditions among homosexual males in Bangladesh have appeared to be alarming. Given the concerns, we offer some recommendations for practitioners and social workers who are serving this population in Bangladesh.",

Integrating Rohingya refugees into the framework of mHealth could be beneficial for both Bangladesh and Rohingya refugees in general, and in specific situation like COVID-19 outbreak<b>.</b> However, no research has been found on what motivates Rohingya refugees to accept mHealth in Bangladesh. Drawing on the UTAUT2 model, this study investigates the predictors of acceptance of mHealth services technologies among Rohingya refugees. The study also seeks to clarify the roles of mHealth developers, the Bangladesh government, and non-governmental organizations working with the 1.1 million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Quantitative data were collected from refugee camps with the permission of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC). The data were analyzed in two stages using a mixed approach that combines PLS-SEM and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This study revealed that Effort expectancy (EE, with <i>t</i> = 5.629, β = 0.313) and facilitating conditions (FC with <i>t</i> = 4.442, β = 0.269) in PLS-SEM, and FC (with 100 percent importance) and Health consciousness (HC, with 94.88 percent importance) in ANN analysis were found to be the most substantial predictors of mHealth adoption. The study also revealed that EE and FC are more important for low education group, while PE and Situational Constraint (SC) are more important for the high education group of refugees. In addition to providing insights for mHealth developers, this study particularly focuses on the role of government institutions and non-governmental social workers in working with the subjects to increase FC and HC among Rohingya refugees and bring them under mHealth services.",

This review article critically examines the occupational risks associated with COPD in the region and emphasizes the need for comprehensive preventive strategies. The review begins by providing background on COPD and highlighting its impact on individuals and the economy. It then explores the different occupational hazards that contribute to the development and progression of COPD, including exposure to airborne pollutants and chemicals, occupational dust, and smoking and secondhand smoke in the workplace. The existing occupational health and safety regulations in the Indian subcontinent are assessed, along with an evaluation of their effectiveness in addressing occupational risks for COPD. The review also highlights gaps and challenges in implementing and enforcing these regulations. The impact of COPD on occupational health and the economy is examined, emphasizing the burden it places on affected individuals and their ability to work. The economic implications of COPD-related productivity losses are evaluated, underscoring the importance of addressing occupational risks to improve workforce health and productivity. Prevention and mitigation strategies are explored, including an overview of preventive measures to reduce occupational risks for COPD, the significance of early detection and diagnosis of COPD in the workplace, and the implementation of engineering controls, personal protective equipment, and ventilation systems. The role of education and training programs for workers and employers is also discussed. The review identifies research gaps in the current understanding of occupational risks and COPD in the Indian subcontinent and suggests future research directions to address these gaps. It emphasizes the importance of collaborative efforts between researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to generate evidence, inform policy decisions, and implement effective interventions.",

        "abstract": "High blood pressure is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. Low-sodium salt substitute (LSSS) is a promising population-level blood pressure-lowering intervention requiring minimal behavioral change. The optimal method of delivering LSSS to individuals, however, is currently unknown. Community health workers (CHWs) have successfully been used to implement health interventions in Bangladesh and may provide a venue for the dissemination of LSSS. We aim to conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 309 households in rural Bangladesh previously identified and characterized by the BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University (BRAC JPGSPH). These households will be randomly assigned to three arms: (1) control, i.e., no intervention; (2) information only, i.e., community health workers will provide basic information on high blood pressure, the health consequences of excessive salt consumption, and feedback to the participant on the likely quantity of salt s/he consumes (estimated using a questionnaire); (3) free LSSS arm: the same information as in arm 2 will be provided, but participants will receive 6 months of free low-sodium salt along with education on the benefits of LSSS. One male and one female adult (age ≥ 18 years) in each household will be invited to participate, the exclusion criteria being households with members known to have high serum potassium levels, are taking medications known to elevate potassium levels (e.g., ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics), are already taking potassium supplements, or those who have known kidney disease or abnormal serum creatinine at baseline. The primary endpoint will be blood pressure at 6 months post-intervention. Recent large clinical trials of LSSS in China and India have shown not only blood pressure improvements, but also stroke, major cardiac event, and all-cause mortality reductions. Nevertheless, how to best translate this intervention to population-level effectiveness remains unclear. Our study would test whether a community health worker-based program could be effectively used to disseminate LSSS and achieve measurable blood pressure benefits. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05425030.

This has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The frontline health care workers, who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with COVID-19, are taking significant personal risks on their own health and those of their family members. Objectives of the study include establishing the physical, psychological and social impact experience by the healthcare workers serving in public hospitals of Bangladesh. This prospective cross-sectional observational study was carried out at Kuwait Bangladesh Friendship Government Hospital, the first Covid-19 designated hospital of Bangladesh between the 1st June and the 31st August, 2020. A total of 294 doctors, nurses, ward boys and ailed healthcare workers were included in this study via purposive sampling. The study found statistically significant (p value 0.024) difference of medical co-morbidities between Covid-19 positive and Covid-19 negative groups of health care professionals. Significant association was found between duration of work and presence during aerosol generating procedure with COVID infectivity of the study subjects. 72.8% respondents experienced public fear of contracting the virus from them and 69.0% noticed negative attitude of the society towards them. Eighty five percent (85.0%) did not get any community support during this pandemic crisis. The health care professionals engaged in COVID-19 treatment have been taking significant personal risk on their life in terms of physical, psychological and social perspective. Providing safeguard to the health care workers are integral components of public health measures for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Special interventions to promote their physical wellbeing and arrangement of adequate psychological training need to be immediately implemented to cope up this critical situation.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization recommends daily iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation during pregnancy, but consumption remains low, and high prevalence of anemia among pregnant women (PW) persists. This study aims to (1) examine factors at the health system, community, and individual levels, which influence adherence to IFA supplements; and (2) describe a comprehensive approach for designing interventions to improve adherence based on lessons learned from 4 country experiences. We conducted literature search, formative research, and baseline surveys in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and India and applied health systems strengthening and social and behavior change principles to design interventions. The interventions addressed underlying barriers at the individual, community, and health system levels. Interventions were further adapted for integration into existing large-scale antenatal care programs through continuous monitoring. Key factors related to low adherence were lack of operational protocols to implement policies, supply chain bottlenecks, low capacity to counsel women, negative social norms, and individual cognitive barriers. We reinforced antenatal care services and linked them with community workers and families to address knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and perceived social norms. Evaluations showed that adherence improved in all countries. Based on implementation lessons, we developed a program pathway and details of interventions for mobilizing health systems and community platforms for improving adherence. A proven process for designing interventions to address IFA supplement adherence will contribute to achieving global nutrition targets for anemia reduction in PW. This evidence-based comprehensive approach may be applied in other countries with high anemia prevalence and low IFA adherence.",

        "abstract": "Turmeric adulterated with lead chromate pigment has been previously identified as a primary source of lead exposure in Bangladesh. This study assesses the impact of a multi-faceted intervention between 2017 and 2021 to reduce lead-tainted turmeric in Bangladesh. The intervention involved: i) disseminating findings from scientific studies via news media that identified turmeric as a source of lead poisoning, ii) educating consumers and businesspeople about the risks of lead chromate in turmeric via public notices and face-to-face meetings, and iii) collaborating with the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority to utilize a rapid lead detection technology to enforce policy disallowing turmeric adulteration. Before and after the intervention, evidence of lead chromate turmeric adulteration was assessed at the nation's largest turmeric wholesale market and at turmeric polishing mills across the country. Blood lead levels of workers at two mills were also assessed. Forty-seven interviews were conducted with consumers, businesspeople, and government officials to assess changes in supply, demand, and regulatory capacity. The proportion of market turmeric samples containing detectable lead decreased from 47% pre-intervention in 2019 to 0% in 2021 (n = 631, p < 0.0001). The proportion of mills with direct evidence of lead chromate adulteration (pigment on-site) decreased from 30% pre-intervention in 2017 to 0% in 2021 (n = 33, p < 0.0001). Blood lead levels dropped a median of 30% (IQR: 21-43%), while the 90th percentile dropped 49% from 18.2 μg/dL to 9.2 μg/dL 16 months after the intervention (n = 15, p = 0.033). Media attention, credible information, rapid lead detection tools and swift government action to enforce penalties all contributed to the intervention's success. Subsequent efforts should evaluate if this is an example of an effective intervention that can be replicated to reduce lead chromate adulteration of spices globally.",

        "abstract": "Acute diarrhea remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality with over 6.3 billion cases and 1.3 million deaths annually. Despite the existence of standardized guidelines for diarrhea management, wide variability in clinical practice exists, particularly in resource-limited settings. The goal of this study was to qualitatively explore how diarrhea management in Bangladesh varies according to resource availability, clinical setting, and provider roles. This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional qualitative study conducted in three diverse hospital settings (district hospital, subdistrict hospital, and specialty diarrhea research hospital) in Bangladesh. A total of eight focus group discussions with nurses and physicians were conducted. Applied thematic analysis was used to identify themes regarding variations in diarrhea management. Of the 27 focus group participants, 14 were nurses and 13 doctors; 15 worked in a private diarrhea specialty hospital and 12 worked in government district or subdistrict hospitals. Several key themes emerged from the qualitative data analysis: 1) priorities in the clinical assessment of diarrhea 2) use of guidelines versus clinical judgment; 3) variability in clinician roles and between clinical settings influences care delivery; 4) impact of resource availability on diarrhea management; and 5) perceptions of community health workers' role in diarrhea management. Findings from this study may aid in informing interventions to improve and standardize diarrhea management in resource-constrained settings. Resource availability, practices regarding diarrhea assessment and treatment, provider experience, and variability in provider roles are essential considerations when developing clinical tools in low- and middle- income countries.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 has affected many people globally, including in Bangladesh. Due to a lack of preparedness and resources, Bangladesh has experienced a catastrophic health crisis, and the devastation caused by this deadly virus has not yet been halted. Hence, precise and rapid diagnostics and infection tracing are essential for managing the condition and limiting its spread. The conventional screening procedure, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is not available in most rural areas and is time-consuming. Therefore, a data-driven intelligent surveillance system can be advantageous for rapid COVID-19 screening and risk estimation. This study describes the design, development, implementation, and characteristics of a nationwide web-based surveillance system for educating, screening, and tracking COVID-19 at the community level in Bangladesh. The system consists of a mobile phone application and a cloud server. The data is collected by community health professionals <i>via</i> home visits or telephone calls and analyzed using rule-based artificial intelligence (AI). Depending on the results of the screening procedure, a further decision is made regarding the patient. This digital surveillance system in Bangladesh provides a platform to support government and non-government organizations, including health workers and healthcare facilities, in identifying patients at risk of COVID-19. It refers people to the nearest government healthcare facility, collecting and testing samples, tracking and tracing positive cases, following up with patients, and documenting patient outcomes. This study began in April 2020, and the results are provided in this paper till December 2022. The system has successfully completed 1,980,323 screenings. Our rule-based AI model categorized them into five separate risk groups based on the acquired patient information. According to the data, around 51% of the overall screened populations are safe, 35% are low risk, 9% are high risk, 4% are mid risk, and the remaining 1% is very high risk. The dashboard integrates all collected data from around the nation onto a single platform. This screening can help the symptomatic patient take immediate action, such as isolation or hospitalization, depending on the severity. This surveillance system can also be utilized for risk mapping, planning, and allocating health resources to more vulnerable areas to reduce the virus's severity.",

        "abstract": "How well patients adhere to their tuberculosis (TB) treatment influences their recovery and development of drug resistance, but influences on adherence are multiple and often competing. We synthesised qualitative studies from our setting in the Indian subcontinent to understand the dimensions and dynamics involved to help inform service provision. Qualitative synthesis comprising inductive coding, thematic analysis and forming a conceptual framework. Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), PsycINFO (EBSCOHost), Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos were databases searched on 26 March 2020 for studies published since 1 January 2000. We included reports in English from the Indian subcontinent that used qualitative or mixed-methodology designs and reported findings around adherence to TB treatment. Full texts meeting eligibility were sampled based on 'thickness' (the richness of the qualitative data reported). Two reviewers used standardised methods to screen abstracts and code. Included studies were assessed for reliability and quality using a standard tool. Qualitative synthesis was performed by inductive coding, thematic analysis and developing conceptual framework. Of 1729 abstracts screened from initial search, 59 were shortlisted for full-text review. Twenty-four studies that qualified as 'thick' were included in the synthesis. Studies were set in India (12), Pakistan (6), Nepal (3), Bangladesh (1) or in two or more of these countries (2). Of the 24 studies, all but one included people who were taking TB treatment (1 study included only healthcare providers), and 17 included healthcare workers, community members or both.We identified three themes: (1) personal influences on the people with TB include interconnections between their social role in the family unit, their own priorities in day-to-day living and their experience to date with the disease; (2) adherence is profoundly influenced by how individual healthcare providers interact with patients on treatment and address their needs; (3) adherence is influenced across communities by structural, social, economic and cultural factors related to treatment. Staff in TB programmes require an understanding of the various competing influences on individuals undergoing treatment. Programmes need to have more flexible and people-centred approaches to service provision in order to achieve adherence, and thus improve treatment outcomes. CRD42020171409.",

        "abstract": "(1) Background: COVID-19 caused the worst international public health crisis, accompanied by major global economic downturns and mass-scale job losses, which impacted the psychosocial wellbeing of the worldwide population, including Saudi Arabia. Evidence of the high-risk groups impacted by the pandemic has been non-existent in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study examined factors associated with psychosocial distress, fear of COVID-19 and coping strategies among the general population in Saudi Arabia. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in healthcare and community settings in the Saudi Arabia using an anonymous online questionnaire. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) were used to assess psychological distress, fear and coping strategies, respectively. Multivariate logistic regressions were used, and an Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was reported. (3) Results: Among 803 participants, 70% (<i>n</i> = 556) were females, and the median age was 27 years; 35% (<i>n</i> = 278) were frontline or essential service workers; and 24% (<i>n</i> = 195) reported comorbid conditions including mental health illness. Of the respondents, 175 (21.8%) and 207 (25.8%) reported high and very high psychological distress, respectively. Factors associated with moderate to high levels of psychological distress were: youth, females, non-Saudi nationals, those experiencing a change in employment or a negative financial impact, having comorbidities, and current smoking. A high level of fear was reported by 89 participants (11.1%), and this was associated with being ex-smokers (3.72, 1.14-12.14, 0.029) and changes in employment (3.42, 1.91-6.11, 0.000). A high resilience was reported by 115 participants (14.3%), and 333 participants (41.5%) had medium resilience. Financial impact and contact with known/suspected cases (1.63, 1.12-2.38, 0.011) were associated with low, medium, to high resilient coping. (4) Conclusions: People in Saudi Arabia were at a higher risk of psychosocial distress along with medium-high resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, warranting urgent attention from healthcare providers and policymakers to provide specific mental health support strategies for their current wellbeing and to avoid a post-pandemic mental health crisis.",

        "abstract": "Engaging communities is an important component of multisectoral action to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted research with non-communicable disease stakeholders in Bangladesh to understand how a community-led intervention which was shown to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in rural Bangladesh could be scaled-up. We purposively sampled any actor who could have an interest in the intervention, or that could affect or be affected by the intervention. We interviewed central level stakeholders from donor agencies, national health policy levels, public, non-governmental, and research sectors to identify scale-up mechanisms. We interviewed community health workers, policy makers, and non-governmental stakeholders, to explore the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the suggested mechanisms. We discussed scale-up options in focus groups with community members who had attended a community-led intervention. We iteratively developed our data collection tools based on our analysis and re-interviewed some participants. We analysed the data deductively using a stakeholder analysis framework, and inductively from codes identified in the data. Despite interest in addressing NCDs, there was a lack of a clear community engagement strategy at the government level, and most interventions have been implemented by non-governmental organisations. Many felt the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should lead on community engagement, and NCD screening and referral has been added to the responsibilities of community health workers and health volunteers. Yet there remains a focus on reproductive health and NCD diagnosis and referral instead of prevention at the community level. There is potential to engage health volunteers in community-led interventions, but their present focus on engaging women for reproductive health does not fit with community needs for NCD prevention. Research highlighted the need for a preventative community engagement strategy to address NCDs, and the potential to utilise existing cadres to scale-up community-led interventions. It will be important to work with key stakeholders to address gender issues and ensure flexibility and responsiveness to community concerns. We indicate areas for further implementation research to develop scaled-up models of community-led interventions to address NCDs.",

        "abstract": "Handwashing with water and soap (HWWS) is an effective method of cleaning and disinfecting the surface of the hands. HWWS is effective in infection control and prevention transmission, such as in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, rates of handwashing compliance vary globally. This systematic review aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators to community HWWS globally. We conducted a comprehensive search strategy in OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus using keywords and subject headings related to handwashing. Studies were excluded if they reported hand hygiene among healthcare or food service workers, considered the use of alcohol rubs, or involved an intervention in a healthcare or food preparation setting. The quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, and data were extracted from the articles and analyzed using the Theoretical Domains Framework and inductive thematic analysis. The search strategy yielded a total of 11,696 studies, and 46 studies met the eligibility criteria. Study dates ranged from 2003 to 2020 and included 26 countries; the most frequently represented were Bangladesh, India, and Kenya. A total of 21 barriers and 23 facilitators to HWWS were identified and organized into the Theoretical Domains Framework. The most frequently cited domains were environmental context and resources, goals, and knowledge. Nine themes emerged from these barriers and facilitators: resource availability, cost and affordability, handwash station design and infrastructure, accessibility, gender roles, champions, health promotion, time management, and knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors. This review uncovered multiple barriers and facilitators around a determinant framework to observe and create an in-depth, multidimensional image of a community-based hand hygiene situation. New comprehensive interventions and implementation strategies can be developed using the findings to target the contextual barriers and facilitators to improve and increase HWWS rates. Stakeholders (i.e., practitioners, researchers, policymakers) can use the findings to revise, design, or evaluate new or existing projects, interventions, and policies to improve HWWS. Registration: A protocol for this systematic review was developed and uploaded onto the PROSPERO-International prospective register of systematic reviews database (Registration number: CRD42020221210).",

        "abstract": "While research has been conducted on the availability, accessibility, and affordability of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, little information is available on the ways in which health workers, especially those in humanitarian settings see themselves, and engage in self-preparedness for social, physical, and mental health and practical care in the pandemic. We sought to address this gap. We followed a constructivist grounded theory approach to guide in-depth interviews with 30 frontline doctors, nurses, and community healthcare workers recruited from the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh using the purposive and snowball sampling methods. Analyses were carried out through the identification of codes in three phases: an initial line-by-line open coding, then focused axial coding, and finally selective coding. An emergent-grounded theory of \"Navigating Self-Preparedness through Pandemics\" was developed as we built a five-phased theoretical framework examining health worker responses with the following pillars: (a) pandemic shock; (b) pandemic awareness; (c) pandemic learning; (d) pandemic resilience, and (e) pandemic resurgence. The theory emerged as a realistic, socially, and culturally sensitive COVID-19 strategy to support healthcare workers. Self-preparedness was characterized by two interwoven processes: (1) the experiences of the daily life span of healthcare workers attempting to improve their own protection using all their potential while providing care for patients in a vulnerable setting and time and (2) the inseparable role of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual factors in each stage of learning during the pandemic to achieve better outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxaemic pneumonia mortality risk in low-income and middle-income countries is high in children who have been hospitalised, but unknown among outpatient children. We sought to establish the outpatient burden, mortality risk, and prognostic accuracy of death from hypoxaemia in children with suspected pneumonia in Bangladesh. We conducted a prospective community-based cohort study encompassing three upazila (subdistrict) health complex catchment areas in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Children aged 3-35 months participating in a community surveillance programme and presenting to one of three upazila health complex Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) outpatient clinics with an acute illness and signs of difficult breathing (defined as suspected pneumonia) were enrolled in the study; because lower respiratory tract infection mortality mainly occurs in children younger than 1 year, the primary study population comprised children aged 3-11 months. Study physicians recorded WHO IMCI pneumonia guideline clinical signs and peripheral arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturations (SpO<sub>2</sub>) in room air. They treated children with pneumonia with antibiotics (oral amoxicillin [40 mg/kg per dose twice per day for 5-7 days, as per local practice]), and recommended oxygen, parenteral antibiotics, and hospitalisation for those with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 90%, WHO IMCI danger signs, or severe malnutrition. Community health workers documented the children's vital status and the date of any vital status changes during routine household surveillance (one visit to each household every 2 months). The primary outcome was death at 2 weeks after enrolment in children aged 3-11 months (primary study population) and 12-35 months (secondary study population). Primary analyses included estimating the outpatient prevalence, mortality risk, and prognostic accuracy of hypoxaemia for death in children aged 3-11 months with suspected pneumonia. Risk ratios were produced by fitting a multivariable model that regressed predefined SpO<sub>2</sub> ranges (<90%, 90-93%, and 94-100%) on the primary 2-week mortality outcome (binary outcome) using Poisson models with robust variance estimation. We established the prognostic accuracy of WHO IMCI guidelines for death with and without varying SpO<sub>2</sub> thresholds. Participants were recruited between Sept 1, 2015, to Aug 31, 2017. During the study period, a total of 7440 children aged 3-35 months with the first suspected pneumonia episode were enrolled, of whom 3848 (54·3%) with an attempted pulse oximeter measurement and 2-week outcome were included in our primary study population of children aged 3-11-months. Among children aged 3-11 months, an SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 90% occurred in 102 (2·7%) of 3848 children, an SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90-93% occurred in 306 (8·0%) children, a failed SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement occurred in 67 (1·7%) children, and 24 (0·6%) children with suspected pneumonia died. Compared with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of 94-100% (3373 [87·7%] of 3848), the adjusted risk ratio for death was 10·3 (95% CI 3·2-32·3; p<0·001) for an SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 90%, 4·3 (1·5-11·8; p=0·005) for an SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90-93%, and 11·4 (3·1-41·4; p<0·001) for a failed measurement. When not considering pulse oximetry, of the children who died, WHO IMCI guidelines identified only 25·0% (95% CI 9·7-46·7; six of 24 children) as eligible for referral to hospital. For identifying deaths, in children with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 90% WHO IMCI guidelines had a 41·7% sensitivity (95% CI 22·1-63·4) and 89·7% specificity (88·7-90·7); for children with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 90% or measurement failure the guidelines had a 54·2% sensitivity (32·8-74·4) and 88·3% specificity (87·2-89·3); and for children with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of less than 94% or measurement failure the guidelines had a 62·5% sensitivity (40·6-81·2) and 81·3% specificity (80·0-82·5). These findings support pulse oximeter use during the outpatient care of young children with suspected pneumonia in Bangladesh as well as the re-evaluation of the WHO IMCI currently recommended threshold of an SpO<sub>2</sub> less than 90% for hospital referral.

        "abstract": "Universal screening for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia risk assessment is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics to reduce related morbidity. In Bangladesh and in many low- and middle-income countries, there is no screening for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Furthermore, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia may not be recognized as a medically significant condition by caregivers and community members. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and operational feasibility of community health worker (CHW)-led, home-based, non-invasive neonatal hyperbilirubinemia screening using a transcutaneous bilimeter in Shakhipur, a rural subdistrict in Bangladesh. We employed a two-step process. In the formative phase, we conducted eight focus group discussions with parents and grandparents of infants and eight key informant interviews with public and private healthcare providers and managers to explore their current knowledge, perceptions, practices, and challenges regarding identification and management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Next, we piloted a prenatal sensitization intervention and home-based screening by CHWs using transcutaneous bilimeters and evaluated the acceptability and operational feasibility of this approach through focus group discussions and key informant interviews with parents, grandparents and CHWs. Formative findings identified misconceptions regarding neonatal hyperbilirubinemia causes and health risks among caregivers in rural Bangladesh. CHWs were comfortable with adoption, maintenance and use of the device in routine home visits. Transcutaneous bilimeter-based screening was also widely accepted by caregivers and family members due to its noninvasive technique and immediate display of findings at home. Prenatal sensitization of caregivers and family members helped to create a supportive environment in the family and empowered mothers as primary caregivers. Adopting household neonatal hyperbilirubinemia screening in the postnatal period by CHWs using a transcutaneous bilimeter is an acceptable approach by both CHWs and families and may increase rates of screening to prevent morbidity and mortality.",

        "title": "Developing Community-Based Palliative Care for Children: A Community Case Study from an Urban Informal Settlement in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Globally, more than 97% of children needing palliative care reside in low- and middle-income countries, where there is very limited access to palliative care. Several community-based palliative care programs focused on adults, have been described in resource limited settings, suggesting a simple and low-cost approach to providing palliative care. The implementation of community-based palliative care for children has not previously been described. This community case study describes the implementation of an innovative model of community-based palliative care program in and urban informal settlement, (Korail Slum, Bangladesh). The program is led by a local government hospital, with experience in community-based palliative care, in partnership with the local community. Children with serious conditions in an urban unformal settlement do not have access to health services which address their medical, psychosocial and spiritual needs. This gap leads to a significant burden of preventable suffering for them and their families. A community-based palliative care program was implemented, which includes home care by trained community health workers, with support and supervision from palliative care nurses and physicians. The program's objective is to provide effective symptom management, clear communication about the child's condition with parents, and psychosocial support including support for basic needs. The program was free for families including medications, medical equipment, physiotherapy, and speech therapy. The program was monitored through regular assessments of quality of life using standardized tools (PedsQL Family Impact Module), as well as interviews and focus group discussions. A model of community-based palliative care for children can be implemented in an urban informal settlement. Program effectiveness is enhanced by community health workers who share language, culture, and life-experiences with the individuals they serve. Partnerships with local health care facilities and community groups strengthen the program's sustainability. Ensuring financial sustainability remains a challenge.",
