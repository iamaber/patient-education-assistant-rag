        "abstract": "Insecticide resistance in disease-transmitting arthropods of agricultural, veterinary, and public health significance poses a significant threat to vector control programs worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that blood-feeding arthropod vectors experience high mortality when ingesting blood containing inhibitors of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), the second enzyme in tyrosine metabolism. This study investigated the mosquitocidal efficacy of HPPD inhibitors from the β-triketone class of herbicides against both susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of three major disease vector species, including mosquitoes that transmit historical diseases such as malaria, reemerging infections such as dengue and Zika, and emerging viral threats such as Oropouche and Usutu viruses. Four HPPD inhibitors (nitisinone, mesotrione, sulcotrione, and tembotrione) were screened using glass plate tarsal bioassays at 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> against bloodfed Anopheles gambiae s.s. Kisumu. Nitisinone was selected for evaluation against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu, An. gambiae s.l. Tiassalé 13, An. coluzzii VK7 2014, Culex quinquefasciatus Muhezha, and Aedes aegypti New Orleans. Mosquitocidal activity was assessed using glass plate tarsal contact bioassays, topical application assays (0.0001% to 1% w/v), and modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassays (0-30 μg per bottle). Female mosquitoes aged 3-5 days were bloodfed within 1 h before exposure. Mortality was recorded at 30 min and 24, 48, and 72 h post-exposure under controlled conditions. A total of 3 biological replicates of 30 mosquitoes per treatment were used. Only nitisinone, and not mesotrione, sulcotrione, or tembotrione, exhibited significant mosquitocidal activity when bloodfed mosquitoes were exposed to treated surfaces. No significant differences in susceptibility to nitisinone were observed between insecticide-susceptible An. gambiae and strains harboring multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms. The compound demonstrated consistent efficacy across all three mosquito species tested, indicating broad-spectrum activity against major disease vectors. This study demonstrates that nitisinone exhibits a novel mode of action distinct from current Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) classifications by specifically targeting blood digestion processes. Its efficacy against resistant strains and potential for integration into existing vector control interventions, such as treated bednets and indoor residual spraying, highlight nitisinone as a promising candidate for expanding strategies against malaria, dengue, Zika, and other emerging viral diseases.",

        "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes debilitating joint pain and fever with limited treatment options. Cinnamic acid, known for its broad-spectrum biological activities, and its derivatives were evaluated for their potential antiviral effects against CHIKV. In vitro experiments assessed the cytotoxicity of cinnamic acid and its derivatives and their efficacy in inhibiting CHIKV under different treatment settings. Additionally, molecular docking of the effective compounds with CHIKV proteins was performed to determine the probable targets. The results indicated that the derivative CATD-3, a 3,6-(substituted phenyl)-(1,2,4) triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazole compound, showed antiviral activity under post-infection treatment conditions in Vero CCL-81 cells. The dose-dependent studies revealed that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 11.49 µM and the selectivity index of CATD-3 was 13.39. The antiviral activity of CATD-3 was also observed in HeLa cells. In-silico studies revealed that the CATD-3 binds multiple non-structural proteins (nsP) i.e., nsP1, nsP2, and nsP4 of the virus with good binding energies and forming strong interactions with conserved residues on nsP1 methyl transferase (Val 129, Tyr 130, Ala 131) and nsP2 helicase (Met 91, Met 289, and Thr 261) and critical residues of the nsP4 RdRp (Arg331 and Asp 350). The combined in vitro and in silico studies underscores the therapeutic potential of cinnamic acid derivative, CATD-3, as a promising antiviral candidate against CHIKV.",

        "abstract": "Background Dengue has emerged as the most common arboviral infection in India and worldwide. Dengue presents with a varied clinical spectrum in different age groups. The changing epidemiology and presentation are a challenge for early diagnosis and management. This prospective observational study aimed to determine the epidemiological profile of hospitalized dengue-positive children aged 0-14 years and correlate their clinical and hematological profiles. Methodology One hundred and five children with laboratory-confirmed dengue were enrolled in this study over a six-month study period. They were categorized into severe and non-severe dengue according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Detailed clinical examination and laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and imaging (chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound), were performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Results Out of the total 105 cases, 90 children (85.7%) had non-severe dengue and only 15 (14.3%) had severe dengue. The mean age of children was 92.02 months, with a male predominance (72, 68.6%). The most commonly identified symptoms were fever (105, 100%), vomiting (47, 44.76%), and abdominal pain (46, 43.81%). It was found that although thrombocytopenia was seen in 79 children (75.2%), it was not significantly associated with the severity of the disease (<i>P</i> = 0.2364). The study found a high recovery rate (101, 96.3%) with a mortality of 3 patients (2.8%) in severe cases. Elevated serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels (<i>P</i> = 0.0025), pleural effusion on chest X-ray (<i>P</i> = 0.000452), abdominal pain (<i>P</i> = 0.0041), and a positive tourniquet test (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) were found to be significantly associated with severe dengue. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were both found to be positive more frequently in severe cases compared to non-severe cases (<i>P</i> = 0.0361). Conclusions This study observed a high rate of recovery and low mortality, owing to the timely management. A possible shift in the seasonal distribution of dengue was observed, with many cases occurring in the winter season. While thrombocytopenia was prevalent, it was not found to be significantly associated with disease severity or bleeding. On the other hand, elevated liver enzymes, pleural effusion, abdominal pain, and a positive tourniquet test were found to be more strongly associated with severe dengue. They may serve as valuable early clinical indicators for the severity of the disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dengue is a virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, with rare cases of vertical transmission occurring through infected mothers. Acute infection can be identified by molecular viral testing or by detecting dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and elevated serum IgM. This report describes the case of a 4-day-old male neonate with fever, rash, and jaundice due to vertical transmission of maternal dengue virus infection, confirmed by NS1 detection. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 4-day-old male neonate admitted with high fever, rash, and jaundice. Initial laboratory investigations showed thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of systemic inflammation. The mother and infant both tested positive for dengue NS1 antigen, confirming vertical transmission. The neonate received supportive management in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), including intravenous fluids and platelet transfusions. He gradually recovered without complications and was discharged in stable condition. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the importance of considering congenital dengue in neonates born to mothers with peripartum dengue infection. NS1 antigen testing can aid early diagnosis, even before seroconversion occurs. Prompt supportive care, especially monitoring and treating thrombocytopenia, is essential for a favorable outcome. Increased awareness and standardized management guidelines are needed to improve neonatal care in similar cases.",

Despite numerous research initiatives aimed at developing effective antiviral therapy, no clinically proven drug or vaccine has been identified to combat all four genetically diverse serotypes of DENV. Therefore, comparative analysis of repurposed drugs and phytocompounds against all DENV serotypes is critical in the search for an effective long-term solution to this menacing disease. 93 phytocompounds and 15 drugs were shortlisted from the literature and screened using DataWarrior 5.5.0, from which 10 phytocompounds and 10 drugs were selected for further analysis. Molecular docking was performed by using AutoDockVina tool. Toxicity and drug likeness activity of standard drugs and phytoconstituents was done by using online servers. The current study showed that among all the selected phytoconstituents, lupiwighteone showed the best binding energy, favorable pharmacokinetics and no toxicity with all the selected serotypes of DENV. The MD simulation result supported the stability of lupiwighteone in complexes with NS3, NS5 and E-Protein. This study identifies lupiwighteone as a promising antiviral candidate with favorable drug-like properties against DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 serotypes. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo study is required for the validation of antiviral activity of Lupiwighteone against dengue virus.",

DENV remains a global health concern, with increasing cases due to climate change, urbanization, and mosquito adaptation. The structural biology of DENV, including its envelope (E), membrane (M), capsid (C) proteins, and RNA genome, plays a critical role in transmission and infectivity. The transmission cycle begins when mosquitoes ingest the virus from an infected human and later transmit it to others after viral replication within their salivary glands. Structural adaptations occur both in the mosquito host and human cells, enhancing viral stability and infectivity. Host-virus interactions, such as immune evasion and cellular entry mechanisms, further complicate disease progression. This review highlights the impact of structural changes on viral replication, pathogenesis, and resistance, while emphasizing recent research advancements and future challenges. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutics and controlling DENV spread.",

        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea, caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is one of the most devastating diseases in the global pig industry due to its high mortality rate in piglets. The host factors required for PEDV replication, including receptors, remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a porcine membrane-protein-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (PigMpCKO) library and performed two rounds of PEDV infection. Ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), the known receptor of dengue virus, was found to be a potent host factor. Moreover, our research revealed that RPSA is involved in the replication stage of PEDV and not in the entry stage. Inhibitor and activator experiments demonstrated that knockout (KO) of RPSA downregulates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to impair PEDV infection. Additionally, RNA sequencing data indicated that cellular lipid biosynthesis and lipid transport processes were significantly inhibited in the absence of RPSA during PEDV infection. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, resulting from RPSA KO, was partially mediated by the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to impaired lipid accumulation during PEDV replication. Interestingly, RPSA KO also significantly downregulated the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN) and inhibited infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), both of which belong to the swine enteric coronavirus group. In summary, our results establish RPSA as a novel host factor that is critical for coronavirus replication. This provides new insights into the mechanisms of virus-host interactions and paves the way for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. Swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs) cause severe economic losses to the global swine industry and pose a potential threat to public health. Identification of receptors required for PEDV infection could develop novel targets for drug therapy and disease-resistant breeding. We conducted a CRISPR/Cas9 screen targeting membrane proteins in porcine kidney cells infected with PEDV to identify possible receptors and discovered numerous novel candidate host factors. Considering RPSA's known role as a receptor for multiple viruses, we focused on investigating its potential in coronavirus infection. Our results revealed that RPSA does not contribute to the entry stage but to the replication stage of coronavirus infection. We first reported the role that RPSA plays in the regulation of APN expression and lipid metabolism. RPSA is essential for PEDV and other SeCoVs replication, providing a novel insight into the search for the receptor of PEDV and identifying potential therapeutic targets for coronaviruses.",

        "abstract": "The dramatic surge in dengue cases in early 2024, endangering half the global population, urgently necessitates faster diagnostic methods. Nanotechnology-enabled optical biosensors offer a promising avenue, leveraging nanomaterial properties for highly sensitive detection of dengue virus (DENV), potentially surpassing conventional techniques in terms of simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness. This systematic review analyzes recent advancements in these biosensors for DENV diagnosis. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases (2010-June 1, 2025; OSF: https://osf.io/3gmey/). The methodological quality of the 98 included studies was assessed using a modified CASP checklist. Diverse nanotechnology-based optical biosensors were identified. SPR (36.7%) was the most common transducer, followed by fluorescence (24.5%), colorimetry (15.3%), and SERS (8.2%). Gold-based nanomaterials (35.7%) were most frequently employed, with silver nanomaterials (15.3%), quantum dots (15.3%), and graphene-based materials (15.3%) also showing promise. DENV NS1 protein was the primary target analyte (21.4%). Importantly, almost half of the studies (44.9%) used clinically relevant human samples. While many optical biosensors show promise, challenges hinder their demonstration of the true potential for point-of-care use in their current format; however, they offer high specificity and faster results, laying a strong foundation for cost-effective clinical diagnostics. Nanotechnology-driven optical biosensors offer a transformative approach for DENV detection. Advances in computational design and green synthesis of novel nanomaterials are key to addressing stability and field-deployment challenges. These innovations are crucial for developing robust, sensitive, and user-friendly tools to manage dengue and improve patient outcomes globally.",

Their compositions are versatile, depending on their structures, including the number of rings in the polyphenol composition. Based on these attributes, polyphenols can be classified as flavanols, anthocyanins, flavones, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans. Polyphenols mainly possess inhibition of viral replication, interference with viral protein synthesis, and modulation of immune responses, providing significant antiviral effects against several viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, and influenza. They are crucial for medical compounds in diverse, versatile treatments, namely in diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative problems. Plants are the primary source of bioactive molecules, which are valued for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities. Especially, polyphenols are extracted as the most abundant bioactive compounds of plants. Moreover, viral infections are one of the major factors in illnesses and diseases, along with bacteria and fungi. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies report antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, Mayaro virus, dengue virus, herpesvirus, and influenza A virus, though clinical validation remains limited.

Laboratory studies assessing DENV inhibition by Wolbachia typically have not considered natural frequent mosquito blood feeding behavior. Here, we determine the impact of successive feeding on DENV-2 transmission by Ae. aegypti in the presence or absence of Wolbachia (wAlbB and wMelM strains). We show that successive feeding shortens the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) in wildtype (WT; without Wolbachia) and wAlbB mosquitoes through enhanced dissemination. Feeding empirical data into models showed that successive feeding increases the probability of WT and wAlbB mosquitoes surviving beyond the EIP. Importantly, the more epidemiologically relevant comparison of the odds of wAlbB mosquitoes surviving beyond the EIP relative to WT, reveals a larger impact of successive feeding on WT than wAlbB.

        "abstract": "Dengue remains a significant public health threat, yet the disease burden among the elderly has remained poorly quantified. This study aims to analyse the spatiotemporal trends in the dengue burden among the elderly at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021. Data on the dengue burden were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. This study described the incident cases, deaths, number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and corresponding rates for dengue among adults aged 70 years and above in 1990 and 2021 by sex, age, socio-demographic index (SDI), GBD region, and country. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to assess the temporal trends in dengue burden from 1990 to 2021. Between 1990 and 2021, the global incidence and DALYs rate of dengue among the elderly were lower than those in the entire population, whereas the mortality rate remained consistently higher. During this period, the incident cases, deaths, and DALYs for dengue worldwide increased by 372.69%, 439.15%, and 404.06%, respectively. In 2021, the global incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates of dengue among the elderly were 666.10, 1.28, and 23.92 per 100 000 population, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, the incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates of dengue showed an overall upward trend, with average annual percentage changes (AAPC) of 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-2.35), 2.58 (95% CI: 2.02-3.14), and 2.35 (95% CI: 2.20-2.69), respectively. Regionally, the highest incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates occurred in low-middle SDI regions. The highest dengue burden were primarily concentrated in Tropical Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The dengue burden among adults aged 70 years and above has significantly increased over the past three decades, with substantial variations across SDI levels, regions, and countries. Targeted measures, including developing clinical management guidelines, enhancing vaccine research, and conducting community education, are urgently needed to reduce the burden in this vulnerable population.",

Cases of acute abdomen have been reported in dengue fever and they include acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, and nonspecific peritonitis. This case report illustrates a case of acute appendicitis in dengue fever and aims to describe the relationship between both conditions. We report a case of a 25-year-old lady who presented with symptoms of dengue fever and was confirmed to have the disease. She was on treatment for dengue but subsequently developed acute appendicitis. She later underwent appendectomy and the appendix was confirmed to be inflamed both intraoperatively and histologically. Dengue virus can cause periappendiceal inflammation (periappendiceal fluid collection and mesenteric lymphadenopathy/adenitis) or acute appendicitis (which can progress to appendiceal perforation or appendicular mass formation). Periappendiceal inflammation presents with clinical features mimicking acute appendicitis but without appendicitis on ultrasonography or laparoscopy. Periappendiceal inflammation can also progress to appendicitis. For patients with dengue fever, diagnosis of acute appendicitis should not be based on clinical findings alone. Serial ultrasonography to confirm appendicitis is recommended. Conservative treatment with antibiotics should be the first line for acute appendicitis in dengue fever or periappendiceal inflammation in dengue. Surgical treatment is required in cases of appendiceal perforation or failure of conservative management.",

        "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of fucosylated IgG in plasma, specific IgGs with low core fucosylation sporadically emerge in response to virus infections and blood cell alloantigens. This low fucosylation of IgG is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections. In COVID-19, the presence of IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) targeting spike protein predicts disease progression to a severe form and actively mediates this progression. This study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 infection of megakaryocytes promotes the generation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgGs, leading to outcomes, such as pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and mortality in FcγRIIa-transgenic mice. Platelets from mice injected with virus-infected human megakaryocytes express significant activation biomarkers, indicating a direct link between the immune response and platelet activation. Mice injected with virus-infected human megakaryocytes demonstrate an elevated rate of thrombus formation induced by FeCl<sub>3</sub> (4%) and a reduction in bleeding time, emphasizing the intricate interplay of viral infection, immune response, and hemostatic complications. Treatment with inhibitors targeting FcγRIIa, serotonin, or complement anaphylatoxins of mice injected with spike-expressing MKs successfully prevents observed platelet activation, thrombus formation, and bleeding abnormalities, offering potential therapeutic strategies for managing severe outcomes associated with afucosylated IgGs in COVID-19 and related disorders.",

This review focuses on elucidating the binding mechanisms between the capsid protein and the viral genome, as well as their potential applications as therapeutic targets. In particular, it summarizes the research progress on small-molecule drugs targeting the capsid-genome binding sites of dengue virus, HBV, and SARS-CoV-2.

        "abstract": "Co-infections of dengue serotypes and dengue with other flaviviruses pose substantial hurdles in disease diagnosis, treatment options, and disease management. The overlapping geographic distributions and mosquito vectors significantly enhance the probability of co-infections. Co-infections may result in more severe disease outcomes due to elevated viral loads, modulation of the immune response, and antibody enhancement. Cross-reactivity in serological assays and the likeness of clinical presentations add to the ongoing challenges in disease diagnosis. Molecular diagnostics such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are, therefore, employed for more specific disease diagnosis although requiring substantial resources. Despite the advancements, specific anti-flaviviral therapy is still limited, hence the urgency for further investigative research into various therapeutic approaches, including peptide inhibitors, host-targeted therapies, and RNA-based interventions. This review discusses the epidemiology, clinical ramifications, and diagnostic obstacles associated with flavivirus co-infections whilst assessing prospective strategies for better disease prevention, treatment, and management. Addressing these critical gaps is essential for disease mitigation whilst improving patient management especially in regions where co-circulation of flaviviruses is common and their diseases are highly endemic.",

        "abstract": "Emerging RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV) continue to pose major challenges to animal and public health due to their high mutation rates, wide host ranges, and immune evasion strategies. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of a marine bacterial extract derived from <i>Parerythrobacter</i> sp. M20A3S10 against IAV (H1N1; H3N2), influenza B virus (IBV), ZIKV, and DENV2. The extract demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral effects with favorable selectivity indices across multiple host-derived epithelial cell lines. Notably, post-infection treatment significantly suppressed viral replication, suggesting a host-modulating or replication-inhibiting mechanism. While the extract's active components have yet to be identified, bacteria from the <i>Erythrobacteraceae</i> family are known producers of bioactive metabolites with potential antiviral properties. These findings provide preliminary insight into the potential of marine-derived bacterial compounds in veterinary antiviral development and highlight the need for further characterization and in vivo validation.

        "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is caused by dengue virus (DENV) and is primarily spread through bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions, including Ethiopia. In the Afar region, DF is often misdiagnosed as malaria due to limited diagnostic capabilities. This study assessed the seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in healthcare facilities in the Afar region. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2022 to March 2023 in Amibara, Harunka and Awash Sebat city administration districts, involving febrile patients suspected of having malaria. Sociodemographic data, clinical features and blood samples were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent or assent. Following blood film examination for Plasmodium infection, sera were tested for anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were entered into Epi Data 3.1 and analyzed with Stata/SE 14.2. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 411 febrile patients (55.5% female, aged 5-80 years, with a mean age of 27.3 ± 13.8 years) participated in the study. Among those tested for anti-DENV antibodies, 101/410 (24.6%) were positive for anti-DENV IgM, indicating an acute DENV infection, and 142/367 (38.7%) were positive for anti-DENV IgG, revealing previous exposure. Only 44/411 (10.7%) were positive for Plasmodium infection, while 18/410 (4.4%) were co-infected with malaria and acute DENV infection and 18/367 (4.9%) were positive for both malaria and previous exposure to DENV. Those diagnosed with malaria were nearly 2.5 times more likely to test positive for acute DENV infection than those without malaria (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.92). The odds of positivity for previous exposure were about two times higher in females than in males (AOR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.32-3.26) and in government and private sector employees than in pastoralists and agro-pastoralists (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.03-8.15), while patients aged 11-20 years had lower odds of previous exposure than those aged 5-10 years (AOR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.88). Experiencing muscle pain was associated with twice the odds of previous exposure (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.04-3.49). The study reveals a high seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in the study area, highlighting the need for routine diagnosis and management of DF in this setting. Improving vector control, disease surveillance and public awareness would be crucial for combating DF and other mosquito-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Arboviral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika are public health concerns worldwide. Prevention and control of these diseases still depend on controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors. Sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT) are environmental friendly approaches that show promising impacts. In order to plan an implementation of SIT/IIT technology, background knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito vectors and their prevention and control, as well as acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the technology, in the targeted communities are needed. In this paper, we conducted questionnaire surveys on KAP and WTP in 400 sampled households in seven communities located in two districts in Bangkok, Thailand. Multivariate logistic regressions analysis was used to determine the association among knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Our findings indicated that participants had high knowledge on dengue (85.25%), and they were more concerned with the severity of dengue than chikungunya and Zika. Participants with ages lower than 35 years old (p = 0.047) and incomes higher than 5,000 THB (p = 0.016) had more knowledge of mosquito vectors. Moreover, 47% of respondents had positive attitude toward sterile mosquitoes and their application in vector control even though 45.5% of them had never heard about the technology. However, the majority of them were not willing to pay (52%); and if they had to pay, the maximum would be 1-2 THB (US$ 1 = ~34 THB) per sterile mosquito, since most of them expected to receive the service as public support from the government. Our study was the first to study KAP and WTP related to SIT/IIT technology. It provided unique insights into how communities view the technology. It also suggested potential for successful implementation with proper education as well as highlighted the need for cost-sharing strategies with government subsidization for SIT/IIT deployment. Municipal officials and community health volunteers were key communication channels and targeted public education was needed, especially on under-recognized diseases like chikungunya and Zika. These findings should be useful for health authorities in planning to integrate SIT/IIT technology with traditional approaches for disease vector control and prevention.",

        "abstract": "The misuse and overprescription of antibiotics have accelerated the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), rendering many antibiotics ineffective and leading to significant clinical challenges. The conventional treatment methods have become progressively challenging, posing a threat of evolving into an impending silent pandemic. The long track record of bacteriophages combating bacterial infections has renewed hope into the potential therapeutic benefits of bacteriophages. Bacteriophage therapy offers a promising alternative to antibiotics, particularly against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. This article explores the promise of phages as a potential means to combat superbugs from the perspective of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of the phages and their bacterial host. Advances in bacteriophage genomics have expedited the detection of new phages and AMR genes, enhancing our understanding of phage-host interactions and enabling the identification of potential treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. At the same time, holo-transcriptomic studies hold potential for discovering disease and context-specific transcriptionally active phages vis-à-vis disease severity. Holo-transcriptomic profiling can be applied to investigate the presence of AMR-bacteria, highlighting COVID-19 and Dengue diseases, in addition to the globally recognized ESKAPE pathogens. By simultaneously capturing phage, bacterial and host transcripts, this approach enables a better comprehension of the bacteriophage dynamics. Moreover, insight into these defence and counter-defence interactions is essential for augmenting the adoption of phage therapy at scale and advancing bacterial control in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "<i>Orthoflavivirus nilense</i>, formerly known as West Nile Virus (WNV), has become endemic to the United States since its introduction in 1999. Current surveillance methods rely primarily on mosquito pool testing, which is both costly and time-intensive. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has proven an effective method for the surveillance of various pathogens, including other orthoflaviviruses such as Dengue. WBE for WNV represents a potentially valuable surveillance approach that has so far been underexplored. A targeted droplet digital reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach (ddRT-PCR) was used to measure WNV concentrations in wastewater retrospectively from five locations and in over 600 samples. Three of these locations were in communities with multiple confirmed WNV infections, while two were not. Samples were collected during periods corresponding to typical WNV seasonality (spring to fall). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured simultaneously to assess nucleic acid degradation during sample storage. Publicly available confirmed WNV case data were compiled from the California and Nebraska departments of public health and their weekly arboviral reports. WNV RNA was detected in wastewater samples during periods of known viral circulation within a community. The adopted ddRT-PCR assay is highly specific and sensitive, and detections in wastewater solids correspond to the occurrence of cases in the season and location of sampling. WNV was detected in nine samples in three locations with known WNV clinical cases-wastewater positivity rates in these locations ranged from 3.3% to 13%. The results suggest that wastewater monitoring could serve as an effective complement to traditional surveillance methods, particularly for sentinel surveillance in locations which do not have extensive mosquito and clinical testing systems.",

        "abstract": "Annually, millions of people are affected by mosquito-borne Orthoflavivirus infections. These include diseases caused by the Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), posing a formidable challenge to global public health. This research aims to explore the potential role of the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA) in Orthoflavivirus infection, particularly focusing on key metabolites involved in the process of viral invasion into the central nervous system. Given the advantages of metabolomics technology in metabolite identification. Therefore, we employed an untargeted Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics platform to examine alterations in metabolite concentrations within the feces and brain tissues of mice infected with DENV, JEV, or ZIKV, as well as uninfected controls. The results showed that 225, 240, and 252 differential metabolites were identified in the fecal metabolome of DENV, JEV, and ZIKV infections, respectively, with amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism being significantly disrupted. In the brain metabolome, 37, 81, and 18 differential metabolites were identified for DENV, JEV, and ZIKV infections, respectively, with lipid metabolism and purine metabolism being significantly disrupted. Amino acids with low abundance in viral proteins are significantly disrupted in the amino acid metabolism pathway, suggesting that Orthoflaviviruses adapt to its needs for synthesizing viral proteins by regulating the host's amino acid composition. The disruption of purine metabolism also implies the viral genome replication process occurring in the brain. Moreover, the disturbance of lipid metabolism is highly correlated with the biological function of the Orthoflavivirus envelope, where Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) may be the key for Orthoflaviviruses to enter the human central nervous system via the GBA. This research is the first to explore the potential role of GBA in Orthoflavivirus infection through joint metabolomic analysis of fecal and brain tissue samples, providing new insights into viral invasion of the central nervous system. The findings not only elucidate the characteristics of viral infection from complementary perspectives of fecal and brain tissue samples, revealing associated metabolic changes, but also establish a foundation for subsequent identification of biomarkers to diagnose disease states-particularly for predicting central nervous system infection risks. The specific patterns revealed by fecal metabolomics analysis provide the theoretical basis for developing non-invasive predictive approaches to assess brain infection status in the future.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is currently the most important arbovirosis in the world, affecting over 120 countries in both tropical and sub-tropical areas, with 2500 million people at risk. Due to global warming, it is expected that <i>Aedes aegypti</i> will be able to survive at higher latitudes, increasing the number of people at risk. Therefore, it is crucial to develop control strategies for the mosquito to prevent its environmental impact. The objective of this paper was to determine the concentration of entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) <i>Steinernema carpocapsae</i> that produces the highest percentage mortality of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae under normal environmental conditions in Yucatán (6.9 - 8.7 mg/l; temperature 25.9 - 31.5°C; pH 7.20 - 8.10). The <i>S. carpocapsae</i> mode of action consists of <i>Xenorhabdus nematophila</i> bacterial release in the haemocele insect, which produces septicaemia and consequently kills the mosquito larvae 24 - 48 h after intake. As for the methodology, a commercial EPN strain was used for experimental infection. The experimental design was a 70-h static bioassay that exposed 10 mosquito larvae per experimental unit (400-ml flask and five replicates per treatment) to four nematode concentrations (1250, 2500, 3125 and 3750 nematodes per ml) plus controls. The best treatment was with 1250 nematodes/ml, which caused 54 % mortality with respect to controls after 70 h (one-way ANOVA; <i>F</i> <sub>5.72, 0.05</sub>; <i>p</i> < 0.04). We concluded that <i>S. carpocapsae</i> is a promising biological control tool for killing <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae at an experimental level. However, it is still necessary to determine its performance at higher volume scales in real-life conditions.",

No significant differences were found between ibuprofen-exposed/ibuprofen groups and acetaminophen group in terms of platelet reduction, bleeding events, severe thrombocytopenia, or the incidence of severe dengue (all p > 0.05). Ibuprofen group had a significantly shorter fever duration (p = 0.046), while acetaminophen group showed a significantly greater elevation in alanine aminotransferase levels (p = 0.029). All patients were followed up post-discharge, and none experienced gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months. This study suggests that safety of low-dose ibuprofen is consistent with acetaminophen for fever management in non-severe dengue patients.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic potential of five natural compounds from Carica papaya - olean-12-ene, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and kaempferol - against dengue virus (DENV) using a multi-faceted in silico approach. Quantum chemical analysis using density functional theory (DFT) revealed insights into the electronic properties and stability, with olean-12-ene exhibiting the highest stability (HOMO-LUMO gap: 6.91 eV), while luteolin and apigenin showed balanced reactivity profiles suitable for biochemical interactions. ADMET profiling underlined the drug-likeness of these compounds: Quercetin showed good solubility (logS: -2.93) and hydrogen bonding potential, apigenin showed high oral bioavailability (HIA: 93.25%) and olean-12-ene exhibited remarkable permeability (Caco-2: 1.26). Molecular docking simulations against the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease, the NS1 protein and the envelope protein provided further insight into their binding affinities and interaction modes. Toxicity assessments indicated manageable risks, although flavonoids exhibited moderate hepatotoxicity and olean-12-ene showed cardiotoxic/nephrotoxic tendencies, suggesting a need for further optimization. Overall, these results highlight the potential of specific papaya-derived compounds, particularly the flavonoids, as candidates for further experimental validation in the development of anti-DENV therapeutics. This work lays a foundation for future in vitro and in vivo studies to combat DENV infection and associated complications such as thrombocytopenia.",

This study assessed a machine learning model to identify a minimal, yet highly predictive biomarker set, aiming to support clinical decision-making and patient triage. A total of 48 inflammatory mediators were quantified from plasma samples collected at admission from confirmed dengue patients, classified as either dengue without warning signs (DF) or dengue with warning signs/severe dengue (DWS/SD). A random forest approach was applied to identify the most predictive biomarkers associated with disease severity requiring hospitalization, based on admission-time variables. Among the 48 immune mediators, 43 were differentially expressed in dengue patients versus healthy controls, and 26 showed significant differences between DF and DWS/SD cases. Lymphocyte counts negatively correlated with IL-1RA, while liver enzymes showed positive correlations with HGF and SCGF-beta; platelet counts also negatively correlated with these markers. Key severity-associated markers included HGF, TNF-beta, MIP-1-beta, and SCGF-beta. A model incorporating these markers and fever duration achieved nearly 80% accuracy in distinguishing DWS/SD from DF cases, independent of clinical examination. The findings suggest that targeted cytokine profiling may guide early hospitalization decisions and ease healthcare burdens in dengue-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Infections caused by mosquito-borne viruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have become a global public health issue. However, due to the unclear pathogenic mechanisms, there are currently no specific treatments available for patients infected with these orthoflaviviruses in clinical practice. Metabolomics provides distinct advantages for characterizing infection features and deciphering disease pathogenesis. Therefore, this review summarizes relevant literature on mosquito-borne viruses metabolomics, with a particular focus on elucidating the metabolic characteristics of cells infected by orthoflaviviruses. By conducting a comparative analysis of the metabolomics data from different sample sources infected with DENV, ZIKV, and JEV, we found that several metabolic pathways involved in viral infection, replication, and pathogenesis are commonly disrupted in the metabolomics data of these orthoflaviviruses. These pathways include the reprogramming of lipid metabolism, interference with energy metabolism, and the induction of host inflammatory responses. These findings identify key targets for subsequent mechanistic studies on the persistent replication and transmission of orthoflaviviruses in mosquito vectors and their ability to cause severe pathology in human hosts. Further elucidations of the above mechanisms could provide an effective scheme for preventing orthoflaviviral transmission in mosquito vectors and treating orthoflaviviral infections. In addition, studying these metabolomic changes in human hosts of orthoflaviviral infections may be able to provide relevant biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of the disease.",

The Aedes mosquito vector's migration, aided by adaptation to climate change has allowed Dengue virus to spread into temperate regions. The major impact of the disease occurs in regions with limited resources, creating a significant burden for these countries. There is a growing body of information characterizing the neurological disorders related to pediatric Dengue infection. In addition to reviewing Dengue virus structure, disease diagnostic criteria and current WHO guidelines, this article discusses the neuropathogenic mechanisms of infection, and the resultant impact on the central and peripheral nervous systems. Our group has created a framework correlating the presentation of neurologic disorders to Dengue virus phases of infection. There is an urgent need for epidemiological analysis and a systematic approach to catalogue the emerging reports of pediatric neurological disorders related to dengue virus infection.

Resource availability in the healthcare systems of LMICs is often inconsistent and, in many cases, insufficient to meet the needs of the local population. One major health concern in LMICs is the high burden of parasitic and viral infections of the nervous system, illnesses that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past 50 years, several LMICs in tropical and subtropical regions have experienced an emergence, re-emergence, or upswing in arthropod-borne viral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.

BCN0941 is a structure-based designed antiviral peptide that inhibits early stages of DENV infection in mammalian cells [WO2015131858A2]. Studies of structure-activity relationship indicate that the molecular target of the antiviral activity of BCN0941 is the Low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1), an evolutionary conserved receptor that we have identified as putative DENV receptor in mammalian cells. In this work, we evaluated the antiviral activity of BCN0941 peptide against DENV serotype 1 in mosquito cells. In vitro assays were performed in cell lines C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and Aag2 (Aedes aegypti). The antiviral activity in vivo in a metapopulation of field-collected A. aegypti mosquitoes was also evaluated. BCN0941 peptide exhibited the capacity to decrease viral infection in both experimental set up, in vivo and in vitro, up to a 50% and 60% of the treatment controls respectively, as determined by immunofluorescence.

Antibodies targeting EDE were prevalent and associated with broad neutralization of mature DENV1 to DENV4 virions in those with evidence of at least two prior DENV infections but were mostly absent in those with only one prior infection. Subsequent infection and vaccination boosted titers of EDE-like antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and DENV-binding antibodies. EDE-like antibodies were associated with reduced risk of symptomatic dengue and more severe dengue and statistically explained the protective effect of binding and neutralizing antibodies on dengue. Thus, antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes help explain the broad cross-protection observed in those with multiple prior DENV exposures, making them useful for evaluation and development of future vaccines and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "New tools and methods are currently under evaluation by the World Health Organization for preventing arbovirus transmission, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. One promising approach involves deploying Aedes aegypti with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to disrupt arbovirus transmission within endemic urban environments. The release program of mosquitoes with the Wolbachia's wMel strain started in August 2017 in 6.88% of the city area of Rio de Janeiro, where 13.1% of the city's population live (~890,000 inhabitants). The deployment of Wolbachia wMel strain in Rio finished in December 2019 with a suboptimal 32% introgression of wMel strain, which coincided with a 38% and 10% reduction of dengue and chikungunya, respectively. We conducted an independent evaluation during 20 consecutive months to evaluate whether the wMel distribution and frequency would expand or retract. More than 50,000 mosquitoes were sampled in 12 neighborhoods with estimated 500,000 inhabitants, of which 39.2% were Ae. aegypti. In total, 7,613 of 19,427 collected Ae. aegypti were screened individually for wMel. Climate, environmental and insecticide application data was used to model the spatiotemporal introgression of wMel. The routine insecticide rotation adopted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health caused the crash of both wMel-infected and -uninfected populations shortly after an increase in coverage with spinosad. However, the wMel-uninfected mosquitoes recovered soon to levels even higher than before, whereas the wMel-infected failed to recover after the population crash. The well documented fitness cost of wMel in egg hatching leads to the absence of an egg bank necessary to recover after adult population was disrupted. Finally, we observed the mtDNA haplotype associated with released Wolbachia at a frequency of ~25% in field-caught uninfected mosquitoes. The reason underlying the poor introgression of Wolbachia wMel strain is multifold. The adoption of an effective larvicide that crashed both wMel-infected and -uninfected populations, the absence of an egg bank due to high fitness cost of egg hatching in the wMel-infected mosquitoes, a suboptimal Wolbachia invasion before the intervention, and Wolbachia loss synergically contributed to the lower invasion and, by corollary, modest epidemiological outcome in Rio de Janeiro. Our results highlight the need to plan and implement technical guidance on Integrated Vector Management in Brazil prior and during the nationwide release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to optimize dengue mitigation efforts while ensuring the judicious use of resources.",

The biosynthesized Ag-NPs, characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, Zeta potential, and DLS analyses, exhibited potent larvicidal and pupicidal activities, with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.501, 20.875, and 22.649 ppm, respectively. The morphological and histopathological alterations in treated larvae, alongside significant modulation of antioxidant (SOD, GPx) and detoxification (GST, AChE) enzymes, indicate oxidative stress as a key mode of action.

        "abstract": "Effective dengue management hinges on targeting key vector breeding sites and understanding transmission risks. Despite recurring outbreaks in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province since 2013, comprehensive entomological and virological data remain scarce. This study identified key larval-based indicators (habitats, Stegomyia indices), mosquito species composition, and dengue virus (DENV) infection rates in Aedes mosquitoes, evaluating their contributions to outbreak risk. From July to December 2021, a cross-sectional larval survey of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus was conducted across epidemiologically high-risk KP districts, inspecting water-holding containers located indoors, outdoors, and on rooftops. Additionally, adult mosquitoes were collected using aspirators and nets, with weekly dengue case data sourced from Peshawar's Directorate of Health Services. A subsample of 200 adult mosquito pools (20 per district) underwent RT-PCR to determine minimum infection rates (MIR). Larval indices revealed a House Index (HI) of 19.4%, a Container Index (CI) of 20.4%, and a Breteau Index (BI) of 89%. Aedes aegypti was the dominant species, accounting for 62% of larvae and 67.8% of adult mosquitoes. Peshawar (BI = 89.3), Nowshera (BI = 71.4), and Mardan (BI = 57) reported the highest Breteau indices and corresponding dengue case counts: 2,584 (48.8%), 404 (7.6%), and 327 (6.2%), respectively. The peak larval positivity was recorded in October (29.3%) and September (24.7%), aligning with dengue patient hospitalization rates of 52.8% and 46.8%, respectively. Common breeding sites included indoor flowerpots (25.4%), outdoor rubber tyres (16%), and roof tap water (23.7%). Container type and location significantly (P < 0.00) predicted larval abundance. Regression analysis revealed significant associations between dengue incidence, population density, and stegomyia indices. Of 38 positive pools (19%), DENV-2 and DENV-3 predominated (47.4% each), with peak MIRs recorded in Peshawar (30), Mardan (25), and Haripur (25). High larval indices and dual-serotype circulation in adaptable Aedes vectors signal substantial outbreak risk in KP. These findings underscore the need for targeted vector strategies, focusing on containers with the highest breeding potentials and epidemiological significance, particularly in high-transmission areas. Further molecular and entomological investigations are critical to corroborate these findings and inform more effective interventions.",

Moreover, the absence of IFN-γ signaling limits the capacity of the AG129 model. To date, wild-type mouse models of DENV infection have only exhibited mild symptoms without lethality, limiting their research applicability. In this study, we developed a lethal C57BL/6 wild-type mouse model infected with DENV-2 365 strain. By blocking the type I interferon receptor before the virus challenge, we allowed the immune response to be restored at a later stage of infection. Following infection, the mice exhibited severe symptoms, including weight loss, high viremia levels, elevated inflammatory cytokines, significant vascular leakage, and pathological changes in the brain, kidney, liver and spleen. The model also displayed severe central nervous symptoms and 100% mortality. Additionally, we used this model to evaluate an adaptable NS2A protein mutation found in both Zika virus and DENV-2.

The review distinguishes between seroprevalence studies, which assess exposure to infection in asymptomatic populations, and overt disease studies, which focus on symptomatic cases and the host-specific factors that affect disease severity. It identifies key risk factors such as age, geography, gender, professional occupation, and socio-economic status, noting their varying impacts on disease transmission and progression across different MBDs. Environmental factors such as climate, mosquito breeding habitats, and urbanization are also reported as significant drivers of vector distribution and human-vector interactions. The review emphasizes the need for tailored, region-specific interventions to control MBD in the MENA region and highlights the importance of integrated vector control, improved sanitation, surveillance programmes, and public health education. The review also stresses the growing influence of climate change on disease patterns and calls for a multi-sectoral approach to MBD control. While focusing on the MENA region, the findings suggest the need for further research and region-specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of these diseases.",

        "abstract": "Northeast India is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE), which causes acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Though there is no specific therapy for JE, many etiological agents of AES are treatable. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the AES cases for their etiologies, laboratory parameters, and associated clinical manifestations. A hospital-based prospective observational study was carried out, enrolling all consecutive cases of AES satisfying the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. Blood was tested for the malaria parasite. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed by Gram staining, India ink staining for <i>Cryptococcus</i>, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture for other bacteria and fungi<i>.</i> Serum and CSF samples lacking the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IgM were processed for the detection of other etiologies. The CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect <i>Enterovirus</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>, and herpes simplex virus, and serum IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) detected scrub typhus, <i>Leptospira</i>, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile antibodies. Out of 395 AES cases tested, 77 were found to be positive for non-JE etiologies. Of these, dengue virus (n=32/371; 8.6%) was the most common, followed by scrub typhus (n=16/348; 4.6%) and <i>Leptospira</i> (n=10/362; 2.8%). Positive cases showed CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC/cumm) and significantly higher protein level (n=6/11; 55%) and sugar level (n=8/11; 73%) in <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae.</i> All cases presented with fever (n=11/11; 100%), followed by altered mental status (n=18/19; 94.7%) and seizure (n=22/32; 68.7%). The number of non-JE causes of AES in Assam is higher. Scrub typhus, dengue virus, and <i>Leptospira</i> are other major infectious etiologies of AES that are treatable. Timely diagnosis of such cases will help reduce AES-related complications and mortality.",

        "abstract": "Post-Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) sequelae involve complex biological processes that can alter the progression and clinical outcome of other infectious diseases. However, there is no documented information on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of severe malaria and dengue. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the association between malaria & dengue and previous COVID-19 infection among the adult population of Mangalore Taluk and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of malaria & dengue. This case-control study was conducted among 293 participants who were positive for either malaria or dengue from November 2022 to August 2024. Data were collected using a proforma which contained sections on demographic details, clinical profile and comorbidities, history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination status. The participants were categorised into having severe disease and mild to moderate disease based on operational definitions. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29. Chi-square test was done, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary Logistic Regression analyses were used and odds ratios were estimated. A total of 293 participants were included in the study with a mean age of 36.7 (SD:14.8) years. Among them, 23.9% (n = 70) had malaria and 76.1% (n = 223) had dengue. Out of those who had malaria, 30% (n = 21) developed severe illness, whereas among those who had dengue 35.8% (n = 80) developed severe dengue. Overall, 58.4% (n = 171) were in the age group of > 30 years. In total, 98.1% (n = 52) of the participants with dengue fever with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe dengue, (aOR:55.93 (95% CI:7.17-435.92) p < 0.001) compared to those without. Similarly, 85.7% (n = 12) of the participants with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe malaria (aOR: 263.7 (95% CI: 34.9-1987.4) p < 0.001) compared to those and these differences were found to be statistically significant. In addition, those participants belonging to lower socio-economic classes had higher chances of developing severe dengue than those belonging to the upper socio-economic class (p < 0.001*). Those with a prior history of COVID-19 infection had higher chances of developing severe malaria and dengue than those without a history of COVID-19 infection.",

        "abstract": "Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is a serious complication of dengue infection which occurs when critical plasma leakage results in haemodynamic shock. Treatment is challenging as fluid therapy must balance the risk of hypoperfusion with volume overload. In this study, we investigate the potential utility of wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) to determine volume status in DSS. In this prospective observational study, we enrolled 250 adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of dengue admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City. PPG monitoring using a wearable device was applied for a 24-hour period. Clinical events were then matched to the PPG data by date and time. We predefined two clinical states for comparison: (1) the 2-hour period before a shock event was an \"empty\" volume state and (2) the 2-hour period between 1 and 3 hours after a fluid initiation event was a \"full\" volume state. PPG data were sampled from these states for analysis. Variability and waveform morphology features were extracted and analyzed using principal components analysis and random forest. Waveform images were used to develop a computer vision model. Of the 250 patients enrolled, 90 patients experienced the predefined outcomes, and had sufficient data for the analysis. Principal components analysis identified four principal components (PCs), from the 23 pulse wave features. Logistic regression using these PCs showed that the empty state is associated with PCs 1 (p = 0.016) and 4 (p = 0.036) with both PCs denoting increased sympathetic activity. Random forest showed that heart rate and the LF-HF ratio are the most important features. A computer vision model had a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.70 for the empty state. These results provide proof of concept that an artificial intelligence-based approach using continuous PPG monitoring can provide information on volume states in DSS.",

Our present study successfully demonstrated the production of the envelope protein structural domain III (EDIII) dengue virus antigen in tobacco chloroplasts. We obtained transformed tobacco lines that show the expression of EDIII dengue antigen and were confirmed through Southern blotting analysis. Furthermore, the expression of EDIII antigen was further confirmed via immunoblotting and quantified. These findings suggest that tobacco chloroplast engineering holds promise as a method for future manufacture of an oral dengue boost vaccine that is safe, affordable, and effective, contributing to the global management and control of this particular dengue infection.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) and Monkeypox virus (MPXV) are two major re-emerging viral pathogen, which have recently gained global attention, mainly in light of their potential for widespread transmission and the ability to cause various complications. While the characteristic manifestations of these infections comprise lymphadenopathy, fever, and rash, recent studies suggest a darker dimension, neuropsychiatric complications, which are a hallmark of neurovirulent viral pathogens. However, current evidence suggests that these complications, which may vary from mild to critical conditions such as meningitis and encephalitis, are not well understood, posing marked challenges in the realm of diagnosis and treatment. In other words, while neuropsychiatric presentations of DENV and MPXV appear as an area of concern, diagnosing these manifestations remains challenging owing to their general characteristics and overlap with those of other pathological conditions and the lack of the central nervous system (CNS)-focused diagnostic tools. This can delay early detection and subsequent appropriate surveillance of DENV- and MPXV-associated neuropsychiatric complications. The present review focuses on describing various DENV- and MPXV-associated neuropsychiatric complications, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and their current diagnostic challenges.",

        "abstract": "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Dengue virus (DENV), represent significant global health threats. Beyond their acute systemic illnesses, many arboviral infections are characterized by debilitating and often chronic musculoskeletal complications, including arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, and bone pain. Evidence suggests that these pathologies may stem, at least in part, from the viruses' direct or indirect interference with fundamental cellular processes governing skeletal homoeostasis, particularly osteogenesis (bone formation) and bone remodelling. Key signalling pathways critical for osteoblast differentiation and function, such as Wnt/β-catenin, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Notch, and Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B Ligand (RANKL) pathways, are potential targets for viral manipulation or dysregulation by the host inflammatory response. This article reviews the current understanding of how arboviruses might interact with osteogenesis-associated signalling pathways, explores the link between this interaction and musculoskeletal disease, and proposes that targeting these pathways could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate the long-term skeletal sequelae of arboviral infections.",

        "abstract": "The ineffectiveness of current prevention efforts is underscored by the increasing number of dengue cases, emphasizing the necessity of innovative approaches. This investigation investigates the extent of stakeholder acceptability and attitudes toward the alternative autocidal trap method and the current fogging technique. The objective is to identify differences in community viewpoints regarding these control techniques among various stakeholder groups, including scientists and the public. Information was collected from two separate groups of individuals: scientists and the general people. A comprehensive survey assessed the level of tolerance and attitudes towards fogging and autocidal traps. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software, specifically utilizing the one-way MANOVA test, to identify any significant variations in attitudes among various stakeholder groups. The results reveal significant discrepancies in the perceived danger level between the two groups since the public views fogging as a riskier activity than scientists. However, the groups had no significant difference in the reported benefits. Scientists exhibited a greater degree of endorsement for both fogging and autocidal traps when compared to the public. While the general population showed more openness towards fogging, scientists have shown a more balanced approval of both tactics. These insights are essential for policymakers and health practitioners as they inform the creation of more efficient, community-oriented initiatives to address the increasing prevalence of dengue cases.",

        "abstract": "<i>Aedes aegypti</i> , a primary vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, displays remarkable adaptability across ecological gradients. Central to this resilience is the egg stage, which must withstand fluctuating moisture and temperature conditions. Environmental transitions, particularly changes in moisture availability, significantly influence egg hatching success in mosquitoes. This study investigates how parental exposure to variable hydration conditions shapes key reproductive traits in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> . Using four environmental regimes, continuous wet, continuous dry, wet-to- dry, and dry-to-wet, we assessed egg output, hatching success, thermotolerance, and egg nutrient composition across three <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations. Our results show that oviposition timing and egg production are significantly affected by the hydration environment experienced by the parental generation. While the wet, dry, and dry-to-wet groups exhibited a consistent oviposition peak beginning four days post-blood feeding, the wet-to-dry group showed delayed reproductive investment, with peak egg production occurring later. Egg output was highest under continuous wet conditions and significantly reduced in the dry and wet-to-dry treatments across all populations. Interestingly, the wet-to-dry group showed significantly higher egg-thermotolerance than any other group, and this pattern was consistent across all three populations under high- temperature stress conditions (41°C and 45°C). Nutritional composition showed an increased glycogen level in eggs when parents were exposed to wet conditions before blood feeding. By integrating physiological and ecological metrics such as hatching rates and thermal stress resilience, we demonstrate how parental environments shape subsequent egg performance, highlighting adaptive responses that enable <i>Ae. aegypti</i> persistence under increasing climate variability.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus is a mosquito transmitted flavivirus that cause inapparent or mild disease but can also cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. Cross-reactive IgG antibodies can cause under specific conditions antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection via Fc-receptor interaction. Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 (anti-S) causing COVID-19 disease can also cross-react against the dengue envelope (anti-E). We therefore investigated the antibody profile of these cross-reactive antibodies and their ability to induce ADE. We found that the cross-reactive anti-E in COVID-19 vaccinated are dominated by IgM/A while, anti-S from vaccinated or anti-E from dengue infected patients have an IgG1 dominated antibody profile. The low-level anti-E IgG from COVID-19 vaccinated are dominated by low Fc-affinity IgG2/4 subclass. These antibodies were able to induce in vitro ADE stronger than from Dengue infected for the 1<sup>st</sup>,2<sup>nd</sup> dose of the vaccine or later omicron variant booster. This could partially be explained that ADE was inhibited by the complement system in dengue infected but not in COVID-19 vaccinated.",

In this Phase 1, open-label study (NCT05201937), high- and low-dose weekly, and twice weekly maintenance doses (MDs) of mosnodenvir were evaluated following a twice daily loading dose (LD) over 2 days. The utility of a convenient capillary blood sampling device (TASSO-M20) was also explored. Healthy adults were sequentially assigned to receive: 450 mg twice daily LD, 900 mg once weekly MD; 450 mg twice daily LD, 450 mg twice weekly MD; 150 mg twice daily LD, 300 mg once weekly MD; or 150 mg twice daily LD, 150 mg twice weekly MD. Mosnodenvir exposure rapidly increased with LD and was maintained during the MD phase. In general, mosnodenvir increased in a dose-proportional manner with similar areas under the concentration-time curve between once weekly and twice weekly MD. The mean terminal elimination half-life across treatments was 6.7-8.7 days, supporting less frequent dosing. Safety and tolerability were similar across all treatment regimens.

Traditional surveillance and control systems often struggle with delayed reporting, limited predictive capacity, and resource constraints. Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity to enhance dengue prevention, control, and management through data-driven decision-making. This review synthesizes current applications of AI across key domains: outbreak forecasting, vector control, clinical management, and public health intervention. Machine learning models have demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting dengue outbreaks using environmental, climatic, and epidemiological data. AI-powered image recognition and autonomous systems support more effective mosquito monitoring and habitat targeting. In clinical settings, AI assists with early diagnosis, severity prediction, and treatment planning. Additionally, AI-driven tools facilitate real-time analysis of behavioral data and community engagement through mobile platforms. However, challenges remain, including data standardization, model interpretability, and ethical concerns around data privacy. This review highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and robust infrastructure to scale and sustain AI-based systems.

        "abstract": "Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the dengue virus (DENV) is essential for viral replication and immune evasion, primarily functioning as a dimer or hexamer. The β-roll domain plays a crucial role in NS1 dimerization, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. This study investigates the potential of a synthetic peptide derived from the β-roll domain to disrupt NS1 dimerization and function. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the peptide binds strongly to NS1, destabilizing its secondary structure and impairing its biological function. SPR analysis revealed a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.12 μM and a Gibbs free energy change (∆G) of -9.44 kcal/mol, indicating high binding affinity and thermodynamic favorability. CD spectroscopy confirmed a significant reduction in β-sheet content, with a corresponding increase in disordered structures, suggesting peptide-induced destabilization of NS1. ELISA results further showed a concentration-dependent loss of NS1 recognition by specific antibodies, indicating functional impairment. Notably, ectoine, a natural osmolyte, enhanced peptide stability and interaction strength, further exacerbating NS1 disruption. These findings highlight the potential of β-roll-targeting peptides as novel inhibitors of NS1 function and propose ectoine as an effective stabilizing co-solvent to improve peptide efficacy. This study provides a strong foundation for developing peptide-based therapeutics against dengue virus infections.",

To identify the clinico-epidemiological characteristics, management, and outcomes of severe dengue fever among inpatients of a tertiary care hospital. Prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, Karnataka. Study included all laboratory-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to Departments of General Medicine and Infectious Diseases during the study period. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and analysed. Descriptive and analytical tests, including multiple logistic regression analyses, were performed. Among 443 patients, 70% were males. Fever (91.9%) and aches/pains (81.7%) were most frequently reported symptoms with thrombocytopenia (81.9%), elevated AST (81.2%), and ALT (73.3%) were commonly observed. Severe dengue was observed in 12.1% of patients, frequently accompanied by acute kidney injury (32.9%), hepatitis (29.4%), and multiple organ dysfunction (22.4%). Severe cases were associated with age over 60 (COR = 4.6; 95% CI:2.1-9.9), low education status (COR = 3.6; 95% CI:1.3-10.4), unskilled occupations (COR = 4.2; 95% CI:1.1-15.8), presence of co-morbidities (COR = 2.5; 95% CI:1.4-4.4) and co-infections (COR = 5.2;95% CI:2.7-9.8), and supportive treatment (COR = 3.9; 95% CI:2.1-7). Independent predictor for severity was coinfection (AOR = 15.6; 95% CI:3.9-61.7). Supportive care was received by 36.3% patients, with 97.5% showing improvement, while 1.6% succumbed to death.

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) remains a critical global health challenge, with no approved antiviral treatments currently available. The growing prevalence of DENV infections highlights the urgent need for effective therapeutics. Antiviral peptides (AVPs) have gained significant attention due to their potential to inhibit viral replication. However, traditional drug discovery methods are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep generative models (DGMs), offer a promising approach to accelerating AVP discovery. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of DGMs in identifying novel AVPs for DENV. It presents an extensive survey of existing antimicrobial and AVP datasets, peptide sequence feature representations, and the integration of DGMs into computational peptide design. Additionally, in vitro and in silico screening data from previous studies highlight the therapeutic potential of AVPs against DENV. Variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks have been extensively documented in the literature for their applications in AVP generation. These models have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to generate diverse and structurally viable compounds, significantly expanding the repertoire of potential antiviral candidates. Additionally, this report assesses both the strengths and limitations of DGMs, providing valuable insights for guiding future research directions. As a data-driven and scalable framework, DGMs offer a promising avenue for the rational design of potent AVPs targeting DENV and other emerging viral pathogens, contributing to the advancement of next-generation therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection is strongly associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, both of which carry mortality risks. Addressing the urgent need for effective dengue therapeutics, we identified sofalcone, a gastroprotective agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as a potential inhibitor of DENV replication. Sofalcone demonstrated efficacy against all four DENV serotypes, with the dose inhibiting 50% (IC50) value of 28.1 ± 0.42 μM against viral replication of DENV serotype 2, without significant cytotoxicity. Additionally, sofalcone significantly improved survival rates and reduced viral titers in DENV-infected ICR-suckling mice. Mechanistically, sofalcone induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression via the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-reated factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which in turn suppressed viral protease activity and restored antiviral interferon (IFN) responses. This included dose-dependent stimulation of IFN downstream antiviral genes such as 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2, and OAS3. Given its established clinical use as an anti-gastric ulcer drug, sofalcone offers promising potential for rapid application in treating DENV infection.",

        "abstract": "Imported malaria remains a significant diagnostic challenge, particularly in regions approaching elimination. This case report is novel in its exploration of the complexities involved in diagnosing malaria imported from a high-endemic area to a low-endemic region, emphasizing the critical role of detailed travel history and molecular diagnostics in identifying the disease. The case underscores the potential public health implications of missing such diagnoses in regions where routine malaria testing is not performed due to low endemicity. A 25-year-old male presented to a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry, India, with symptoms of intermittent fever, headache, loss of appetite, and vomiting, which persisted over a week. Initial laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, with negative tests for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus. Further investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified Plasmodium falciparum. The patient had recently returned from Burkina Faso, West Africa, where he had experienced similar episodes of fever, establishing the diagnosis of imported malaria. This case highlights the necessity of considering imported malaria in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses in India, a country nearing malaria elimination. It illustrates the importance of incorporating travel history into clinical evaluations and supports the use of molecular diagnostics to effectively diagnose malaria in settings where traditional diagnostic methods may overlook imported cases. The findings advocate for enhanced surveillance and diagnostic preparedness to manage imported cases of malaria, thereby supporting ongoing elimination efforts and preventing the re-establishment of local transmission.

        "abstract": "Dengue infection is one of the most widely spread flavivirus infections. Despite the fatality it could cause, no antiviral treatment is currently available to treat the disease and its associated pathophysiological conditions. This study aimed to search drug-like compounds for possible inhibitors of the NS5 protein of dengue virus (serotype 2). In the present study, a data set of twenty-five Beta vulgaris. L-based phytoconstituents was developed. We employed machine learning (ML) data pre-processing, screening of differentially expressed transcripts and genes, identification of common transcriptional signatures and pathways and function enrichment analysis of dengue infection; and protein-protein interaction network construction and identification of hub genes. ML data revealed that NS5 mRNA was downregulated by betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside. Moreover, administering these compounds can alleviate host innate immune factor suppression mediated by NS5, thereby exhibiting antiviral activity. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetics studies revealed a potential therapeutic role of betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside phytoconstituents as potent antiviral phytocompounds. MD simulation and post-simulation analysis, including principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation, confirmed the antiviral therapeutic potency of betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside against dengue virus infection. In vitro cytotoxic studies also depicted nontoxic effects of betanin and quercetin hydrate in Vero and CHO cells at a concentration range of 20-0.31 μM. In summary, computational screening and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis revealed that betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside may prove as potential drug candidates against dengue virus regarding their possible safety and antiviral activity in future.",

From 2020 to 2022, the Lee County Mosquito Control District (LCMCD) employed the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to test a new approach in its integrated mosquito management toolbox, targeting the population suppression of Ae. aegypti on Captiva Island, Florida. Over 24.1 million sterile males were released across three phases, covering up to 142 hectares. The study demonstrated a population reduction of up to 79% in wild adults and a 59% decline in egg densities in the primary intervention area. While population control was successful, an influx of wild females from untreated zones posed ongoing challenges to complete suppression in areas close to non-intervention areas. This supported a need for an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approach. These results underscore SIT's potential as a critical tool in integrated mosquito management strategies and emphasize practical application.",

In response to this unmet need, we developed the \"i-DENV\" web server to facilitate structure-based drug prediction targeting key viral proteins.

A total of 1213 and 157 unique compounds, along with their IC50 values targeting NS3 and NS5 respectively, were retrieved from the ChEMBL and DenvInD databases. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints were computed and used to train multiple regression-based MLTs, including SVM, RF, kNN, ANN, XGBoost, and DNN, with ten-fold cross-validation. The best-performing SVM and ANN models achieved Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.857/0.862 (NS3) and 0.982/0.964 (NS5) on training/testing sets, and 0.870/0.894 (NS3) and 0.970/0.977 (NS5) on independent validation sets. Model robustness was supported through scatter plots, chemical clustering, statistical analyses, decoy set etc. Virtual screening identified Micafungin, Oritavancin, and Iodixanol as top hits for NS2B/NS3 protease, and Cangrelor, Eravacycline, and Baloxavir marboxil for NS5 polymerase. Molecular docking further confirmed strong binding affinities of these compounds. Our <i>in-silico</i> findings suggest these repurposed drugs as promising antiviral candidates against DENV. However, further <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies are essential to validate their therapeutic potential.

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of oral AT-752 (750 mg thrice daily for 5 days) compared with a placebo in 21 adults with confirmed dengue infection. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in viral load via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing, with assessments performed daily on Days 1-8, 14, and 28. The primary endpoint was nonevaluable because many patients presented late during the course of disease, with low baseline viremia levels precluding accurate quantification at subsequent timepoints. In the as-treated population (patients with assessment at baseline and at each post-baseline timepoint), the numerical mean reduction (versus baseline) in viral load on Day 4 was greater in the AT-752 group than the placebo group (P = 0.0022). The median time to a sustained resolution of fever (the major clinical sign of dengue) was 4 days in the AT-752 group compared with >5 days in the placebo group; the reduction in oral temperature at the Day 4 timepoint was greater in the AT-752 group (treatment difference: 0.84°C; P = 0.0322). There was a trend toward faster platelet recovery in the AT-752 group compared with the placebo group, and proportionally fewer patients in the AT-752 group underwent hospitalization for disease progression (one patient in each group).

        "abstract": "Progressive unilateral hearing loss (PUHL) in adolescents is uncommon and presents diagnostic challenges due to its varied etiologies, including infections, ototoxicity, congenital anomalies, and autoimmune conditions, though many cases remain idiopathic. We report a 16-year-old male with a history of COVID-19, dengue at age 14, and recurrent headaches, who developed left-sided hearing loss progressing to profound unilateral deafness. Audiometry confirmed sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of 97 dB HL in the left ear and 35 dB HL in the right. Despite multiple evaluations, no definitive etiology was identified. Differential diagnoses included post-viral sequelae, congenital anomalies (e.g., Mondini dysplasia), and nasal obstruction, though insurance limitations restricted further testing. The patient discontinued hearing aid use due to limited benefit and experienced social withdrawal, impacting both academic performance and overall well-being. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and a systematic, multidisciplinary approach to PUHL, including imaging and genetic testing, given its potential impact on social development, mental health, and long-term outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is a multifunctional regulator involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and glucose metabolism. In this study, we investigated the role of TXNIP in viral infection and its potential as a therapeutic target. Our findings reveal that HSV-1 infection induces TXNIP upregulation, and elevated TXNIP levels promote viral replication by inhibiting MAVS aggregation. This inhibition disrupts the TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway, leading to reduced interferon-beta (IFN-β) production and impaired antiviral immunity. Conversely, TXNIP knockout significantly suppresses HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, we utilized Luteolin, a TXNIP degrader previously reported by our group, which restores MAVS aggregation and enhances antiviral responses, demonstrating potent antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this mechanism was also validated in dengue virus (DENV2) infection, suggesting a broader role for TXNIP in immune regulation. These findings establish TXNIP as a critical modulator of viral infection and highlight TXNIP degraders as promising candidates for antiviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes account for the highest number of infections among vector-borne diseases and continue to present a formidable global health challenge. Due to the nonavailability of direct treatment of dengue, vector control relies on the use of insecticides currently dominated by pyrethroids. Recurring applications of these insecticides lead to transgenerational impacts on their fitness and resistance dynamics. This study investigates the threat to vector control techniques by altered biological fitness, metabolic and molecular properties after selection with permethrin exposure. Populations of Ae. aegypti were treated with a sublethal dose of permethrin (LC<sub>50</sub>) in each generation, and their resistance status, together with its effect on biological fitness and transgenerational features, were analysed. To understand the different mechanisms of resistance development, detoxifying enzyme activity, the presence of kdr mutation and cuticular thickness were also analysed. Throughout the study, a prolonged larval and pupal stage was noted with reduced fecundity and hatchability. Moreover, biochemical assays revealed a major role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases behind permethrin resistance, which was supported by a piperonyl butoxide assay. Major kdr mutations F1534C and V1016G were also found. Overall, reduction in life traits of resistant populations may seem in favour of vector management but this may be the manipulative strategy of Ae. aegypti to divert the essential fuels away from these features and invest it towards the maintenance of insecticide resistance. Therefore, to effectively combat resistance, insecticides must be used judiciously as part of a comprehensive strategy that includes non-insecticide methods and regular surveillance.",

We conducted a retrospective study over 11 years (2014-2024) in the pediatric emergency and intensive care units of a quaternary hospital in North India. Children aged one month to 12 years diagnosed with ANEC were enrolled. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging findings, etiology, management, and outcomes were collected. The ANEC Severity Score (ANE-SS) was calculated. Thirty-two children were included (median age, 4 [interquartile range, 1-7] years; 53.1% male). Common clinical features included altered state of consciousness (96.9%), fever (93.7%), seizures (78.1%), and signs of raised intracranial pressure (46.9%). Organ dysfunctions included encephalopathy (100%), transaminitis (56.2%), and thrombocytopenia (46.9%). Neuroimaging revealed bilateral thalamic involvement in all cases. Etiology was identified in 37.5%, most commonly dengue virus (21.9%), followed by H1N1 (6.2%). Intensive care interventions included mechanical ventilation (56.2%) and vasoactive drugs (31.2%). Immunomodulatory therapy included methylprednisolone (78.1%), intravenous immunoglobulin (25%), and tocilizumab (15.6%). Survival rate was 78.1%. At discharge, the median Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score was 3 (3-4), indicating moderate to severe disability. High-risk ANE-SS was significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.007). ANEC remains a severe pediatric encephalopathy with high neuromorbidity. Dengue virus was the most common trigger in this cohort. Early identification and intensive care support, along with immunomodulation, are key. ANE-SS may serve as a valuable prognostic tool.",

Natural products, especially plant-derived compounds, have been crucial in drug discovery and often serve as scaffolds for synthetic drug development. This study focused on modifying paulownin, an isolated lignan, through a Click reaction to incorporate 1,2,3-triazole and quinolinic ring frameworks. The resulting derivative 7 was evaluated for its in vitro antiviral activity against Alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV). The paulownin derivative 7 did not exhibit cytotoxicity in Vero cells and demonstrated potent activity against CHIKV, with median effective concentration value of 9.05 µM and a selectivity index exceeding 16.8. Furthermore, compound 7 outperformed positive controls, being over 46 times more active against CHIKV. Cytopathic effect assays confirmed this anti-CHIKV activity. The virucidal assay indicated that the compound does not exert a direct effect on CHIKV particles before cell infection. RT-qPCR studies further demonstrated derivative 7 significantly reduces CHIKV replication. These findings highlight the paulownin derivative 7 as a promising and selective candidate for CHIKV treatment.",

        "abstract": "Epidemic-prone infectious diseases (EPIDs) such as dengue fever, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leptospirosis, Marburg virus disease, measles and cholera, to name a few, place a significant burden on the Tanzanian population and health system. Clinicians working in primary health facilities (PHFs), such as dispensaries, health centres, and basic hospitals, play a vital role in detecting cases and outbreaks. However, they often face challenges, including insufficient knowledge of these diseases and a lack of supporting resources, including surveillance guidelines, standard case definitions, and, most importantly, access to confirmatory diagnostic tests. Although Tanzania reports outbreaks of infectious diseases almost every year, a significant number of cases go undetected and contribute to delayed response and recurrent outbreaks. Smartphone-based clinical diagnostic decision support systems (CDSS) have been proven to help bridge case detection gaps. The Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (ESIDA) project proposed developing the ESIDA app, a smartphone-based CDSS, to aid clinicians in the detection of EPIDs. Before developing the app, the ESIDA project evaluated its acceptability among clinicians, the primary target users. The aim was to gather insights to inform the app development, ensuring its design and features are relevant and applicable in Tanzania context. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 clinicians, including medical doctors and clinical officers from public and private facilities in the Dar es Salaam region, which has reported frequent outbreaks of dengue and cholera. Data were collected and analyzed using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Clinicians were positive about the proposed ESIDA app and intended to use it once it was available. The facilitators and barriers to acceptability focused on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. Expected benefits, ease of use, and government involvement emerged as facilitators of acceptability, while high internet costs, workload, time constraints, infrastructure gaps, and patient resistance were identified as potential barriers. The development of the ESIDA app should prioritize maximizing system performance and benefits. They must also be user-friendly and in line with social norms. The necessary infrastructure must be in place for effective implementation.",

        "abstract": "Infections may be associated with an increased risk of poor brain health and frailty among older people, but evidence from low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. We aimed to investigate associations between nine infections and cognition, depression, and frailty in India. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from Wave 1 (2017–2019) of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) survey of adults (≥ 45years) from 35 of India’s 36 states and union territories. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews and direct health measurements. We investigated the association between nine infections, either self-reported ever (periodontal disease) or in the two years before interview (jaundice/hepatitis, malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid, chikungunya, diarrhoea/gastroenteritis, dengue, urinary tract infection [UTI]), and measured global cognitive function, depression, and frailty. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to compare odds of impaired cognition, depression, and frailty in people with and without infections, overall and for individual infections. We included 64,682 respondents; median age 59 years (IQR:50–67), 53.5% female, 35% reported at least one infection. After controlling for demographic, social/environmental and lifestyle factors, and chronic health conditions, we saw evidence of associations between infection and both depression (OR: 1.28 [95%CI: 1.22–1.35]) and frailty (OR: 1.74 [95%CI: 1.65–1.84]). UTIs were associated with the highest odds of both depression (OR: 1.33 [95%CI: 1.14, 1.55) and frailty (OR: 2.94 [95%CI: 2.51, 3.44]). Reporting at least one infection was associated with reduced odds of impaired cognition (OR: 0.80 [95%CI: 0.74–0.86]). Our results suggest infections are associated with increased depression and frailty in adults over 45 in India. Our finding of association between reported infections and better cognition, is potentially explained by preferential infection recall in those with better cognition. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate potential causal links between infections and adverse brain health and frailty and guide interventions to improve the health of older people in India and other LMICs.

This study assessed age-specific immune responses and the effects of vaccination on neutralization against wild-type (WT) and JN.1 variants. We analyzed 4,371 serum samples from individuals aged 6 months-80 years (May-August 2024). We found that 95.1% of participants had detectable anti-N Ig, suggesting widespread prior infection. Among unvaccinated children (6 months-4 years), 96.5% exhibited anti-RBD or anti-N Ig antibodies mostly from asymptomatic infections. Neutralization against JN.1 did not significantly differ by age, but children aged 6 months-4 years exhibited higher JN.1 neutralization than WT, while individuals aged ≥ 12 years showed the opposite pattern. Unvaccinated individuals demonstrated stronger neutralization against JN.1, whereas vaccinated participants had lower neutralization against JN.1 relative to WT, regardless of vaccine dose. No significant differences in JN.1 neutralization were observed across vaccine doses or age groups. Although 86.5% of participants exhibited neutralizing activity against JN.1, the titers remained relatively low. These findings highlight that almost all children experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that natural exposure maintains immunity in adults. Infection-driven boosting may improve community-wide protection and alleviate immune imprinting, offering key insights for optimizing vaccine strategies.",

        "abstract": "Climate change and global warming significantly affect the incidence and distribution of infectious ocular diseases. This narrative review explores how climate-related factors-including extreme weather events, precipitation, temperature fluctuations, humidity, wind patterns, ultraviolet radiation, and air pollution-can directly and indirectly influence the burden of ocular infections. By synthesizing evidence from the published literature, we examine how these environmental variables impact disease mechanisms such as pathogen survival, transmission dynamics, and host susceptibility. Increased precipitation has been associated with a higher incidence and recurrence of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), likely due to the enhanced spread of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts through contaminated water and soil. Rainfall also creates breeding habitats for mosquitoes, facilitating the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Rift Valley fever. Rising temperatures and humidity have been linked to increased rates of fungal infections, particularly fungal keratitis in tropical regions. Wind has been implicated in the airborne dispersal of pathogens, including fungal spores, T. gondii oocysts, and insect-derived particles such as moth setae, potentially contributing to OT and seasonal hyperacute panuveitis. Air pollution further exacerbates dry eye disease, which influences the vulnerability to microbial keratitis. These climate-related shifts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations-particularly those living in rural, low-income, and tropical areas. This review highlights the urgent need for further research into climate-sensitive mechanisms of ocular infections and the development of targeted adaptation strategies to mitigate their impact on global eye health.",

Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), C-reactive protein, ferritin, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured, along with the height, weight, and waist circumference. AST, ALT, CRP, and ferritin levels were significantly higher in patients with central obesity (waist circumference of ≥80 cm in women or ≥90 cm in men) compared with leaner individuals. ALT and CRP levels were also significantly higher in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 4-HNE levels significantly increased with the rise in AST levels and with ALT levels, although the increase was not significant. In contrast, MDA levels gradually decreased with the rise in AST levels and ALT levels. There were no differences in 4-HNE and MDA levels in relation to clinical disease severity. However, MDA levels were significantly higher in younger individuals and leaner individuals with a normal BMI. Furthermore, MDA levels inversely correlated with serum ferritin levels, while AST, ALT, and CRP levels significantly correlated with ferritin levels. 4-HNE and MDA appear to play different roles in the pathogenesis of Dengue, which should be further investigated for identification of therapeutic targets for treatment of Dengue.",

We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction.

The immune response generated by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents is not well defined in terms of the intensity and medium to long-term duration of protective immunity, which may indicate the need for booster doses and could support decisions in public health. The study aims to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in a two-dose primary protocol in children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years old in Brazil. Participants were invited to the research at two public healthcare centers located in Serrana (São Paulo) and Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais), Brazil. They underwent medical interviews to gather their medical history, including COVID-19 history and medical records. Physical exams were conducted, which included measurements of weight, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate. Blood samples were obtained from the participants before vaccination, 1 month after the first dose, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the second dose. These samples were followed up using a virtual platform to monitor post-vaccination reactions and symptoms of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 genome from swab samples of COVID-19 positive individuals was sequenced using NGS. Total antibodies were measured by ELISA, and neutralizing antibodies to the B.1 lineage and Omicron variant (BA.1) were quantified by PRNT and VNT assays. The cellular immune response was evaluated by flow cytometry through the quantification of systemic soluble immune mediators. The follow-up of 640 participants showed that CoronaVac was able to significantly induce the production of total IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the production of neutralizing antibodies to the B.1 lineage and Omicron variant. Additionally, a robust cellular immune response was observed, characterized by a wide release of pro-inflammatory and regulatory mediators in the early post-immunization moments. Adverse events recorded so far have been mild and transient, except for seven serious adverse events reported on VigiMed. The results indicate a robust and sustained immune response induced by CoronaVac in children and adolescents for up to six months, providing evidence to support the safety and immunogenicity of this effective immunizer.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) poses a critical health threat causing millions of cases every year. The absence of proof-reading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) leads to significant mutations in its genome. This may result in genetic diversity among the genotypes which contribute to severe complications during the infection. Targeting these mutations may help to understand the viral transmission and identify a potential treatment. An aggregate of 152 dengue positive serum samples were collected from different tertiary care hospitals in Karachi. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis as well as amplification of the C-prM region was performed, followed by the Sanger sequencing. The resultant sequences of each serotype were aligned with their respective genome sequences and phylogenetic trees based on genotypes were constructed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) method with 1000 bootstraps replicates. The sequences were then converted to the amino acid sequence and genetic variations in comparison to the reference genomes were evaluated. The results showed that there was a higher number of positive cases in males (58%) than in females (42%). The most affected age group was 21-30. The study suggested that the dominant serotype in the population of Karachi was DENV-1 (78.33%), followed by DENV- 2 (15%) and DENV-3 (6.66%). Overall, the acquired data provide the information about genetic variation in the C-prM region of dengue virus in Karachi, Pakistan.",

        "abstract": "Despite dengue being a major public health problem, there are no antiviral or adjunctive treatments for the disease. Novel therapeutics are needed, particularly for patients at high risk of severe disease, including those living with obesity. Metformin reduces dengue viral replication in vitro through AMPK activation and may also have beneficial immunomodulatory effects. We conducted an open label trial at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, enrolling 120 patients with dengue and obesity (60 treatment arm, 60 control arm receiving standard of care only). Within the treatment arm, the first 10 patients were prescribed low dose metformin, and the remaining 50 patients received weight-based dosing of 1-1.5g/day. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events (AEs), and secondary outcomes were clinical and laboratory parameters, including fever clearance time, platelet nadir, percentage of haematocrit change from baseline, maximum creatinine and highest AST/ALT, and the kinetics of plasma viraemia and NS1 antigenaemia. The majority of patients in both groups had dengue with warning signs. Six patients in the metformin group and 5 controls developed dengue shock syndrome, and no patients died. There were more AEs recorded in the metformin treated group than in the control group (mean±SD: 15 ± 4 vs. 11 ± 6), particularly the high-dose metformin group (15 ± 5). Twenty-five patients (42%) had to stop the study drug due to AEs, including severe diarrhea (n = 12), dengue shock (n = 5), increased lactate of >3mmol/L (n = 4), hypoglycemia (n = 3), and persistent vomiting (n = 1). There were no clear differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups. Metformin was poorly tolerated in patients with dengue, mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects. Metformin did not beneficially affect clinical evolution or virological parameters compared to supportive care alone. Our data does not support progression to larger phase 3 trials of metformin in patients with dengue. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04377451 (May 6th, 2020).",

        "abstract": "In2Care traps combining an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen) with an entomopathogen (Beauveria bassiana) have been developed as an effective way of reducing mosquito populations with promising results. Here, we test the technology in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In2Care traps might be particularly suitable in Jeddah because harsh climatic conditions in the hot dry season may limit Aedes movement when mosquitoes likely persist in localized sites around underground car parks and other built structures. After 8 wk of deployment, the proportion of positive traps in the intervention area was gradually reduced by 39% in the unfavorable season compared with a control area. No adults emerged from In2Care traps. Breeding containers placed in the trial site, 3 wk after termination of the trial, showed a range of emergence values from 0 to 100% compared with controls where emergence was always >80%. In subsequent interventions in three other sites, we obtained reductions of 30% to 52% based on positive traps and egg numbers per trap. However, the intervention did not reduce numbers at one site which was expected to be a mosquito hotspot and subsequently shown to have an estimated mosquito population 5.2× larger than the adjacent control area. The clear reduction at some sites and an increasing reduction in numbers over time at others, several weeks after post-In2Care monitoring operations were completed, highlight the potential of the In2Care approach in this environment. The approach could help to reduce routine pesticide-based fogging that forms the mainstay of current control measures in Jeddah.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever represents an escalating global health threat, as unprecedented outbreaks expose significant limitations of current vaccine strategies. Conventional live-attenuated dengue vaccines, while partially efficacious, face critical hurdles including serotype imbalances and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This review critically assesses virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines as a promising alternative, providing safer, non-replicating platforms that mimic viral structure without risks associated with live replication. Technological advancements in recombinant expression systems have improved VLP yield, stability, and scalability, addressing deployment obstacles. Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that tetravalent dengue VLP vaccines induce balanced neutralizing antibodies across all serotypes, effectively circumventing ADE in animal models. These findings suggest superior safety and robust immune responses, potentially surpassing live-attenuated and mRNA-based vaccines. We emphasize advancements in VLP vaccine technology, including novel tetravalent particle designs engineered to exclude ADE-related immunopathogenic components (prM protein), innovative stability-enhancing formulation techniques, and cost-effective recombinant production platforms (yeast and plant-based systems). Additionally, this review proposes novel deployment strategies, such as regional manufacturing hubs, standardized modular VLP platforms, adaptive clinical trial frameworks leveraging surrogate endpoints, and strengthened international coordination for equitable vaccine distribution. Integrating these scientific innovations and practical strategies positions dengue VLP vaccines as pivotal next-generation solutions for global dengue prevention.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with over half the world's population at risk. Infection with any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes is most often self-limiting, but a significant number of cases present with severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage that may be fatal. African ancestry is associated with protection against severe dengue, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using skin explants from genetically defined donors, we show that European ancestry skin has a much stronger inflammatory response to DENV than African ancestry skin, eliciting markedly increased infiltration, infection and migration of resident Langerhans cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The effect was seen with all dengue serotypes and Zika virus and in the presence of heterotypic immune serum. Genetic pathways associated with inflammation, interferon (IFN)-α, and inflammatory cytokine signaling were enriched in European relative to African ancestry skin following infection. Infiltration and infection of macrophages in African ancestry skin increased to that of European skin after blocking IFN-α and providing interleukin-1β. Polymorphic variants in <i>RXRA</i>, <i>OAS1-3,</i> and <i>TGFB1</i> genes that were more frequent in European donors were associated with increased virus replication. Paradoxically, European ancestry skin cells had increased expression of OAS3 in response to virus and type I IFN. Thus, the limited inflammatory response of African ancestry skin to infection restricts replication and spread of dengue and other flaviviruses. Genetic ancestry should be considered when predicting a patient's likelihood of severe dengue, and when assessing efficacy and adverse events associated with dengue vaccines.",

        "title": "Dengue diagnosis and impact on clinical management: A literature review.",
        "abstract": "Dengue is a re-emerging infectious disease that poses substantial challenges to healthcare systems in endemic regions, such as West Africa. Owing to its nonspecific and overlapping clinical symptoms - including fever, rash, headache, joint pains, nausea, vomiting - many cases go unrecognized or are misdiagnosed. Consequently, patients are often inappropriately treated with antimalarial or antibiotic therapies. Such mismanagement not only affects patient outcomes but also contributes to the development of antimicrobial and antimalarial drug resistance within these populations. This literature review aimed to describe the patterns and impact of dengue diagnosis in West Africa. A comprehensive electronic database search of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted using keywords related to dengue, chikungunya, acute febrile illness, diagnostic strategies, and clinical management. Additional manual searches was performed through Google Scholar and relevant conference proceedings. Eligible studies included observational, real-world evidence, or interventional research conducted in West Africa involving adult patients diagnosed with dengue or chikungunya. Inclusion criteria required studies to report on diagnostic approaches and/or clinical management strategies. Due to the limited availability of data on chikungunya, this review focused exclusively on dengue. Ten studies from Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Nigeria were included in this review. Rapid serologic testing (DENGUE NS1, IgG, IgM) was the most frequently used diagnostic tools, used in 60% of the studies. Clinical management of dengue primarily involved the administration of antipyretics, fluid therapy, and blood transfusions when necessary. In five studies, antimalarial treatments were systematically prescribed despite negative malaria results. Additionally, two studies reported the use of antibiotics without confirmed bacterial infection or supporting biological diagnosis, indicating inappropriate antibiotic use. Evidence on dengue diagnosis and related clinical management in West Africa remains limited. The available data indicate a widespread underuse of diagnosis tools and frequent misuse of antimalarial and antibiotic therapies in the management of dengue. Future studies should prioritize evaluating the impact of accurate differential diagnosis between dengue and malaria on patient care, particularly regarding the inappropriate use of antibiotics and antimalarials. Moreover, integrating routine diagnostic testing into standard clinical practice, as recommended by health authorities, could significantly improve current management. This would enable clinicians to more accurately diagnose dengue, malaria, other febrile illnesses, and potential co-infections, ultimately reducing the misuse of antimicrobial treatments.",

We present a similar case of a 27-year-old female diagnosed with DHF, reporting the development of aspergillosis during recovery from dengue fever. The patient presented with persistent high-grade fever, vomiting, hypotension, and body aches. Lab results showed a dropping platelet count and raised inflammatory markers. Dengue serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was positive. She had on-and-off episodes of shivering for which a malarial parasite smear was ordered, which came back negative. Chest X-ray showed a heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics (tazobactam + piperacillin and amikacin sulphate) along with IV dexamethasone. Chest physiotherapy and regular nebulization were also done. A bronchoscopy was performed, which was turbid. No acid-fast bacilli were found, but budding yeast cells were identified. The patient was put on voriconazole oral tablet, after which she became afebrile, and her oxygen saturation started stabilizing. There was a significant improvement in lab results and radiological investigations as well. She was discharged after a month of initial presentation, with antifungal medication until the next follow-up.

Without an effective antiviral therapy, an accurate diagnosis of the four viruses, DENV1-4, is crucial for patient management and outcome. We aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of a commercial DENV antigen rapid diagnostic test kit in point-of-care conditions. Six-hundred-forty-six patients with fever or history of fever, and without leukocytosis, were enrolled from Tabanan General Hospital, Bali in 2017-2018. All sera were tested for DENV NS1 antigen using the Standard Diagnostics Bioline NS1 Ag rapid test kit and <i>Flavivirus</i> genus specific RT-PCR. Positive specimens were further confirmed using DENV multiplex RT-PCR. DENV was detected in 10.4% (67/646) of enrolled patients by molecular assays. Only 41 of the positives were found to be positive by the NS1 rapid test. Our findings indicate that the kit was the most sensitive in the first 2 days after disease onset with sensitivity > 75%, and declining at day 3 with a sensitivity of <60%. In addition, the kit was found to be the most sensitive to DENV-2 and least sensitive to DENV-4. Overall, the kit had a sensitivity of 59.7% [95% CI: 44.5-74.9] and specificity of 99.8% [95% CI: 99.5-100.0]. Our evaluation indicated that the rapid diagnostic test is useful for both surveillance and initial detection of DENV infection in community settings.

        "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a growing public health concern worldwide, as one of the leading causes of vision impairment. We aimed to estimate global, national, and region-specific prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) along with tobacco as a modifiable risk factor to aid public policy addressing AMD. Data on AMD were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study 2021 database in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2021. Vision impairment was defined and categorised by severity as follows: moderate to severe vision loss (visual acuity from <6/18 to 3/60) and blindness (visual acuity <3/60 or a visual field <10 degrees around central fixation). The burden of vision impairment attributable to AMD was subsequently estimated. These estimates were further stratified by geographical region, age, year, sex, Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) levels. Additionally, the effect of tobacco use, a modifiable risk factor, on the burden of AMD was analysed, and projections of AMD burden were estimated through to 2050. These projections also included scenario modelling to assess the potential effects of tobacco elimination. Globally, the number of individuals with vision impairment due to AMD more than doubled, rising from 3·64 million (95% uncertainty inverval [UI] 3·04-4·35) in 1990 to 8·06 million (6·71-9·82) in 2021. Similarly, DALYs increased by 91% over the same period, from 0·30 million (95% UI 0·21-0·42) to 0·58 million (0·40-0·80). By contrast, age-standardised prevalence and DALY rates declined, with prevalence rates decreasing by 5·53% (99·50 per 100 000 of the population [95% UI 83·16-118·04] in 1990 to 94·00 [78·32-114·42] in 2021) and DALY rates dropping by 19·09% (8·38 [5·70-11·53] to 6·78 [4·70-9·32]). These rates showed a consistent decrease in higher SDI quintiles, reflecting the negative correlation between HAQ Index and AMD burden. A general downward trend was observed from 1990 to 2021, with the largest age-standardised reduction occurring in the low-middle SDI quintile. The global contribution of tobacco to age-standardised DALYs decreased by 20%, declining from 12·45% (95% UI 7·73-17·37) in 1990 to 9·96% (6·12-14·06) in 2021. By 2050, the number of individuals affected by AMD is projected to increase from 3·40 million males (95% UI 2·81-4·17) in 2021 to 9·02 million (5·72-14·20) and from 4·66 million females (3·88-5·65) to 12·32 million (8·88-17·08). Eliminating tobacco use could reduce these numbers to 8·17 million males (5·59-11·92) and 11·15 million females (8·58-14·48) in 2050. While the total prevalence and DALYs due to AMD have steadily increased from 1990 to 2021, age-standardised prevalence and DALY rates have declined, probably reflecting the effect of population ageing and growth. The consistent decrease in age-standardised rates with higher SDI levels highlights the crucial role of health-care resources and public policies in mitigating AMD-related vision impairment. The downward trend observed from 1990 to 2021 might also be partially attributed to the reduced effect of tobacco as a modifiable risk factor, with declines in tobacco use seen globally and across all SDI quintiles. The burden of vision impairment due to AMD is projected to increase to about 21·34 million in 2050. However, effective tobacco regulation has the potential to substantially reduce AMD-related vision impairment, particularly in lower SDI quintiles where health-care resources are limited.

        "title": "What is the optimal In2Care stations density to achieve Aedes aegypti population reduction in a dengue endemic setting?",
        "abstract": "Autodissemination traps are among the most innovative strategies for suppressing mosquito vector populations. These traps are particularly effective against Aedes aegypti due to the species' skip oviposition behavior, where eggs from a single clutch are distributed across multiple breeding sites. Evaluating the efficacy of different densities of In2Care stations under large-scale field conditions is crucial for understanding their potential impact on Ae. aegypti populations. A total of 3,250 In2Care stations were deployed in Goiânia, the 10th largest city in Brazil, with an estimated population of 1.45 million. The field study lasted 14 months, with each station serviced bi-monthly. To assess the impact of In2Care, ovitraps were installed and inspected weekly to measure changes in the number of positive ovitraps and the average number of eggs laid by Ae. aegypti females in intervention areas compared to control neighborhoods. Over the course of the study, 666,204 eggs were sampled. The density of In2Care stations varied across neighborhoods, ranging from 220 to 555 stations per km2. In the high-density area (~555 stations per km2), the Ovitrap Positivity Index (OPI) decreased from 56.9% to 31.5%, while the average number of eggs per positive paddle dropped from 41.2 to 18.1-representing a 56% reduction in egg counts. Conversely, in the low- and medium-density, no significant effect was observed. The recommended density of In2Care is about 2500 stations per Km2. Our results demonstrated stations density 4.5 times lower than the recommended density is able to reduce the frequency of positive ovitraps and the number of eggs collected on them. entomological indexes. Additional fieldwork in other entomological and epidemiological settings are needed to evaluate whether the In2Care density of ~555 units/Km2 observed for Goiânia was site-dependent or if it has borader applicability. Our results show that In2Care stations can effectively suppress Ae. aegypti populations over large geographic areas, with efficacy likely influenced by trap density.",

This Phase 0 study investigated dengue infections among household contacts (HHCs) of dengue index cases (ICs) and assessed the feasibility of conducting a Phase 2 trial for a novel antiviral. Participants were enrolled in Nha Trang, Vietnam, from April 2022 to February 2023. Dengue ICs were identified within 72 h of fever onset, and their healthy adult HHCs enrolled within 48 h. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected bi-weekly for four weeks, with a follow-up visit on day 40. DENV RT-qPCR, NS1, and anti-DENV IgM/IgG ELISAs were performed. Overall, 130 dengue ICs and 301 HHCs were enrolled, with 91.7% (276/301) completing all follow-up visits. Baseline anti-DENV IgG showed prior dengue infections in 262/301 HHCs (87.0%). Fifty HHCs were excluded from the HHC infection analysis based on evidence of a DENV infection (viral load [VL], NS1, IgM, and IgG results) at enrollment. During follow-up, 2.0% of HHCs (5/251) had DENV infections based on virological parameters (DENV RNA and/or NS1 positivity), and anti-DENV IgG/IgM seroconversion was detected in 7.2% (18/251).

        "abstract": "Dengue is an arthropod borne viral illness which infects millions of people each year. Despite the huge global losses, an effective medication is still unavailable against the disease. For vaccine development, reverse vaccinology approach is being tremendously used as it saves time, energy, cost and resources by selecting the potential epitopes for developing an effective vaccine formulation. In our previous study, we have also used reverse vaccinology approach to propose a multi-epitope vaccine formulation (dvac) against dengue, by targeting the conserved epitopes from all of its serotypes. In this study, we have performed population coverage analysis and molecular dynamic simulation studies which predicted that dvac could offer protection to 98.5% of world population against dengue and forms stable interactions with TLR3/TLR4 receptors, respectively. Moreover, we have performed in-lab gene cloning and expression analysis of dvac in Escherichia coli. The purified dvac is subjected to anti-NS1, anti-dNS1 and anti-EDIII antibodies, raised in rabbits, and the ELISA results confirmed the individuality and intactness of the epitopes incorporated in the refolded dvac molecule. The results from this study endorse the use of dvac as a potential dengue vaccine candidate and also support the reverse vaccinology approach for developing novel therapeutic formulations.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 390 million individuals globally are infected with dengue virus annually. Notably, no specific therapeutic strategy has been clinically approved for dengue fever to date. In this study, molecular docking screening against the methyltransferase (MTase) domain of the dengue virus (DENV) NS5 protein unveiled hypaphorine as a high-affinity ligand, with calculated binding energies of -6.657 kcal/mol (DENV2) and -6.663 kcal/mol (DENV3). This computational prediction was subsequently validated via cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi), collectively demonstrating direct target engagement with a dissociation constant (KD) of 2.19 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M. Functional characterization revealed that hypaphorine exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of MTase enzymatic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 29.9 μM). In antiviral assays, hypaphorine displayed dose-dependent suppression of viral replication in both BHK-21 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 18.85 μM) and Huh-7 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 15.7 μM), while maintaining low cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> = 605.8 μM and 617.3 μM, respectively). Time-course analyses indicated maximal antiviral efficacy when hypaphorine was administered either pre- or post-infection (<24 hpi), which is consistent with the role of MTase in viral RNA capping during successive rounds of virus replication. The reduction in viral titer was found to correlate with MTase inhibition, thereby establishing a clear structure-activity relationship. These findings systematically characterize hypaphorine as a first-in-class natural MTase inhibitor, highlighting the utility of structure-guided approaches in anti-flaviviral drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "<i>Aedes aegypti</i>, the main urban vector of dengue fever, represents a growing public health problem in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. Identifying the factors influencing the distribution and productivity of its breeding sites is essential for the development of effective control strategies. From May 2023 to April 2024, physico-chemical characteristics were recorded and mosquito larvae were collected, using a standard dipping method, from 60 water collections each month during the dry season and twice a month during the rainy season, totaling 294 observations. The larval positivity of water collections and larval abundance of breeding sites over the time were modeled using a random-effect logistic regression model and a negative binomial regression model, respectively. The depth, distance from habitat, type of water collection and exposure to sunlight were statistically significant and independently associated with water collection positivity for <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae (aOR = 5.18, 95%CI [1.66-16.18], <i>p</i>-value = 0.005; aOR = 0.00, 95%CI [0.00-0.02], <i>p</i>-value < 0.001; aOR = 252.88, 95%CI [4.05-15,786.84], <i>p</i>-value = 0.009 and aOR = 0.04, 95%CI [0.01-0.26], <i>p</i>-value < 0.001, respectively). <i>Aedes aegypti</i> larval habitats were mainly artificial (90%), temporary (<i>n</i> = 217 observations), close to dwellings (<i>n</i> = 114) and shaded (<i>n</i> = 96). Plastic water tanks (<i>n</i> = 17, 48.6%), wells (<i>n</i> = 6, 17.1%) and barrels (<i>n</i> = 4, 11.4%) were the most common breeding sites. Larval abundance was negatively associated with containers of increasing pH and surface area (aOR = 0.50, 95%CI [0.33-0.75] <i>p</i>-value = 0.001 and aOR = 0.48, 95%CI [0.27-0.87], <i>p</i>-value = 0.016, respectively). As <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes are multi-resistant to adult insecticides and dengue has become endemo-epidemic since 2014, vector control should give the priority to the physical removal or treatment of shaded, peridomestic containers-particularly plastic water tanks and barrels-and consider the use of biological larvicides to target breeding sites with low pH and small surface areas.",

This study searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and JSTOR databases for publications on the prevalence of parasitic coinfection in people living with viruses from 1 January 2005 to 30 April 2022, and 356 studies were included and systematically reviewed. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the global prevalence of and factors potentially associated with parasitic infection (helminths and protozoa) in virus-infected people, and the infection burden was estimated. A variety of parasites (29 families, 39 genera, and 63 species) and viruses (8 kinds) were identified. The prevalence of parasitic coinfection in (all) virus-infected people was estimated to be 21.34% (95% CI 17.58-25.10, 5593 of 29,190 participants) and 34.13% (95% CI 31.32-36.94, 21,243/76,072 participants) for helminths and protozoa, respectively. Specially, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people, the global prevalence was 19.96% (95% CI 16.18-23.74) for helminths and 34.18% (95% CI 31.33-37.03) for protozoa, respectively. The global prevalence of protozoa was 41.79% (95% CI 15.88-67.69) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected people and 17.75% (95% CI 3.54-31.95) in DENV-infected people, respectively. The global burden of parasitic infections in HIV-infected people was 7,664,640 for helminths and 13,125,120 for protozoa, respectively, and that in HBV- and dengue virus (DENV)-infected people was 137,019,428 and 629,952, respectively. The prevalence of parasitic coinfection at the family, genus, and species levels in virus- or HIV-infected people were comprehensively estimated and further analyzed by subgroups. Among the most commonly identified parasites, the five helminth genera with the highest prevalence in HIV-infected people were <i>Schistosoma</i> (12.46%, 95% CI 5.82-19.10), <i>Ascaris</i> (7.82%, 95% CI 6.15-9.49), <i>Strongyloides</i> (5.43%, 95% CI 4.11-6.74), <i>Trichuris</i> (4·82%, 95% CI 2.48-7.17) and <i>Ancylostoma</i> (2.79%, 95% CI 1.32-4.27), whereas the top five protozoan genera were <i>Toxoplasma</i> (48.85%, 95% CI 42.01-55.69), <i>Plasmodium</i> (34.96%, 95% CI 28.11-41.82), <i>Cryptosporidium</i> (14.27%, 95% CI 11.49-17.06), <i>Entamoeba</i> (12.33%, 95% CI 10.09-14.57) and <i>Blastocystis</i> (10.61%, 95% CI 6.26-14.97).

        "abstract": "A country with continental dimensions like Brazil, characterized by heterogeneity of climates, biomes, natural resources, population density, socioeconomic conditions, and regional challenges, also exhibits significant spatial variation in dengue outbreaks. This study aimed to characterize Brazilian territory based on epidemiological and climate data to determine the optimal time to guide preventive and control strategies. To achieve this, the Moving Epidemics Method (MEM) was employed to analyze dengue historical patterns using 14-year disease data (2010-2023) aggregated by the 120 Brazilian Health Macro-Regions (HMR). Statistical outputs from MEM included the mean outbreak onset, duration, and variation of these measurements, pre- and post-epidemic thresholds, and the high-intensity level of cases. Environmental data used includes mean annual precipitation, temperature, and altitude, as well as the Köppen Climate Classification of each area. A multivariate cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm was applied to MEM outputs and climate data. Four clusters/regions were identified, with the mean temperature, mean precipitation, mean outbreak onset, high-intensity level of cases, and mean altitude explaining 80% of the centroid variation among the clusters. Region 1 (North-Northwest) encompasses areas with the highest temperatures, precipitation, and early outbreak onset, in February. Region 2a (Northeast) has the lowest precipitation and a later onset, in March. Region 3 (Southeast) presents higher altitude, and early outbreak onset in February; while Region 4 (South) has a lower temperature, with onset in March. To better adjust the results, the unique Roraima state HMR state was manually classified as Region 2b (Roraima) because of its outbreak onset in July and the highest precipitation volume. The results suggested preventive and control measures should be implemented first in Regions North-Northwest and Southeast, followed by Regions Northeast, South, and Roraima, highlighting the importance of regional vector control measures based on historical and climatic patterns. Integrating these findings with monitoring systems and fostering cross-sector collaboration can enhance surveillance and mitigate future outbreaks. The proposed methodology also holds potential for application in controlling other mosquito-transmitted viral diseases, expanding its public health impact.",

A new reporting system implemented in 2018 has not previously been used to characterise trends in TB and identify areas to prioritise for the expansion of access to TB diagnostics and treatment programmes. We conducted a retrospective study of all TB cases notified to the Paraguay National Program for Tuberculosis Control (NPTC) from 2018 to 2022. We quantified trends in case notifications spatially and in specific populations identified as vulnerable by the NPTC and measured trends in access to GeneXpert testing. Of the 13,725 TB cases notified in Paraguay from 2018 to 2022, 2337 (17%) occurred among incarcerated individuals and 1743 (12.7%) occurred among self-identified Indigenous individuals. In 2022, the relative risk of TB was 87 and 6.39 (95% CI: 6.08-6.72) among persons deprived of liberty and Indigenous populations, compared to those who are not persons deprived of liberty and non-Indigenous populations respectively. We found significant heterogeneity in TB incidence across Paraguay's 17 departments. While 45% of TB cases among the Indigenous population occurred in the Chaco Region, in western Paraguay, notification among the Indigenous population was highest (1127.4 per 100,000) in the Capital, including the metropolitan area. TB cases are concentrated among Paraguay's incarcerated and Indigenous populations, both of which have extremely high relative risk of TB.

Laboratory investigations revealed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 109 × 10⁹/L. The patient had no known allergic conditions. Based on the clinical presentation and high index of suspicion, a dengue test was performed, confirming the infection through positive IgM serology and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, which identified the DENV-2 serotype.

        "abstract": "Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases pose significant threats to global public health, economic stability, and security. This paper focuses on three critical examples: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Dengue Fever (DF), and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), emphasizing the importance of the One Health approach, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health strategies. HPAI poses a risk to poultry and various mammals, including recent outbreaks in US dairy cows, raising concerns about zoonotic and potential human transmission. Dengue Fever, exacerbated by urbanization and climate change, currently impacts over 100 countries. Antimicrobial Resistance undermines the effectiveness of antibiotics, threatening modern medicine's ability to combat infections. Effective responses to these challenges require strengthening global health networks, improving data sharing, and enhancing outbreak analytics and disease modeling (OADM). The ECLIPSE initiative, a collaborative effort involving thirteen Latin American countries and the US, shows the value of cross-country disease surveillance and control. Key actionable recommendations from ECLIPSE partners include strengthening global health networks, implementing integrated data-sharing platforms, developing enhanced surveillance mechanisms, and advancing targeted policy interventions to improve OADM. This review underscores the urgent need for sustained international collaboration, investment in surveillance infrastructure, and continuous refinement of outbreak analytics and disease modeling. By proactively adopting an integrated One Health approach and implementing concrete recommendations such as improved cross-border surveillance and coordinated data analytics frameworks, we can strengthen global resilience against emerging infectious threats and better safeguard public health.",

While the intervention was randomized at a cluster-level, human and mosquito movement suggest potential violations in assumptions necessary for intention-to-treat analyses to produce accurate estimates of the full intervention effect due to spatial clustering of dengue cases, and/or potential non-independence in the intervention arising from spillover of the intervention (or control) across cluster boundaries. We address these distinct but related effects using two approaches. First, we examine whether a clustering effect exists, that is, whether the presence of a recent dengue case in the sample within a specified distance from a residence raises the risk of dengue. Second, we use cluster reallocation techniques to examine intervention spillover effects. We find strong spatial effects of the presence of dengue cases on the risk of clinical dengue that exhibit both serospecificity and a dose response, more evident in control than intervention clusters at least on an additive scale. Contrarily, there is no evidence of any appreciable local spillover effect from intervention to control clusters, or vice versa, in terms of either the risk of dengue infection or the level of disease clustering.",

        "abstract": "Background A major global health problem is dengue illness, which is rising in Bangladesh between 2019 and 2023. Dengue infections can present with a wide range of symptoms, from fever to severe organ involvement like myocarditis. In this retrospective analysis, risk factors, clinic-laboratory profile, and outcomes of dengue myocarditis in hospitalised patients were investigated. Methods The study was a retrospective one, conducted in a tertiary private hospital in Dhaka between 2019 and 2023. Dengue infection was diagnosed by positive dengue nonstructural antigen (NS1) tests and/or dengue IgM or dengue RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) positivity. Dengue myocarditis was diagnosed with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013 consensus statement. For each myocarditis patient, we recruited age-, gender-, and year-of-admission-matched control dengue patients. Results Thirty-four dengue-myocarditis patients and 81 matched dengue patients were recruited as controls, with the mean age of myocarditis patients being 48.5 ± 20.1 years; 20.7% were from the 60-69 age group, and 21 (61.7%) were male. Mean (±standard deviation) leucocyte count 9.1 (±4.7) ×10<sup>9</sup>/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 604 (±937) IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2076 (±4202) IU/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 5.5 (±5.3) mg/dL were significantly higher in the myocarditis group. Among 34 myocarditis patients, four patients (11.7%) died, with procalcitonin 18.8 (±27.5) ng/mL, prothrombin time (PT) 28.7 (±12.4) seconds, and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 102.6 (±46.9) seconds being significantly higher. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the presence of comorbidities (odds ratio [OR]: 10.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78-39.5]) and a raised neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR 11.9; 95% CI: 2.82-50.7) were significantly associated with myocarditis. Conclusion The presence of comorbidities and a higher NLR ratio were significantly associated with developing dengue myocarditis.",

        "title": "Progress and Criteria in Public Health Applications of Gene Therapy and Gene Editing: Beyond the White Paper.",
        "abstract": "In 2023, the FDA approved two gene therapies for sickle cell disease (SCD), one of which follows a standard gene therapy protocol and the other a gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) approach. Other gene therapy protocols for conditions relating to public health continue to advance and are being discussed in academic and professional circles. This review examines the pace of public health-related gene therapy and gene editing development since the publication of a key British white paper dealing with the pace of fruition in this field. Gene therapy developments related to public health fit into three overarching baskets: (1) gene therapy and editing for rare, single-gene disorders (e.g., homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and hereditary amyloidosis polyneuropathy); (2) gene therapy and editing for high prevalence conditions (e.g., SCD); and (3) genetic engineering and gene editing of mosquitoes transmitting tropical disease. While the protocols listed in this purposive inspection largely center around phase III (comparing treatments), with several in phase II (establishing efficacy) and phase I (assessing safety), costs of actual administration can span USD 2.1 to 3.1 million. By comparison, conventional SCD treatment runs between USD 22,500 and USD 200,000 per year for its most severe forms. Expert and public buy-in of gene editing of mosquitoes to reduce tropical disease and for human germline gene editing contain many caveats, with public health serving a useful monitoring and filtering role for how a technology might be deemed permissible. Gene therapy has advanced beyond the stage where possible consequences serve as an automatic barrier to mainstream use, moving it closer to British white paper objectives. Ethical and feasible adoption by public health, taking into account population needs, will most likely happen through a combination Medicaid and Medicare, as opposed to the system governing newborn screening, under arrangements similar to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' coverage under evidence development program. Vector gene drives to alleviate tropical disease should remain privately financed, with this type of financing also being used for the vast majority of gene therapies entering the market. Though the criteria for germline applications continue to evolve, in the end such applications do not serve public health purposes. Academic public health has a monitoring role to play as relevant gene therapy and gene editing trials evolve; public health practice a referral and field monitoring role in the T3 (implementation) and T4 (population outcomes) translational research phases for the few applications that could justifiably receive public funding and public health support.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we presented two strategies for designing an envelope domain III (EDIII)-based tetravalent dengue virus (DENV) vaccine. The first approach was conjugation of the EDIIIs from all four DENV serotypes to a norovirus-like particle (NoV-LP) scaffold, yielding the NoV::tetEDIII vaccine. The second approach linked the EDIIIs of all four serotypes into a single polypeptide chain, which was also conjugated to the NoV-LP scaffold by using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, creating the NoV::quartetEDIII vaccine. These tetravalent DENV vaccines were evaluated for their immunogenicity against all DENV serotypes. Both vaccines elicited strong antibody responses against all serotypes in a prime-and-boost immunization regimen. Furthermore, the single-round infectious particle (SRIP) assay demonstrated that these antibodies had neutralizing capabilities superior to those of traditional subunit vaccines. Our study proposes a promising DENV vaccine strategy that may protect against all four serotypes, potentially promoting public health efforts to prevent and control dengue disease.",

        "abstract": "Megakaryopoiesis is a complex biological process through which haematopoietic stem cells differentiate into megakaryocyte, leading to the formation of platelets. This process is characterised by a unique differentiation pathway involving endomitosis, resulting in the polyploidisation of megakaryocyte nuclei. Megakaryopoiesis is controlled by various factors, including transcription factors, cytokines and hormones. Defects in this complex process can cause significant complications. A major issue associated with this is thrombocytopaenia, a condition characterised by abnormally low platelet counts. Thrombocytopaenia is often seen in certain cancer-related complications, genetic bone marrow disorders, autoimmune diseases, and particularly in many types of infectious diseases. Among these, dengue virus infection presents a major challenge due to its strong association with thrombocytopaenia, which greatly complicates disease management and outcomes. By integrating knowledge of megakaryopoiesis, thrombocytopaenia, and dengue infection, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of megakaryopoiesis dysregulation, the molecular mechanisms of thrombocytopaenia in DENV pathogenesis and to identify potential areas for future research and clinical intervention. Additionally, this review highlights emerging insights into the role of non-coding RNAs in thrombocytopaenia and offers a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the dengue virus interferes with megakaryocyte function and platelet production, elucidating the intricate viral-host interactions that exacerbate platelet depletion.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is an increasing global problem associated with negative health and economic impacts. Vaccination is an important measure to reduce the significant public health and economic burden caused by dengue. Our study assesses the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of a new dengue vaccine, TAK-003, using Thailand as a case study. We developed a dynamic transmission model with both host and vector populations, 4 serotype-specific infections, seasonality, and other key elements of dengue natural history. We estimated efficacy of TAK-003 from the DEN-301 trial. We first used the model to determine the optimal cohort age for different vaccination strategies with TAK-003, based on Thai dengue epidemiology. Secondly, we assessed the public health impact of a pragmatic strategy integrating TAK-003 into an existing national immunization program in Thailand. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a societal perspective using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) over a 20-year horizon. TAK-003 is estimated to prevent 41%-57% of symptomatic cases and 47%-70% of hospitalizations, with the greatest impact observed when routinely vaccinating children aged 6 years with 10 additional catch-up cohorts. This strategy resulted in 104,415 fewer DALYs and savings of US$1,786 million. If introduced into the national immunization program at 11 years of age (alongside the existing human papillomavirus vaccine), TAK-003 is estimated to prevent 44% of symptomatic cases and 53% of hospitalizations. This strategy prevented 87,715 DALYs and saved US$1,346 million. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were robust. The main limitations were inherent to the assumptions and simplifications made in the model, which are unavoidable when approximating the impact of vaccination in the real world. TAK-003 can considerably reduce dengue burden and lead to cost savings in Thailand. These benefits can be maximized by identifying optimal age cohorts for vaccination and adding catch-up programs. Our model can be used to assess the vaccination impact in other dengue-endemic countries.",

        "abstract": "Early differentiation between severe multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and severe presentations of dengue, scrub typhus, and other endemic tropical infections could help clinicians devise appropriate treatment strategies. This study aims to identify the diagnostic markers that may be used to discriminate between MIS-C versus endemic tropical infections, namely dengue and scrub typhus, which frequently occur in endemic areas. A retrospective study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India between 2020 and 2023. Comparative analysis of 33 children diagnosed with MIS-C was done versus 77 children with five endemic tropical infections-dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever, malaria, and leptospirosis. Rash [63.63% vs. 31.64% (P = 0.005)], conjunctival redness [63.63% vs. 8.86% (P < 0.001)], and altered sensorium [45.45% vs. 22.78% (P = 0.031)] were seen in a greater proportion of MIS-C cases than those with tropical infections. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dl) was significantly higher in children with MIS-C versus those with tropical infections [176.1 (112.61, 198.32) vs. 9.25 (24.05, 69.38), P ≤ 0.001]. Ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were observed to be significantly higher in children with tropical infections compared to those with MIS-C. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds of having a rash were higher among children with MIS-C than those with dengue [OR = 8.07 (95% CI: 1.22-53.48, P = 0.03)]; followed by altered sensorium [OR = 16.04 (95% CI: 2.06-124.62, P = 0.008)]; myocardial involvement [OR = 7.18 (95% CI: 1.12-45.93, P = 0.037)]; and CRP (>50 mg/dl) [OR = 17.59 (95% CI: 2.69-114.92, P = 0.003)]. The findings of our study suggest that several clinical and laboratory measures could potentially distinguish between patients with severe MIS-C and endemic tropical infections. Clinical markers such as rash, altered sensorium, myocardial involvement, and shock were seen in a greater proportion of cases with MIS-C. Inflammatory markers such as CRP were higher in children with MIS-C, whereas ferritin and LDH were higher in dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever, malaria, and leptospirosis.",

Currently, there are no FDA-approved antivirals available. This study evaluated the anti-CHIKV potential of 16 synthetic 3-amino-2-thiocyanato-α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and elucidated their probable mechanisms of action. Anti-CHIKV activity of 16 compounds were investigated in Vero CCL-81 cells using focus forming unit assay (FFU). Dose-dependent and time-dependent antiviral assays were performed for the effective compounds. Molecular docking was performed to find out their interactions with viral proteins. Five compounds showed promising anti-CHIKV activity by reducing viral titer with >1 log<sub>10</sub> FFU/ml. Dose-dependent studies revealed that the compound 3 g was more effective in reducing the virus titer with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.4315 μM and a selectivity index of 35.99. Docking analyses revealed that all the compounds mainly interact with the non-structural proteins of CHIKV. These findings demonstrate the in vitro anti-CHIKV activity of these compounds, and their possible mode of action via interference with early stages of infection and replication processes. This study warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation to establish their safety and efficacy as novel anti-CHIKV therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive statistical and graphical analysis of hematological parameters in a cohort of 1523 dengue patients in a thorough search for the determination of the clinical features of dengue fever. The most important parameters were hemoglobin level, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and total platelet counts, whose statistical analysis has been conducted with the vision to clarify their role in dengue pathology. Statistical significance finds the key hematological parameters such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red blood cells, and RDW-CV to be strongly associated with dengue, and the same is borne out by their p-values. The gender, hemoglobin, MCH, and PDW are less strongly related, however. The consistency of results using T-tests as well as Z-tests strengthens the findings, highlighting significant markers while also pointing out how more intricate interactions would be uncovered using multivariate analysis. Subsequently, several data visualizations were constructed using box plots, violin plots, and pair plots. Hematological parameters in dengue positive and negative patients are somewhat disparate, as shown by box plots; positive patients presented with lower WBC and RBC counts and higher hemoglobin levels and monocyte percentages. Although females tend to have greater monocyte percentages and platelet counts and males tend to have overall greater hematocrit levels, violin plots do not indicate any gender differences in the majority of the blood parameters. The pair plot indicates that younger patients with lower hemoglobin are more likely to have positive dengue results, with some overlap between total WBC count and lymphocyte percentage. In conclusion, this database will be very useful and will provide a tremendous benefit to dengue research studies, public health initiatives, and better patient diagnosis and treatment methods.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, arboviruses have become increasingly important in Europe due to autochthonous outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases such as chikungunya fever, dengue and Zika. These viruses represent a threat in temperate areas such as the Valencian Community (CV), where the presence of their vector, the Asian tiger mosquito, is widely distributed. The objective of this work was to report on the actions carried out within the CV Programme, in the management of declared cases of imported arboviruses from 2016 to 2021. To this end, coordinated work procedures had been implemented between the Generalitat Valenciana and the University of Valencia in order to reduce the risk of autochthonous transmission through detection, surveillance and monitoring of the vector, as well as entomological surveys in the vicinity of the residence of infected citizens. The sample size consisted of forty-five imported cases, which had been analysed with the statistical software R version 3.3. The presence of established tiger mosquito populations had been corroborated in a total of 273 municipalities during the study period, increasing the number of affected localities by the end of 2021 to 464 out of the total of 542 in the VC. The response time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, the time elapsed from diagnosis to reporting to the corresponding Environmental Health Unit and the completion of the entomological survey had been evaluated. Vector surveillance is essential. The time between the onset of the patient's symptoms and the diagnosis by health professionals must be reduced. The most numerous imported cases are those of dengue from Asia and Central America with 87.5% of hospitalizations.",

A comprehensive approach combining viral and host biomarker detection improves diagnostic accuracy. Here, we describe a signal enhancement technique combining fluorescent silica nanoparticles and bioorthogonal chemistries for the ultrasensitive detection of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), and the viral biomarker nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Our plate-based sandwich assay enhances signals with multiple layered fluorescent dye-encapsulated nanoparticles. In human serum, the assay achieved a limit of detection (LOD) of 43 pg/mL (∼5.0 nM) for MCP-1, ranging from 100 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL; 66 pg/mL (∼7.6 nM) for IP-10, ranging from 10 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL; and 351 pg/mL (8.6 nM) for NS1, ranging from 100 pg/mL to 10 μg/mL. We also monitored host biomarkers in dengue virus-infected AG129 mice using a Milliplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel. MCP-1 levels in infected mice ranged from 1000 to 7000 pg/mL (mean: 2911 pg/mL), while uninfected controls showed much lower levels (1-10 pg/mL, mean 7 pg/mL). IP-10 levels ranged from 150 to 300 pg/mL (mean 188 pg/mL) in infected mice and 50-100 pg/mL (mean 69.4 pg/mL) in controls.

        "abstract": "Safe and effective vaccines against co-circulating mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZikV) and the four serotypes of Dengue virus (DenV1-4) must elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to prevent the risk of enhancement of infection by non-neutralizing antibodies. We recently discovered new orthoflavivirus-directed bnAbs, including F25.S02, which neutralizes DenV1-4 and ZikV with comparable or superior potency to the previously characterized E dimer epitope (EDE) bnAbs. Mutagenesis studies of viral envelope proteins showed that the epitope specificity of F25.S02 is distinct from EDE1 bnAbs. Here, we used cryoEM and X-ray crystallography to understand the basis of cross-neutralization of F25.S02 at the molecular level. We obtained a ~4.2 Å cryoEM structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to a stabilized DenV3 soluble E protein dimer and a 2.3 Å crystal structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to ZikV soluble E protein dimer. Like previously described EDE1 bnAbs, the structural epitope of F25.S02 is at the E dimer interface, encompassing predominantly conserved regions in domain II, including the fusion loop. However, unlike EDE1 bnAbs, F25.S02 binding is almost entirely dependent on the heavy chain and is shifted slightly away from the dimer symmetry axis. Our findings emphasize the importance of this cross-neutralizing site of vulnerability for DenV and ZikV that can facilitate rational design of vaccines and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever remains a critical public health concern, particularly in regions like Thailand, where the disease exhibits complex transmission dynamics involving human and mosquito populations. Traditional models often fail to address the intricacies of non-local interactions, memory effects, and control dynamics. This research introduces an innovative approach using fractional optimal control problems (FOCPs) integrated with the Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. The model stratifies human and mosquito populations into detailed compartments, enabling a granular representation of transmission dynamics. The FOCP framework leverages fractional-order equations to incorporate memory-dependent and non-local interactions, ensuring biological feasibility and predictive accuracy. Computational results reveal that the model aligns closely with observed data for dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome across fractional orders ranging from 0.83 to 1.00. Sensitivity analyses identify critical parameters, such as biting rates and initial population sizes, as pivotal to disease control. The findings underscore the effectiveness of FOCPs in optimizing public health interventions, offer a robust tool for minimizing infection rates and associated costs. The theoretical global stability analysis confirms the model's reliability in predicting long-term outcomes under varying epidemiological scenarios. Future research could extend this framework to incorporate environmental variables, co-infections, and vaccination strategies, enhancing its applicability across diverse public health challenges. This study represents a significant step forward in the mathematical modeling of epidemic diseases, particularly in optimizing control measures for dengue fever.",

        "abstract": "Community knowledge plays a crucial role in preventing dengue outbreaks. This study assessed dengue fever awareness and knowledge gaps among Tanzanians to inform prevention efforts. A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted from April to June 2022 across Kyela, Bahi and Ngorongoro districts. Data on socio-demographics, dengue knowledge, transmission, symptoms and prevention were collected using questionnaires from 482 participants aged ≥ 18 years. Descriptive statistics, χ2 and logistic regression analysis examined knowledge levels in relation to socio-demographic factors. A majority of participants (76.6%) reported prior knowledge of dengue fever. Awareness of mosquito bites as a transmission mode was relatively high (68.8%), but specific knowledge of Aedes mosquitoes as vectors was significantly lower at only 23.4% (χ2 = 132.50, P < 0.05). Findings indicated a fair knowledge of vector biting frequency (52.5%) and breeding sites (57.9%). However, most demonstrated good knowledge of symptoms (52.3%) and prevention (66.4%). Knowledge levels differed across demographic groups. For instance, women were less likely than men to report knowledge of vector bite frequency (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.76). There are critical dengue knowledge gaps among communities at high epidemic risk regarding vectors, transmission dynamics and breeding ecology. Targeted educational interventions considering disparities across socio-demographics are urgently required to raise awareness, improve participation in integrated control programs and empower at-risk populations to mitigate outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Flagellin, an essential structural protein of bacterial flagella, has emerged as a potent modulator of both specific and nonspecific immunity, demonstrating significant potential as a vaccine adjuvant and carrier. By inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12, flagellin activates the innate immune system, enhancing antigen-specific adaptive immune responses mediated by tumour-specific type 1 helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, thus positioning it as a valuable adjuvant or complementary therapy for various cancers and infectious diseases. This review explores recent strategies, innovations, and clinical applications of flagellin-based immunotherapies, particularly in the context of infectious diseases and cancers. Flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium has been extensively studied as a vaccine adjuvant for diseases like HIV, influenza, dengue, West Nile virus, poultry cholera, and bursal diseases and shows promise in treating lung metastasis, melanoma, colon, and prostate cancers. It has also proven effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. Notably, S. typhimurium flagellin-based vaccines for influenza have progressed to clinical trials. Additionally, flagellins from S. typhi, S. enteritidis, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli are being evaluated as vaccine candidates for plague, malaria, and infections caused by P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In cancer therapy, flagellin-based treatments, especially when combined with tumour antigens, have exhibited the ability to enhance anti-tumour immunity and improve patient outcomes. Other flagellin-based vaccines derived from S. Dublin, S. munchen, and Vibrio vulnificus have been employed in the treatment of prostate, lung, liver, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, as well as lymphoma, melanoma, and radiation-induced mucositis. Mobilan, a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus vector expressing Salmonella flagellin, is currently in a phase Ib clinical trial for prostate cancer. Overall, bacterial flagellin treatments are generally safe, well-tolerated, and associated with minimal side effects, making them a promising option for managing infectious diseases and cancers.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is a significant public health issue in Indonesia, facing a substantial year-round disease burden and rising incidence. However, comprehensive assessments of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) regarding dengue in the Indonesian adult population are limited. This study provides one of the first comprehensive evaluations of KAP in Indonesia, aiming to inform integrated dengue management programs. This study utilized data from the larger GEMKAP study, which covered seven countries, including Indonesia. The GEMKAP study was a cross-sectional electronic survey conducted in September and October 2022, targeting adults aged 21 to 60, recruited through email invitations from an existing web-based panel. The survey, consisting of 35 questions, was developed based on existing dengue KAP studies and was translated into Bahasa Indonesia. Analysis of 600 Indonesian responses revealed higher levels of Attitudes (65%) and Practices (56%) compared to Knowledge (46%). Most respondents correctly identified dengue transmission through <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes (85%) and mosquito breeding grounds (98%); however, awareness of dengue serotypes (48%) and multiple infection risks (50%) was lower. Out of the dengue prevention methods practiced, draining and covering water containers was rated the safest and most effective (8.4 and 8.1, respectively, on a scale from 0 to 10). In comparison, dengue vaccination was perceived as generally safe and effective (7.6 and 7.7, respectively, on a scale from 0 to 10). Willingness to receive dengue vaccines was moderate (51%), with 60% unaware of vaccine availability. Fear of side effects (18%) was the most common reason for moderate willingness to vaccinate. Respondents preferred search engines (88%) and social media (85%) as sources to search health information, with doctors being the most trusted stakeholder to receive health information from (94%). The most favored dengue management strategy was combining vaccination with education and vector control (42%). The KAP assessment identified strengths and gaps in dengue awareness and practices among Indonesians. The gaps identified from the KAP results underscore the need for an integrated approach combining vector control, vaccination, and education. As the most trusted stakeholders, HCPs can play a key role in supporting the effective implementation of dengue management strategies.",

The prioritization of 20-NTD action plans in 2020 was undertaken by the WHO to acknowledge their importance. Infections such as leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, and human African trypanosomiasis exhibit high rates of mortality. This highlights the pressing need for collaborative initiatives aimed at addressing these diseases and minimizing their detrimental impact on susceptible populations. The etiology, types of NTDs, and management strategies, particularly vaccinations are discussed. The limitations of the available vaccines and the scope of development of novel formulations are also covered. The emergence of vaccines for NTDs poses significant challenges, mostly arising from the complex developmental phases of diverse diseases, inadequate resources for research, minimal involvement from the pharmaceutical industry, and the wide spectrum of infections, impeding vaccine development.

There is need to raise awareness of the burden of leptospirosis among health care givers and policy makers in Africa. The aim of this review was to highlight the current situation of leptospirosis in Africa and suggest a One Health approach of addressing its status as a leading zoonosis. In tropical regions, the nonspecific symptoms of fever, myalgia and arthralgia result in misdiagnosis of leptospirosis with malaria, yellow fever, typhoid fever, dengue fever, brucellosis, rickettsiosis, and babesiosis. Urinalysis presents an inexpensive diagnostic aid for leptospirosis. Humans with leptospirosis exhibit proteinuria, glucosuria, pyuria, haematuria and granular casts resulting from acute kidney injury. Therapeutic guidelines for empirical treatment of febrile patients should be considered. Febrile patients who test negative for malaria and yellow fever can benefit from doxycycline, which also treats brucellosis, rickettsiosis and typhoid fever. Control of leptospirosis should also address Leptospira infection in domestic animal reservoirs through vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs in endemic areas. Treatment of sick animals with streptomycin eliminates the carrier status, curbing leptospiruria and spread of infection. Rodents are important in transmission of Leptospira to humans in urban slums and rural settings therefore rodent control strategies help in reducing transmission of leptospirosis. Indirect transmission of Leptospira occurs through contact with water, vegetation, or soil contaminated with infected urine. Drinking water should be drawn from protected sources or chlorinated before household use.",

        "abstract": "Vector-borne diseases, particularly arboviral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes (e.g. dengue, Zika and chikungunya), have (re)emerged globally with increasing prevalence and severity. Climatic and environmental changes have resulted in significant expansion of the geographical distribution of Aedes mosquito vectors to unprecedented levels, creating optimal conditions for their introduction and establishment in new areas, especially in Africa. The prevention of Aedes-borne diseases relies heavily on controlling vector populations. However, the global resurgence of dengue underscores the limitations of current vector control tools in preventing epidemics, highlighting the urgent need for affordable, scalable and community-based vector control measures to address Aedes-borne diseases and urban mosquito vectors (e.g. Aedes spp. and Anopheles stephensi), with the overall aim to improve public health and well-being. In this report, we summarize the main outcomes of the \"International conference on advances in surveillance and control methods for Aedes-borne diseases and urban vectors\" held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 26-28 August 2024. The conference aimed to facilitate knowledge exchange, promote collaborative research and drive innovation in the surveillance and control of Aedes-borne diseases in Africa. Key objectives included reviewing the performance of new tools and technologies for Aedes control, and fostering inter-sectoral and international collaborations to strengthen public health measures against mosquito-borne diseases. The event was attended by more than 200 participants from 20 nationalities/countries and was streamed live online, with 321 virtual accesses recorded during the 3-day event.",

        "abstract": "Effective control of local dengue virus transmission requires reducing the population of mosquitoes below a critical density threshold. Aedes aegypti density thresholds can serve as targets for intervention effectiveness. Most thresholds have been identified by correlating vector densities with pathogen transmission events. However, despite previous descriptive research there is a need for rigorously controlled field studies to clarify the interactions between Ae. aegypti density and human infections. We report on a multi-arm cluster randomized field trial aimed at determining the number of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes below which dengue outbreaks are limited. We implemented four mosquito control treatments in a dose-response trial, using zero to three Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO traps) per house across study neighborhoods in Caguas, Puerto Rico from January 2021 to June 2024. We anticipated that significant reductions in Ae. aegypti populations would indicate a threshold density if low or no prevalence of dengue viruses was observed in mosquitoes or antibodies in residents through IgM and IgG serological testing. Results showed that female Ae. aegypti densities decreased by 44 %, 60 %, and 80 % in clusters with one, two, and three traps/house, respectively. The expected number of dengue-infected mosquitoes per thousand were 2.01, 1.70, 0.60, and 0.36 in clusters with zero, one, two, and three traps/house, respectively. Increases in dengue IgG antibody prevalence from 2022 to 2023 were noted only among residents aged 1-10 years, with rates of 25 %, 18 %, 6 %, and 5.9 % corresponding to the number of traps used. To reduce dengue incidence, local populations of Ae. aegypti should be kept below 4 females per AGO trap per week.",

Reproduction of mosquitoes is avoided by identifying and treating the Possible Breeding Habitats (PBH) such as Stagnant water in Tires, water tanks, and Puddles. The PBH can be identified using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) better known as Drones which cover vast areas and are cost-effective. In this work, an aerial dataset containing the PBH is created which is obtained by UAV. Each image is annotated manually to identify the objects of interest. Automatic detection of objects is experimented with by using YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 algorithms of all variants where YOLOv11 outperformed YOLOv8 with the metrics of mAP50 as 0.97, mAP50-90 as 0.61, Precision as 0.96, and recall as 0.88.

The lack of models replicating the disease's immunopathological features has hampered the understanding of the immune system's role in developing this disease. Recent advances, such as single-cell approaches, provide better systems and methodologies to study the role of different immune cells in SD, closing this gap and providing a better mechanistic understanding of disease pathogenesis and promoting the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions.

In the absence of treatments and vaccines for arboviral diseases, surveillance and control of Aedes larvae remains a top priority. However, Aedes larvae control strategies relay to a large extent on the knowledge of the distribution and characteristics of their habitats. The study assessed habitats, indices, habitat physico-chemical characteristics and composition of Aedes larvae and pupae in three towns. Aedes larvae and pupae were collected in Metema-Yohannes, Kokit, and Gendawuha towns of northwestern Ethiopia, from January 2022 to December 2023 following standard procedures. Aedes larvae/pupae were surveyed along natural and artificial habitats in relation to residential houses, physico-chemical characteristics of habitats characterized, reared to adults and later identified to species based on their morphological features. Data were entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20.0. Aedes larvae and pupae were abundant in Metema-Yohannes, Kokit and Gendawuha towns. Breteau, house, and container indices exceeded the World Health Organization's risk levels for arboviral diseases. Density of Aedes larvae/pupae was positively correlated with habitat water temperature, conductivity, phosphate, ammonia, total hardness and sulphate both in the artificial and natural habitats (P < 0.001). Adult Ae. aegypti were the most abundant (56.77%; 5106/8993) that emerged from larvae/pupae followed by Ae. vittatus (37.25%; 3350/8993), Ae. communis (2.39%; 215/8993), Ae. opok (0.66%; 60) and Ae. albopictus (0.26; 24). The number of Ae. aegypti emerged from algal habitats was greater than the number from the algae free (p < 0.001) and the number from tadpole free habitats was greater than the number from tadpole infested (p < 0.001). Adults of Ae. vittatus followed a similar trend. The mean number of Ae. aegypti emerged from larvae/pupae of habitats closer to human habitations, not exposed to sunlight, free of emergent vegetation and tyre substrates were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than from habitats of corresponding attributes. Artificial water-holding containers maintained higher density of Aedes larvae/pupae than natural water-holding containers in Metema-Yohannes, Kokit and Gendawuha towns. Ae. aegypti, Ae. vittatus, Ae. communis, Ae. albopictus and Ae. opok occurred in the towns. Ae. aegypti and Ae. vittatus larvae/pupae were abundant in discarded tyres, Ae. communis in discarded metal containers, and Ae. albopictus and Ae. opok in tree holes during the wet seasons in Metema Woreda, Northwestern Ethiopia. This study indicates the importance of improving Aedes larvae/pupae surveillance and control measures in Metema Woreda, Northwest Ethiopia.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a deadly disease and represents one of the biggest threats to global health, with persisting uncertainty surrounding its prognosis and treatment standards. The onset of severe dengue fever, characterized by intense inflammation and the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, is currently the only well-established association with disease severity. Therefore, identifying and assessing both new and established biomarkers that can accurately predict the outcome of severe dengue fever is essential. In this study, 100 age-matched healthy controls and 100 hospitalized dengue patients positive for NS1 and IgM, with a mean age of 45 years (range: 22- 65), were examined. Potential biomarkers were analyzed using a Coulter counter, spectroscopy, and ELISA to determine their prognostic value in assessing dengue fever severity. Triglycerides and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) were significantly higher in severe dengue fever patients compared to controls (P<0.001). Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and cholesterol levels were significantly lower in patients compared to controls (P<0.001). Albumin levels were 40.9% lower, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 422.1% higher, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 435.6% higher in severe dengue fever patients compared to controls. Unlike HDL, oxidized HDL (oxHDL) levels were 160.4% higher in patients with severe dengue fever compared to controls. Still, the absolute levels of oxHDL did not exceed total HDL levels, as confirmed by corrected data. Oxidized HDL, combined with other lipoproteins, may provide an ideal panel of prognostic indicators that could guide the treatment of severe dengue fever and serve as reliable biomarkers for predicting disease outcomes.",

        "title": "Assessing generalizability of a dengue classifier across multiple datasets.",
        "abstract": "Early diagnosis of dengue fever is important for individual treatment and monitoring disease prevalence in the population. To assist diagnosis, previous studies have proposed classification models to detect dengue from symptoms and clinical measurements. However, there has been little exploration of whether existing models can be used to make predictions for new populations. In this study, we assess the generalizability of dengue classification models to new datasets. We trained logistic regression models on five publicly available dengue datasets from previous studies, using three explanatory variables identified as important in prior work: age, white blood cell count, and platelet count. These five datasets were collected at different times in different locations, with a variety of disease rates and patient ages. A model was trained on each dataset, and predictive performance and model calibration was evaluated on both the original (training) dataset, and the other (test) datasets from different studies. By comparing the model's performance when applied to data from a new location, we are able to assess the model's generalizability to new populations. We further compared performance with larger models and other classification methods. In-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for the logistic regression models ranged from 0.74 to 0.89, while out-of-sample AUCs ranged from 0.55 to 0.89. Matching age ranges in training/test datasets increased AUC values and balanced the sensitivity and specificity. Adjusting the predicted probabilities to account for differences in dengue prevalence improved calibration in 20/28 training-test pairs. Results were similar when other explanatory variables were included and when other classification methods (decision trees and support vector machines) were used. The in-sample performance of the logistic regression model was consistent with previous dengue classifiers, suggesting the chosen model is a good choice in a variety of settings and has decent overall performance. However, adjustments are required to make predictions on new datasets. Practitioners can use existing dengue classifiers in new settings but should be careful with different patient ages and disease rates.",

        "title": "Psychiatric Sequelae of Dengue: A Review of the Interface.",
        "abstract": "Dengue is one of the major public health concerns in tropical and subtropical countries. In addition to neurological sequelae which are well documented, emerging evidence suggests that dengue may also lead to psychiatric sequelae including mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety, and body dysmorphic disorder. This narrative review aims to synthesize the existing literature to explore the psychiatric manifestations and postulated pathophysiological mechanisms and identify predictors and treatment of psychiatric sequelae in dengue. This review identified 30 studies including observational studies, case reports, and case series. The immune-inflammatory responses due to cytokine dysregulation, blood-brain barrier disruption, direct viral effects, and epigenetic mechanisms with histone deacetylase activation are possible contributors to psychiatric sequelae in dengue. The main predictors include severity of dengue, thrombocytopenia, central nervous system involvement, febrile and critical phase of illness, specific dengue virus serotypes (DENV-2 and DENV-3), and stress due to hospitalization. Psychiatric symptoms often persist beyond the acute phase, highlighting the importance of long-term follow-up to evaluate the impact of dengue on mental health. Additionally, comparisons with other Flaviviridae viruses, such as Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, reveal both shared and distinct psychiatric implications, suggesting potential virus-specific mechanisms. The current treatment approaches are largely extrapolated from general psychiatric practice, with limited research on targeted interventions. Future research should focus on standardized diagnostic assessment, longitudinal follow-up, diagnostic biomarkers, and developing targeted treatment strategies to improve clinical outcomes. With rising cases of dengue, integrating psychiatric screening into routine dengue management may enhance early recognition and intervention. Hence, a multidisciplinary research approach involving psychiatrists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, immunologists, and policymakers is crucial for addressing psychiatric sequelae in dengue fever and mitigating the detrimental implications on public health.",

        "abstract": "Dengue infection is an emerging global health concern. Understanding its impact on patients with a history of psoriasis is essential, particularly concerning its potential to trigger psoriasis flare-ups. Additionally, it is crucial to assess the influence of psoriasis treatments on the severity of dengue. This study aims to describe the effects of dengue infection on psoriasis exacerbations, in patients with pre-existing psoriasis and to assess whether prior psoriasis treatment influences dengue severity. A cross-sectional descriptive study. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were systematically collected. 25 dermatologists reported psoriasis flare-ups in 52 patients (67.3% male; median age 48 years, IQR 23-81). Among these patients, 63.5% (33 patients) experienced plaque psoriasis flare-ups, 19.2% (10 patients) developed guttate psoriasis, 11.5% (6 patients) progressed to erythroderma, 3.8% (2 patients) presented with plaque psoriasis and pustules, and one patient (1.9%) had an acute generalized pustular psoriasis flare-up. Overall, 63.5% of patients experienced moderate dengue, 30.8% had mild dengue, and 5.8% had severe dengue. Among the 19 patients receiving biologic treatments, 84.2% experienced moderate dengue, while 15.8% had mild dengue. Importantly, none of these patients required hospitalization for severe dengue. In the methotrexate-treated group, comprising seven patients, four experienced mild dengue and three had moderate dengue. Psoriasis flare-ups in this group included two severe cases, five moderate cases, one erythroderma, and six cases of plaque psoriasis. Dengue infection appears to trigger psoriasis flare-ups in affected individuals. The most commonly observed type was plaque psoriasis. Our findings suggest systemic therapies for psoriasis may not exacerbate dengue severity and could be considered safe. Further prospective studies are necessary to elucidate the relationship between psoriasis severity and dengue outcomes.",

This review article aims to provide a full explanation of the causes, historical background, occurrence, development, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, spread, variables that increase the risk, importance to public health, economic impact, treatment, and methods of controlling bovine brucellosis. Bovine tuberculosis primarily affects cattle although it can also affect other animals. Bovine brucellosis is a global illness that occurs in all regions of the world, with the exception of Antarctica. Cattle afflicted with bovine brucellosis may suffer from persistent and incapacitating illness. The main techniques used to identify Brucella infection are serological assays, such as the Rose Bengal plate test, milk ring test, serum agglutination test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The prevalence of Brucellosis exhibits significant variation as a result of disparities in the precision and efficacy of serological tests. <i>Brucella abortus</i> can be found in various physiological fluids and tissues, such as milk, urine, feces, vaginal secretions, semen, bones, joints, male reproductive organs, placenta, and the fetuses of pregnant women. This condition commonly decreases cow productivity and can negatively impact the financial performance of livestock businesses, particularly dairy sectors. The most effective initial treatment for brucellosis is isoniazid, doxycycline, and streptomycin. The vaccine strains most frequently employed to protect cattle against <i>Brucella</i> infection and related abortions are strains 19 and RB51. Research has shown that bacteriophage lysates are effective for treating bovine brucellosis. Adopting a One Health strategy can help effectively treat this illness by considering the health of both animals and humans.",

        "abstract": "Background In tropical countries like Nepal, the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded within a population already grappling with various tropical infectious diseases. Co-infection with malaria and dengue holds clinical significance when managing COVID-19 patients in regions endemic to these diseases. Objective To identify malaria and dengue infections in febrile or symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu. Method Over two months, a prospective study was conducted on febrile or symptomatic patients suspected of COVID-19 visiting Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu. One hundred and twenty-three patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 through RT-PCR as well as for malaria and dengue infection using rapid diagnostic test kits. Result Out of 123 patients suspected of COVID-19, 64 were confirmed to have COVID-19. No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infection was found among the 123 tested patients. However, two patients admitted for COVID-19 tested positive for dengue virus infection. The patients with co-infections with dengue or scrub typhus were likely to have a longer hospital stays (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 0.22-29.26), though lacking a significant association. Conclusion The two patients diagnosed with dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 were identified during their hospital visit and both recovered after receiving treatment. Given that COVID-19 patients manifest symptoms resembling many tropical infectious diseases, the study underscores the clinical importance of testing for multiple circulating infections in patients from endemic areas. This approach ensures appropriate and timely management reducing the risk of severity or mortality.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the intrinsic factors that influence mosquito vector competence (VC) to pathogens is crucial for assessing the risk of disease transmission in both rural and urban environments. We assessed the VC of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes from urban (dengue-endemic) and rural (dengue-free) areas in Guangzhou, China, for dengue virus-2 (DENV-2), while also examining intrinsic factors such as Wolbachia and immune-related gene expression influencing VC. Adult females of rural, urban, and laboratory (control) populations of Ae. albopictus were orally exposed to a freshly prepared suspension of the DENV-2 New Guinea C strain (GenBank: AF038403.1), with a final titer of 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml, for a period of 60 min. Three different bioassays (B1-B3) were conducted on 60 mosquitoes per population: B1 at 7 days post-exposure (dpe) to assess viral infection in the mosquito midgut, and B2 and B3 at 14 dpe to evaluate viral dissemination in the carcass and transmission via saliva. The mosquito samples were processed for total RNA and DNA extraction. RNA was subsequently analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to quantify viral load and measure the expression of immune-related genes, while DNA was assessed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine Wolbachia density (wAlbA and wAlbB) and the rps6 gene. At 7 dpe, virus proliferation in rural mosquitoes was similar to that in urban mosquitoes (P = 0.10). By 14 dpe, rural mosquitoes showed a significantly lower status of virus dissemination (P < 0.04) and transmission (P < 0.012). Wolbachia (-0.12 < r < -0.92) and immune effectors (-0.025 < r < -0.568) were negatively correlated with DENV in all mosquitoes, with more negative values indicating a stronger inverse relationship. The wAlbA and wAlbB strains exhibited similar densities across all the mosquito populations, with wAlbB revealing a slightly greater abundance in rural mosquitoes, although the difference was not significant. Elevated Relish 2 (Rel2), defensin A (DefA), and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) levels indicate activation of the Toll and JAK-STAT pathways, contributing to resistance against DENV replication and reduced VC in rural mosquitoes. This study indicates that rural Ae. albopictus mosquitoes may possess intrinsic barriers limiting their VC for DENV-2, offering valuable preliminary insights into VC across geographically distinct populations. However, further research across a broader range of urban and rural locations is needed to validate these findings and better understand the local factors influencing VC. Such insights are vital for public health, as they can help prioritize locations for dengue surveillance and effective vector control. Future studies should investigate the roles of intestinal microflora and immune pathways across diverse mosquito populations to better understand these dynamics and improve our knowledge of mosquito-borne disease transmission in different environments.",

Our research group reported the antiviral activity of phenolic dihalogenated compounds derived from l-tyrosine. Therefore, we aimed to identify the anti-flaviviral potential of two dihalogenated O-methylated compounds derived from l-tyrosine. A dichlorinated compound (dC) and a dibrominated compound (dB) were evaluated via a sequential treatment strategy against DENV-2 and ZIKV on Vero cells. The most promising compound was evaluated by several individual antiviral strategies in both viral models; infectious viral particles (IVP), viral genome copies and proteins were quantified. Finally, in silico predictions were made, molecular docking with AutoDock Vina®, molecular dynamics with GROMACS, pharmaco-kinetics by SWISSADME and toxicity by ADMET-predictor. Only dC showed activity against both flaviviruses. In treatment pre-infection strategy, dC had activity against both flaviviruses but with different sites of action into replicative cycle; when treatment post-infection was evaluated, there was only activity in the late stages of DENV-2 and there was virucidal activity against DENV-2 and against DENV-4, predicting a stable complex with the compound and E-protein. Additionally, have modeled characteristics to become an oral drug were favorable. dC has antiviral potential against the two most important flavivirus models in public health in recent years and has several sites of action in viral replication cycle which could reduce the possibility of generating resistance against it.",

        "abstract": "Vector control measures assume utmost importance in the absence of specific treatment against clinically complicated Dengue virus infections. Preventive measures such as reduction of mosquito larvae breeding hot spots also include spraying of insecticides. However, insecticides pose a risk to the general population as well as to the environment. A search for a suitable environmentally friendly substitute for insecticides has been one of the goals of all researchers round the globe. To investigate the possibility of using salt in existing vector control programs, we investigated the effect of different concentrations of saline water on mosquito larva in the present study. Larvae of Aedes aegypti were subjected to six different doses of salt solutions ranging from 0.5% to 3% for the larval bioassay. The lethal concentrations (LC50 and LC90 values) for 50% and 90% mortality were computed. Simultaneously, gravid females, A. aegypti mosquitoes, were released into the cage for egg-laying, and from the 4th day onward, the eggs were counted. Egg-hatching tests were also done in the salt solution to assess the influence of salinity on egg hatching. The findings imply that a salt concentration of 1%-2% is lethal for A. aegypti . With a salinity content of more than 2%, no egg-laying was observed. After control, the maximum emergence (64.5%) was recorded in a water bowl containing 8% saltwater (66%). The threshold concentration was found to be between 0.5% and 1.0%, after which the mortality of the hatched larvae rose sharply, reaching 100% in 24 h at 2.0% concentration. At a salinity of 2%, common salt sodium chloride (NaCl) was shown to be efficient in killing A. aegypti larvae. Unlike other insecticides, salt is nontoxic, crystalline, cost-effective, stable, and easy to implement. More studies on this aspect of salt may be undertaken in the future to assess its efficacy in field conditions.",

However, there is limited evidence of community engagement in dengue management in urban settings in Nepal. This study aimed to assess the community stakeholders' perceptions and experiences on dengue outbreak management in urban settings in Nepal. A qualitative study with interpretive phenomenology approach was conducted among community leaders and female community health volunteers (FCHVs) who were directly involved in the prevention and control of Dengue outbreaks in Lalitpur Metropolitan City. The participants were selected based on the purposive sampling with inclusion criteria. Twenty face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted between April 2023 and June 2023 among the local community stakeholders. The data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach guided by the Health Belief Model as a theoretical framework. Findings are presented under two broader themes (i) Community contributions in awareness building, and (ii) Stakeholders' experiences on dengue management and prevention. The study identified perceived severity and susceptibility, driven by recurrent dengue outbreaks, as key motivators for stakeholders engagement and actions in dengue outbreak management. Community-based initiatives, such as awareness programs and home-to-home visits, were considered effective in increasing public engagement. However, challenges such as delayed actions, the community's limited knowledge of dengue prevention and control, reluctance for consistent source reduction, inadequate water supply, and adverse sociocultural practices posed significant barriers to dengue management. Despite these obstacles, stakeholders expressed strong self-efficacy and commitment to the prevention and control of potential dengue outbreaks in future. Local stakeholder engagement was considered crucial in dengue outbreak prevention and control. However, proactive, timely planning, continuous dissemination of dengue education, improved health infrastructures, and enhanced collaboration and coordination among community members and authorities are essential for the effective management of dengue outbreaks.",

The most widespread serotype is type 2 DENV (DENV 2), which has no specific treatment. NS2B-NS3 protease plays a pivotal role in DENV replication because of its function in cleavage of the viral polyprotein; thus, it is considered a promising target for antiviral discovery. In this study, we developed a high-throughput screening system based on the NS2B-NS3 protease to identify candidates from an FDA-approved drug library. Eltrombopag was screened out of 3273 drugs, and demonstrated inhibition on DENV 2 ​at the micromolar level in vitro, significantly reducing viral loads in the targeted organs of challenged mice following intraperitoneal injection. Further mechanistic analysis showed that eltrombopag allosterically binds to the DENV 2 NS2B-NS3 protease in a reversible, non-competitive manner, therefore inhibiting DENV 2 ​at the post-infection stage. In addition, eltrombopag inhibited the NS2B-NS3 proteases of DENV 4 and Zika virus, suggesting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. This study repurposed eltrombopag as a promising antiviral agent against DENV, providing an alternative for antiviral development against flaviviruses.",

        "title": "Tailoring dengue health communication: Survey-based strategies to reduce message fatigue across risk areas.",
        "abstract": "Dengue remains a significant public health challenge in Taiwan, particularly in the southern region where Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes thrive. Despite nationwide dengue prevention campaigns, message fatigue-where individuals become disengaged due to repetitive messaging-may reduce the effectiveness of public health communication. This study analyses trends and associations between key predictors-such as age, sex, education, job, and perceived risks (optimistic bias, perceived prevalence, and perceived severity)-and message fatigue across different dengue-risk areas in Taiwan. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from October 25 to November 13, 2023, among 814 adults across Taiwan. Participants were classified into high-risk (southern Taiwan) and low-risk (other regions) groups. Message fatigue was assessed using the message environment (ME) and audience response (AR) dimensions. Perceived risks (perceived prevalence, severity, and optimistic bias) and demographic variables (sex, age, education, job experience, and residency) were analyzed using Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models. The findings revealed that message fatigue varied by region and demographic factors. In high-risk areas, individuals with lower education levels exhibited higher AR fatigue (boredom and disengagement) (p = 0.04). In low-risk areas, males (p = 0.02), individuals with lower education (p = 0.01), and those with optimistic bias (p = 0.02) reported significantly higher ME fatigue (perceived overexposure). Despite uniform nationwide messaging, participants in high-risk regions exhibited greater message fatigue, possibly due to habituation. Message fatigue is associated with regional dengue risk, demographic factors, and perceived risk. A uniform health communication approach may not be effective across different populations. In high-risk regions, message fatigue is more pronounced. Repetitive warnings may contribute to disengagement, suggesting a need for communication strategies that reduce redundancy and emphasize localized, actionable information. In low-risk areas, messages should focus on engagement, particularly for men, who exhibited higher fatigue in this study. Simplified messaging can reduce cognitive overload for lower-educated populations. Addressing message fatigue can enhance the effectiveness of dengue prevention campaigns and sustain public engagement in long-term health communication efforts.",

Concurrently, he was diagnosed with dengue fever, further complicating anticoagulation management due to thrombocytopenia. Prompt discontinuation of warfarin, intravenous vitamin K administration, and delayed initiation of enoxaparin after platelet recovery were key aspects of treatment.

        "abstract": "Platelet transfusion is a frequent procedure with benefits and risks. To provide recommendations in adult and pediatric populations in whom platelet transfusions are commonly performed. Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to findings from 21 randomized trials and 13 observational studies in contexts of limited randomized clinical trial data. Transfusion strategies using fewer (restrictive) vs greater (liberal) amounts of platelets were compared. Evidence demonstrated that restrictive transfusion strategies probably did not cause increases in mortality or bleeding relative to liberal strategies across predefined clinical populations. Exceedingly low incidence of spinal hematoma was identified in patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing lumbar puncture. Because definitions of restrictive strategies varied across trials, recommendations reflect practical guidance. The following recommendations are strong recommendations with high/moderate-certainty evidence. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. For consumptive thrombocytopenia in neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 25 × 103/μL. In patients undergoing lumbar puncture, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL. In patients with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to Dengue without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is not recommended. The following recommendations are conditional recommendations with low/very low-certainty evidence. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding adults undergoing autologous stem cell transplant or with aplastic anemia, prophylactic platelet transfusion is not recommended. In adults with consumptive thrombocytopenia without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. In adults undergoing central venous catheter placement in compressible anatomic sites, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 103/μL. In adults undergoing interventional radiology, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 20 × 103/μL for low-risk procedures and less than 50 × 103/μL for high-risk procedures. For adults undergoing major nonneuraxial surgery, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 50 × 103/μL. For patients without thrombocytopenia undergoing cardiovascular surgery in the absence of major hemorrhage, including those receiving cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet transfusion is not recommended. For nonoperative intracranial hemorrhage in adults with platelet count greater than 100 × 103/μL, including those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion is not recommended. A consistent pattern of evidence supports the implementation of restrictive platelet transfusion strategies. Restrictive strategies reduce risk of adverse reactions, mitigate platelet shortages, and reduce costs. It is good practice to consider overall clinical context and alternative therapies in the decision to perform platelet transfusion.",

Eligible studies included SRs, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and matched cohort observational studies between 1946 and March 2025. Populations included were hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, periprocedural prophylaxis, cardiovascular surgery, consumptive thrombocytopenia, and intracranial hemorrhage. The intervention was restrictive versus liberal platelet transfusion strategies on outcomes of mortality and bleeding. Duplicate screening and data extraction occurred. Meta-analysis used Mantel-Haenszel method of random effects model. Twenty-one RCTs, 24 observational studies, and 20 SRs were included. The evidence quality varied. For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, 11 RCTs were analyzed, with 9 RCTs at moderate risk of bias (ROB). Two RCTs were identified for dengue, with high ROB for bleeding. One RCT was identified each in cardiovascular surgery, intracranial hemorrhage, and periprocedural prophylaxis. Meta-analyses indicated no significant effect for outcomes of mortality or bleeding by strategy, but confidence intervals (CIs) were wide. Effect estimates were 1.32 [0.93, 1.86] for all-cause mortality in hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, 0.80 [0.38, 1.70] in cardiovascular surgery, and 0.69 [0.47, 1.03] in critically ill neonates or dengue patients. A consistent lack of benefit with liberal platelet transfusion was observed across analyzed populations, although wide confidence intervals do not exclude clinically meaningful impacts.

This study aimed to trace the origins and transmission route of the dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) strain responsible for the 2022 epidemic through genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. We successfully sequenced 135 complete DENV-1 genomes from clinical samples using long-read amplicon sequencing. The DENV-1 genotype III strain circulating in Pakistan likely originated from Southeast Asia, with potential connections to China-Singapore strains. Mutation comparisons using reconstructed ancestral sequences indicated that the Pakistan clade shared characteristic non-synonymous mutations with the 2014-2015 China epidemic strains, indicating the potential origin of the currently circulating DENV-1 strain. Considering the temporal gap between the China and Pakistan epidemics, there is likely a \"missing link\" in the transmission route. Our findings provide critical insights into the genetic diversity and transmission patterns of DENV-1 in Pakistan and underscore the need for enhanced genomic surveillance and international collaboration to control the spread and predict outbreaks of DENV.",

Developing a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (LATDV) faces challenges in overcoming viral interference to induce a balanced immune response.

This first-in-human Phase I study of KD-382 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, ascending-dose study in 60 flavivirus antibody-naïve healthy subjects aged 18-65 years. The study was conducted in two parts evaluating low dose (Part 1) and standard dose (Part 2). In each part, subjects were randomized in a 3:2:1 ratio to receive either KD-382 as a single dose, two doses, or placebo. Subjects received subcutaneous injections on Days 1 and 29 and were followed up for 1 year. Eight (Part 1: 3; Part 2: 5) of 60 vaccinated subjects were withdrawn from the study. Both low and standard doses of KD-382, regardless of the dosing regimen, showed a 100 % seroconversion rate for all four serotypes (DENV1-4) at Day 57 and retained 100 % seropositivity for DENV1, 2, and 4 through the 12-month follow-up. For DENV3, a single dose in the low dose group of KD-382 retained a 100 % seroconversion rate at Months 3 and 12, while in the standard dose group, it was 91.7 % at Month 12. The most frequently reported solicited local treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were erythema, followed by pain and injection site pruritus; solicited systemic TEAEs were fatigue, followed by headache and myalgia. No serious or severe solicited TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to study vaccine withdrawal or death were reported. KD-382 was safe and well-tolerated in flavivirus antibody-naïve healthy subjects.

Three studies evaluated the use of insecticide-impregnated curtains alone, one combined those with residual insecticide treatment in dwellings, one evaluated the use of insecticide-impregnated school uniforms, and the remaining three evaluated household insecticide application. Only four of the eight articles showed some level of efficacy of chemical interventions in reducing dengue prevalence or incidence.

This review discusses the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic workup, and management of CE and DE, and provides insights into the vector-borne diseases with the help of literature obtained from clinical studies, reviews, and case series/reports. Chikungunya, as well as dengue viruses, are spread by the bite of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus . The pathogenesis includes either direct invasion of the nervous system and/or immune-mediated CNS injury. It starts with fever, body aches/myalgia, and arthralgia (more in chikungunya) and may progress to encephalitis, if not treated properly during the initial stages. Laboratory investigations show leukopenia/thrombocytopenia, immunoglobulin M (serum and cerebrospinal fluid) positivity, and real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity. Brain imaging does not have any specific diagnostic clue. However, chikungunya has a predilection for the medulla oblongata, while dengue may affect the thalamus to show the classical double doughnut sign. Treatment is invariably medical, with adequate hydration and additional supportive care, although steroids and immunoglobulins have also been tried. CE and DE are critical vector-borne illnesses of CNS with guarded prognosis. The exact pathogenesis needs further research insights. A high index of clinical suspicion and aggressive management can lead to better outcomes. No specific therapy or immunization is available for CE or DE.

Severe dengue, defined by hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, can develop quickly in people who have warning indications such as abdominal pain, mucosal bleeding, and a significant decrease in platelet count. Laboratory markers such as hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, and coagulation tests are critical for early diagnosis and prognosis. This retrospective study was carried out from January 2023 to December 2024 at a super-specialty tertiary care hospital. There were 283 adult patients with dengue with warning signs, who were categorized into 102 with platelet transfusion and 181 with no platelet transfusion. Data on patient demographics, clinical history, laboratory values, and radiological findings were systematically obtained from hospital records at the time of admission. Laboratory parameters such as white blood cell (OR = 2.137), hemoglobin (OR = 2.15), aPTT (OR = 5.815), AST<sup>2</sup>/ALT (OR = 2.431), platelet count (OR = 26.261) and NS1 (OR = 4.279) were found to be significantly associated (<i>p</i> < 0.01) with platelet transfusion.

        "abstract": "Flaviviruses are a group of viruses transmitted mainly by mosquitoes and ticks, causing severe diseases in humans. Examples include dengue, Zika, West Nile virus, and yellow fever. They primarily affect individuals in tropical and subtropical regions, causing public health problems such as epidemic outbreaks and significant economic burdens due to hospitalizations and treatments. They share antigens, leading to cross-reactivity where antibodies generated against one flavivirus can react with others, complicating the accurate diagnosis of individual infections and making the development of treatments or vaccines more challenging. The role of T cells in the immune response to flaviviruses is a complex topic debated by scientists. On one hand, T cells help control infection by eliminating infected cells and protecting against disease. However, there is evidence that an excessive or dysregulated T cell response can cause tissue damage and worsen the disease, as seen in severe dengue cases. This duality underscores the complexity of the immune response to flavivirus infections, posing a significant challenge for researchers. Gaining a deeper understanding of the immune response at the cellular level, particularly the role of T follicular helper cells, can reveal new avenues of investigation that could lead to novel strategies for disease management. This review explores the dynamics of T cell responses, focusing on circulatory T follicular helper cells (cT<sub>FH</sub>), to enhance our understanding of flavivirus immunity and inform future interventions.",

Hypericin (HY), a compound derived from <i>Hypericum perforatum</i>, exhibited potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells, with low cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> > 200 nM). HY showed no significant activity against Influenza A (H1N1) or dengue virus serotype 2, supporting its selective action. Antiviral effects were most evident when HY was administered post-infection, in a concentration-dependent manner, while cellular pretreatment or viral pre-incubation produced limited effects. Notably, HY also displayed virucidal activity, significantly reducing viral titers at 4 °C, 22 °C, and 37 °C. Combination treatments with remdesivir or nirmatrelvir enhanced antiviral efficacy by 50-70% relative to monotherapy, depending on compound concentration. Molecular simulations revealed stable interactions with conserved residues in RdRp and 3CLpro, suggesting a low risk of resistance. Together, these findings highlight the potential of HY as a selective antiviral and virucidal agent against SARS-CoV-2, particularly in combination regimens.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/objectives:</b> In Brazil, the co-circulation of arboviruses-such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and Chikungunya viruses-creates a complex epidemiological landscape, drawing attention from health authorities due to high morbidity and mortality rates. Also present in this context is the Mayaro virus (MAYV), a neglected arbovirus, which can also cause severe syndromes and has been expanding beyond its usual endemic areas in northern and central-western Brazil. Epidemiological surveillance measures remain limited, and there are no effective prophylactic strategies or antiviral treatments for this neglected arbovirus. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of commercial and synthetic compounds against MAYV using an image high-throughput screening (iHTS) system. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 52 compounds from an FDA-approved commercial library (Tocriscreen) and 50 other compounds were tested. <b>Results:</b> Seven compounds showed anti-MAYV activity and were non-toxic for the following cell lines: Naringenin, LLA9A, chrysin, and its ester C6. Post-infection treatments with these selected compounds significantly decreased the percentage of infected cells and the release of infectious viral particles in the supernatant. Additionally, anti-MAYV activity of these four selected hits was confirmed using several human cell lines and two different MAYV genotypes. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results indicate that the iHTS platform is effective for screening anti-MAYV drugs and that four promising compounds can efficiently inhibit MAYV replication in human cell lines. Although in vivo studies are still required to confirm the efficacy of the selected hits, our findings provide a starting point for developing a potential treatment for MAYV infections.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever and enteric fever, two prevalent infectious diseases in tropical and subtropical regions, pose significant public health challenges due to their overlapping clinical manifestations and distinct therapeutic approaches. This study aims to evaluate hospitalization and management protocols for both illnesses, assessing their adherence to clinical guidelines and examining patient outcomes across diverse healthcare settings. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing hospital records over a five-year period (April 2019-April 2024). A total of 218 individuals diagnosed with enteric fever (n=98) and dengue fever (n=120) were included in the study. Data were retrospectively collected using standardized forms from hospital records, laboratory reports, and discharge summaries to capture demographics, clinical presentations, lab findings, treatments, complications, and outcomes for patients with dengue or enteric fever. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS, Version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), applying descriptive statistics, chi-square test, t-test, logistic regression, and Cox modeling to evaluate associations between treatment protocols and patient outcomes, with significance set at p<0.05. Dengue and enteric fever showed distinct clinical patterns: rash and headache were more common in dengue fever, while abdominal pain and diarrhea predominated in enteric fever. Although demographic differences in age, sex, and residence were observed, they were not statistically significant. Improved outcomes in dengue fever were significantly associated with fluid replacement (n=110, 91.67%, p=0.02), reflecting the collective effect of standard supportive care measures. In contrast, antibiotic therapy (n=98, 100.00%, p=0.01) was central to favorable outcomes in enteric fever. Dengue fever was primarily diagnosed through serological testing (n=115, 95.83%), while enteric fever relied on blood cultures (n=78, 79.59%) (χ²=126.98, p<0.0001, OR=0.02). Hospitalization durations were significantly longer in enteric fever, patients staying ≥5 days compared to dengue fever patients (χ²=8.76, p=0.0031, OR=0.39). Recovery without complications was slightly more frequent in dengue fever (n=112, 93.33%) than in enteric fever (n=88, 89.80%), though this difference was not statistically significant (χ²=0.49, p=0.483, OR=0.60). These findings apply to general dengue fever cases only; patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever were managed separately due to differing clinical protocols. This study highlights the necessity of tailored treatment protocols for enteric and dengue fever, emphasizing the importance of strict adherence to established clinical guidelines to optimize patient outcomes, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings. While appropriate management, such as antibiotic therapy for enteric fever and supportive care for dengue, is well defined, differentiating between these conditions based solely on clinical presentation remains a significant challenge due to overlapping symptoms with other febrile illnesses. This diagnostic ambiguity underscores the urgent need for more robust, accessible, and rapid diagnostic tools. Furthermore, ongoing education and capacity building for healthcare professionals are essential to enhance clinical judgment, ensure early recognition, and improve compliance with evolving evidence-based practices in the management of febrile illnesses.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains a major global health threat. Its incidence is increasing, with frequent outbreaks affecting millions of people each year. Although vaccines are available, their limited effectiveness and the absence of targeted antiviral therapies highlight the critical need for alternative treatment approaches. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity of bidebiline A and heteropsine, two dimeric aporphine alkaloids isolated from Trivalvaria costata, against DENV-infected Huh7 liver cells. Our findings reveal that heteropsine inhibits DENV production and infection in Huh7 cells more effectively than bidebiline A. Heteropsine also exerts antiviral activity in endothelial and lung cell lines. Mechanistic studies, including time-of-addition assays and molecular docking, elucidate that heteropsine targets early steps during cellular infection, possibly by binding to domain III of the dengue virus envelope protein (EDIII). Viral binding and internalization assays confirmed that heteropsine disrupts viral entry. Furthermore, heteropsine suppresses DENV-induced immunopathogenesis by downregulating the expression of cytokine/chemokine genes (TNF-α, IL-6, RANTES, and IP-10) and attenuating nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) transcription factor. These findings highlight the importance of heteropsine as a promising antiviral candidate with the potential for further development to address the urgent need for effective dengue therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Mosquitoes are significant vectors of infectious diseases, causing thousands of fatalities worldwide each year. This present study was to check the toxicity of essential oil (EO) from Maranta arundinacea L. against three mosquito species: Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. The immature stages were exposed to five different concentrations such as 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 ppm; these were used to check the insecticidal activity according to WHO standard protocol with slight modification. The EO presented 100 % ovicidal toxicity against the eggs of treated three mosquitoes at 24 h. Strong mosquitocidal effects were observed, with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 5.0, 4.9 and 6.2 ppm for the larvae (3rd Instar) of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes species, respectively, at 24 h. However, no significant pupicidal toxicity was observed in any of the mosquito. Three main compounds were identified in the EO that might have contributed to its mosquitocidal properties. Toxicity assessments indicated that the EO from M. arundinacea did not adversely affect the tested natural predators such as P. reticulata, Dragon fly nymph, D. indicus and G. affinis. The EO was then formulated for field application, which confirmed its promising mosquitocidal activity (20-28 ppm), without any toxicity to tested natural predators. This study highlights the potential of EO from M. arundinacea in mosquito management, suggesting that it can serve as a possible substitute to synthetic chemicals, offering effective mosquito control with minimal environmental impact.",

We developed a computational workflow using scRNA-Seq data to assess cellular metabolism during viral infection. With this workflow we predicted the capacity of cells to sustain SARS-CoV-2 virion production in patients and found a tissue-wide induction of metabolic pathways that support viral replication. Expanding our analysis to influenza A and dengue viruses, we identified metabolic targets and inhibitors for potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatment. These targets were highly enriched for known interaction partners of all analyzed viruses. Indeed, phenformin, an NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase inhibitor, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus replication. Atpenin A5, blocking succinate dehydrogenase, inhibited SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus with high selectivity indices. In vivo, phenformin showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a Syrian hamster model.

The primary objective of our study was to assess the factors associated with 30-day mortality in DSS patients. Adult patients >18 years old, who were admitted with DSS were included. DSS was diagnosed in patients who required vasopressors or had lactic acidosis >4 mmol/L. Patients were divided into three different groups based on cumulative fluid balance at death or extubation: group I (<3.5 L), group II (3.5-8.0 L), and group III (>8.0 L). A total of 135 patients with DSS was included, with an overall 30-day mortality of 74.8%. The average Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on intensive care unit admission was 12.2. Mechanical ventilation was required in 112 patients (83.0%), with 61 patients (45.2%) being intubated without a noninvasive ventilation trial. Respiratory failure was the most common reason for requiring intubation (65 patients, 48.2%).

The neural network performed the best, with an AUC of 0.921, CA of 0.755, F1 score of 0.740, precision of 0.732, and recall value of 0.755 and was thus selected for future predictions. Among the predictors, building area, population and road density had the highest influence, followed by minimum, maximum, and average temperatures in decreasing order of importance. The machine learning approach neural network effectively predicted the historical dengue distribution considering both landscape and climatic variables for an urban settings like Bhopal.

        "abstract": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has been a health challenge in Singapore for decades. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore encountered a serious dengue outbreak and deployed various communication strategies to raise public awareness and mitigate dengue transmission. Drawing on the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework, this study examines how dengue-related messages communicated on Facebook (Meta) during the COVID-19 pandemic fall into the CERC themes. This study also seeks to understand how these themes differ between dengue outbreak (eg, 2020) and nonoutbreak years (eg, 2021). In addition, we explore how message themes on dengue changed across different CERC phases within the dengue outbreak year. We conducted a content analysis on 314 Facebook posts published by public health authorities in Singapore between January 1, 2020, and September 30, 2022. We conducted chi-square tests to examine the differences in message themes between the dengue outbreak and nonoutbreak years. We also conducted chi-square tests to examine how these message themes varied across 3 CERC phases during the dengue outbreak year. Our findings suggest that during the dual epidemics of dengue and COVID-19, Singapore's public health communication on dengue largely adhered to CERC principles. Dengue-related messaging, particularly regarding intelligence and requests for contributions, significantly varied between outbreak and nonoutbreak years. In addition, messages on general advisories and vigilance, as well as those on social and common responsibility, significantly differed across the CERC phases during the dengue outbreak year. Singapore's public health authorities flexibly adjusted their messaging strategies on social media platforms in response to the evolving dengue situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the high adaptability of the government's health communication amid the dual epidemics. However, several areas for improvement should also be noted for future public health communication to mitigate dengue transmission.",

The real data of dengue infection in East Java, Indonesia is employed to estimate the parameters of the dengue model. The estimation of parameters is done by using monthly cumulative data on humans infected dengue that recorded at East Java Health Office on 2018-2020. We then analyze the stability of the equilibria of the model. The analysis exhibits that the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than one. We utilize the Lyapunov function approach to guarantee that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever the reproduction number is greater than one. Furthermore, this work examines the effectiveness of various dengue control strategies, including vector control, awareness program, and prevention. Cost-effectiveness evaluation has shown that the combination of vector control, awareness programs, and awareness prevention is the most effective intervention to reduce the dengue fever in the community.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), a member of the flavivirus family, continues to pose a significant threat to populations worldwide, despite advances in technology. Nearly half of the global population is at risk of contracting the disease, ranging from mild dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). The precise mechanisms underlying the progression of DF to DHF and DSS remain unclear and the presence of various DENV serotypes exacerbates this situation. Urbanization and climate change are expected to affect dengue epidemiology, potentially increasing the frequency and intensity of outbreaks. This review aims to consolidate the current knowledge on the biological characteristics, pathogenesis and application of \"Omics\" based strategies for biomarker discovery for precision medicine. Although the precise mechanisms behind the progression from DF to DHF/DSS are not fully understood, hypotheses include immune over-activation, cytokine storms and antibody-dependent enhancement. Studies of comorbid conditions have shown no significant association with the development of DHF/DSS in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or other chronic diseases. Despite the far-reaching and intricate nature of dengue, the inconsistencies found in clinical pathophysiological studies underscore the need for additional research aimed at elucidating the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS and devising effective preventive measures. Identifying the differentially expressed genes, proteins and metabolites in DF, DHF and DSS may enrich our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis. Moreover, these differentially regulated pathways may serve as novel therapeutic targets. These biomarkers may also be utilized for disease surveillance and the evaluation of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for personalized treatment. Continuous research is essential to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms and progression of dengue fever and to formulate more effective prevention and control strategies.

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection in tropical and subtropical regions. High-grade fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and hemorrhagic manifestations are among its classic clinical features. Acute pancreatitis, however, remains an exceptionally rare complication. Awareness of this possibility is crucial, as early recognition and appropriate management can significantly improve patient outcomes. A previously healthy 44-year-old woman presented with a five-day history of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, high-grade fever (39°C), profuse sweating, and persistent greenish vomiting. Laboratory results revealed leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and markedly raised pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase). Dengue infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Imaging demonstrated minimal biliary sludge and mild pancreatic edema without evidence of gallstones or necrosis. She was managed supportively with intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antiemetics, and her condition improved rapidly. By the fourth day of hospitalization, she was discharged in stable condition with dietary advice. Acute pancreatitis complicating dengue is rarely reported, with proposed mechanisms involving direct viral invasion, immune-mediated damage, or ischemic injury from increased vascular permeability. This case underscores the need to consider pancreatitis in patients with dengue who experience severe or persistent abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is paramount to ensure early diagnosis, prompt supportive treatment, and favorable patient outcomes. This report highlights acute pancreatitis as a rare but important complication of dengue fever. Clinicians practicing in dengue-endemic areas should maintain vigilance for this diagnosis to facilitate early intervention. Strengthening physician awareness may influence guidelines and promote more timely identification of this unusual yet significant complication.",

        "abstract": "Lately, dengue fever has emerged as a public health concern in India. Overcrowding and climate change facilitated this vector-borne disease. Hence, we carried out this study to evaluate the incidence and outcome of dengue fever in monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon periods. Additionally, we correlated the age, platelet count, and duration of hospitalization of the participants. We conducted this cross-sectional study from June 2019 to September 2021 at Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar, India. We obtained data (age, gender, organs affected, platelet count, requirement of ICU, platelet transfusion, duration of hospitalization, and outcome) from their case records. R software version 4.1.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for data analysis. Seven hundred eighteen dengue patients were recruited for this study. Their mean age was 43.2 ± 11.8 years. There were 347 (48.3%) female participants. The mean platelet count of the study population was 132.1 ± 64.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. The dengue cases were the highest (561, 78.1%) during the monsoon period. Most participants had their kidneys (185, 25.8%) affected due to dengue fever. A total of 224 (31.2%) patients had bleeding manifestations, and 371 (51.7%) patients required ICU admission. The average duration of hospital stay was 11.0 ± 3.9 days. Of 718 patients, 693 (96.5%) were discharged and 25 (3.5%) died. The platelet count and duration of hospital stay were negatively correlated (r = -0.390, p < 0.001).  Dengue cases were maximum during the monsoon period. Younger individuals and men were more affected. Kidney involvement was the maximum, followed by lungs, liver, and heart. The duration of hospitalization and platelet count were inversely related.",

        "abstract": "Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are essential components of the innate immune system, demonstrating potent resistance to various enveloped viruses (such as influenza, West Nile, and dengue viruses) both in laboratory settings and in living organisms. Newcastle disease (ND), resulting from Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a severe avian viral ailment with notable economic impact due to its significant mortality and morbidity rates. On the basis of the efficient antiviral effects of IFITMs, an in-depth study of the role and mechanism of NDV inhibition by chicken IFITMs (chIFITMs) is highly important for the prevention and control of this disease. In this study, we found that transient overexpression of chIFITMs effectively inhibited NDV (NDV Lasota, NDV Na) infection in DF-1 cells, with the highest inhibition rates of up to 89% and 99%, respectively, and that there was no significant difference in the antiviral effects of chIFITM1/2/3, which were not significantly different. Virus‒cell binding-entry assays revealed that chIFITMs restrict the entry process of NDV. Deleting endogenous chIFITMs enhances viral replication (more than 1.27-fold) and diminishes chIFNL3-mediated antiviral effects. Concurrently, overexpressing chIFITMs influences the expression level of the W protein; and co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interaction between them. These findings suggest that the W protein could represent a novel target for the inhibition of NDV by chIFITMs. In summary, our results provide the initial comprehensive analysis of the antiviral effects of chIFITMs against NDV. This observation suggests that IFITMs are important barriers against zoonotic infections and important targets against viral invasion.",

        "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are the receptors of the innate immune system that play a vital role in initiating innate immune response. PRRs recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and activate immune cells through a signaling cascade. Due to this remarkable ability to recognize pathogenic microbes and elucidation of an immune response in a well-organized manner, PRR agonizts are likely to have great potential as vaccine adjuvants. Recent advancements in vaccine development raised concerns regarding the reduced immunogenicity of various vaccines, questioning the vaccine efficacy. In such cases, the use of an adjuvant becomes crucial. Understanding the structure and downstream signaling of PRRs will provide the possibility of developing a novel therapeutic approach. The rapidly evolving field of immunology and vaccinology, coupled with the increasing focus on PRRs in disease therapy, demands a comprehensive overview. In this review, we provide all-inclusive and contemporary gist on PRRs and the applications of their agonizts. We explored the potential of PRR agonizts as vaccine adjuvant. The current review integrates the basic understanding of PRRs and recent findings highlighting emerging trends of the same. Our review highlights that combining multiple PRR agonizts could offer synergistic benefits. This approach might prove advantageous and could potentially enhance vaccine efficacy and reduce the need for excessive immunogens. A comprehensive understanding of PRR subset, agonizts of PRR and their application in vaccine adjuvant. This knowledge will be significant in formulating vaccine approaches.",

        "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterium that mainly infects those who have previously been treated with antibiotics. We hypothesised that antibiotic treatment disrupts tryptophan metabolism, leading to increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection. Our results showed that mice receiving antibiotics exhibited intestinal dysbiosis with alterations in host tryptophan metabolism, a higher mortality rate and a higher bacterial load compared to eubiotic mice. In the lungs of the dysbiotic mice, there was an increase in IDO1 (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) activity and an accumulation of kynurenine after infection, and IDO1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were resistant to infection after induction of dysbiosis. Importantly, dysbiosis led to increased expression and activation of AHR (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor) in an IDO1-dependent manner. Blocking AHR activation in dysbiotic mice resulted in a lower bacterial load. Our data showed that increased AHR activation by kynurenine was associated with decreased phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by macrophages and neutrophils. In conclusion, our results indicate that dysbiosis resulting from prolonged antimicrobial treatment alters tryptophan metabolism, leading to activation of the IDO1-AHR axis and increasing susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, these data suggest that IDO1 or AHR are potential host targets for the prevention of opportunistic infections in patients undergoing antimicrobial therapy.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus infection is a growing global health concern, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue fever is commonly self-limiting, but sometimes, rare complications such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may occur, leading to fatal outcomes. HLH is a rare, hyperinflammatory syndrome marked by excessive immune activation, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. The relationship between dengue and HLH, particularly in adults, is not well understood, and early diagnosis and treatment remain critical for improving outcomes. A total of 15 adult patients with severe dengue were admitted to a tertiary care ICU setting in North India from September to December 2023. Out of 15 patients, seven were diagnosed with dengue-associated HLH based on H-Score, and bone marrow aspiration was done in six patients. In this retrospective case series, we reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment regimens, and outcomes. The median age of patients was 34 years, with female predominance. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score upon admission had a median value of 18, while the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at the time of HLH diagnosis had a median value of 11. The median day of illness at the time of HLH diagnosis was 23 days. The H-Score had a median value of 241 at the time of HLH diagnosis, supported by bone marrow aspiration, indicating a >99% probability of HLH. The mortality rate was 50%. Aggressive treatment with corticosteroid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or a combination of both, along with other supportive care, was given to the patients. Persistent fever, altered mental status, bicytopenia, elevated triglyceride levels, and markedly elevated serum ferritin levels are important to differentiate dengue-associated HLH from severe dengue. H-Score can assist in the early identification of HLH. Early recognition and timely initiation of HLH-targeted therapy are essential for improving survival rates.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is an endemic mosquito-borne viral infection in many tropical and subtropical regions. While its common manifestations include high-grade fever, rash, and myalgia, cardiac complications, particularly complete heart block, are rare but potentially life-threatening, underscoring the importance of vigilance. A 53-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with dizziness, weakness, and a five-day history of high-grade fever with chills. He lived in a dengue-endemic area and denied any recent travel. Physical examination revealed bradyarrhythmia (38-49 beats per minute) and hypotension (99/72 millimeters of mercury). Laboratory tests confirmed acute dengue infection. Despite supportive care and temporary pacing, the patient's intrinsic atrioventricular conduction showed no recovery, leading to persistent pacemaker dependence. On hospital day 17, a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted. He stabilized after the procedure and was discharged with close follow-up. The diagnosis of dengue was established using standard clinical criteria, confirmed by serologies for immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Comprehensive investigations excluded other bradyarrhythmia causes, such as Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, and myocarditis, supporting dengue as the sole etiology. This case highlights the rare but significant phenomenon of dengue-induced complete heart block, emphasizing that long-term pacemaker support may be necessary if conduction fails to recover. By adding to the limited data on dengue-associated advanced conduction disturbances, this case underscores the need for early recognition and multidisciplinary management to improve outcomes.",

However, there is currently no specific antiviral drug available for the treatment of DENV infection. DDX17, a member of the DExD/H-box helicase family, has been implicated in the replication processes of various viruses. Our research group discovered that during the early stages of dengue virus replication, DDX17 promotes viral replication and suppresses the activity of the IFN promoter. Furthermore, DDX17 binds to viral dsRNA and interacts with G3BP1, a component of stress granules (SGs), to inhibit SG formation, thereby enhancing viral replication. By elucidating the role of DDX17 in the early stages of dengue virus replication, our findings provide valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions during DENV infection, offering potential therapeutic perspectives.",

An X-coded gene on the chromosome regulates the immune system. The gene can control the immune system which causes females to have higher amounts of CD4+ T cells and less susceptibility to inflammation, making them not easily infected with viruses. In this paper, we construct and analyze the model of DHF transmission by classifying the sex of human populations. The model parameters are estimated based on DHF data in West Java Province, Indonesia using the least-squares method. The results of the model analysis obtained two equilibria, namely the disease-free equilibrium (locally and globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text]) and the endemic equilibrium in special cases (globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text]). We then extend an optimal control model for dengue transmission, which includes fumigation and prevention as the control variables. The Pontryagin maximum principle is utilized to find the optimal control conditions. Next, based on the ICER calculation, implementing control in the form of a combination of fumigation and prevention is the best strategy in eliminating DHF cases and cost efficiency. We also suggest that prevention efforts should be differentiated between male and female due to the significant impact in eliminating DHF sufferers.",

        "abstract": "Despite intensive efforts to develop different types of vaccines against dengue virus (DENV), safe and effective products are still lacking. Progress toward this goal has been especially hindered by a pathological phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In our previous study, we demonstrated that the N8 epitope within the envelope (E) protein of DENV2 plays a role in cross-reactivity and infection enhancement. Building on these findings, we designed mRNAs encoding structurally modified DENV2 E proteins (E<sub>1-394</sub>-N8R) to assess their antibody neutralization activity and infection-enhancing effects in comparison to wild-type E proteins (E<sub>1-394</sub>-WT). Mice were immunized using mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs), carrying either the modified (N8R-mRNA-LNP) or wild-type (WT-mRNA-LNP) DENV2 mRNA vaccines. Animals immunized with N8R-mRNA-LNP exhibited higher antibody titers and enhanced neutralizing activity, along with a reduced ADE burden compared to those immunized with WT-mRNA-LNP. Furthermore, sera from N8R-mRNA-LNP-immunized animals demonstrated superior protective effects in vivo compared to sera from WT-mRNA-LNP-immunized animals. Based on these findings, mRNA vaccines with enhancing epitope modification may allow for the generation of highly effective dengue tetravalent mRNA vaccines with low potential for ADE.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever remains a significant global public health issue, necessitating a collaborative One Health strategy for efficient management. This cross-sectional study evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of 516 healthcare professionals regarding dengue and its vectors. Most participants were young (82.6%), male (75.6%), and had MBBS qualifications (61.4%), predominantly employed in hospital settings (70.3%), and living in non-hotspot areas (53.3%). The research indicated that 65.1% of respondents possessed moderate knowledge about dengue, while 19.6% exhibited high knowledge and 15.3% showed low knowledge. Most participants (87.8%) correctly identified <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes as the main vector, with 52.7% recognizing stagnant clean water as their breeding habitat. Positive attitudes were noted among 72.5% of participants; 51% viewed dengue as a moderately serious threat, and 47.3% strongly agreed on the crucial role of healthcare professionals in prevention. Conversely, 48.9% pointed out insufficient preventive measures in their facilities. In terms of practices, 80.8% of participants regularly informed patients about prevention, and 79.1% recommended CBC tests for suspected cases. Protective measures such as repellents and mosquito nets were consistently utilized by 57.2%, whereas 41.1% reported infrequent use. Remarkably, 59.7% had never undergone formal training on dengue prevention and management, with only 23.6% receiving consistent training. Furthermore, while 50.8% indicated that their facilities had adequate resources for dengue treatment, 42.8% reported a lack of mosquito control activities. These findings underline significant gaps in training, resource availability, and preventive practices, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced capacity-building, resource allocation, and intersectoral collaboration within the One Health framework to combat the effects of dengue in the region.",

        "abstract": "Oropouche virus (OROV), a mosquito-borne pathogen primarily found in the Amazon basin, has attracted increasing attention due to its expanding geographical spread and recurrent outbreaks. First identified in 1955, OROV causes Oropouche fever, a febrile illness with clinical features that often overlap with those of other arboviral infections, posing significant diagnostic challenges. Arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, and yellow fever also circulate in the same regions of South and Central America, further complicating the clinical differentiation of OROV from these infections. The primary vector for OROV in urban areas is Culicoides paraensis midges, but the virus also maintains a sylvatic transmission cycle involving Aedes serratus and Coquillettidia venezuelensis mosquitoes, along with wild vertebrate reservoirs such as sloths, non-human primates, and birds. Moreover, in 2024, over 10,000 OROV cases were reported including in previously unaffected regions with Brazil recording 5,407 cases since 2015, while recent fatalities linked to severe coagulopathy, liver failure, and adverse pregnancy outcomes remain under investigation. Currently, no specific antiviral treatments are available for OROV, and the diagnostic tools are limited, highlighting the urgent need for improved management strategies. Given the increasing number of OROV cases, there is a clear need to strengthen surveillance efforts and accelerate the development of vaccines and therapeutic interventions. This review delves into the multi-faceted approach to control OROV, incorporating surveillance, antiviral therapy, and vaccine development to mitigate the impact of this emerging pathogen. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology and future potential antiviral candidates and challenges in current therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Aedes (Ae) aegypti is the primary mosquito vector responsible for transmitting the pathogens that cause Dengue fever and Dengue hemorrhagic fever. We have previously identified 31 kDa and 56 kDa immunogenic proteins from the salivary glands of Ae. aegypti. The 31 kDa fraction primarily contains D7 protein, which has immunomodulatory properties that influence the host's immune response. This study aims to analyze the humoral (IgG) and specific immune responses (represented by IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokines) in a mouse model (Mus musculus) after exposure to the 31 kDa immunogenic protein from the salivary glands of Ae. aegypti. The mice were divided into three treatment groups: group A (elution buffer control), group B (adjuvant control), and group C (31 kDa 0.2 µg/µL + adjuvant). Injections were administered bi-weekly over six weeks. IgG levels and cytokine (IFN-γ and IL-4) concentrations were analyzed using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. The results showed that repeated exposure to the 31 kDa immunogenic protein elevated the humoral immune response (IgG) and modulated the host's immune response from the Th1 subset to the Th2 subset, characterized by a decrease in IFN-γ and an increase in IL-4 cytokine concentrations. This modulation is important in developing the host immune response against the transmitted dengue pathogen. This finding confirms that the 31 kDa protein is both immunogenic and immunomodulatory, inducing and modulating the immune response in mice. This study recognizes the 31 kDa protein from the salivary gland of Ae. aegypti as a potential target for the development of a vector-based dengue transmission-blocking vaccine.",

        "title": "Dual level dengue diagnosis using lightweight multilayer perceptron with XAI in fog computing environment and rule based inference.",
        "abstract": "Over the last fifty years, arboviral infections have made an unparalleled contribution to worldwide disability and morbidity. Globalization, population growth, and unplanned urbanization are the main causes. Dengue is regarded as the most significant arboviral illness among them due to its prior dominance in growth. The dengue virus is mostly transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. The human body infected with dengue virus (DenV) will experience certain adverse impacts. To keep the disease under control, some of the preventative measures implemented by different countries need to be updated. Manual diagnosis is typically employed, and the accuracy of the diagnosis is assessed based on the experience of the healthcare professionals. Because there are so many patients during an outbreak, incompetence also happens. Remote monitoring and massive data storage are required. Though cloud computing is one of the solutions, it has a significant latency, despite its potential for remote monitoring and storage. Also, the diagnosis should be made as quickly as possible. The aforementioned issue has been resolved with fog computing, which significantly lowers latency and facilitates remote diagnosis. This study especially focuses on incorporating machine learning and deep learning techniques in the fog computing environment to leverage the overall diagnostic efficiency of dengue by promoting remote diagnosis and speedy treatment. A dual-level dengue diagnosis framework has been proposed in this study. Level-1 diagnosis is based on the symptoms of the patients, which are sent from the edge layer to the fog. Level-1 diagnosis is done in the fog to manage the storage and computation issues. An optimized and normalized lightweight MLP has been proposed along with preprocessing and feature reduction techniques in this study for the Level-1 Diagnosis in the fog computing environment. Pearson Correlation coefficient has been calculated between independent and target features to aid in feature reduction. Techniques like K-fold cross-validation, batch normalization, and grid search optimization have been used for increasing the efficiency. A variety of metrics have been computed to assess the effectiveness of the model. Since the suggested model is a \"black box,\" explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools such as SHAP and LIME have been used to help explain its predictions. An exceptional accuracy of 92% is attained with the small dataset using the proposed model. The fog layer sends the list of probable cases to the edge layer. Also, a precision of 100% and an F1 score of 90% have been attained using the proposed model. The list of probable cases is sent from the fog layer to the edge layer, where Level-2 Diagnosis is carried out. Level-2 diagnosis is based on the serological test report of the suspected patients of the Level-1 diagnosis. Level-2 diagnosis is done at the edge using the rule-based inference method. This study incorporates dual-level diagnosis, which is not seen in recent studies. The majority of investigations end at Level 1. However, this study minimizes incorrect treatment and fatality rates by using dual-level diagnosis and assisting in confirmation of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Secreted viral proteins are crucial in virus-host interactions, as they modify the host microenvironment to promote infection. These secreted proteins could alter immune and inflammatory responses, allowing viruses to evade defense mechanisms such as cytotoxic T cell activation and antibody neutralization. Some secreted proteins mimic host molecules to suppress antiviral responses, making them valuable targets for antivirals and diagnostics. Notable examples include BARF1 from Epstein-Barr virus, associated with gastric cancer; vIL-10 from Epstein-Barr virus, which regulates immune responses and contributes to autoimmune diseases; NS1 from dengue virus, associated with vascular permeability and early diagnosis; and NSP4 from rotavirus as an enterotoxin, among others. The study of these proteins improves our understanding of viral pathogenesis and helps to develop innovative treatments for infectious and non-infectious diseases, taking advantage of the evolutionary adaptations of viruses. This review explores their impact on the infection cycle, disease progression, and key processes, such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cell signaling. Research on these proteins deepens our basic knowledge of virology and generates alternative methods for detecting biomarkers and creating more effective therapies, as well as implementing some emerging technologies, such as biosensors and plasmon resonance, for the diagnosis of viral diseases.",

        "title": "Unveiling <i>Wolbachia</i> transcriptomic signature in the arboviral vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.",
        "abstract": "The mosquito <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is the main vector of arboviral diseases such as dengue and imposes a global health burden. A promising control strategy is to infect <i>A. aegypti</i> populations with <i>Wolbachia</i>, a genus of intracellular bacteria capable of blocking arboviral infections. Enhancing and preserving the efficacy of this method will depend on a solid mechanistic knowledge of the <i>A. aegypti-Wolbachia</i> symbiosis. By identifying differences between <i>Wolbachia</i>-infected and uninfected <i>A. aegypti</i>, previous transcriptomic studies proposed a wide range of symbiotic interactions, but a systematic identification of consistent effects across datasets is still missing. To identify <i>A. aegypti</i> genes and functions consistently affected by <i>Wolbachia</i>, we performed differential expression and functional enrichment analysis on published transcriptomic datasets, followed by a meta-analysis of the obtained <i>p-values</i> using the maxP method. Six datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus, Sequence Read Archive and ArrayExpress (last searched in July 2024, considering lack of replication as the exclusion criteria). After discarding one dataset from <i>w</i>AlbB-infected cell line due to poor mapping to the <i>A. aegypti</i> genome, the data comprised adult female <i>A. aegypti</i> heads, muscles, carcasses, midguts and bodies, and Wolbachia strains wMel and wMelPop. Meta-analysis revealed 10 and 21 consistently down- and upregulated host genes, some of which have escaped the focus of previous research, including the consistently downregulated exonuclease <i>AAEL009650</i> which has a pro-dengue virus homolog in <i>Drosophila</i>. At the function level, we found consistent upregulation of electron transport chain (ETC), carbohydrate transport and serine-type peptidase activity and inhibition, and downregulation of DNA replication. ETC upregulation suggests an alternative mechanism for Wolbachia's induction of antiviral oxidative stress, previously attributed to dual- and NADPH-oxidases which here showed downregulation or no regulation. Through analysis of previously published datasets, this work identifies promising molecular and functional targets for future studies aimed at elucidating the most fundamental mechanisms of the <i>A. aegypti-Wolbachia</i> symbiosis.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever, a rapidly spreading global epidemic, ranks among the most frequently reported viral infections worldwide, typically presenting with systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and rash. Although generally linked to systemic issues, dengue infection can also lead to uncommon ocular complications, such as acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG), which poses a threat to sight. This review focuses on the alterations in the anterior chamber angle and the subsequent development of glaucoma after dengue infection. Prompt and precise diagnosis, aided by essential diagnostic tools like intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, gonioscopy, and advanced imaging methods, is essential for effective management. The initial treatment typically includes osmotic agents, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and topical glaucoma medications, with Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser iridotomy being the definitive treatment option. The review emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to assess ocular outcomes and prevent relapse. While AACG occurrence in dengue patients is rare, healthcare providers in endemic areas must stay alert for ocular symptoms in dengue patients presenting with vision problems. Preventing irreversible vision loss demands increased vigilance, early diagnosis, and timely treatment. Additionally, the review advocates for more clinical research and the creation of refined diagnostic protocols to tackle this rare but severe complication.",

Structure-based molecular docking of a natural MTase substrates library identified herbacetin (HC) and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as potential CHIKV nsP1 and DENV NS5 MTase inhibitors. Binding affinities and MTase inhibition were confirmed using purified proteins. The crystal structure of DENV 3 NS5 MTase and CAPE complex revealed CAPE binding at viral RNA capping sites. Interestingly, HC and CAPE depleted polyamines crucial for RNA virus replication and decreased viral titer with IC<sub>50</sub> values of ~ 13.44 and ~ 0.57 μm against CHIKV, and ~ 7.24 and ~ 1.01 μm against DENV 3, respectively. Polyamine addition did not reverse the antiviral effects, suggesting a dual inhibition mechanism. Impact statement This study reveals the antiviral potential of natural small molecules, Herbacetin (HC) and Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) against Dengue and Chikungunya viruses.

        "abstract": "Dengue fever remains a major public health threat in Indonesia, exacerbated by rising insecticide resistance in <i>Aedes aegypti.</i> Strategies relying on chemical insecticides, while initially effective, have led to widespread resistance in mosquito populations. This resistance is particularly pronounced in areas such as Java, where the extensive use of insecticides, including organophosphates and pyrethroids, has been documented. To address this challenge, one promising alternative is the utilization of biolarvicides derived from local Indonesian plant materials. Biolarvicides are environmentally friendly, safe, and have the potential to mitigate the adverse impacts associated with chemical insecticides. Numerous studies have explored the larvicidal properties of indigenous plants native to Indonesia, demonstrating their efficacy against <i>A. aegypti.</i> The aim of this study was to examine insecticide resistance in <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes across Indonesia, highlighting geographical variations and underexplored regions, and exploring plant- based biolarvicides as sustainable alternatives. Biolarvicides derived from native Indonesian plants could be eco-friendly alternative for dengue vector management.

        "abstract": "The rise in mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, exacerbated by the ever-expanding habitats of Aedes albopictus, poses a significant public health risk. Even marginal improvements in vector control efficacy can be crucial in mitigating these risks. In this study, we employed a metapopulation model to simulate Ae. albopictus population dynamics and dispersal, optimizing the timing and spatial allocation of larvicidal treatments. Simulations revealed that larvicide treatments are most effective when applied preventively, early in the mosquito season, particularly under conditions of lower-than-average cumulative rainfall and, to a minor extent, colder-than-average temperatures, as these conditions limit larvae proliferation. We found that breeding site characteristics, particularly surface area and maximum water holding capacity, are critical in determining optimal treatment allocation in scarce-resource scenarios. However, a cost-effectiveness trade-off exists, as larger breeding sites offer more substantial reductions in mosquito populations but also demand higher larvicide dosages. Spatial factors such as breeding site distribution had minimal impact on treatment efficacy, possibly due to the high mobility range of adult mosquitoes compared with the size of the study area. Our results highlight the superior efficiency of the optimized approach in comparison with routine vector control strategies, especially when resources are limited, offering a more effective use of larvicide in controlling mosquito populations. This study demonstrates that vector control strategies for Ae. albopictus can be significantly enhanced by considering climatic variables and breeding site characteristics in treatment planning. This research provides a framework for developing cost-effective and flexible mosquito control programs that can adapt to environmental conditions, potentially improving public health outcomes by reducing the transmission risk of mosquito-borne diseases.",

Despite decades of research since the discovery of the dengue virus, no specific antiviral treatments are available and strategies to reliably prevent severe disease remain limited. Direct-acting antivirals against dengue are under active investigation but have shown limited efficacy to date. An underappreciated Achille's heal of the virus is its dependence on host factors for infection and pathogenesis, each of which presents a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. We and others have demonstrated that dengue virus relies on multiple host kinases, some of which are already targeted by clinically approved inhibitors.

        "abstract": "Lee County Mosquito Control District (LCMCD) is an independent taxing district that works to protect human health and improve quality of life in Lee County, Florida, USA. With local dengue transmission in southern Florida, LCMCD prioritized the control of Aedes aegypti. Due to the cryptic larval habitats of Ae. aegypti and insecticide resistance, effective control using conventional methods is difficult. Thus, the sterile insect technique (SIT) program, using X-ray irradiated male mosquitoes, was created to target Ae. aegypti. The goal of this program was to suppress Ae. aegypti through establishing a robust SIT program and performing a pilot study in the field to assess the impacts of SIT releases. The SIT program at LCMCD released sterile male Ae. aegypti from 2020 to 2022 in Captiva Island, Florida. The SIT program works within a larger Integrated Mosquito Management (IMM) framework and is not a standalone tool. The SIT program consists of nine employees, one of which is dedicated to quality assurance. Quality assurance assessments are performed routinely and periodically. Due to widespread destruction throughout Captiva and Sanibel Islands from Hurricane Ian in September 2022, the SIT pilot in Captiva Island was concluded and moved to Fort Myers, Florida. During the pilot study on Captiva Island, various lessons were learned and this knowledge has been applied to efforts in Fort Myers. LCMCD has established a successful SIT program to suppress populations of Ae. aegypti. Through connections with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the University of Florida, LCMCD received guidance from experts in the field to help ensure the program's success. Stable funding through taxes levied specifically for mosquito control provided essential consistency, allowing the program to grow and evolve. Consistent trapping routines provided immense amounts of entomological data. Thoughtful and intentional community engagement was essential in ensuring acceptance of the SIT program in Lee County. Following the phased conditional approach suggested by IAEA, LCMCD has built an effective and resilient SIT program. The integration of the SIT as a tool of an area-wide mosquito control program is a feature that distinguishes LCMCD's SIT program from others.",

The 384 healthcare workers conducted across Somalia demonstrated 66.66% poor knowledge (16.2 ± 4.7), 70.9% positive attitudes (mean score 45.3 ± 4.2), and 61.6% poor practices (mean score 11.7 ± 4.7). Correlation analysis showed that knowledge showed a moderate correlation with practices (r = 0.49) and a weak correlation with attitudes (r = 0.30), while attitudes and practices demonstrated a weak correlation (r = 0.25). This study identified critical gaps in knowledge and practice regarding DF among healthcare workers in Somalia.

        "abstract": "Several arthropod-borne (arbo)-viruses have overlapping symptoms, insect vectors and geographical occurrence. With little known about the importance of arboviruses as cause of acute undifferentiated fever (AUF) in East and Central Africa (ECA), there is a clear need for a multiplex-PCR allowing for multi-pathogen surveillance. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR (RDCZ-multiplex) was developed and validated for the simultaneous detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), dengue virus 1-4 (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was added to the PCR as sample extraction control. Validation was conducted following the MIQE-guidelines using a panel of retrospective clinical samples and Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD, https://www.qcmd.org/en/) samples with the simplex-PCR as reference. These included samples from RVFV in animals (n = 19), DENV (n = 15), CHIKV (n = 11), ZIKV (n = 2) and YFV (n = 1, QCMD), and 14 negative endemic controls. Extractions and PCRs were done with commercially available kits. Some loss of sensitivity was observed at low target concentrations for RVFV, DENV1 and DENV4, when comparing the standard curves of simplex-PCRs with the multiplex-PCR. The limit of detection of the multiplex-PCR was 2064 copies/ml for CHIKV, 3587 copies/ml for DENV1, 30,249 copies/ml for ZIKV and 73 PFU/ml for RVFV. Specificity of the multiplex-PCRs was 100 %. For 12 out of 48 positive samples with high Cq values, RVFV (n = 7), CHIKV (n = 2), DENV1 (n = 2), YFV (n = 1), the multiplex-PCRs were negative. Although PCR sensitivity of the RDCZ-multiplex is slightly lower with low target concentrations, it offers a useful tool for molecular surveillance and clinical diagnosis for arboviruses for the ECA-region.",

        "abstract": "Inhibition of STAT2 degradation has emerged as a promising strategy for flaviviruses. The NS5 protein of the ZIKV and DENV-2 inhibits the IFN-Ⅰ antiviral response by degrading STAT2, thereby evading the host's immune defense. Therefore, the development of novel agents capable of inhibiting STAT2 degradation via targeted modulation constitutes a pivotal therapeutic strategy for controlling viral infections. In this study, HEK293T<sup>STAT2-mCherry-Flag/rtTA-HA-NS5</sup> cells were used as reporter tools. Through screening the ZINC drug-like database, the lead compound ZINC000060514583 was obtained and structurally modified to yield the optimized compounds SMU-1k, which significantly inhibited the degradation of STAT2. We verified its activity against ZIKV and DENV-2 through Western blotting, RT-qPCR, plaque formation assays, and immunofluorescence experiments. The results showed that SMU-1k significantly inhibited the expression of NS5 protein and restored the level of STAT2 to a certain extent. Additionally, the EC<sub>50</sub> values of SMU-1k against ZIKV and DENV-2 were 7.08 ± 0.06 μM and 3.96 ± 0.11 μM, respectively, which helped to alleviate the cytopathic effects caused by ZIKV and DENV-2 infection. Here, we have successfully characterized a novel small-molecule compound that selectively blocks STAT2 proteasomal degradation while exhibiting potent dual antiviral efficacy against both ZIKV and DENV-2, thereby revealing a promising lead candidate for developing broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever, primarily transmitted by <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, remains a critical public health challenge in Indonesia, with periodic outbreaks exacerbated by widespread insecticide resistance. Resistance to organophosphates and pyrethroids limits vector control efforts, necessitating updated insights into resistance patterns and their genetic underpinnings. This study aimed to evaluate and map insecticide resistance and associated genetic mutations in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> across Indonesia, providing actionable insights for vector management strategies. This systematic review adheres to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, encompassing studies from 2010 to 2023 identified through PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, and Embase. Keywords targeted <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, insecticide classes, resistance, and Indonesian regions. Inclusion criteria focused on field-derived populations subjected to World Health Organization bioassays for organophosphates (malathion and temefos) and pyrethroids (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, etc.), alongside analyses of knockdown resistance (<i>kdr</i>) mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (<i>Vgsc</i>) and acetylcholinesterase-1 (<i>Ace-1</i>) genes. Data synthesis included resistance trends, spatial mapping, and allele frequency analyses. Resistance to malathion and temefos is extensive, with sporadic susceptibility in specific districts. Pyrethroid resistance is pervasive, particularly for cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, with deltamethrin exhibiting isolated susceptibility. Genetic analyses reveal <i>Vgsc</i> mutations (V1016G, F1534C) as key drivers of pyrethroid resistance, while <i>Ace-1</i> mutations remain unreported. The evolution of resistance correlates with indiscriminate insecticide usage, urbanization, and climatic factors. The growing prevalence of insecticide resistance in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> underscores the urgent need for integrated vector management strategies. These should incorporate insecticide rotation, resistance monitoring, and community engagement to mitigate resistance and support sustainable dengue control efforts in Indonesia.",

        "abstract": "The decline in malaria cases in Cambodia has led to a relative increase in non-malarial febrile illness. In rural Cambodia, village malaria workers (VMWs) provide early diagnosis and treatment for malaria, but their role and relevance are diminishing as malaria cases decline. Expanding VMW roles would ensure continued utilisation of their services until malaria elimination is achieved and strengthen community health services. A mixed methods operational research study was implemented to evaluate the use of two combination-RDTs (combo-RDTs) as an expansion of the VMW role, enabling VMWs in Cambodia to test for diseases other than malaria for the first time. VMWs in 78 villages in Battambang and Pailin Provinces were trained and provided with either a Malaria/CRP Duo or Dengue Duo RDT to assess febrile patients. Data were collected on VMW consultations, and combo-RDT usage and results. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and competency assessments of combo-RDT usage were conducted with VMWs. The main objectives were to determine whether VMWs could perform these combo-RDTs correctly and follow management algorithms, and whether deployment had an impact on VMW consultation rates. Perspectives concerning role expansion and the feasibility of conducting additional tests were also explored. Between June 2022, and May 2023, a total of 2,425 febrile patients were assessed with either a Malaria/CRP Duo or Dengue Duo RDT. Active dengue infection (NS1- and/or IgM-positive) was identified in 1.2% (11/915) of patients. Positive CRP results (> 20 mg/L) were found for 3.2% (48/1,510) of patients. Following deployment, there was an immediate mean increase of 4.4 VMW consultations per month, from 9.0 to 13.4 (p < 0.01). Competency assessments revealed that some VMWs had difficulty performing the Dengue Duo RDT, particularly in collecting the correct blood volume. This limitation may have led to false-negative dengue NS1 results. VMWs and community members were keen to broaden the skills and responsibilities of VMWs. Deploying combo-RDTs to VMWs led to a higher utilization of their services. Difficulties performing some aspects of the Dengue Duo RDT, low positivity rates, and a lack of actionable outcomes within the existing context of VMW services suggest that alternative interventions may be better suited for VMW role expansion at this time. Overall, VMWs and community members were receptive to the expansion of the VMW role for a wider range of diseases other than malaria.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the factors influencing Dengue vaccine adoption in the Philippines, utilizing an integrated framework based on the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Trust-Confidence-Cooperation Framework (TCCF). Data were collected from 2863 respondents and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to explore the relationships between key constructs such as government trust, self-efficacy, observational learning, confidence in vaccines, accessibility, cooperation, and outcome expectations. Ethical clearance was obtained for the study to ensure compliance with research ethics guidelines. The findings reveal that government trust, self-efficacy, observational learning, and accessibility significantly enhance cooperation and vaccine uptake, highlighting their critical roles in shaping vaccination behaviors. However, confidence in vaccines and social influence showed limited direct effects on outcome expectations and self-efficacy, suggesting the need for targeted strategies to bridge these gaps. The study emphasizes the importance of transparent government communication, leveraging trusted role models, and improving accessibility to increase vaccine adoption. While the study offers valuable insights, it acknowledges limitations in sample diversity and the exclusion of certain mediating factors, such as cultural and socio-economic variables. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of vaccine adoption and provide practical recommendations for designing effective public health interventions to address vaccine hesitancy and improve adoption rates.",

        "abstract": "Flaviviruses, including Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), remain major global health threats, and currently, there are no widely available vaccines for humans. The fusion loop region of the flavivirus envelope protein plays a crucial role in eliciting neutralizing antibodies and providing protection against secondary DENV infections. However, these antibodies often exhibit dual functionalities, with both neutralizing and enhancing activities, posing a challenge for vaccine development. In this study, we focused on optimizing the fusion loop epitope as the primary immunogen and incorporated the adjacent bc loop which we had reported previously as a complementary element, aiming to enhance the immunogen capable of robust neutralization and protection without inducing the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This newly designed immunogen was named as muBCFL which comprises sequences spanning from amino acid 69 to 116 primarily on DENV-2 envelope protein, along with four specific mutations (T76A, W101A, G106Q, and L107D). The synthesized muBCFL peptide elicited neutralizing antibodies against all four DENV serotypes, ZIKV, and JEV, with particularly strong neutralization activity against DENV-2, ZIKV, and JEV. Besides, compared to pre-immune sera, muBCFL-immune sera significantly reduced viremia levels in DENV- or ZIKV-infected AG129 mice and increased the survival rates of JEV-challenged ICR mice. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo ADE assays validated that muBCFL-immune sera did not induce ADE compared with the control 4G2 monoclonal antibody. These findings indicated that the muBCFL sequence holds great potential as a safe and effective immunogen for developing a flavivirus vaccine in the future.",

        "abstract": "Background Early identification of pediatric patients at high risk for dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is crucial to enable timely and appropriate clinical interventions. However, the application of machine learning (ML) models for predicting DSS risk remains underexplored. Objective This study aimed to develop and validate a ML-based nomogram for predicting DSS risk in pediatric patients with dengue fever, supporting clinical decision-making. Methods A prospective study was conducted on 230 children with dengue fever admitted to Can Tho Children's Hospital, Vietnam, from January 2020 to December 2022. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed using R software (version 4.4.1). Six ML algorithms were used to develop risk prediction models for hospitalized pediatric patients with dengue, and their predictive performances were compared. The best-performing model was used to construct a nomogram for DSS prediction. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and the calibration of the nomogram was assessed using a calibration curve. Results Among the 230 dengue patients enrolled, 124 (53.9%) were male, with a median age of 11 years (IQR: 8-13 years). The cohort was randomly divided into a training set (n = 173) and a test set (n = 57). Five key predictors selected for the nomogram were albumin, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and platelet count. In the test set, the AUROC for the six models ranged from 0.888 to 0.945. The random forest model demonstrated the best performance, with an AUROC of 0.945 (95% CI: 0.886-1.000), an accuracy of 0.951 (95% CI: 0.865-0.989), sensitivity of 0.894, specificity of 0.976, and a Kappa score of 0.884. Conclusions ML-based models can be established and potentially help identify hospitalized pediatric patients with dengue who are at high risk of progressing to DSS. The proposed nomogram may be a valuable tool for predicting DSS in clinical practice.",

Small antibodies (sAb) such as single-chain variable fragments (scFv) and single-domain antibodies (sdAb) against dengue and chikungunya viral proteins have been applied to neutralize viral infections in mouse and human primary cells. Here, we explored the use of these protective sAbs for the development of transgenic mosquito-based arboviral disease control strategies. We expressed scFv against orthoflaviviruses and sdAb against alphaviruses using a dual bloodmeal-inducible midgut-specific promoter, AeG12, achieving strong expression of both orthoflavivirus scFv and alphavirus sdAb in Aedes aegypti midguts. The presence of sAbs significantly reduced mosquito midgut infections with multiple orthoflaviviruses and alphaviruses, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and Mayaro viruses, thus compromising viral transmission by the transgenic mosquitoes. We further augmented virus-blocking by co-expression of sAbs and the siRNA pathway factor Dcr2, proving the utility of combinatorial virus targeting by mechanistically independent antiviral effectors. Our results demonstrate the potential of expressing broadly neutralizing sAbs in mosquitoes, particularly in combination with enhancing endogenous antiviral pathways, as a promising strategy to reduce arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes.",

        "abstract": "Reliance on traditional vector control methods, such as insecticides and \"clean up\" source reduction efforts for reducing mosquito breeding sites, has proven increasingly ineffective and costly in the battle against dengue. The Wolbachia-based mosquito replacement strategy, which replaces wild mosquitoes with mosquitoes trans-infected with Wolbachia bacteria, preventing up to 77% dengue transmission, represents an advancement in prevention. Integrating this approach into current routine dengue control efforts could reduce dengue incidence. However, challenges such as implementation costs, the need for country ownership, alignment of released mosquitoes with local mosquito populations, increased education and sensitization for government authorities and the public on the benefits of Wolbachia, identifying international funding partners, and recognizing areas where the strategy may be less effective due to environmental or socio-political factors must be addressed. Furthermore, Wolbachia replacement must focus in areas with high population density and high dengue incidence because it is not feasible to cover all endemic areas. Establishing robust surveillance systems to monitor efficacy against different dengue serotypes is also critical. Despite these challenges, the Wolbachia strategy is the one of the most promising developments in dengue prevention to date. By complementing this approach with effective vaccines, we have the unprecedented opportunity to significantly reduce dengue.",

We analyzed pre-infection plasma samples from children in our Nicaraguan cohort study who later developed either dengue fever (DF; n = 31) or dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS; n = 33) upon secondary heterotypic DENV infection. Various antibody properties, notably antibody-dependent complement deposition, correlated with protection against DHF/DSS. Interestingly, this association was strongest when using recombinant ZIKV antigens despite participants being ZIKV naive. Additionally, complement-mediated virion lysis (virolysis) with ZIKV virions was strongly associated with protection, a finding replicated in an independent sample set. ZIKV virolysis emerged as the only antibody property linked to reduced risk of DHF/DSS and severe symptoms such as thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage. These results suggest that ZIKV-cross-reactive anti-DENV antibodies that mediate complement-dependent virolysis may lower the risk of severe disease, informing the development of effective dengue vaccines and therapeutics.",

Black and white ovitraps were designed using 0.95 L plastic containers, paper towel, and plastic film. Three treatments were tested: water, water with birdseed, and water with birdseed plus diflubenzuron, for 15 weeks, in Monteria and Ayapel, Colombia. The data were analyzed with Python<sup>®</sup>, using ChatGPT. Manual egg counts were compared with counts done by an artificial intelligence (AI) system, and ovicidal methods were evaluated in the laboratory. Ovitraps with birdseed, costing less than USD $0.20, achieved test positivity rates (TPR) above 78.0%, and captured an average of 385 eggs per trap per week. Over the entire study, approximately 100 ovitraps eliminated 67 868 eggs and prevented the development of 48 458 adults (47.2% female). Black traps (TPR: 54.47%) outperformed white traps (TPR: 41.24%), although no significant differences were due to color. Treatment with birdseed and diflubenzuron was the most effective. Manual egg counts were more accurate than AI counts. In addition, the use of hot water (80-100 °C) achieved 100% ovicidal efficacy, outperforming diflubenzuron. The community showed a high level of acceptance and reported significant benefits through mosquito reduction. Handmade ovitraps with paper towel immersed weekly in hot water, are a cost-effective, accessible, environmentally friendly strategy that can be easily integrated into vector control programs in urban and rural areas endemic for arboviral diseases, minimizing the use of insecticides and reducing environmental impacts.",

        "abstract": "Introduction  Dengue fever remains a major public health challenge in endemic regions, leading to significant hospital admissions and resource utilization. This study aimed to analyze the clinical course of dengue, focusing on fever trends, thrombocytopenia, hematocrit fluctuations, and bleeding manifestations. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted on 135 confirmed dengue patients admitted to Alkhidmat Raazi Hospital, a secondary care hospital in Rawalpindi, which is a dengue-endemic region. Clinical and laboratory data, including fever patterns, platelet counts, hematocrit levels, and total leukocyte count trends, were recorded over the course of the illness. Patient outcomes and symptomatology were analyzed to determine the necessity of hospitalization. Results Among 135 patients, 118 (87.4%) had uncomplicated dengue fever, while 12 (8.9%) developed dengue hemorrhagic fever. Despite all patients experiencing thrombocytopenia at some stage, 19 (14.1%) had platelet counts below 20,000/µL without any bleeding. Fever trends followed a biphasic pattern, with resolution observed in 101 (74.5%) patients by day 10. A total of 38 (28.1%) patients remained afebrile for over 72 hours despite a declining platelet count, indicating fever resolution independent of thrombocytopenia. The median length of hospital stay was three days (range: 1-10 days), with 107 (79.3%) patients having no comorbidities. Bleeding manifestations were seen in 22 (16.3%) patients, with nasal bleeding in eight (36.3%) and gum bleeding in six (27.2%) patients. Conclusion This study reinforces the idea that hospital admissions for dengue should not be based solely on platelet counts. Structured outpatient monitoring could help reduce unnecessary admissions, optimizing healthcare resources. Future studies should explore home-based care models to improve dengue management.",
