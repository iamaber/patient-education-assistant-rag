        "abstract": "Insecticide resistance in disease-transmitting arthropods of agricultural, veterinary, and public health significance poses a significant threat to vector control programs worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that blood-feeding arthropod vectors experience high mortality when ingesting blood containing inhibitors of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), the second enzyme in tyrosine metabolism. This study investigated the mosquitocidal efficacy of HPPD inhibitors from the β-triketone class of herbicides against both susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of three major disease vector species, including mosquitoes that transmit historical diseases such as malaria, reemerging infections such as dengue and Zika, and emerging viral threats such as Oropouche and Usutu viruses. Four HPPD inhibitors (nitisinone, mesotrione, sulcotrione, and tembotrione) were screened using glass plate tarsal bioassays at 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> against bloodfed Anopheles gambiae s.s. Kisumu. Nitisinone was selected for evaluation against susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains of An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu, An. gambiae s.l. Tiassalé 13, An. coluzzii VK7 2014, Culex quinquefasciatus Muhezha, and Aedes aegypti New Orleans. Mosquitocidal activity was assessed using glass plate tarsal contact bioassays, topical application assays (0.0001% to 1% w/v), and modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassays (0-30 μg per bottle). Female mosquitoes aged 3-5 days were bloodfed within 1 h before exposure. Mortality was recorded at 30 min and 24, 48, and 72 h post-exposure under controlled conditions. A total of 3 biological replicates of 30 mosquitoes per treatment were used. Only nitisinone, and not mesotrione, sulcotrione, or tembotrione, exhibited significant mosquitocidal activity when bloodfed mosquitoes were exposed to treated surfaces. No significant differences in susceptibility to nitisinone were observed between insecticide-susceptible An. gambiae and strains harboring multiple insecticide-resistance mechanisms. The compound demonstrated consistent efficacy across all three mosquito species tested, indicating broad-spectrum activity against major disease vectors. This study demonstrates that nitisinone exhibits a novel mode of action distinct from current Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) classifications by specifically targeting blood digestion processes. Its efficacy against resistant strains and potential for integration into existing vector control interventions, such as treated bednets and indoor residual spraying, highlight nitisinone as a promising candidate for expanding strategies against malaria, dengue, Zika, and other emerging viral diseases.",

        "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes debilitating joint pain and fever with limited treatment options. Cinnamic acid, known for its broad-spectrum biological activities, and its derivatives were evaluated for their potential antiviral effects against CHIKV. In vitro experiments assessed the cytotoxicity of cinnamic acid and its derivatives and their efficacy in inhibiting CHIKV under different treatment settings. Additionally, molecular docking of the effective compounds with CHIKV proteins was performed to determine the probable targets. The results indicated that the derivative CATD-3, a 3,6-(substituted phenyl)-(1,2,4) triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazole compound, showed antiviral activity under post-infection treatment conditions in Vero CCL-81 cells. The dose-dependent studies revealed that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 11.49 µM and the selectivity index of CATD-3 was 13.39. The antiviral activity of CATD-3 was also observed in HeLa cells. In-silico studies revealed that the CATD-3 binds multiple non-structural proteins (nsP) i.e., nsP1, nsP2, and nsP4 of the virus with good binding energies and forming strong interactions with conserved residues on nsP1 methyl transferase (Val 129, Tyr 130, Ala 131) and nsP2 helicase (Met 91, Met 289, and Thr 261) and critical residues of the nsP4 RdRp (Arg331 and Asp 350). The combined in vitro and in silico studies underscores the therapeutic potential of cinnamic acid derivative, CATD-3, as a promising antiviral candidate against CHIKV.",

        "abstract": "Background Dengue has emerged as the most common arboviral infection in India and worldwide. Dengue presents with a varied clinical spectrum in different age groups. The changing epidemiology and presentation are a challenge for early diagnosis and management. This prospective observational study aimed to determine the epidemiological profile of hospitalized dengue-positive children aged 0-14 years and correlate their clinical and hematological profiles. Methodology One hundred and five children with laboratory-confirmed dengue were enrolled in this study over a six-month study period. They were categorized into severe and non-severe dengue according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Detailed clinical examination and laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and imaging (chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound), were performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Results Out of the total 105 cases, 90 children (85.7%) had non-severe dengue and only 15 (14.3%) had severe dengue. The mean age of children was 92.02 months, with a male predominance (72, 68.6%). The most commonly identified symptoms were fever (105, 100%), vomiting (47, 44.76%), and abdominal pain (46, 43.81%). It was found that although thrombocytopenia was seen in 79 children (75.2%), it was not significantly associated with the severity of the disease (<i>P</i> = 0.2364). The study found a high recovery rate (101, 96.3%) with a mortality of 3 patients (2.8%) in severe cases. Elevated serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels (<i>P</i> = 0.0025), pleural effusion on chest X-ray (<i>P</i> = 0.000452), abdominal pain (<i>P</i> = 0.0041), and a positive tourniquet test (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) were found to be significantly associated with severe dengue. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were both found to be positive more frequently in severe cases compared to non-severe cases (<i>P</i> = 0.0361). Conclusions This study observed a high rate of recovery and low mortality, owing to the timely management. A possible shift in the seasonal distribution of dengue was observed, with many cases occurring in the winter season. While thrombocytopenia was prevalent, it was not found to be significantly associated with disease severity or bleeding. On the other hand, elevated liver enzymes, pleural effusion, abdominal pain, and a positive tourniquet test were found to be more strongly associated with severe dengue. They may serve as valuable early clinical indicators for the severity of the disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dengue is a virus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, with rare cases of vertical transmission occurring through infected mothers. Acute infection can be identified by molecular viral testing or by detecting dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and elevated serum IgM. This report describes the case of a 4-day-old male neonate with fever, rash, and jaundice due to vertical transmission of maternal dengue virus infection, confirmed by NS1 detection. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 4-day-old male neonate admitted with high fever, rash, and jaundice. Initial laboratory investigations showed thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of systemic inflammation. The mother and infant both tested positive for dengue NS1 antigen, confirming vertical transmission. The neonate received supportive management in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), including intravenous fluids and platelet transfusions. He gradually recovered without complications and was discharged in stable condition. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the importance of considering congenital dengue in neonates born to mothers with peripartum dengue infection. NS1 antigen testing can aid early diagnosis, even before seroconversion occurs. Prompt supportive care, especially monitoring and treating thrombocytopenia, is essential for a favorable outcome. Increased awareness and standardized management guidelines are needed to improve neonatal care in similar cases.",

Despite numerous research initiatives aimed at developing effective antiviral therapy, no clinically proven drug or vaccine has been identified to combat all four genetically diverse serotypes of DENV. Therefore, comparative analysis of repurposed drugs and phytocompounds against all DENV serotypes is critical in the search for an effective long-term solution to this menacing disease. 93 phytocompounds and 15 drugs were shortlisted from the literature and screened using DataWarrior 5.5.0, from which 10 phytocompounds and 10 drugs were selected for further analysis. Molecular docking was performed by using AutoDockVina tool. Toxicity and drug likeness activity of standard drugs and phytoconstituents was done by using online servers. The current study showed that among all the selected phytoconstituents, lupiwighteone showed the best binding energy, favorable pharmacokinetics and no toxicity with all the selected serotypes of DENV. The MD simulation result supported the stability of lupiwighteone in complexes with NS3, NS5 and E-Protein. This study identifies lupiwighteone as a promising antiviral candidate with favorable drug-like properties against DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 serotypes. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo study is required for the validation of antiviral activity of Lupiwighteone against dengue virus.",

DENV remains a global health concern, with increasing cases due to climate change, urbanization, and mosquito adaptation. The structural biology of DENV, including its envelope (E), membrane (M), capsid (C) proteins, and RNA genome, plays a critical role in transmission and infectivity. The transmission cycle begins when mosquitoes ingest the virus from an infected human and later transmit it to others after viral replication within their salivary glands. Structural adaptations occur both in the mosquito host and human cells, enhancing viral stability and infectivity. Host-virus interactions, such as immune evasion and cellular entry mechanisms, further complicate disease progression. This review highlights the impact of structural changes on viral replication, pathogenesis, and resistance, while emphasizing recent research advancements and future challenges. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutics and controlling DENV spread.",

        "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea, caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is one of the most devastating diseases in the global pig industry due to its high mortality rate in piglets. The host factors required for PEDV replication, including receptors, remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a porcine membrane-protein-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (PigMpCKO) library and performed two rounds of PEDV infection. Ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), the known receptor of dengue virus, was found to be a potent host factor. Moreover, our research revealed that RPSA is involved in the replication stage of PEDV and not in the entry stage. Inhibitor and activator experiments demonstrated that knockout (KO) of RPSA downregulates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to impair PEDV infection. Additionally, RNA sequencing data indicated that cellular lipid biosynthesis and lipid transport processes were significantly inhibited in the absence of RPSA during PEDV infection. Mechanistic studies revealed that the reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, resulting from RPSA KO, was partially mediated by the ERK1/2 pathway, leading to impaired lipid accumulation during PEDV replication. Interestingly, RPSA KO also significantly downregulated the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN) and inhibited infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), both of which belong to the swine enteric coronavirus group. In summary, our results establish RPSA as a novel host factor that is critical for coronavirus replication. This provides new insights into the mechanisms of virus-host interactions and paves the way for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. Swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs) cause severe economic losses to the global swine industry and pose a potential threat to public health. Identification of receptors required for PEDV infection could develop novel targets for drug therapy and disease-resistant breeding. We conducted a CRISPR/Cas9 screen targeting membrane proteins in porcine kidney cells infected with PEDV to identify possible receptors and discovered numerous novel candidate host factors. Considering RPSA's known role as a receptor for multiple viruses, we focused on investigating its potential in coronavirus infection. Our results revealed that RPSA does not contribute to the entry stage but to the replication stage of coronavirus infection. We first reported the role that RPSA plays in the regulation of APN expression and lipid metabolism. RPSA is essential for PEDV and other SeCoVs replication, providing a novel insight into the search for the receptor of PEDV and identifying potential therapeutic targets for coronaviruses.",

        "abstract": "The dramatic surge in dengue cases in early 2024, endangering half the global population, urgently necessitates faster diagnostic methods. Nanotechnology-enabled optical biosensors offer a promising avenue, leveraging nanomaterial properties for highly sensitive detection of dengue virus (DENV), potentially surpassing conventional techniques in terms of simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness. This systematic review analyzes recent advancements in these biosensors for DENV diagnosis. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases (2010-June 1, 2025; OSF: https://osf.io/3gmey/). The methodological quality of the 98 included studies was assessed using a modified CASP checklist. Diverse nanotechnology-based optical biosensors were identified. SPR (36.7%) was the most common transducer, followed by fluorescence (24.5%), colorimetry (15.3%), and SERS (8.2%). Gold-based nanomaterials (35.7%) were most frequently employed, with silver nanomaterials (15.3%), quantum dots (15.3%), and graphene-based materials (15.3%) also showing promise. DENV NS1 protein was the primary target analyte (21.4%). Importantly, almost half of the studies (44.9%) used clinically relevant human samples. While many optical biosensors show promise, challenges hinder their demonstration of the true potential for point-of-care use in their current format; however, they offer high specificity and faster results, laying a strong foundation for cost-effective clinical diagnostics. Nanotechnology-driven optical biosensors offer a transformative approach for DENV detection. Advances in computational design and green synthesis of novel nanomaterials are key to addressing stability and field-deployment challenges. These innovations are crucial for developing robust, sensitive, and user-friendly tools to manage dengue and improve patient outcomes globally.",

Their compositions are versatile, depending on their structures, including the number of rings in the polyphenol composition. Based on these attributes, polyphenols can be classified as flavanols, anthocyanins, flavones, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans. Polyphenols mainly possess inhibition of viral replication, interference with viral protein synthesis, and modulation of immune responses, providing significant antiviral effects against several viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, and influenza. They are crucial for medical compounds in diverse, versatile treatments, namely in diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative problems. Plants are the primary source of bioactive molecules, which are valued for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities. Especially, polyphenols are extracted as the most abundant bioactive compounds of plants. Moreover, viral infections are one of the major factors in illnesses and diseases, along with bacteria and fungi. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies report antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, Mayaro virus, dengue virus, herpesvirus, and influenza A virus, though clinical validation remains limited.

Laboratory studies assessing DENV inhibition by Wolbachia typically have not considered natural frequent mosquito blood feeding behavior. Here, we determine the impact of successive feeding on DENV-2 transmission by Ae. aegypti in the presence or absence of Wolbachia (wAlbB and wMelM strains). We show that successive feeding shortens the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) in wildtype (WT; without Wolbachia) and wAlbB mosquitoes through enhanced dissemination. Feeding empirical data into models showed that successive feeding increases the probability of WT and wAlbB mosquitoes surviving beyond the EIP. Importantly, the more epidemiologically relevant comparison of the odds of wAlbB mosquitoes surviving beyond the EIP relative to WT, reveals a larger impact of successive feeding on WT than wAlbB.

This study aims to analyse the spatiotemporal trends in the dengue burden among the elderly at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2021. Data on the dengue burden were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. This study described the incident cases, deaths, number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and corresponding rates for dengue among adults aged 70 years and above in 1990 and 2021 by sex, age, socio-demographic index (SDI), GBD region, and country. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to assess the temporal trends in dengue burden from 1990 to 2021. Between 1990 and 2021, the global incidence and DALYs rate of dengue among the elderly were lower than those in the entire population, whereas the mortality rate remained consistently higher. During this period, the incident cases, deaths, and DALYs for dengue worldwide increased by 372.69%, 439.15%, and 404.06%, respectively. In 2021, the global incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates of dengue among the elderly were 666.10, 1.28, and 23.92 per 100 000 population, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, the incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates of dengue showed an overall upward trend, with average annual percentage changes (AAPC) of 2.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-2.35), 2.58 (95% CI: 2.02-3.14), and 2.35 (95% CI: 2.20-2.69), respectively. Regionally, the highest incidence, mortality, and DALYs rates occurred in low-middle SDI regions. The highest dengue burden were primarily concentrated in Tropical Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The dengue burden among adults aged 70 years and above has significantly increased over the past three decades, with substantial variations across SDI levels, regions, and countries. Targeted measures, including developing clinical management guidelines, enhancing vaccine research, and conducting community education, are urgently needed to reduce the burden in this vulnerable population.",

Cases of acute abdomen have been reported in dengue fever and they include acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, and nonspecific peritonitis. This case report illustrates a case of acute appendicitis in dengue fever and aims to describe the relationship between both conditions. We report a case of a 25-year-old lady who presented with symptoms of dengue fever and was confirmed to have the disease. She was on treatment for dengue but subsequently developed acute appendicitis. She later underwent appendectomy and the appendix was confirmed to be inflamed both intraoperatively and histologically. Dengue virus can cause periappendiceal inflammation (periappendiceal fluid collection and mesenteric lymphadenopathy/adenitis) or acute appendicitis (which can progress to appendiceal perforation or appendicular mass formation). Periappendiceal inflammation presents with clinical features mimicking acute appendicitis but without appendicitis on ultrasonography or laparoscopy. Periappendiceal inflammation can also progress to appendicitis. For patients with dengue fever, diagnosis of acute appendicitis should not be based on clinical findings alone. Serial ultrasonography to confirm appendicitis is recommended. Conservative treatment with antibiotics should be the first line for acute appendicitis in dengue fever or periappendiceal inflammation in dengue. Surgical treatment is required in cases of appendiceal perforation or failure of conservative management.",

        "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of fucosylated IgG in plasma, specific IgGs with low core fucosylation sporadically emerge in response to virus infections and blood cell alloantigens. This low fucosylation of IgG is implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and dengue infections. In COVID-19, the presence of IgGs with low core fucosylation (afucosylated IgGs) targeting spike protein predicts disease progression to a severe form and actively mediates this progression. This study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 infection of megakaryocytes promotes the generation of pathogenic afucosylated anti-spike IgGs, leading to outcomes, such as pulmonary vascular thrombosis, acute lung injury, and mortality in FcγRIIa-transgenic mice. Platelets from mice injected with virus-infected human megakaryocytes express significant activation biomarkers, indicating a direct link between the immune response and platelet activation. Mice injected with virus-infected human megakaryocytes demonstrate an elevated rate of thrombus formation induced by FeCl<sub>3</sub> (4%) and a reduction in bleeding time, emphasizing the intricate interplay of viral infection, immune response, and hemostatic complications. Treatment with inhibitors targeting FcγRIIa, serotonin, or complement anaphylatoxins of mice injected with spike-expressing MKs successfully prevents observed platelet activation, thrombus formation, and bleeding abnormalities, offering potential therapeutic strategies for managing severe outcomes associated with afucosylated IgGs in COVID-19 and related disorders.",

This review focuses on elucidating the binding mechanisms between the capsid protein and the viral genome, as well as their potential applications as therapeutic targets. In particular, it summarizes the research progress on small-molecule drugs targeting the capsid-genome binding sites of dengue virus, HBV, and SARS-CoV-2.

        "abstract": "Co-infections of dengue serotypes and dengue with other flaviviruses pose substantial hurdles in disease diagnosis, treatment options, and disease management. The overlapping geographic distributions and mosquito vectors significantly enhance the probability of co-infections. Co-infections may result in more severe disease outcomes due to elevated viral loads, modulation of the immune response, and antibody enhancement. Cross-reactivity in serological assays and the likeness of clinical presentations add to the ongoing challenges in disease diagnosis. Molecular diagnostics such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are, therefore, employed for more specific disease diagnosis although requiring substantial resources. Despite the advancements, specific anti-flaviviral therapy is still limited, hence the urgency for further investigative research into various therapeutic approaches, including peptide inhibitors, host-targeted therapies, and RNA-based interventions. This review discusses the epidemiology, clinical ramifications, and diagnostic obstacles associated with flavivirus co-infections whilst assessing prospective strategies for better disease prevention, treatment, and management. Addressing these critical gaps is essential for disease mitigation whilst improving patient management especially in regions where co-circulation of flaviviruses is common and their diseases are highly endemic.",

        "abstract": "Emerging RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV) continue to pose major challenges to animal and public health due to their high mutation rates, wide host ranges, and immune evasion strategies. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of a marine bacterial extract derived from <i>Parerythrobacter</i> sp. M20A3S10 against IAV (H1N1; H3N2), influenza B virus (IBV), ZIKV, and DENV2. The extract demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral effects with favorable selectivity indices across multiple host-derived epithelial cell lines. Notably, post-infection treatment significantly suppressed viral replication, suggesting a host-modulating or replication-inhibiting mechanism. While the extract's active components have yet to be identified, bacteria from the <i>Erythrobacteraceae</i> family are known producers of bioactive metabolites with potential antiviral properties. These findings provide preliminary insight into the potential of marine-derived bacterial compounds in veterinary antiviral development and highlight the need for further characterization and in vivo validation.

        "abstract": "Dengue fever (DF) is caused by dengue virus (DENV) and is primarily spread through bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions, including Ethiopia. In the Afar region, DF is often misdiagnosed as malaria due to limited diagnostic capabilities. This study assessed the seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in healthcare facilities in the Afar region. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2022 to March 2023 in Amibara, Harunka and Awash Sebat city administration districts, involving febrile patients suspected of having malaria. Sociodemographic data, clinical features and blood samples were collected from participants after obtaining informed consent or assent. Following blood film examination for Plasmodium infection, sera were tested for anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were entered into Epi Data 3.1 and analyzed with Stata/SE 14.2. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 411 febrile patients (55.5% female, aged 5-80 years, with a mean age of 27.3 ± 13.8 years) participated in the study. Among those tested for anti-DENV antibodies, 101/410 (24.6%) were positive for anti-DENV IgM, indicating an acute DENV infection, and 142/367 (38.7%) were positive for anti-DENV IgG, revealing previous exposure. Only 44/411 (10.7%) were positive for Plasmodium infection, while 18/410 (4.4%) were co-infected with malaria and acute DENV infection and 18/367 (4.9%) were positive for both malaria and previous exposure to DENV. Those diagnosed with malaria were nearly 2.5 times more likely to test positive for acute DENV infection than those without malaria (AOR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.92). The odds of positivity for previous exposure were about two times higher in females than in males (AOR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.32-3.26) and in government and private sector employees than in pastoralists and agro-pastoralists (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.03-8.15), while patients aged 11-20 years had lower odds of previous exposure than those aged 5-10 years (AOR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.88). Experiencing muscle pain was associated with twice the odds of previous exposure (AOR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.04-3.49). The study reveals a high seroprevalence of DENV infection among febrile patients in the study area, highlighting the need for routine diagnosis and management of DF in this setting. Improving vector control, disease surveillance and public awareness would be crucial for combating DF and other mosquito-borne diseases.",

        "abstract": "Arboviral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika are public health concerns worldwide. Prevention and control of these diseases still depend on controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors. Sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT) are environmental friendly approaches that show promising impacts. In order to plan an implementation of SIT/IIT technology, background knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito vectors and their prevention and control, as well as acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the technology, in the targeted communities are needed. In this paper, we conducted questionnaire surveys on KAP and WTP in 400 sampled households in seven communities located in two districts in Bangkok, Thailand. Multivariate logistic regressions analysis was used to determine the association among knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Our findings indicated that participants had high knowledge on dengue (85.25%), and they were more concerned with the severity of dengue than chikungunya and Zika. Participants with ages lower than 35 years old (p = 0.047) and incomes higher than 5,000 THB (p = 0.016) had more knowledge of mosquito vectors. Moreover, 47% of respondents had positive attitude toward sterile mosquitoes and their application in vector control even though 45.5% of them had never heard about the technology. However, the majority of them were not willing to pay (52%); and if they had to pay, the maximum would be 1-2 THB (US$ 1 = ~34 THB) per sterile mosquito, since most of them expected to receive the service as public support from the government. Our study was the first to study KAP and WTP related to SIT/IIT technology. It provided unique insights into how communities view the technology. It also suggested potential for successful implementation with proper education as well as highlighted the need for cost-sharing strategies with government subsidization for SIT/IIT deployment. Municipal officials and community health volunteers were key communication channels and targeted public education was needed, especially on under-recognized diseases like chikungunya and Zika. These findings should be useful for health authorities in planning to integrate SIT/IIT technology with traditional approaches for disease vector control and prevention.",

        "abstract": "The misuse and overprescription of antibiotics have accelerated the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), rendering many antibiotics ineffective and leading to significant clinical challenges. The conventional treatment methods have become progressively challenging, posing a threat of evolving into an impending silent pandemic. The long track record of bacteriophages combating bacterial infections has renewed hope into the potential therapeutic benefits of bacteriophages. Bacteriophage therapy offers a promising alternative to antibiotics, particularly against multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. This article explores the promise of phages as a potential means to combat superbugs from the perspective of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of the phages and their bacterial host. Advances in bacteriophage genomics have expedited the detection of new phages and AMR genes, enhancing our understanding of phage-host interactions and enabling the identification of potential treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. At the same time, holo-transcriptomic studies hold potential for discovering disease and context-specific transcriptionally active phages vis-à-vis disease severity. Holo-transcriptomic profiling can be applied to investigate the presence of AMR-bacteria, highlighting COVID-19 and Dengue diseases, in addition to the globally recognized ESKAPE pathogens. By simultaneously capturing phage, bacterial and host transcripts, this approach enables a better comprehension of the bacteriophage dynamics. Moreover, insight into these defence and counter-defence interactions is essential for augmenting the adoption of phage therapy at scale and advancing bacterial control in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "<i>Orthoflavivirus nilense</i>, formerly known as West Nile Virus (WNV), has become endemic to the United States since its introduction in 1999. Current surveillance methods rely primarily on mosquito pool testing, which is both costly and time-intensive. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has proven an effective method for the surveillance of various pathogens, including other orthoflaviviruses such as Dengue. WBE for WNV represents a potentially valuable surveillance approach that has so far been underexplored. A targeted droplet digital reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach (ddRT-PCR) was used to measure WNV concentrations in wastewater retrospectively from five locations and in over 600 samples. Three of these locations were in communities with multiple confirmed WNV infections, while two were not. Samples were collected during periods corresponding to typical WNV seasonality (spring to fall). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured simultaneously to assess nucleic acid degradation during sample storage. Publicly available confirmed WNV case data were compiled from the California and Nebraska departments of public health and their weekly arboviral reports. WNV RNA was detected in wastewater samples during periods of known viral circulation within a community. The adopted ddRT-PCR assay is highly specific and sensitive, and detections in wastewater solids correspond to the occurrence of cases in the season and location of sampling. WNV was detected in nine samples in three locations with known WNV clinical cases-wastewater positivity rates in these locations ranged from 3.3% to 13%. The results suggest that wastewater monitoring could serve as an effective complement to traditional surveillance methods, particularly for sentinel surveillance in locations which do not have extensive mosquito and clinical testing systems.",

        "abstract": "Annually, millions of people are affected by mosquito-borne Orthoflavivirus infections. These include diseases caused by the Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV), posing a formidable challenge to global public health. This research aims to explore the potential role of the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA) in Orthoflavivirus infection, particularly focusing on key metabolites involved in the process of viral invasion into the central nervous system. Given the advantages of metabolomics technology in metabolite identification. Therefore, we employed an untargeted Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics platform to examine alterations in metabolite concentrations within the feces and brain tissues of mice infected with DENV, JEV, or ZIKV, as well as uninfected controls. The results showed that 225, 240, and 252 differential metabolites were identified in the fecal metabolome of DENV, JEV, and ZIKV infections, respectively, with amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism being significantly disrupted. In the brain metabolome, 37, 81, and 18 differential metabolites were identified for DENV, JEV, and ZIKV infections, respectively, with lipid metabolism and purine metabolism being significantly disrupted. Amino acids with low abundance in viral proteins are significantly disrupted in the amino acid metabolism pathway, suggesting that Orthoflaviviruses adapt to its needs for synthesizing viral proteins by regulating the host's amino acid composition. The disruption of purine metabolism also implies the viral genome replication process occurring in the brain. Moreover, the disturbance of lipid metabolism is highly correlated with the biological function of the Orthoflavivirus envelope, where Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) may be the key for Orthoflaviviruses to enter the human central nervous system via the GBA. This research is the first to explore the potential role of GBA in Orthoflavivirus infection through joint metabolomic analysis of fecal and brain tissue samples, providing new insights into viral invasion of the central nervous system. The findings not only elucidate the characteristics of viral infection from complementary perspectives of fecal and brain tissue samples, revealing associated metabolic changes, but also establish a foundation for subsequent identification of biomarkers to diagnose disease states-particularly for predicting central nervous system infection risks. The specific patterns revealed by fecal metabolomics analysis provide the theoretical basis for developing non-invasive predictive approaches to assess brain infection status in the future.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is currently the most important arbovirosis in the world, affecting over 120 countries in both tropical and sub-tropical areas, with 2500 million people at risk. Due to global warming, it is expected that <i>Aedes aegypti</i> will be able to survive at higher latitudes, increasing the number of people at risk. Therefore, it is crucial to develop control strategies for the mosquito to prevent its environmental impact. The objective of this paper was to determine the concentration of entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) <i>Steinernema carpocapsae</i> that produces the highest percentage mortality of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae under normal environmental conditions in Yucatán (6.9 - 8.7 mg/l; temperature 25.9 - 31.5°C; pH 7.20 - 8.10). The <i>S. carpocapsae</i> mode of action consists of <i>Xenorhabdus nematophila</i> bacterial release in the haemocele insect, which produces septicaemia and consequently kills the mosquito larvae 24 - 48 h after intake. As for the methodology, a commercial EPN strain was used for experimental infection. The experimental design was a 70-h static bioassay that exposed 10 mosquito larvae per experimental unit (400-ml flask and five replicates per treatment) to four nematode concentrations (1250, 2500, 3125 and 3750 nematodes per ml) plus controls. The best treatment was with 1250 nematodes/ml, which caused 54 % mortality with respect to controls after 70 h (one-way ANOVA; <i>F</i> <sub>5.72, 0.05</sub>; <i>p</i> < 0.04). We concluded that <i>S. carpocapsae</i> is a promising biological control tool for killing <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae at an experimental level. However, it is still necessary to determine its performance at higher volume scales in real-life conditions.",

This study included hospitalized patients with dengue fever who were treated with ibuprofen and/or acetaminophen for fever management. At admission, none of the patients were diagnosed with severe dengue. The patients were divided into three groups: ibuprofen-exposed group (those receiving ibuprofen alone or in combination with acetaminophen), ibuprofen group (patients who received ibuprofen alone), and acetaminophen group (patients who received acetaminophen alone for fever management). Key safety parameters were compared across groups. A total of 262 patients participated. The cumulative dose of ibuprofen administered during hospitalization was 0.6 (0.4-0.8) g. No significant differences were found between ibuprofen-exposed/ibuprofen groups and acetaminophen group in terms of platelet reduction, bleeding events, severe thrombocytopenia, or the incidence of severe dengue (all p > 0.05). Ibuprofen group had a significantly shorter fever duration (p = 0.046), while acetaminophen group showed a significantly greater elevation in alanine aminotransferase levels (p = 0.029). All patients were followed up post-discharge, and none experienced gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months. This study suggests that safety of low-dose ibuprofen is consistent with acetaminophen for fever management in non-severe dengue patients.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the therapeutic potential of five natural compounds from Carica papaya - olean-12-ene, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and kaempferol - against dengue virus (DENV) using a multi-faceted in silico approach. Quantum chemical analysis using density functional theory (DFT) revealed insights into the electronic properties and stability, with olean-12-ene exhibiting the highest stability (HOMO-LUMO gap: 6.91 eV), while luteolin and apigenin showed balanced reactivity profiles suitable for biochemical interactions. ADMET profiling underlined the drug-likeness of these compounds: Quercetin showed good solubility (logS: -2.93) and hydrogen bonding potential, apigenin showed high oral bioavailability (HIA: 93.25%) and olean-12-ene exhibited remarkable permeability (Caco-2: 1.26). Molecular docking simulations against the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease, the NS1 protein and the envelope protein provided further insight into their binding affinities and interaction modes. Toxicity assessments indicated manageable risks, although flavonoids exhibited moderate hepatotoxicity and olean-12-ene showed cardiotoxic/nephrotoxic tendencies, suggesting a need for further optimization. Overall, these results highlight the potential of specific papaya-derived compounds, particularly the flavonoids, as candidates for further experimental validation in the development of anti-DENV therapeutics. This work lays a foundation for future in vitro and in vivo studies to combat DENV infection and associated complications such as thrombocytopenia.",

This study assessed a machine learning model to identify a minimal, yet highly predictive biomarker set, aiming to support clinical decision-making and patient triage. A total of 48 inflammatory mediators were quantified from plasma samples collected at admission from confirmed dengue patients, classified as either dengue without warning signs (DF) or dengue with warning signs/severe dengue (DWS/SD). A random forest approach was applied to identify the most predictive biomarkers associated with disease severity requiring hospitalization, based on admission-time variables. Among the 48 immune mediators, 43 were differentially expressed in dengue patients versus healthy controls, and 26 showed significant differences between DF and DWS/SD cases. Lymphocyte counts negatively correlated with IL-1RA, while liver enzymes showed positive correlations with HGF and SCGF-beta; platelet counts also negatively correlated with these markers. Key severity-associated markers included HGF, TNF-beta, MIP-1-beta, and SCGF-beta. A model incorporating these markers and fever duration achieved nearly 80% accuracy in distinguishing DWS/SD from DF cases, independent of clinical examination. The findings suggest that targeted cytokine profiling may guide early hospitalization decisions and ease healthcare burdens in dengue-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Infections caused by mosquito-borne viruses such as Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have become a global public health issue. However, due to the unclear pathogenic mechanisms, there are currently no specific treatments available for patients infected with these orthoflaviviruses in clinical practice. Metabolomics provides distinct advantages for characterizing infection features and deciphering disease pathogenesis. Therefore, this review summarizes relevant literature on mosquito-borne viruses metabolomics, with a particular focus on elucidating the metabolic characteristics of cells infected by orthoflaviviruses. By conducting a comparative analysis of the metabolomics data from different sample sources infected with DENV, ZIKV, and JEV, we found that several metabolic pathways involved in viral infection, replication, and pathogenesis are commonly disrupted in the metabolomics data of these orthoflaviviruses. These pathways include the reprogramming of lipid metabolism, interference with energy metabolism, and the induction of host inflammatory responses. These findings identify key targets for subsequent mechanistic studies on the persistent replication and transmission of orthoflaviviruses in mosquito vectors and their ability to cause severe pathology in human hosts. Further elucidations of the above mechanisms could provide an effective scheme for preventing orthoflaviviral transmission in mosquito vectors and treating orthoflaviviral infections. In addition, studying these metabolomic changes in human hosts of orthoflaviviral infections may be able to provide relevant biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of the disease.",

The Aedes mosquito vector's migration, aided by adaptation to climate change has allowed Dengue virus to spread into temperate regions. The major impact of the disease occurs in regions with limited resources, creating a significant burden for these countries. There is a growing body of information characterizing the neurological disorders related to pediatric Dengue infection. In addition to reviewing Dengue virus structure, disease diagnostic criteria and current WHO guidelines, this article discusses the neuropathogenic mechanisms of infection, and the resultant impact on the central and peripheral nervous systems. Our group has created a framework correlating the presentation of neurologic disorders to Dengue virus phases of infection. There is an urgent need for epidemiological analysis and a systematic approach to catalogue the emerging reports of pediatric neurological disorders related to dengue virus infection.

Resource availability in the healthcare systems of LMICs is often inconsistent and, in many cases, insufficient to meet the needs of the local population. One major health concern in LMICs is the high burden of parasitic and viral infections of the nervous system, illnesses that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Over the past 50 years, several LMICs in tropical and subtropical regions have experienced an emergence, re-emergence, or upswing in arthropod-borne viral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.

BCN0941 is a structure-based designed antiviral peptide that inhibits early stages of DENV infection in mammalian cells [WO2015131858A2]. Studies of structure-activity relationship indicate that the molecular target of the antiviral activity of BCN0941 is the Low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1), an evolutionary conserved receptor that we have identified as putative DENV receptor in mammalian cells. In this work, we evaluated the antiviral activity of BCN0941 peptide against DENV serotype 1 in mosquito cells. In vitro assays were performed in cell lines C6/36 (Aedes albopictus) and Aag2 (Aedes aegypti). The antiviral activity in vivo in a metapopulation of field-collected A. aegypti mosquitoes was also evaluated. BCN0941 peptide exhibited the capacity to decrease viral infection in both experimental set up, in vivo and in vitro, up to a 50% and 60% of the treatment controls respectively, as determined by immunofluorescence. BCN0941 may be an effective DENV transmission-blocking drug due to its dual action in decreasing the viral load in infected people and the mosquito vector.",

Antibodies targeting EDE were prevalent and associated with broad neutralization of mature DENV1 to DENV4 virions in those with evidence of at least two prior DENV infections but were mostly absent in those with only one prior infection. Subsequent infection and vaccination boosted titers of EDE-like antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, and DENV-binding antibodies. EDE-like antibodies were associated with reduced risk of symptomatic dengue and more severe dengue and statistically explained the protective effect of binding and neutralizing antibodies on dengue. Thus, antibodies targeting quaternary epitopes help explain the broad cross-protection observed in those with multiple prior DENV exposures, making them useful for evaluation and development of future vaccines and therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "New tools and methods are currently under evaluation by the World Health Organization for preventing arbovirus transmission, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. One promising approach involves deploying Aedes aegypti with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to disrupt arbovirus transmission within endemic urban environments. The release program of mosquitoes with the Wolbachia's wMel strain started in August 2017 in 6.88% of the city area of Rio de Janeiro, where 13.1% of the city's population live (~890,000 inhabitants). The deployment of Wolbachia wMel strain in Rio finished in December 2019 with a suboptimal 32% introgression of wMel strain, which coincided with a 38% and 10% reduction of dengue and chikungunya, respectively. We conducted an independent evaluation during 20 consecutive months to evaluate whether the wMel distribution and frequency would expand or retract. More than 50,000 mosquitoes were sampled in 12 neighborhoods with estimated 500,000 inhabitants, of which 39.2% were Ae. aegypti. In total, 7,613 of 19,427 collected Ae. aegypti were screened individually for wMel. Climate, environmental and insecticide application data was used to model the spatiotemporal introgression of wMel. The routine insecticide rotation adopted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health caused the crash of both wMel-infected and -uninfected populations shortly after an increase in coverage with spinosad. However, the wMel-uninfected mosquitoes recovered soon to levels even higher than before, whereas the wMel-infected failed to recover after the population crash. The well documented fitness cost of wMel in egg hatching leads to the absence of an egg bank necessary to recover after adult population was disrupted. Finally, we observed the mtDNA haplotype associated with released Wolbachia at a frequency of ~25% in field-caught uninfected mosquitoes. The reason underlying the poor introgression of Wolbachia wMel strain is multifold. The adoption of an effective larvicide that crashed both wMel-infected and -uninfected populations, the absence of an egg bank due to high fitness cost of egg hatching in the wMel-infected mosquitoes, a suboptimal Wolbachia invasion before the intervention, and Wolbachia loss synergically contributed to the lower invasion and, by corollary, modest epidemiological outcome in Rio de Janeiro. Our results highlight the need to plan and implement technical guidance on Integrated Vector Management in Brazil prior and during the nationwide release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to optimize dengue mitigation efforts while ensuring the judicious use of resources.",

This study presents the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) using Aerva lanata flower extract and evaluates their larvicidal efficacy against Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. stephensi, and Ae. aegypti. The biosynthesized Ag-NPs, characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, Zeta potential, and DLS analyses, exhibited potent larvicidal and pupicidal activities, with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.501, 20.875, and 22.649 ppm, respectively. The morphological and histopathological alterations in treated larvae, alongside significant modulation of antioxidant (SOD, GPx) and detoxification (GST, AChE) enzymes, indicate oxidative stress as a key mode of action.

        "abstract": "Effective dengue management hinges on targeting key vector breeding sites and understanding transmission risks. Despite recurring outbreaks in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province since 2013, comprehensive entomological and virological data remain scarce. This study identified key larval-based indicators (habitats, Stegomyia indices), mosquito species composition, and dengue virus (DENV) infection rates in Aedes mosquitoes, evaluating their contributions to outbreak risk. From July to December 2021, a cross-sectional larval survey of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus was conducted across epidemiologically high-risk KP districts, inspecting water-holding containers located indoors, outdoors, and on rooftops. Additionally, adult mosquitoes were collected using aspirators and nets, with weekly dengue case data sourced from Peshawar's Directorate of Health Services. A subsample of 200 adult mosquito pools (20 per district) underwent RT-PCR to determine minimum infection rates (MIR). Larval indices revealed a House Index (HI) of 19.4%, a Container Index (CI) of 20.4%, and a Breteau Index (BI) of 89%. Aedes aegypti was the dominant species, accounting for 62% of larvae and 67.8% of adult mosquitoes. Peshawar (BI = 89.3), Nowshera (BI = 71.4), and Mardan (BI = 57) reported the highest Breteau indices and corresponding dengue case counts: 2,584 (48.8%), 404 (7.6%), and 327 (6.2%), respectively. The peak larval positivity was recorded in October (29.3%) and September (24.7%), aligning with dengue patient hospitalization rates of 52.8% and 46.8%, respectively. Common breeding sites included indoor flowerpots (25.4%), outdoor rubber tyres (16%), and roof tap water (23.7%). Container type and location significantly (P < 0.00) predicted larval abundance. Regression analysis revealed significant associations between dengue incidence, population density, and stegomyia indices. Of 38 positive pools (19%), DENV-2 and DENV-3 predominated (47.4% each), with peak MIRs recorded in Peshawar (30), Mardan (25), and Haripur (25). High larval indices and dual-serotype circulation in adaptable Aedes vectors signal substantial outbreak risk in KP. These findings underscore the need for targeted vector strategies, focusing on containers with the highest breeding potentials and epidemiological significance, particularly in high-transmission areas. Further molecular and entomological investigations are critical to corroborate these findings and inform more effective interventions.",

Moreover, the absence of IFN-γ signaling limits the capacity of the AG129 model. To date, wild-type mouse models of DENV infection have only exhibited mild symptoms without lethality, limiting their research applicability. In this study, we developed a lethal C57BL/6 wild-type mouse model infected with DENV-2 365 strain. By blocking the type I interferon receptor before the virus challenge, we allowed the immune response to be restored at a later stage of infection. Following infection, the mice exhibited severe symptoms, including weight loss, high viremia levels, elevated inflammatory cytokines, significant vascular leakage, and pathological changes in the brain, kidney, liver and spleen. The model also displayed severe central nervous symptoms and 100% mortality. Additionally, we used this model to evaluate an adaptable NS2A protein mutation found in both Zika virus and DENV-2.

This systematic review delves into the multifaceted factors contributing to the spread of MBD in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Following PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed peer-reviewed English-language observational and experimental studies published between May 1990 and January 2023, focusing on the interaction between population, environmental, disease, and mosquito factors in MBD. The review includes 32 studies (30 articles) that revealed a complex relationship between various risk factors and the presence of MBD. The review distinguishes between seroprevalence studies, which assess exposure to infection in asymptomatic populations, and overt disease studies, which focus on symptomatic cases and the host-specific factors that affect disease severity. It identifies key risk factors such as age, geography, gender, professional occupation, and socio-economic status, noting their varying impacts on disease transmission and progression across different MBDs. Environmental factors such as climate, mosquito breeding habitats, and urbanization are also reported as significant drivers of vector distribution and human-vector interactions. The review emphasizes the need for tailored, region-specific interventions to control MBD in the MENA region and highlights the importance of integrated vector control, improved sanitation, surveillance programmes, and public health education. The review also stresses the growing influence of climate change on disease patterns and calls for a multi-sectoral approach to MBD control. While focusing on the MENA region, the findings suggest the need for further research and region-specific public health policies to mitigate the impact of these diseases.",

Though there is no specific therapy for JE, many etiological agents of AES are treatable. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the AES cases for their etiologies, laboratory parameters, and associated clinical manifestations. A hospital-based prospective observational study was carried out, enrolling all consecutive cases of AES satisfying the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. Blood was tested for the malaria parasite. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed by Gram staining, India ink staining for <i>Cryptococcus</i>, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture for other bacteria and fungi<i>.</i> Serum and CSF samples lacking the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IgM were processed for the detection of other etiologies. The CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect <i>Enterovirus</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>, and herpes simplex virus, and serum IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) detected scrub typhus, <i>Leptospira</i>, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile antibodies. Out of 395 AES cases tested, 77 were found to be positive for non-JE etiologies. Of these, dengue virus (n=32/371; 8.6%) was the most common, followed by scrub typhus (n=16/348; 4.6%) and <i>Leptospira</i> (n=10/362; 2.8%). Positive cases showed CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC/cumm) and significantly higher protein level (n=6/11; 55%) and sugar level (n=8/11; 73%) in <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae.</i> All cases presented with fever (n=11/11; 100%), followed by altered mental status (n=18/19; 94.7%) and seizure (n=22/32; 68.7%). The number of non-JE causes of AES in Assam is higher. Scrub typhus, dengue virus, and <i>Leptospira</i> are other major infectious etiologies of AES that are treatable. Timely diagnosis of such cases will help reduce AES-related complications and mortality.",

However, there is no documented information on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of severe malaria and dengue. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the association between malaria & dengue and previous COVID-19 infection among the adult population of Mangalore Taluk and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of malaria & dengue. This case-control study was conducted among 293 participants who were positive for either malaria or dengue from November 2022 to August 2024. Data were collected using a proforma which contained sections on demographic details, clinical profile and comorbidities, history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination status. The participants were categorised into having severe disease and mild to moderate disease based on operational definitions. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29. Chi-square test was done, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary Logistic Regression analyses were used and odds ratios were estimated. A total of 293 participants were included in the study with a mean age of 36.7 (SD:14.8) years. Among them, 23.9% (n = 70) had malaria and 76.1% (n = 223) had dengue. Out of those who had malaria, 30% (n = 21) developed severe illness, whereas among those who had dengue 35.8% (n = 80) developed severe dengue. Overall, 58.4% (n = 171) were in the age group of > 30 years. In total, 98.1% (n = 52) of the participants with dengue fever with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe dengue, (aOR:55.93 (95% CI:7.17-435.92) p < 0.001) compared to those without. Similarly, 85.7% (n = 12) of the participants with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe malaria (aOR: 263.7 (95% CI: 34.9-1987.4) p < 0.001) compared to those and these differences were found to be statistically significant. In addition, those participants belonging to lower socio-economic classes had higher chances of developing severe dengue than those belonging to the upper socio-economic class (p < 0.001*). Those with a prior history of COVID-19 infection had higher chances of developing severe malaria and dengue than those without a history of COVID-19 infection.",

        "abstract": "Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is a serious complication of dengue infection which occurs when critical plasma leakage results in haemodynamic shock. Treatment is challenging as fluid therapy must balance the risk of hypoperfusion with volume overload. In this study, we investigate the potential utility of wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) to determine volume status in DSS. In this prospective observational study, we enrolled 250 adults and children with a clinical diagnosis of dengue admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City. PPG monitoring using a wearable device was applied for a 24-hour period. Clinical events were then matched to the PPG data by date and time. We predefined two clinical states for comparison: (1) the 2-hour period before a shock event was an \"empty\" volume state and (2) the 2-hour period between 1 and 3 hours after a fluid initiation event was a \"full\" volume state. PPG data were sampled from these states for analysis. Variability and waveform morphology features were extracted and analyzed using principal components analysis and random forest. Waveform images were used to develop a computer vision model. Of the 250 patients enrolled, 90 patients experienced the predefined outcomes, and had sufficient data for the analysis. Principal components analysis identified four principal components (PCs), from the 23 pulse wave features. Logistic regression using these PCs showed that the empty state is associated with PCs 1 (p = 0.016) and 4 (p = 0.036) with both PCs denoting increased sympathetic activity. Random forest showed that heart rate and the LF-HF ratio are the most important features. A computer vision model had a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.70 for the empty state. These results provide proof of concept that an artificial intelligence-based approach using continuous PPG monitoring can provide information on volume states in DSS.",

Our present study successfully demonstrated the production of the envelope protein structural domain III (EDIII) dengue virus antigen in tobacco chloroplasts. We obtained transformed tobacco lines that show the expression of EDIII dengue antigen and were confirmed through Southern blotting analysis. Furthermore, the expression of EDIII antigen was further confirmed via immunoblotting and quantified. These findings suggest that tobacco chloroplast engineering holds promise as a method for future manufacture of an oral dengue boost vaccine that is safe, affordable, and effective, contributing to the global management and control of this particular dengue infection.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) and Monkeypox virus (MPXV) are two major re-emerging viral pathogen, which have recently gained global attention, mainly in light of their potential for widespread transmission and the ability to cause various complications. While the characteristic manifestations of these infections comprise lymphadenopathy, fever, and rash, recent studies suggest a darker dimension, neuropsychiatric complications, which are a hallmark of neurovirulent viral pathogens. However, current evidence suggests that these complications, which may vary from mild to critical conditions such as meningitis and encephalitis, are not well understood, posing marked challenges in the realm of diagnosis and treatment. In other words, while neuropsychiatric presentations of DENV and MPXV appear as an area of concern, diagnosing these manifestations remains challenging owing to their general characteristics and overlap with those of other pathological conditions and the lack of the central nervous system (CNS)-focused diagnostic tools. This can delay early detection and subsequent appropriate surveillance of DENV- and MPXV-associated neuropsychiatric complications. The present review focuses on describing various DENV- and MPXV-associated neuropsychiatric complications, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and their current diagnostic challenges.",

        "abstract": "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Dengue virus (DENV), represent significant global health threats. Beyond their acute systemic illnesses, many arboviral infections are characterized by debilitating and often chronic musculoskeletal complications, including arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, and bone pain. Evidence suggests that these pathologies may stem, at least in part, from the viruses' direct or indirect interference with fundamental cellular processes governing skeletal homoeostasis, particularly osteogenesis (bone formation) and bone remodelling. Key signalling pathways critical for osteoblast differentiation and function, such as Wnt/β-catenin, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Notch, and Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B Ligand (RANKL) pathways, are potential targets for viral manipulation or dysregulation by the host inflammatory response. This article reviews the current understanding of how arboviruses might interact with osteogenesis-associated signalling pathways, explores the link between this interaction and musculoskeletal disease, and proposes that targeting these pathways could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate the long-term skeletal sequelae of arboviral infections.",

        "abstract": "The ineffectiveness of current prevention efforts is underscored by the increasing number of dengue cases, emphasizing the necessity of innovative approaches. This investigation investigates the extent of stakeholder acceptability and attitudes toward the alternative autocidal trap method and the current fogging technique. The objective is to identify differences in community viewpoints regarding these control techniques among various stakeholder groups, including scientists and the public. Information was collected from two separate groups of individuals: scientists and the general people. A comprehensive survey assessed the level of tolerance and attitudes towards fogging and autocidal traps. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software, specifically utilizing the one-way MANOVA test, to identify any significant variations in attitudes among various stakeholder groups. The results reveal significant discrepancies in the perceived danger level between the two groups since the public views fogging as a riskier activity than scientists. However, the groups had no significant difference in the reported benefits. Scientists exhibited a greater degree of endorsement for both fogging and autocidal traps when compared to the public. While the general population showed more openness towards fogging, scientists have shown a more balanced approval of both tactics. These insights are essential for policymakers and health practitioners as they inform the creation of more efficient, community-oriented initiatives to address the increasing prevalence of dengue cases.",

        "abstract": "<i>Aedes aegypti</i> , a primary vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, displays remarkable adaptability across ecological gradients. Central to this resilience is the egg stage, which must withstand fluctuating moisture and temperature conditions. Environmental transitions, particularly changes in moisture availability, significantly influence egg hatching success in mosquitoes. This study investigates how parental exposure to variable hydration conditions shapes key reproductive traits in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> . Using four environmental regimes, continuous wet, continuous dry, wet-to- dry, and dry-to-wet, we assessed egg output, hatching success, thermotolerance, and egg nutrient composition across three <i>Ae. aegypti</i> populations. Our results show that oviposition timing and egg production are significantly affected by the hydration environment experienced by the parental generation. While the wet, dry, and dry-to-wet groups exhibited a consistent oviposition peak beginning four days post-blood feeding, the wet-to-dry group showed delayed reproductive investment, with peak egg production occurring later. Egg output was highest under continuous wet conditions and significantly reduced in the dry and wet-to-dry treatments across all populations. Interestingly, the wet-to-dry group showed significantly higher egg-thermotolerance than any other group, and this pattern was consistent across all three populations under high- temperature stress conditions (41°C and 45°C). Nutritional composition showed an increased glycogen level in eggs when parents were exposed to wet conditions before blood feeding. By integrating physiological and ecological metrics such as hatching rates and thermal stress resilience, we demonstrate how parental environments shape subsequent egg performance, highlighting adaptive responses that enable <i>Ae. aegypti</i> persistence under increasing climate variability.",

Cross-reactive IgG antibodies can cause under specific conditions antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection via Fc-receptor interaction. Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 (anti-S) causing COVID-19 disease can also cross-react against the dengue envelope (anti-E). We therefore investigated the antibody profile of these cross-reactive antibodies and their ability to induce ADE. We found that the cross-reactive anti-E in COVID-19 vaccinated are dominated by IgM/A while, anti-S from vaccinated or anti-E from dengue infected patients have an IgG1 dominated antibody profile. The low-level anti-E IgG from COVID-19 vaccinated are dominated by low Fc-affinity IgG2/4 subclass. These antibodies were able to induce in vitro ADE stronger than from Dengue infected for the 1<sup>st</sup>,2<sup>nd</sup> dose of the vaccine or later omicron variant booster. This could partially be explained that ADE was inhibited by the complement system in dengue infected but not in COVID-19 vaccinated.",

In this Phase 1, open-label study (NCT05201937), high- and low-dose weekly, and twice weekly maintenance doses (MDs) of mosnodenvir were evaluated following a twice daily loading dose (LD) over 2 days. The utility of a convenient capillary blood sampling device (TASSO-M20) was also explored. Healthy adults were sequentially assigned to receive: 450 mg twice daily LD, 900 mg once weekly MD; 450 mg twice daily LD, 450 mg twice weekly MD; 150 mg twice daily LD, 300 mg once weekly MD; or 150 mg twice daily LD, 150 mg twice weekly MD. Mosnodenvir exposure rapidly increased with LD and was maintained during the MD phase. In general, mosnodenvir increased in a dose-proportional manner with similar areas under the concentration-time curve between once weekly and twice weekly MD. The mean terminal elimination half-life across treatments was 6.7-8.7 days, supporting less frequent dosing. Safety and tolerability were similar across all treatment regimens.

Traditional surveillance and control systems often struggle with delayed reporting, limited predictive capacity, and resource constraints. Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity to enhance dengue prevention, control, and management through data-driven decision-making. This review synthesizes current applications of AI across key domains: outbreak forecasting, vector control, clinical management, and public health intervention. Machine learning models have demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting dengue outbreaks using environmental, climatic, and epidemiological data. AI-powered image recognition and autonomous systems support more effective mosquito monitoring and habitat targeting. In clinical settings, AI assists with early diagnosis, severity prediction, and treatment planning. Additionally, AI-driven tools facilitate real-time analysis of behavioral data and community engagement through mobile platforms. However, challenges remain, including data standardization, model interpretability, and ethical concerns around data privacy. This review highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and robust infrastructure to scale and sustain AI-based systems.

        "abstract": "Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the dengue virus (DENV) is essential for viral replication and immune evasion, primarily functioning as a dimer or hexamer. The β-roll domain plays a crucial role in NS1 dimerization, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention. This study investigates the potential of a synthetic peptide derived from the β-roll domain to disrupt NS1 dimerization and function. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the peptide binds strongly to NS1, destabilizing its secondary structure and impairing its biological function. SPR analysis revealed a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.12 μM and a Gibbs free energy change (∆G) of -9.44 kcal/mol, indicating high binding affinity and thermodynamic favorability. CD spectroscopy confirmed a significant reduction in β-sheet content, with a corresponding increase in disordered structures, suggesting peptide-induced destabilization of NS1. ELISA results further showed a concentration-dependent loss of NS1 recognition by specific antibodies, indicating functional impairment. Notably, ectoine, a natural osmolyte, enhanced peptide stability and interaction strength, further exacerbating NS1 disruption. These findings highlight the potential of β-roll-targeting peptides as novel inhibitors of NS1 function and propose ectoine as an effective stabilizing co-solvent to improve peptide efficacy. This study provides a strong foundation for developing peptide-based therapeutics against dengue virus infections.",

To identify the clinico-epidemiological characteristics, management, and outcomes of severe dengue fever among inpatients of a tertiary care hospital. Prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, Karnataka. Study included all laboratory-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to Departments of General Medicine and Infectious Diseases during the study period. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and analysed. Descriptive and analytical tests, including multiple logistic regression analyses, were performed. Among 443 patients, 70% were males. Fever (91.9%) and aches/pains (81.7%) were most frequently reported symptoms with thrombocytopenia (81.9%), elevated AST (81.2%), and ALT (73.3%) were commonly observed. Severe dengue was observed in 12.1% of patients, frequently accompanied by acute kidney injury (32.9%), hepatitis (29.4%), and multiple organ dysfunction (22.4%). Severe cases were associated with age over 60 (COR = 4.6; 95% CI:2.1-9.9), low education status (COR = 3.6; 95% CI:1.3-10.4), unskilled occupations (COR = 4.2; 95% CI:1.1-15.8), presence of co-morbidities (COR = 2.5; 95% CI:1.4-4.4) and co-infections (COR = 5.2;95% CI:2.7-9.8), and supportive treatment (COR = 3.9; 95% CI:2.1-7). Independent predictor for severity was coinfection (AOR = 15.6; 95% CI:3.9-61.7). Supportive care was received by 36.3% patients, with 97.5% showing improvement, while 1.6% succumbed to death.

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) remains a critical global health challenge, with no approved antiviral treatments currently available. The growing prevalence of DENV infections highlights the urgent need for effective therapeutics. Antiviral peptides (AVPs) have gained significant attention due to their potential to inhibit viral replication. However, traditional drug discovery methods are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep generative models (DGMs), offer a promising approach to accelerating AVP discovery. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of DGMs in identifying novel AVPs for DENV. It presents an extensive survey of existing antimicrobial and AVP datasets, peptide sequence feature representations, and the integration of DGMs into computational peptide design. Additionally, in vitro and in silico screening data from previous studies highlight the therapeutic potential of AVPs against DENV. Variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks have been extensively documented in the literature for their applications in AVP generation. These models have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to generate diverse and structurally viable compounds, significantly expanding the repertoire of potential antiviral candidates. Additionally, this report assesses both the strengths and limitations of DGMs, providing valuable insights for guiding future research directions. As a data-driven and scalable framework, DGMs offer a promising avenue for the rational design of potent AVPs targeting DENV and other emerging viral pathogens, contributing to the advancement of next-generation therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection is strongly associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, both of which carry mortality risks. Addressing the urgent need for effective dengue therapeutics, we identified sofalcone, a gastroprotective agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as a potential inhibitor of DENV replication. Sofalcone demonstrated efficacy against all four DENV serotypes, with the dose inhibiting 50% (IC50) value of 28.1 ± 0.42 μM against viral replication of DENV serotype 2, without significant cytotoxicity. Additionally, sofalcone significantly improved survival rates and reduced viral titers in DENV-infected ICR-suckling mice. Mechanistically, sofalcone induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression via the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-reated factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which in turn suppressed viral protease activity and restored antiviral interferon (IFN) responses. This included dose-dependent stimulation of IFN downstream antiviral genes such as 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), OAS2, and OAS3. Given its established clinical use as an anti-gastric ulcer drug, sofalcone offers promising potential for rapid application in treating DENV infection.",

        "abstract": "Imported malaria remains a significant diagnostic challenge, particularly in regions approaching elimination. This case report is novel in its exploration of the complexities involved in diagnosing malaria imported from a high-endemic area to a low-endemic region, emphasizing the critical role of detailed travel history and molecular diagnostics in identifying the disease. The case underscores the potential public health implications of missing such diagnoses in regions where routine malaria testing is not performed due to low endemicity. A 25-year-old male presented to a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry, India, with symptoms of intermittent fever, headache, loss of appetite, and vomiting, which persisted over a week. Initial laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, with negative tests for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus. Further investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified Plasmodium falciparum. The patient had recently returned from Burkina Faso, West Africa, where he had experienced similar episodes of fever, establishing the diagnosis of imported malaria. This case highlights the necessity of considering imported malaria in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses in India, a country nearing malaria elimination. It illustrates the importance of incorporating travel history into clinical evaluations and supports the use of molecular diagnostics to effectively diagnose malaria in settings where traditional diagnostic methods may overlook imported cases. The findings advocate for enhanced surveillance and diagnostic preparedness to manage imported cases of malaria, thereby supporting ongoing elimination efforts and preventing the re-establishment of local transmission.

        "abstract": "Dengue infection is one of the most widely spread flavivirus infections. Despite the fatality it could cause, no antiviral treatment is currently available to treat the disease and its associated pathophysiological conditions. This study aimed to search drug-like compounds for possible inhibitors of the NS5 protein of dengue virus (serotype 2). In the present study, a data set of twenty-five Beta vulgaris. L-based phytoconstituents was developed. We employed machine learning (ML) data pre-processing, screening of differentially expressed transcripts and genes, identification of common transcriptional signatures and pathways and function enrichment analysis of dengue infection; and protein-protein interaction network construction and identification of hub genes. ML data revealed that NS5 mRNA was downregulated by betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside. Moreover, administering these compounds can alleviate host innate immune factor suppression mediated by NS5, thereby exhibiting antiviral activity. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetics studies revealed a potential therapeutic role of betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside phytoconstituents as potent antiviral phytocompounds. MD simulation and post-simulation analysis, including principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation, confirmed the antiviral therapeutic potency of betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside against dengue virus infection. In vitro cytotoxic studies also depicted nontoxic effects of betanin and quercetin hydrate in Vero and CHO cells at a concentration range of 20-0.31 μM. In summary, computational screening and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis revealed that betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside may prove as potential drug candidates against dengue virus regarding their possible safety and antiviral activity in future.",

From 2020 to 2022, the Lee County Mosquito Control District (LCMCD) employed the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to test a new approach in its integrated mosquito management toolbox, targeting the population suppression of Ae. aegypti on Captiva Island, Florida. Over 24.1 million sterile males were released across three phases, covering up to 142 hectares. The study demonstrated a population reduction of up to 79% in wild adults and a 59% decline in egg densities in the primary intervention area. While population control was successful, an influx of wild females from untreated zones posed ongoing challenges to complete suppression in areas close to non-intervention areas. This supported a need for an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) approach. These results underscore SIT's potential as a critical tool in integrated mosquito management strategies and emphasize practical application.",

A total of 1213 and 157 unique compounds, along with their IC50 values targeting NS3 and NS5 respectively, were retrieved from the ChEMBL and DenvInD databases. Molecular descriptors and fingerprints were computed and used to train multiple regression-based MLTs, including SVM, RF, kNN, ANN, XGBoost, and DNN, with ten-fold cross-validation. The best-performing SVM and ANN models achieved Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of 0.857/0.862 (NS3) and 0.982/0.964 (NS5) on training/testing sets, and 0.870/0.894 (NS3) and 0.970/0.977 (NS5) on independent validation sets. Model robustness was supported through scatter plots, chemical clustering, statistical analyses, decoy set etc. Virtual screening identified Micafungin, Oritavancin, and Iodixanol as top hits for NS2B/NS3 protease, and Cangrelor, Eravacycline, and Baloxavir marboxil for NS5 polymerase. Molecular docking further confirmed strong binding affinities of these compounds. Our <i>in-silico</i> findings suggest these repurposed drugs as promising antiviral candidates against DENV. However, further <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies are essential to validate their therapeutic potential.

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of oral AT-752 (750 mg thrice daily for 5 days) compared with a placebo in 21 adults with confirmed dengue infection. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in viral load via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing, with assessments performed daily on Days 1-8, 14, and 28. The primary endpoint was nonevaluable because many patients presented late during the course of disease, with low baseline viremia levels precluding accurate quantification at subsequent timepoints. In the as-treated population (patients with assessment at baseline and at each post-baseline timepoint), the numerical mean reduction (versus baseline) in viral load on Day 4 was greater in the AT-752 group than the placebo group (P = 0.0022). The median time to a sustained resolution of fever (the major clinical sign of dengue) was 4 days in the AT-752 group compared with >5 days in the placebo group; the reduction in oral temperature at the Day 4 timepoint was greater in the AT-752 group (treatment difference: 0.84°C; P = 0.0322). There was a trend toward faster platelet recovery in the AT-752 group compared with the placebo group, and proportionally fewer patients in the AT-752 group underwent hospitalization for disease progression (one patient in each group).

        "abstract": "Progressive unilateral hearing loss (PUHL) in adolescents is uncommon and presents diagnostic challenges due to its varied etiologies, including infections, ototoxicity, congenital anomalies, and autoimmune conditions, though many cases remain idiopathic. We report a 16-year-old male with a history of COVID-19, dengue at age 14, and recurrent headaches, who developed left-sided hearing loss progressing to profound unilateral deafness. Audiometry confirmed sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of 97 dB HL in the left ear and 35 dB HL in the right. Despite multiple evaluations, no definitive etiology was identified. Differential diagnoses included post-viral sequelae, congenital anomalies (e.g., Mondini dysplasia), and nasal obstruction, though insurance limitations restricted further testing. The patient discontinued hearing aid use due to limited benefit and experienced social withdrawal, impacting both academic performance and overall well-being. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and a systematic, multidisciplinary approach to PUHL, including imaging and genetic testing, given its potential impact on social development, mental health, and long-term outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is a multifunctional regulator involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and glucose metabolism. In this study, we investigated the role of TXNIP in viral infection and its potential as a therapeutic target. Our findings reveal that HSV-1 infection induces TXNIP upregulation, and elevated TXNIP levels promote viral replication by inhibiting MAVS aggregation. This inhibition disrupts the TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway, leading to reduced interferon-beta (IFN-β) production and impaired antiviral immunity. Conversely, TXNIP knockout significantly suppresses HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, we utilized Luteolin, a TXNIP degrader previously reported by our group, which restores MAVS aggregation and enhances antiviral responses, demonstrating potent antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this mechanism was also validated in dengue virus (DENV2) infection, suggesting a broader role for TXNIP in immune regulation. These findings establish TXNIP as a critical modulator of viral infection and highlight TXNIP degraders as promising candidates for antiviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes account for the highest number of infections among vector-borne diseases and continue to present a formidable global health challenge. Due to the nonavailability of direct treatment of dengue, vector control relies on the use of insecticides currently dominated by pyrethroids. Recurring applications of these insecticides lead to transgenerational impacts on their fitness and resistance dynamics. This study investigates the threat to vector control techniques by altered biological fitness, metabolic and molecular properties after selection with permethrin exposure. Populations of Ae. aegypti were treated with a sublethal dose of permethrin (LC<sub>50</sub>) in each generation, and their resistance status, together with its effect on biological fitness and transgenerational features, were analysed. To understand the different mechanisms of resistance development, detoxifying enzyme activity, the presence of kdr mutation and cuticular thickness were also analysed. Throughout the study, a prolonged larval and pupal stage was noted with reduced fecundity and hatchability. Moreover, biochemical assays revealed a major role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases behind permethrin resistance, which was supported by a piperonyl butoxide assay. Major kdr mutations F1534C and V1016G were also found. Overall, reduction in life traits of resistant populations may seem in favour of vector management but this may be the manipulative strategy of Ae. aegypti to divert the essential fuels away from these features and invest it towards the maintenance of insecticide resistance. Therefore, to effectively combat resistance, insecticides must be used judiciously as part of a comprehensive strategy that includes non-insecticide methods and regular surveillance.",

We conducted a retrospective study over 11 years (2014-2024) in the pediatric emergency and intensive care units of a quaternary hospital in North India. Children aged one month to 12 years diagnosed with ANEC were enrolled. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging findings, etiology, management, and outcomes were collected. The ANEC Severity Score (ANE-SS) was calculated. Thirty-two children were included (median age, 4 [interquartile range, 1-7] years; 53.1% male). Common clinical features included altered state of consciousness (96.9%), fever (93.7%), seizures (78.1%), and signs of raised intracranial pressure (46.9%). Organ dysfunctions included encephalopathy (100%), transaminitis (56.2%), and thrombocytopenia (46.9%). Neuroimaging revealed bilateral thalamic involvement in all cases. Etiology was identified in 37.5%, most commonly dengue virus (21.9%), followed by H1N1 (6.2%). Intensive care interventions included mechanical ventilation (56.2%) and vasoactive drugs (31.2%). Immunomodulatory therapy included methylprednisolone (78.1%), intravenous immunoglobulin (25%), and tocilizumab (15.6%). Survival rate was 78.1%. At discharge, the median Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score was 3 (3-4), indicating moderate to severe disability. High-risk ANE-SS was significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.007). ANEC remains a severe pediatric encephalopathy with high neuromorbidity. Dengue virus was the most common trigger in this cohort. Early identification and intensive care support, along with immunomodulation, are key. ANE-SS may serve as a valuable prognostic tool.",

Natural products, especially plant-derived compounds, have been crucial in drug discovery and often serve as scaffolds for synthetic drug development. This study focused on modifying paulownin, an isolated lignan, through a Click reaction to incorporate 1,2,3-triazole and quinolinic ring frameworks. The resulting derivative 7 was evaluated for its in vitro antiviral activity against Alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV). The paulownin derivative 7 did not exhibit cytotoxicity in Vero cells and demonstrated potent activity against CHIKV, with median effective concentration value of 9.05 µM and a selectivity index exceeding 16.8. Furthermore, compound 7 outperformed positive controls, being over 46 times more active against CHIKV. Cytopathic effect assays confirmed this anti-CHIKV activity. The virucidal assay indicated that the compound does not exert a direct effect on CHIKV particles before cell infection. RT-qPCR studies further demonstrated derivative 7 significantly reduces CHIKV replication. These findings highlight the paulownin derivative 7 as a promising and selective candidate for CHIKV treatment.",

        "abstract": "Epidemic-prone infectious diseases (EPIDs) such as dengue fever, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leptospirosis, Marburg virus disease, measles and cholera, to name a few, place a significant burden on the Tanzanian population and health system. Clinicians working in primary health facilities (PHFs), such as dispensaries, health centres, and basic hospitals, play a vital role in detecting cases and outbreaks. However, they often face challenges, including insufficient knowledge of these diseases and a lack of supporting resources, including surveillance guidelines, standard case definitions, and, most importantly, access to confirmatory diagnostic tests. Although Tanzania reports outbreaks of infectious diseases almost every year, a significant number of cases go undetected and contribute to delayed response and recurrent outbreaks. Smartphone-based clinical diagnostic decision support systems (CDSS) have been proven to help bridge case detection gaps. The Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (ESIDA) project proposed developing the ESIDA app, a smartphone-based CDSS, to aid clinicians in the detection of EPIDs. Before developing the app, the ESIDA project evaluated its acceptability among clinicians, the primary target users. The aim was to gather insights to inform the app development, ensuring its design and features are relevant and applicable in Tanzania context. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 clinicians, including medical doctors and clinical officers from public and private facilities in the Dar es Salaam region, which has reported frequent outbreaks of dengue and cholera. Data were collected and analyzed using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Clinicians were positive about the proposed ESIDA app and intended to use it once it was available. The facilitators and barriers to acceptability focused on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. Expected benefits, ease of use, and government involvement emerged as facilitators of acceptability, while high internet costs, workload, time constraints, infrastructure gaps, and patient resistance were identified as potential barriers. The development of the ESIDA app should prioritize maximizing system performance and benefits. They must also be user-friendly and in line with social norms. The necessary infrastructure must be in place for effective implementation.",

        "abstract": "Infections may be associated with an increased risk of poor brain health and frailty among older people, but evidence from low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. We aimed to investigate associations between nine infections and cognition, depression, and frailty in India. We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from Wave 1 (2017–2019) of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) survey of adults (≥ 45years) from 35 of India’s 36 states and union territories. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews and direct health measurements. We investigated the association between nine infections, either self-reported ever (periodontal disease) or in the two years before interview (jaundice/hepatitis, malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid, chikungunya, diarrhoea/gastroenteritis, dengue, urinary tract infection [UTI]), and measured global cognitive function, depression, and frailty. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to compare odds of impaired cognition, depression, and frailty in people with and without infections, overall and for individual infections. We included 64,682 respondents; median age 59 years (IQR:50–67), 53.5% female, 35% reported at least one infection. After controlling for demographic, social/environmental and lifestyle factors, and chronic health conditions, we saw evidence of associations between infection and both depression (OR: 1.28 [95%CI: 1.22–1.35]) and frailty (OR: 1.74 [95%CI: 1.65–1.84]). UTIs were associated with the highest odds of both depression (OR: 1.33 [95%CI: 1.14, 1.55) and frailty (OR: 2.94 [95%CI: 2.51, 3.44]). Reporting at least one infection was associated with reduced odds of impaired cognition (OR: 0.80 [95%CI: 0.74–0.86]). Our results suggest infections are associated with increased depression and frailty in adults over 45 in India. Our finding of association between reported infections and better cognition, is potentially explained by preferential infection recall in those with better cognition. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate potential causal links between infections and adverse brain health and frailty and guide interventions to improve the health of older people in India and other LMICs.

This study assessed age-specific immune responses and the effects of vaccination on neutralization against wild-type (WT) and JN.1 variants. We analyzed 4,371 serum samples from individuals aged 6 months-80 years (May-August 2024). We found that 95.1% of participants had detectable anti-N Ig, suggesting widespread prior infection. Among unvaccinated children (6 months-4 years), 96.5% exhibited anti-RBD or anti-N Ig antibodies mostly from asymptomatic infections. Neutralization against JN.1 did not significantly differ by age, but children aged 6 months-4 years exhibited higher JN.1 neutralization than WT, while individuals aged ≥ 12 years showed the opposite pattern. Unvaccinated individuals demonstrated stronger neutralization against JN.1, whereas vaccinated participants had lower neutralization against JN.1 relative to WT, regardless of vaccine dose. No significant differences in JN.1 neutralization were observed across vaccine doses or age groups. Although 86.5% of participants exhibited neutralizing activity against JN.1, the titers remained relatively low. These findings highlight that almost all children experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that natural exposure maintains immunity in adults. Infection-driven boosting may improve community-wide protection and alleviate immune imprinting, offering key insights for optimizing vaccine strategies.",

        "abstract": "Climate change and global warming significantly affect the incidence and distribution of infectious ocular diseases. This narrative review explores how climate-related factors-including extreme weather events, precipitation, temperature fluctuations, humidity, wind patterns, ultraviolet radiation, and air pollution-can directly and indirectly influence the burden of ocular infections. By synthesizing evidence from the published literature, we examine how these environmental variables impact disease mechanisms such as pathogen survival, transmission dynamics, and host susceptibility. Increased precipitation has been associated with a higher incidence and recurrence of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), likely due to the enhanced spread of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts through contaminated water and soil. Rainfall also creates breeding habitats for mosquitoes, facilitating the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Rift Valley fever. Rising temperatures and humidity have been linked to increased rates of fungal infections, particularly fungal keratitis in tropical regions. Wind has been implicated in the airborne dispersal of pathogens, including fungal spores, T. gondii oocysts, and insect-derived particles such as moth setae, potentially contributing to OT and seasonal hyperacute panuveitis. Air pollution further exacerbates dry eye disease, which influences the vulnerability to microbial keratitis. These climate-related shifts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations-particularly those living in rural, low-income, and tropical areas. This review highlights the urgent need for further research into climate-sensitive mechanisms of ocular infections and the development of targeted adaptation strategies to mitigate their impact on global eye health.",

Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), C-reactive protein, ferritin, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured, along with the height, weight, and waist circumference. AST, ALT, CRP, and ferritin levels were significantly higher in patients with central obesity (waist circumference of ≥80 cm in women or ≥90 cm in men) compared with leaner individuals. ALT and CRP levels were also significantly higher in patients with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 4-HNE levels significantly increased with the rise in AST levels and with ALT levels, although the increase was not significant. In contrast, MDA levels gradually decreased with the rise in AST levels and ALT levels. There were no differences in 4-HNE and MDA levels in relation to clinical disease severity. However, MDA levels were significantly higher in younger individuals and leaner individuals with a normal BMI. Furthermore, MDA levels inversely correlated with serum ferritin levels, while AST, ALT, and CRP levels significantly correlated with ferritin levels. 4-HNE and MDA appear to play different roles in the pathogenesis of Dengue, which should be further investigated for identification of therapeutic targets for treatment of Dengue.",

We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction.

        "abstract": "Vaccines are essential for the prevention and control of several diseases, and monitoring the immune response generated by vaccines is crucial. The immune response generated by vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents is not well defined in terms of the intensity and medium to long-term duration of protective immunity, which may indicate the need for booster doses and could support decisions in public health. The study aims to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in a two-dose primary protocol in children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years old in Brazil. Participants were invited to the research at two public healthcare centers located in Serrana (São Paulo) and Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais), Brazil. They underwent medical interviews to gather their medical history, including COVID-19 history and medical records. Physical exams were conducted, which included measurements of weight, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate. Blood samples were obtained from the participants before vaccination, 1 month after the first dose, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the second dose. These samples were followed up using a virtual platform to monitor post-vaccination reactions and symptoms of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 genome from swab samples of COVID-19 positive individuals was sequenced using NGS. Total antibodies were measured by ELISA, and neutralizing antibodies to the B.1 lineage and Omicron variant (BA.1) were quantified by PRNT and VNT assays. The cellular immune response was evaluated by flow cytometry through the quantification of systemic soluble immune mediators. The follow-up of 640 participants showed that CoronaVac was able to significantly induce the production of total IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the production of neutralizing antibodies to the B.1 lineage and Omicron variant. Additionally, a robust cellular immune response was observed, characterized by a wide release of pro-inflammatory and regulatory mediators in the early post-immunization moments. Adverse events recorded so far have been mild and transient, except for seven serious adverse events reported on VigiMed. The results indicate a robust and sustained immune response induced by CoronaVac in children and adolescents for up to six months, providing evidence to support the safety and immunogenicity of this effective immunizer.",

        "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) poses a critical health threat causing millions of cases every year. The absence of proof-reading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) leads to significant mutations in its genome. This may result in genetic diversity among the genotypes which contribute to severe complications during the infection. Targeting these mutations may help to understand the viral transmission and identify a potential treatment. An aggregate of 152 dengue positive serum samples were collected from different tertiary care hospitals in Karachi. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis as well as amplification of the C-prM region was performed, followed by the Sanger sequencing. The resultant sequences of each serotype were aligned with their respective genome sequences and phylogenetic trees based on genotypes were constructed using Maximum Likelihood (ML) method with 1000 bootstraps replicates. The sequences were then converted to the amino acid sequence and genetic variations in comparison to the reference genomes were evaluated. The results showed that there was a higher number of positive cases in males (58%) than in females (42%). The most affected age group was 21-30. The study suggested that the dominant serotype in the population of Karachi was DENV-1 (78.33%), followed by DENV- 2 (15%) and DENV-3 (6.66%). Overall, the acquired data provide the information about genetic variation in the C-prM region of dengue virus in Karachi, Pakistan.",

        "abstract": "Despite dengue being a major public health problem, there are no antiviral or adjunctive treatments for the disease. Novel therapeutics are needed, particularly for patients at high risk of severe disease, including those living with obesity. Metformin reduces dengue viral replication in vitro through AMPK activation and may also have beneficial immunomodulatory effects. We conducted an open label trial at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, enrolling 120 patients with dengue and obesity (60 treatment arm, 60 control arm receiving standard of care only). Within the treatment arm, the first 10 patients were prescribed low dose metformin, and the remaining 50 patients received weight-based dosing of 1-1.5g/day. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events (AEs), and secondary outcomes were clinical and laboratory parameters, including fever clearance time, platelet nadir, percentage of haematocrit change from baseline, maximum creatinine and highest AST/ALT, and the kinetics of plasma viraemia and NS1 antigenaemia. The majority of patients in both groups had dengue with warning signs. Six patients in the metformin group and 5 controls developed dengue shock syndrome, and no patients died. There were more AEs recorded in the metformin treated group than in the control group (mean±SD: 15 ± 4 vs. 11 ± 6), particularly the high-dose metformin group (15 ± 5). Twenty-five patients (42%) had to stop the study drug due to AEs, including severe diarrhea (n = 12), dengue shock (n = 5), increased lactate of >3mmol/L (n = 4), hypoglycemia (n = 3), and persistent vomiting (n = 1). There were no clear differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups. Metformin was poorly tolerated in patients with dengue, mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects. Metformin did not beneficially affect clinical evolution or virological parameters compared to supportive care alone. Our data does not support progression to larger phase 3 trials of metformin in patients with dengue. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04377451 (May 6th, 2020).",

        "abstract": "In2Care traps combining an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen) with an entomopathogen (Beauveria bassiana) have been developed as an effective way of reducing mosquito populations with promising results. Here, we test the technology in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In2Care traps might be particularly suitable in Jeddah because harsh climatic conditions in the hot dry season may limit Aedes movement when mosquitoes likely persist in localized sites around underground car parks and other built structures. After 8 wk of deployment, the proportion of positive traps in the intervention area was gradually reduced by 39% in the unfavorable season compared with a control area. No adults emerged from In2Care traps. Breeding containers placed in the trial site, 3 wk after termination of the trial, showed a range of emergence values from 0 to 100% compared with controls where emergence was always >80%. In subsequent interventions in three other sites, we obtained reductions of 30% to 52% based on positive traps and egg numbers per trap. However, the intervention did not reduce numbers at one site which was expected to be a mosquito hotspot and subsequently shown to have an estimated mosquito population 5.2× larger than the adjacent control area. The clear reduction at some sites and an increasing reduction in numbers over time at others, several weeks after post-In2Care monitoring operations were completed, highlight the potential of the In2Care approach in this environment. The approach could help to reduce routine pesticide-based fogging that forms the mainstay of current control measures in Jeddah.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever represents an escalating global health threat, as unprecedented outbreaks expose significant limitations of current vaccine strategies. Conventional live-attenuated dengue vaccines, while partially efficacious, face critical hurdles including serotype imbalances and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This review critically assesses virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines as a promising alternative, providing safer, non-replicating platforms that mimic viral structure without risks associated with live replication. Technological advancements in recombinant expression systems have improved VLP yield, stability, and scalability, addressing deployment obstacles. Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that tetravalent dengue VLP vaccines induce balanced neutralizing antibodies across all serotypes, effectively circumventing ADE in animal models. These findings suggest superior safety and robust immune responses, potentially surpassing live-attenuated and mRNA-based vaccines. We emphasize advancements in VLP vaccine technology, including novel tetravalent particle designs engineered to exclude ADE-related immunopathogenic components (prM protein), innovative stability-enhancing formulation techniques, and cost-effective recombinant production platforms (yeast and plant-based systems). Additionally, this review proposes novel deployment strategies, such as regional manufacturing hubs, standardized modular VLP platforms, adaptive clinical trial frameworks leveraging surrogate endpoints, and strengthened international coordination for equitable vaccine distribution. Integrating these scientific innovations and practical strategies positions dengue VLP vaccines as pivotal next-generation solutions for global dengue prevention.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with over half the world's population at risk. Infection with any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes is most often self-limiting, but a significant number of cases present with severe dengue characterized by vascular leakage that may be fatal. African ancestry is associated with protection against severe dengue, but the mechanisms are unknown. Using skin explants from genetically defined donors, we show that European ancestry skin has a much stronger inflammatory response to DENV than African ancestry skin, eliciting markedly increased infiltration, infection and migration of resident Langerhans cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The effect was seen with all dengue serotypes and Zika virus and in the presence of heterotypic immune serum. Genetic pathways associated with inflammation, interferon (IFN)-α, and inflammatory cytokine signaling were enriched in European relative to African ancestry skin following infection. Infiltration and infection of macrophages in African ancestry skin increased to that of European skin after blocking IFN-α and providing interleukin-1β. Polymorphic variants in <i>RXRA</i>, <i>OAS1-3,</i> and <i>TGFB1</i> genes that were more frequent in European donors were associated with increased virus replication. Paradoxically, European ancestry skin cells had increased expression of OAS3 in response to virus and type I IFN. Thus, the limited inflammatory response of African ancestry skin to infection restricts replication and spread of dengue and other flaviviruses. Genetic ancestry should be considered when predicting a patient's likelihood of severe dengue, and when assessing efficacy and adverse events associated with dengue vaccines.",

        "title": "Dengue diagnosis and impact on clinical management: A literature review.",
        "abstract": "Dengue is a re-emerging infectious disease that poses substantial challenges to healthcare systems in endemic regions, such as West Africa. Owing to its nonspecific and overlapping clinical symptoms - including fever, rash, headache, joint pains, nausea, vomiting - many cases go unrecognized or are misdiagnosed. Consequently, patients are often inappropriately treated with antimalarial or antibiotic therapies. Such mismanagement not only affects patient outcomes but also contributes to the development of antimicrobial and antimalarial drug resistance within these populations. This literature review aimed to describe the patterns and impact of dengue diagnosis in West Africa. A comprehensive electronic database search of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted using keywords related to dengue, chikungunya, acute febrile illness, diagnostic strategies, and clinical management. Additional manual searches was performed through Google Scholar and relevant conference proceedings. Eligible studies included observational, real-world evidence, or interventional research conducted in West Africa involving adult patients diagnosed with dengue or chikungunya. Inclusion criteria required studies to report on diagnostic approaches and/or clinical management strategies. Due to the limited availability of data on chikungunya, this review focused exclusively on dengue. Ten studies from Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Nigeria were included in this review. Rapid serologic testing (DENGUE NS1, IgG, IgM) was the most frequently used diagnostic tools, used in 60% of the studies. Clinical management of dengue primarily involved the administration of antipyretics, fluid therapy, and blood transfusions when necessary. In five studies, antimalarial treatments were systematically prescribed despite negative malaria results. Additionally, two studies reported the use of antibiotics without confirmed bacterial infection or supporting biological diagnosis, indicating inappropriate antibiotic use. Evidence on dengue diagnosis and related clinical management in West Africa remains limited. The available data indicate a widespread underuse of diagnosis tools and frequent misuse of antimalarial and antibiotic therapies in the management of dengue. Future studies should prioritize evaluating the impact of accurate differential diagnosis between dengue and malaria on patient care, particularly regarding the inappropriate use of antibiotics and antimalarials. Moreover, integrating routine diagnostic testing into standard clinical practice, as recommended by health authorities, could significantly improve current management. This would enable clinicians to more accurately diagnose dengue, malaria, other febrile illnesses, and potential co-infections, ultimately reducing the misuse of antimicrobial treatments.",

We present a similar case of a 27-year-old female diagnosed with DHF, reporting the development of aspergillosis during recovery from dengue fever. The patient presented with persistent high-grade fever, vomiting, hypotension, and body aches. Lab results showed a dropping platelet count and raised inflammatory markers. Dengue serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was positive. She had on-and-off episodes of shivering for which a malarial parasite smear was ordered, which came back negative. Chest X-ray showed a heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics (tazobactam + piperacillin and amikacin sulphate) along with IV dexamethasone. Chest physiotherapy and regular nebulization were also done. A bronchoscopy was performed, which was turbid. No acid-fast bacilli were found, but budding yeast cells were identified. The patient was put on voriconazole oral tablet, after which she became afebrile, and her oxygen saturation started stabilizing. There was a significant improvement in lab results and radiological investigations as well. She was discharged after a month of initial presentation, with antifungal medication until the next follow-up.

Without an effective antiviral therapy, an accurate diagnosis of the four viruses, DENV1-4, is crucial for patient management and outcome. We aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy and usefulness of a commercial DENV antigen rapid diagnostic test kit in point-of-care conditions. Six-hundred-forty-six patients with fever or history of fever, and without leukocytosis, were enrolled from Tabanan General Hospital, Bali in 2017-2018. All sera were tested for DENV NS1 antigen using the Standard Diagnostics Bioline NS1 Ag rapid test kit and <i>Flavivirus</i> genus specific RT-PCR. Positive specimens were further confirmed using DENV multiplex RT-PCR. DENV was detected in 10.4% (67/646) of enrolled patients by molecular assays. Only 41 of the positives were found to be positive by the NS1 rapid test. Our findings indicate that the kit was the most sensitive in the first 2 days after disease onset with sensitivity > 75%, and declining at day 3 with a sensitivity of <60%. In addition, the kit was found to be the most sensitive to DENV-2 and least sensitive to DENV-4. Overall, the kit had a sensitivity of 59.7% [95% CI: 44.5-74.9] and specificity of 99.8% [95% CI: 99.5-100.0]. Our evaluation indicated that the rapid diagnostic test is useful for both surveillance and initial detection of DENV infection in community settings.

        "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a growing public health concern worldwide, as one of the leading causes of vision impairment. We aimed to estimate global, national, and region-specific prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) along with tobacco as a modifiable risk factor to aid public policy addressing AMD. Data on AMD were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study 2021 database in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2021. Vision impairment was defined and categorised by severity as follows: moderate to severe vision loss (visual acuity from <6/18 to 3/60) and blindness (visual acuity <3/60 or a visual field <10 degrees around central fixation). The burden of vision impairment attributable to AMD was subsequently estimated. These estimates were further stratified by geographical region, age, year, sex, Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) levels. Additionally, the effect of tobacco use, a modifiable risk factor, on the burden of AMD was analysed, and projections of AMD burden were estimated through to 2050. These projections also included scenario modelling to assess the potential effects of tobacco elimination. Globally, the number of individuals with vision impairment due to AMD more than doubled, rising from 3·64 million (95% uncertainty inverval [UI] 3·04-4·35) in 1990 to 8·06 million (6·71-9·82) in 2021. Similarly, DALYs increased by 91% over the same period, from 0·30 million (95% UI 0·21-0·42) to 0·58 million (0·40-0·80). By contrast, age-standardised prevalence and DALY rates declined, with prevalence rates decreasing by 5·53% (99·50 per 100 000 of the population [95% UI 83·16-118·04] in 1990 to 94·00 [78·32-114·42] in 2021) and DALY rates dropping by 19·09% (8·38 [5·70-11·53] to 6·78 [4·70-9·32]). These rates showed a consistent decrease in higher SDI quintiles, reflecting the negative correlation between HAQ Index and AMD burden. A general downward trend was observed from 1990 to 2021, with the largest age-standardised reduction occurring in the low-middle SDI quintile. The global contribution of tobacco to age-standardised DALYs decreased by 20%, declining from 12·45% (95% UI 7·73-17·37) in 1990 to 9·96% (6·12-14·06) in 2021. By 2050, the number of individuals affected by AMD is projected to increase from 3·40 million males (95% UI 2·81-4·17) in 2021 to 9·02 million (5·72-14·20) and from 4·66 million females (3·88-5·65) to 12·32 million (8·88-17·08). Eliminating tobacco use could reduce these numbers to 8·17 million males (5·59-11·92) and 11·15 million females (8·58-14·48) in 2050. While the total prevalence and DALYs due to AMD have steadily increased from 1990 to 2021, age-standardised prevalence and DALY rates have declined, probably reflecting the effect of population ageing and growth. The consistent decrease in age-standardised rates with higher SDI levels highlights the crucial role of health-care resources and public policies in mitigating AMD-related vision impairment. The downward trend observed from 1990 to 2021 might also be partially attributed to the reduced effect of tobacco as a modifiable risk factor, with declines in tobacco use seen globally and across all SDI quintiles. The burden of vision impairment due to AMD is projected to increase to about 21·34 million in 2050. However, effective tobacco regulation has the potential to substantially reduce AMD-related vision impairment, particularly in lower SDI quintiles where health-care resources are limited.

        "title": "What is the optimal In2Care stations density to achieve Aedes aegypti population reduction in a dengue endemic setting?",
        "abstract": "Autodissemination traps are among the most innovative strategies for suppressing mosquito vector populations. These traps are particularly effective against Aedes aegypti due to the species' skip oviposition behavior, where eggs from a single clutch are distributed across multiple breeding sites. Evaluating the efficacy of different densities of In2Care stations under large-scale field conditions is crucial for understanding their potential impact on Ae. aegypti populations. A total of 3,250 In2Care stations were deployed in Goiânia, the 10th largest city in Brazil, with an estimated population of 1.45 million. The field study lasted 14 months, with each station serviced bi-monthly. To assess the impact of In2Care, ovitraps were installed and inspected weekly to measure changes in the number of positive ovitraps and the average number of eggs laid by Ae. aegypti females in intervention areas compared to control neighborhoods. Over the course of the study, 666,204 eggs were sampled. The density of In2Care stations varied across neighborhoods, ranging from 220 to 555 stations per km2. In the high-density area (~555 stations per km2), the Ovitrap Positivity Index (OPI) decreased from 56.9% to 31.5%, while the average number of eggs per positive paddle dropped from 41.2 to 18.1-representing a 56% reduction in egg counts. Conversely, in the low- and medium-density, no significant effect was observed. The recommended density of In2Care is about 2500 stations per Km2. Our results demonstrated stations density 4.5 times lower than the recommended density is able to reduce the frequency of positive ovitraps and the number of eggs collected on them. entomological indexes. Additional fieldwork in other entomological and epidemiological settings are needed to evaluate whether the In2Care density of ~555 units/Km2 observed for Goiânia was site-dependent or if it has borader applicability. Our results show that In2Care stations can effectively suppress Ae. aegypti populations over large geographic areas, with efficacy likely influenced by trap density.",

This Phase 0 study investigated dengue infections among household contacts (HHCs) of dengue index cases (ICs) and assessed the feasibility of conducting a Phase 2 trial for a novel antiviral. Participants were enrolled in Nha Trang, Vietnam, from April 2022 to February 2023. Dengue ICs were identified within 72 h of fever onset, and their healthy adult HHCs enrolled within 48 h. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected bi-weekly for four weeks, with a follow-up visit on day 40. DENV RT-qPCR, NS1, and anti-DENV IgM/IgG ELISAs were performed. Overall, 130 dengue ICs and 301 HHCs were enrolled, with 91.7% (276/301) completing all follow-up visits. Baseline anti-DENV IgG showed prior dengue infections in 262/301 HHCs (87.0%). Fifty HHCs were excluded from the HHC infection analysis based on evidence of a DENV infection (viral load [VL], NS1, IgM, and IgG results) at enrollment. During follow-up, 2.0% of HHCs (5/251) had DENV infections based on virological parameters (DENV RNA and/or NS1 positivity), and anti-DENV IgG/IgM seroconversion was detected in 7.2% (18/251). This study demonstrated the operational feasibility of a dengue IC-HHC design for a Phase 2 trial.",

        "abstract": "Dengue is an arthropod borne viral illness which infects millions of people each year. Despite the huge global losses, an effective medication is still unavailable against the disease. For vaccine development, reverse vaccinology approach is being tremendously used as it saves time, energy, cost and resources by selecting the potential epitopes for developing an effective vaccine formulation. In our previous study, we have also used reverse vaccinology approach to propose a multi-epitope vaccine formulation (dvac) against dengue, by targeting the conserved epitopes from all of its serotypes. In this study, we have performed population coverage analysis and molecular dynamic simulation studies which predicted that dvac could offer protection to 98.5% of world population against dengue and forms stable interactions with TLR3/TLR4 receptors, respectively. Moreover, we have performed in-lab gene cloning and expression analysis of dvac in Escherichia coli. The purified dvac is subjected to anti-NS1, anti-dNS1 and anti-EDIII antibodies, raised in rabbits, and the ELISA results confirmed the individuality and intactness of the epitopes incorporated in the refolded dvac molecule. The results from this study endorse the use of dvac as a potential dengue vaccine candidate and also support the reverse vaccinology approach for developing novel therapeutic formulations.",

        "title": "Identifying hypaphorine as a novel antiviral compound against dengue virus.",
        "abstract": "Approximately 390 million individuals globally are infected with dengue virus annually. Notably, no specific therapeutic strategy has been clinically approved for dengue fever to date. In this study, molecular docking screening against the methyltransferase (MTase) domain of the dengue virus (DENV) NS5 protein unveiled hypaphorine as a high-affinity ligand, with calculated binding energies of -6.657 kcal/mol (DENV2) and -6.663 kcal/mol (DENV3). This computational prediction was subsequently validated via cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi), collectively demonstrating direct target engagement with a dissociation constant (KD) of 2.19 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M. Functional characterization revealed that hypaphorine exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of MTase enzymatic activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 29.9 μM). In antiviral assays, hypaphorine displayed dose-dependent suppression of viral replication in both BHK-21 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 18.85 μM) and Huh-7 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 15.7 μM), while maintaining low cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> = 605.8 μM and 617.3 μM, respectively). Time-course analyses indicated maximal antiviral efficacy when hypaphorine was administered either pre- or post-infection (<24 hpi), which is consistent with the role of MTase in viral RNA capping during successive rounds of virus replication. The reduction in viral titer was found to correlate with MTase inhibition, thereby establishing a clear structure-activity relationship. These findings systematically characterize hypaphorine as a first-in-class natural MTase inhibitor, highlighting the utility of structure-guided approaches in anti-flaviviral drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "<i>Aedes aegypti</i>, the main urban vector of dengue fever, represents a growing public health problem in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. Identifying the factors influencing the distribution and productivity of its breeding sites is essential for the development of effective control strategies. From May 2023 to April 2024, physico-chemical characteristics were recorded and mosquito larvae were collected, using a standard dipping method, from 60 water collections each month during the dry season and twice a month during the rainy season, totaling 294 observations. The larval positivity of water collections and larval abundance of breeding sites over the time were modeled using a random-effect logistic regression model and a negative binomial regression model, respectively. The depth, distance from habitat, type of water collection and exposure to sunlight were statistically significant and independently associated with water collection positivity for <i>Ae. aegypti</i> larvae (aOR = 5.18, 95%CI [1.66-16.18], <i>p</i>-value = 0.005; aOR = 0.00, 95%CI [0.00-0.02], <i>p</i>-value < 0.001; aOR = 252.88, 95%CI [4.05-15,786.84], <i>p</i>-value = 0.009 and aOR = 0.04, 95%CI [0.01-0.26], <i>p</i>-value < 0.001, respectively). <i>Aedes aegypti</i> larval habitats were mainly artificial (90%), temporary (<i>n</i> = 217 observations), close to dwellings (<i>n</i> = 114) and shaded (<i>n</i> = 96). Plastic water tanks (<i>n</i> = 17, 48.6%), wells (<i>n</i> = 6, 17.1%) and barrels (<i>n</i> = 4, 11.4%) were the most common breeding sites. Larval abundance was negatively associated with containers of increasing pH and surface area (aOR = 0.50, 95%CI [0.33-0.75] <i>p</i>-value = 0.001 and aOR = 0.48, 95%CI [0.27-0.87], <i>p</i>-value = 0.016, respectively). As <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes are multi-resistant to adult insecticides and dengue has become endemo-epidemic since 2014, vector control should give the priority to the physical removal or treatment of shaded, peridomestic containers-particularly plastic water tanks and barrels-and consider the use of biological larvicides to target breeding sites with low pH and small surface areas.",

This study searched the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and JSTOR databases for publications on the prevalence of parasitic coinfection in people living with viruses from 1 January 2005 to 30 April 2022, and 356 studies were included and systematically reviewed. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the global prevalence of and factors potentially associated with parasitic infection (helminths and protozoa) in virus-infected people, and the infection burden was estimated. A variety of parasites (29 families, 39 genera, and 63 species) and viruses (8 kinds) were identified. The prevalence of parasitic coinfection in (all) virus-infected people was estimated to be 21.34% (95% CI 17.58-25.10, 5593 of 29,190 participants) and 34.13% (95% CI 31.32-36.94, 21,243/76,072 participants) for helminths and protozoa, respectively. Specially, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people, the global prevalence was 19.96% (95% CI 16.18-23.74) for helminths and 34.18% (95% CI 31.33-37.03) for protozoa, respectively. The global prevalence of protozoa was 41.79% (95% CI 15.88-67.69) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected people and 17.75% (95% CI 3.54-31.95) in DENV-infected people, respectively. The global burden of parasitic infections in HIV-infected people was 7,664,640 for helminths and 13,125,120 for protozoa, respectively, and that in HBV- and dengue virus (DENV)-infected people was 137,019,428 and 629,952, respectively. The prevalence of parasitic coinfection at the family, genus, and species levels in virus- or HIV-infected people were comprehensively estimated and further analyzed by subgroups. Among the most commonly identified parasites, the five helminth genera with the highest prevalence in HIV-infected people were <i>Schistosoma</i> (12.46%, 95% CI 5.82-19.10), <i>Ascaris</i> (7.82%, 95% CI 6.15-9.49), <i>Strongyloides</i> (5.43%, 95% CI 4.11-6.74), <i>Trichuris</i> (4·82%, 95% CI 2.48-7.17) and <i>Ancylostoma</i> (2.79%, 95% CI 1.32-4.27), whereas the top five protozoan genera were <i>Toxoplasma</i> (48.85%, 95% CI 42.01-55.69), <i>Plasmodium</i> (34.96%, 95% CI 28.11-41.82), <i>Cryptosporidium</i> (14.27%, 95% CI 11.49-17.06), <i>Entamoeba</i> (12.33%, 95% CI 10.09-14.57) and <i>Blastocystis</i> (10.61%, 95% CI 6.26-14.97).

        "abstract": "A country with continental dimensions like Brazil, characterized by heterogeneity of climates, biomes, natural resources, population density, socioeconomic conditions, and regional challenges, also exhibits significant spatial variation in dengue outbreaks. This study aimed to characterize Brazilian territory based on epidemiological and climate data to determine the optimal time to guide preventive and control strategies. To achieve this, the Moving Epidemics Method (MEM) was employed to analyze dengue historical patterns using 14-year disease data (2010-2023) aggregated by the 120 Brazilian Health Macro-Regions (HMR). Statistical outputs from MEM included the mean outbreak onset, duration, and variation of these measurements, pre- and post-epidemic thresholds, and the high-intensity level of cases. Environmental data used includes mean annual precipitation, temperature, and altitude, as well as the Köppen Climate Classification of each area. A multivariate cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm was applied to MEM outputs and climate data. Four clusters/regions were identified, with the mean temperature, mean precipitation, mean outbreak onset, high-intensity level of cases, and mean altitude explaining 80% of the centroid variation among the clusters. Region 1 (North-Northwest) encompasses areas with the highest temperatures, precipitation, and early outbreak onset, in February. Region 2a (Northeast) has the lowest precipitation and a later onset, in March. Region 3 (Southeast) presents higher altitude, and early outbreak onset in February; while Region 4 (South) has a lower temperature, with onset in March. To better adjust the results, the unique Roraima state HMR state was manually classified as Region 2b (Roraima) because of its outbreak onset in July and the highest precipitation volume. The results suggested preventive and control measures should be implemented first in Regions North-Northwest and Southeast, followed by Regions Northeast, South, and Roraima, highlighting the importance of regional vector control measures based on historical and climatic patterns. Integrating these findings with monitoring systems and fostering cross-sector collaboration can enhance surveillance and mitigate future outbreaks. The proposed methodology also holds potential for application in controlling other mosquito-transmitted viral diseases, expanding its public health impact.",

        "abstract": "While over the past decade global incidence rates of tuberculosis (TB) have decreased, in Paraguay incidence has risen. A new reporting system implemented in 2018 has not previously been used to characterise trends in TB and identify areas to prioritise for the expansion of access to TB diagnostics and treatment programmes. We conducted a retrospective study of all TB cases notified to the Paraguay National Program for Tuberculosis Control (NPTC) from 2018 to 2022. We quantified trends in case notifications spatially and in specific populations identified as vulnerable by the NPTC and measured trends in access to GeneXpert testing. Of the 13,725 TB cases notified in Paraguay from 2018 to 2022, 2337 (17%) occurred among incarcerated individuals and 1743 (12.7%) occurred among self-identified Indigenous individuals. In 2022, the relative risk of TB was 87 and 6.39 (95% CI: 6.08-6.72) among persons deprived of liberty and Indigenous populations, compared to those who are not persons deprived of liberty and non-Indigenous populations respectively. We found significant heterogeneity in TB incidence across Paraguay's 17 departments. While 45% of TB cases among the Indigenous population occurred in the Chaco Region, in western Paraguay, notification among the Indigenous population was highest (1127.4 per 100,000) in the Capital, including the metropolitan area. TB cases are concentrated among Paraguay's incarcerated and Indigenous populations, both of which have extremely high relative risk of TB. Our findings highlight the urgency of expanding access to TB diagnosis, treatment, and prevention across the country and specifically, to the populations at heightened risk of TB.
