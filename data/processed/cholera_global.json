        "abstract": "The human gut harbors enormous microbial diversity, which influences the gut's chemical environment. As the production of virulence factors affects bacterial fitness, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> has adapted to sense the gut chemical environment to selectively activate virulence factors at permissible intestinal niches. Here, we show that diffusible signal factors (DSFs) canonically used by gut proteobacteria for quorum-sensing communication can repress expression of essential ToxT-dependent virulence factors cholera toxin (<i>ctxAB</i>) and the toxin co-regulated pilus (<i>tcpA-F</i>). Unlike canonical quorum sensing, where DSFs are sensed by two-component systems or cyclic di-GMP-regulated proteins, DSFs target the central AraC-type transcriptional regulator ToxT. The most potent of these molecules is cis-2-hexadecenoic acid, which represses <i>ctxAB</i> and <i>tcpA-F</i> expression by 84-fold and 12-fold, respectively. We find that the length of the carbon chain, the cis-2 double bond, and the carboxylic-acid terminus play important roles in the efficacy of these repressive chemicals. We further demonstrate that these chemicals interact with ToxT, preventing it from binding its target promoters while also rendering it susceptible to degradation. Our findings suggest that c2HDA targets ToxT's fatty acid-binding pocket, where high-affinity interactions likely maintain a restrained conformation that represses activity. Collectively, our data show that <i>V. cholerae</i> senses interspecies DSF signals to regulate virulence activation, providing an opportunity to design interventions targeting the virulence of this pathogen.IMPORTANCE<i>V. cholerae</i> continues to cause sporadic pandemics globally. Although cholera is a self-limiting acute disease, severe cases often require the use of antimicrobials in addition to rehydration therapy. Efforts to eradicate cholera have been hampered by the increased incidence of antimicrobial resistance and low vaccine coverage. The gut chemical environment, driven largely by the microbiota, has been shown to play important roles in modulating colonization by enteric pathogens. Pathogens utilize this chemical environment as cues to optimize virulence and survival. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogen-microbiota interactions may therefore provide avenues to develop control measures targeting virulence and survival. Many of the mechanisms of pathogen-microbiota interactions have yet to be fully described. We demonstrate that <i>V. cholerae</i> integrates interspecies chemical signals (DSFs) produced by members of the microbiota to regulate the expression of important virulence factors. DSFs potently repress the virulence island master regulator (ToxT), effectively attenuating cholera toxin secretion. As other related long-chain fatty acids have been reported to impair ToxT function, and as DSF producers localize to the intestinal crypts and mucus layer, it is likely that <i>V. cholerae</i> employs these signals in a spatial-temporal manner to program the induction and repression of the energy-intensive virulence factors. Our work provides a framework for designing interventions to disrupt this virulence and survival program to control this pathogen.",

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota, melatonin synthesis, and breast cancer (BC) development in hormone receptor-positive patients (HR+HER2+ and HR+HER2-). This study investigated alterations in gut microbiota composition, the serum serotonin-N-acetylserotonin (NAS)-melatonin axis, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and beta-glucuronidase (βGD) activity, and serum zonulin in HR+ BC patients compared to healthy controls. Blood and fecal samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry for serotonin, NAS, melatonin, and SCFAs; ELISA for AANAT, ASMT, 14-3-3 protein, and zonulin; fluorometric assay for βGD activity; and 16S rRNA sequencing for gut microbiota composition. HR+ BC patients exhibited gut dysbiosis with reduced <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> and increased <i>Bacteroides eggerthii</i>, alongside elevated fecal βGD activity, SCFA levels (e.g., isovaleric acid), and serum zonulin, indicating increased intestinal permeability. Serum serotonin and N-acetylserotonin (NAS) levels were elevated, while melatonin levels were reduced, with a higher NAS/melatonin ratio in BC patients. AANAT levels were increased, and ASMT levels were decreased, suggesting disrupted melatonin synthesis. <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> positively correlated with melatonin and negatively with βGD activity, while <i>Bacteroides eggerthii</i> showed a positive correlation with βGD activity. These findings suggested that gut microbiota alterations, disrupted melatonin synthesis, microbial metabolism, and intestinal permeability may contribute to BC pathophysiology. The NAS/melatonin ratio could represent a potential biomarker, necessitating further mechanistic studies to confirm causality and explore therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are widely used to assess microbial contamination in surface water. However, traditional FIB such as fecal coliforms and enterococcus often fail to reflect pathogen-related health risks due to differences in environmental persistence and behavior. This study evaluated Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) as an alternative FIB through a national-scale survey of 116 sites across seven major Chinese river basins impacted by anthropogenic contamination. C. perfringens was detected at all sites, with a median concentration of 700 CFU/100 mL, substantially higher than fecal coliforms (26 CFU/100 mL) and enterococcus (4 CFU/100 mL). It showed stronger correlations with priority bacterial pathogens (Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae) and with microbial source tracking markers of human and livestock origin. A significant wastewater treatment plant downstream decay trend (k = -0.21, p < 0.05), aligned with key bacterial pathogens, further supports its diagnostic potential. Using reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment, generalized additive models, and species sensitivity distribution analysis, we derived a health-based guideline of 174 CFU/100 mL for C. perfringens, corresponding to the WHO benchmark of bacterial pathogens (10<sup>-6</sup> DALYs per person per year for drinking, swimming, and vegetable ingestion exposure). Based on this threshold, 55-100 % of sites in Chinese rivers exceeded acceptable risk levels, far surpassing exceedance rates under current fecal coliform criteria. This represents the first large-scale application of C. perfringens as a risk-based indicator and highlights its potential to strengthen microbial water quality monitoring and public health protection.",

        "abstract": "Non-cholera Vibrio species are rare waterborne pathogens that can cause severe infections. Among these, few cases of <i>Vibrio metschnikovii</i> infections have been reported, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, with no cardiac tissue involvement as a result. Following the PRISMA checklist, we conducted a literature review, and thirteen articles for twenty-two cases overall were included: seven cases of sepsis (in three cases, the echocardiographic results were negative), seven cases of pneumonia, two skin infections, eleven cases of diarrhoea, and a gastroenteritis outbreak. This report documents the expanding clinical spectrum and the role played by <i>V. metschnikovii</i> in infective endocarditis. A 28-year-old male patient was referred to the cardiac surgery unit for urgent mitral valve replacement due to suspicion of infective endocarditis. Microbiological tests yielded negative results. Following recovery and discharge with antimicrobial therapy for 6 weeks, the patient experienced prosthesis detachment, necessitating re-hospitalisation for an emergency valve replacement. <i>Vibrio metschnikovii</i> was identified on the prosthesis valve through PCR and successfully treated with ciprofloxacin. However, a spontaneous rupture of the ascending thoracic aorta led to a neurological injury. This case represents the first case of valve infection caused by <i>Vibrio metschnikovii</i>, characterised by diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and the involvement of the great vessels. Also considered in this case, for a disease with a median age of 58 years (11-83) and a male-to-female ratio of 2.2, were one male neonate and six cases for whom neither sex nor age was indicated. Excluding gastrointestinal cases, the septic forms are associated with high morbidity, although the single case described involved a young and healthy subject. Risk factors for the pathogen or predisposing/pathological conditions for endocarditis did not emerge. The routes and the time of infection could not be determined, deepening the possibility of occupational exposure via the patient's position as a boat worker. Poor sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporins has been reported in the literature: the absence of an antibiogram does not allow for a comparison, although resolution was achieved with ciprofloxacin. The rising global incidence of non-cholera Vibrio infections, driven by environmental changes, calls for urgent research into the factors behind their pathogenicity and infection routes. Diagnostic complexities have emerged together with clinical severity.",

        "abstract": "In the humanitarian sector, anticipatory action entails acting ahead of predicted hazardous events to prevent or mitigate potential impacts and needs. It leverages early warnings to bridge preparedness and response, with a core principle being the provision of ex-ante emergency funding for preagreed early actions. Traditionally applied to extreme climatic events, there is growing interest in integrating anticipatory action into disease outbreak preparedness and response. We present an analytical framework for trigger development for climate-sensitive infectious disease outbreaks based on a review of existing and emerging practices from the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, United Nations agencies and Médecins Sans Frontières since 2014. We propose that, depending on data availability, there are four broad approaches for trigger development. First, the humanitarian sector could scale up the release of prearranged funding based on real-time surveillance data (eg, suspected cases) while other emergency funding is secured. Second, the humanitarian sector could take advantage of weather forecasts and seasonal climate forecasts to anticipate outbreaks linked to extreme climatic events, anomalous climatic conditions or highly suitable climatic conditions. Third, to extend the lead time available for intervention, the humanitarian sector could use observed environmental and socioeconomic transmission risk factors (eg, population displacement, overcrowding, presence of vectors, weather changes) in combination with real-time surveillance data to improve early detection or curb a rapid increase in cases, while other emergency funding is secured. Fourth, data-driven outbreak forecasting using seasonal forecasts can help extend the lead time further to make informed decisions about future risks. We present examples and discuss the trade-offs between approaches. As anticipatory action for outbreaks becomes established, we expect that future applications will integrate all four approaches.",

        "abstract": "Diarrheal disease caused by Gram-negative enteric pathogens, such as enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC), <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, <i>Shigella</i> spp., and <i>Salmonella</i> spp., is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality of children, especially in low resource nations. While progress has been made in reducing this burden, there remains a need to develop effective therapies. Recently, we determined the structure of Rns, a member of the AraC/XylS family that regulates the expression of pili and other virulence factors in ETEC. The structure revealed decanoic acid bound between the N- and C-terminal domains. To test the hypothesis that bound decanoic acid directly inhibits Rns, we identified amino acid side chains predicted to be necessary for ligand binding. Removal of the positive side chains of R75 and H20 rendered Rns insensitive to fatty acid inhibition. Additionally, mutations designed to block decanoic acid binding also produced a variant Rns that was fatty acid insensitive. We also observed that this variant is structurally more flexible than wildtype Rns bound to decanoic acid, suggesting that fatty acid binding contributes to structural rigidity. These studies demonstrate that Rns binding pocket residues are critical for binding fatty acids, which result in inhibition of DNA binding and support our hypothesis that fatty acids must bind in the binding pocket to inhibit other AraC regulators. Further work by us and others suggests that inhibition of AraC virulence regulators by fatty acids is a common paradigm among many bacterial pathogens. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of inhibition lays the groundwork for the development of small molecule therapeutics targeting enteric disease. As antimicrobial resistance increases, it is critical to develop new strategies to combat these infections. One area of concern is bacteria that cause intestinal disease such as <i>Salmonella</i> species, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, <i>Shigella</i> species, and enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC). ETEC is a leading cause of travelers' diarrheal disease and a leading cause of mortality for children under 5 years old. To cause disease, ETEC requires the gene regulator Rns. Our previous work found that Rns was inhibited by a fatty acid. Here, we identify key features in the protein that are required for not only binding fatty acids but also for responding to them. This was done through a combination of microbiological as well as structural techniques of altered Rns proteins that can no longer bind fatty acid. Understanding how Rns is inhibited will lead to new ideas about how to target this class of proteins without causing antimicrobial resistance.",

Two stool specimens from patients with diarrhea per site were collected between 2014 and 2022 and cultured using standard microbiology techniques. The isolated bacteria were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Of the 2,393 samples analyzed during the study, 217 (9%) exhibited bacterial growth. Isolated bacteria indicated the prevalence of Shigella spp. (4.4%), Vibrio cholerae (3.1%), Salmonella spp. (1.4%), and Escherichia coli (0.1%). A statistical analysis revealed that water source, hand washing, and boiled water were significantly associated with infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that Shigella spp. exhibited resistance to tetracycline (71%), ampicillin (68%), and chloramphenicol (42%). Vibrio cholerae exhibited resistance to ampicillin (51%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (49%), tetracycline (32%), gentamicin (32%), and chloramphenicol (26%).

In this study, zinc oxide nanoparticles (PlS-ZnO NPs) were synthesized eco-friendly using an aqueous extract from the stems of <i>Persicaria lapathifolia</i> and their anticancer and antibacterial activities were evaluated. The PlS-ZnO NPs were prepared by a simple sol-gel combustion method and investigated by different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The resulting nanoparticles were of polygonal and hexagonal morphology with the average size of 21.45 nm. The PlS-ZnO NPs exhibited high cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cell line (HCT-116) with IC50 value of 11.31 μg/mL. Cytomorphological studies showed that these nanoparticles killed cells through both apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptotic process was accompanied by enhancement of intracellular ROS and MMP. Moreover, the PlS-ZnO NPs exhibited excellent antibacterial activity towards different pathogenic bacteria like <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Bacillus megaterium</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Proteus vulgaris</i> and was found to be better than the positive control amoxicillin. These results indicate that the green synthesized PlS-ZnO NPs can be considered as a potential multifunctional agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer and bacterial infections.

Pediatric health systems are well-positioned to recognize and address chronic absenteeism but have not yet operationalized processes to do so. To characterize primary care clinician and care manager perceptions and practice regarding chronic absenteeism. In this qualitative study, we developed a semi-structured interview guide using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We conducted Zoom interviews (July-August 2023) with primary care clinicians and care managers affiliated with a child-focused alternative payment model serving Medicaid- and Children's Health Insurance Program-enrolled children in a five-county region of central North Carolina. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed iteratively using a rapid qualitative analytic approach. We interviewed twelve participants including six clinicians and six care managers serving families across urban, rural, academic, and community settings. Key themes included a lack of systematic and universal approaches to discussing school attendance, limited infrastructure for school-health system collaboration resulting in caregiver burden, importance of family engagement, and leveraging unique spheres of influence for multidisciplinary collaboration. Clinicians and care managers support addressing chronic absenteeism but perceive provider, patient, and system-level barriers to identifying and addressing underlying needs. Perceived facilitators include leveraging strong relationships with families and multidisciplinary collaboration. Health system efforts to operationalize chronic absenteeism as a health metric and to coordinate services across health, education, and social sectors may improve long-term health and academic outcomes.",

We address the fundamental causes of global cholera transmission following a systematic review of available literature with a focus on the ecological and epidemiological drivers in developing countries. Apart from the established risk for cholera outbreaks, we postulated that the detection of V. cholerae in terrestrial animals could serve as an additional pathway (zoonosis) for cholera transmission. Based on the well-documented detection of V. cholerae in environmental and human samples as well as animal samples, we recommend that epidemic preparedness for cholera should be based on an integrated \"One Health\" approach following genomic surveillance. Thus, we strongly recommend that long-term, multisectoral, multidisciplinary methods be employed to develop evidence-based, context-specific, and innovative strategies for preventing cholera outbreaks.",

We have previously reported two immunomodulatory adjuvants based on non-toxic derivatives of Cholera toxin (CT), namely mmCT and CTB-CpG with strong ability to mount mucosal immune responses. Herein, we aimed to pinpoint the potential of prime-boost immunization approaches using the fusion-protein based <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> subunit vaccine candidate H56 as a model antigen, combined with adjuvants CAF01, mmCT, and CTB-CpG in mice. This included a parenteral H56+CAF01 priming followed by an intranasal boost with H56+CAF01, H56+mmCT, or H56+CTB-CpG, compared with repeated homologous intranasal administrations of H56 with each adjuvant. We observed that a parenteral prime with H56+CAF01 followed by an intranasal H56+CTB-CpG booster immunization triggered a Th1-skewed immune response. Conversely, combining the parenteral H56+CAF01 prime with an intranasal H56+mmCT boost resulted in a mixed Th1/Th17-skewed immune response. Notably, the latter combination also engendered anamnestic, long-lived T-cell responses in the lungs which homologous intranasal H56+mmCT immunizations failed to induce. These results suggest that an immunization regimen consists of parenteral priming with H56+CAF01 followed by an airway boosting with H56 protein and mucosal adjuvants holds promise in mounting combined systemic and mucosal immune responses to <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and as such warrants further exploration. Given the rising interest in mucosal vaccines for respiratory pathogens, these findings offer an important immunological framework for future translational studies.",

It took diverse measures to satisfy the needs of the public, such as theory discussion, drug advertisement, medical knowledge, policy news and describing medical cases. The content of <i>Weisheng Bao</i> focused on etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prescription and case studies, with special issues sometimes. The section of disease prevention involved urban construction, disinfection and sterilization, food and water sources and air cleaning. It was found that <i>Weisheng Bao</i> innovated based on traditional Chinese medicine, integrated Chinese medicine with western medicine, paid attention to environment and faced the public.

        "abstract": "In mid-2021, a global surge in cholera cases was reported. This study characterized Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates obtained from faecal samples of cholera-positive cases during the 2022 cholera outbreak in Kenya. A total of 202 V. cholerae were confirmed through serogroup and serotype characterization by slide agglutination. Susceptibility testing was done using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, and ESBL production confirmed using the double-disc synergy test. WGS was performed on Illumina and ONT platforms, followed by bioinformatics analysis. All the isolates were identified as V. cholerae O1 of Ogawa serotype, with 99% classified as MDR and 98.5% positive for ESBL production. Notably, the isolates were resistant to azithromycin, one of the recommended antibiotics for cholera treatment. MDR was linked to the acquisition of an IncC plasmid (pVCMLK181) carrying seven resistance genes, including mph(A), mph(E) and msr(E), which confer resistance to azithromycin, and the blaPER-7 ESBL gene. Resistance to nalidixic acid was associated with mutations in QRDRs of gyrA and parC. The isolates also carried SXT/R391-like ICE, ICEVchInd5 featuring a 10 kb deletion and mapped to the 7PET-AFR13 lineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship to other highly drug-resistant AFR13 strains reported in Tanzania, Comoros and Mayotte. The high prevalence of multidrug resistance in cholera isolates emphasizes the need for continuous surveillance to monitor the evolution of MDR V. cholerae O1 strains and calls for consideration of deployment of alternative management and prevention options including oral cholera vaccines and long-term improvement of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and practice.",

There were no differences in the GI transit between mouse groups at baseline. After the LPS injection, <i>ztm</i> mice had an attenuated slowing of the GI transit compared to wildtype mice. The zonulin-inhibited mice had motility patterns similar to wildtype mice. zonulin upregulation was noted in GI segments of the <i>ztm</i>, <i>ztm-par2 -/-,</i> and <i>ztm-</i>AT1001 after the LPS injection. Differences in motility patterns between <i>ztm</i> and zonulin inhibition models despite zonulin expression in GI segments of all mouse groups supports that PAR2 is key for zonulin's effect on motility under conditions of inflammation.

        "abstract": "Traditional hazard identification techniques for <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> often neglect the distinction between viable and nonviable bacteria in aquatic products, leading to overestimated disease risks and uncertainties in risk assessments. To address this limitation, we developed an automated PMA pretreatment instrument that integrates dark incubation and photo-crosslinking into a unified workflow, allowing customizable parameters such as incubation time, light exposure duration, and mixing speed while maintaining stable temperatures (<±1 °C fluctuation) to preserve bacterial DNA integrity. Leveraging this system, a duplex qPCR assay was optimized for simultaneous quantitative detection of <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> in aquatic products and environmental samples. The assay demonstrated robust performance with 90-110% amplification efficiencies across diverse matrices, achieving low limits of detection (LODs) of 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL in shrimp farming environment water and 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>3</sup> CFU/g in shrimp (<i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>) and oyster (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>). Notably, it effectively discriminated viable bacteria from 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL(g) nonviable cells and showed strong correlation with ISO-standard methods in real-world sample validation.

        "abstract": "Inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) accounts for a high burden of morbidity and mortality in impoverished regions. This is significantly due to infectious diseases and the direct impact on social and economic well-being. The high burden of communicable diseases and malnutrition in Mozambique, as well as high vulnerability to climate change, results in increased risk of WASH-related diseases. Our objective was to describe access to safe water and sanitation practices in Mopeia, a remote rural district in Mozambique. The source of data for this analysis is a cross-sectional, demographic survey carried out in Mopeia in 2021 under the Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa project, a cluster-randomised trial to assess the impact of ivermectin on malaria transmission. The survey was conducted in all households of a sub-population created for the trial, and it included questions about WASH-related practices at the household level. The results showed that  4200 (56.29%) households have an improved water source at walking distance, which is drastically different to sanitation practices, where 6608 (88.56%) households do not have access to at least one basic sanitation service. Data on water access for Mopeia was similar to that reported in rural contexts in sub-Saharan Africa, yet the district remains off-track from achieving universal safe water coverage in the next few years. Regarding sanitation, the use of unsafe sanitation services is more widespread than in the average rural sub-Saharan Africa (75.00%), with twice as many households (n = 3897, 56.08%) practising open land defecation. Mopeia is still far from achieving universal safe water and sanitation coverage by 2030, especially in sanitation, and remains prone to outbreaks and has a high burden of WASH-related diseases.",

We present the progress in achieving NACP-V's EVTH goal as of year 2023-24. We analysed the 2023 state level data using Spectrum model in 2023 to measure the coverage of anti-retroviral treatment among pregnant women, annual paediatric HIV case incidence rate and final vertical transmission rate. UNAIDS and WHO definitions for these indicators were used. In 2023, around 2350 new paediatric infections were estimated by vertical transmission. However, 44% of these transmissions resulted from incident HIV infections among pregnant and breastfeeding women. Overall, paediatric HIV incidence per 100,000 live births decreased from 25.2 (14.7-46.6) in 2019 to 10.4 (6.1-19.3) in 2023. During the same reference period, final vertical transmission rate (inclusive of breastfeeding period) decreased from 25.28% (17.06-37.99) in 2019 to 11.75% (7.93-17.66) in 2023. The 2023 India HIV estimates, using recent data and global modelling tools, highlighted progress in eliminating vertical transmission of HIV. Early identification of HIV-positive mothers and starting them on lifelong ART is crucial.

To inform future investment decisions, this study aimed to estimate the cases, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and societal economic costs averted by past ORI programmes. Outbreaks of measles, Ebola, yellow fever, cholera and meningococcal meningitis in LMICs between 2000 and 2023 were considered. 210 outbreaks (51 measles, 40 cholera, 88 yellow fever, 24 meningitis, 7 Ebola) across 49 LMICs were identified with sufficient data for analysis. Data were sourced from publicly available outbreak reports and literature. Agent-based models were calibrated for each disease such that after controlling for baseline vaccine coverage, response time, vaccination rate, environmental variables or endemic prevalence of the disease, observed outbreaks were within the distribution of simulated outbreaks. A status-quo and no ORI scenario were compared for each outbreak. Across 210 outbreaks, ORI programmes are estimated to have averted 5.81M (95% uncertainty interval 5.75M-5.87M) cases (4.01M measles, 283K cholera, 1.50M yellow fever, 21.3K meningitis, 820 Ebola), 327K (317K-338K) deaths (20.0K measles, 5215 cholera, 300K yellow fever, 1599 meningitis, 381 Ebola), 14.6M (14.1M-15.1M) DALYs (1.27M measles, 220K cholera, 13.0M yellow fever, 113K meningitis, 16.6K Ebola) and US$31.7B (29.0B-34.9B) (US$710M measles, US$156M cholera, US$30.7B yellow fever, US$97.6M meningitis, US$6.72M Ebola) in economic costs.

One ETEC strain was classified into cryptic clade 1. Subtypes of hallmark virulence genes varied substantially amongst strains in each pathotype, and 31 accessory virulence genes were detected either specifically within certain pathotypes or across multiple pathotypes at varying frequencies, indicating diversification of the virulence gene repertoire within each pathotype.

The current wave shows multidrug resistance, has produced enormous human and economic losses, as well as humanitarian crises, and has the potential to collapse the healthcare system of entire countries. Antibiotic resistance in this and other pathogens is an urgent threat that remains unaddressed due to the significant costs to develop new antibiotics. In this work, we have tested several FDA-approved phenazines and phenothiazines, and have identified that clofazimine (Lamprene) shows strong antibiotic effects against V. cholerae cells in culture and in an in vitro infection model, at concentrations well below the clinically-used doses in humans. Our results show that in an animal model, clofazimine is as effective as ampicillin in the treatment of cholerae. In addition, clofazimine shows strong antivirulence properties, almost completely inhibiting cholera toxin production. The characterization of V. cholerae metabolism allowed us to identify that clofazimine's main target in this pathogen is the respiratory complex NQR, an essential enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, virulence factor production and multidrug resistance, which is widely distributed among pathogenic bacteria. Biochemical and computational analyses show that the structural target of clofazimine is the catalytically-active ubiquinone-binding site, which is a unique structural motif, not found in any human protein, making it an ideal pharmacologic target. These results show that clofazimine can be repurposed to treat cholera, and open opportunities to develop a novel class of antibiotics that target NQR.",

Post-flood periods have the potential for transmission of water-borne diseases with significantly higher cholera risk. This study aims to assess the health risks associated with Vibrio cholerae pathogens after flood events and evaluate their impacts on Accra's population, focusing on Alajo, a neighbourhood in Accra. A post-flood pathogen (SPATE) model was developed, integrating hydrological processes (evaporation and infiltration) and pathogen decay rate, to simulate the spatial temporal distribution of floodwater ponds and the V. cholerae concentrations therein. The infection probability was calculated with the quantitative microbial and flood risk assessment. After flooding, the risk of V. cholerae infection tends to be higher in scattered ponds near the drainage network, surrounding areas of the Onyasia river, and the urban area northeastern of Alajo. The peak risk of V. cholerae infection occurs within the first 12 h post-flooding, declining rapidly thereafter. Variations in infection probability and flood exceedance probability are observed across the area, with an overall trend of reduced infection probability with increasing return periods. Notably, children engaging in water activities face higher risks compared to adults wading in post-flood waters. These findings contribute to decision-making in flood risk management and health risk assessment, facilitating prioritization of vulnerable areas and resource allocation to mitigate and prevent the health impacts of flooding, considering explicitly for the time after flooding when the risk remains elevated.",

        "abstract": "Access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation is essential for maintaining public health. This study investigates water collection, treatment practices, perceptions of water safety, and their health impacts within a community. Understanding these aspects is crucial for developing interventions to enhance water safety and health outcomes. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 360 households in the community and the study subjects were selected randomly from these households. Data was collected through a survey conducted in 360 households, focusing on water collection methods, types of containers, water treatment practices, and sanitation and hygiene behaviors, perceptions of water safety, and the health effects of unsafe water. Descriptive statistics was applied to analyze the frequency and percentage distributions of the variables using SPSS version 20.0. The most common containers for water collection were jerricans (44.2%) and plastic containers (38.6%). While 74.7% of the containers were covered, a notable portion remained uncovered (25.3%). Although 72.8% of respondents believed their water was safe to drink, only 58.1% of the respondents treated their water. Boiling was the most common water treatment method (36.3%), followed by filtration (31.1%) and chemical treatment (30.6%). The primary reasons for not treating water (<i>n </i> = 151) included the belief that water was already clean (62 respondents, 41.1%) and lack of knowledge about water treatment (60 respondents, 39.7%). There was a major recognition of the health effects of unsafe water, with 38.3% associating it with diarrhea and 30.3% with cholera. However, 47.5% did not link water quality to health, indicating gaps in knowledge. The majority of households used toilets (76.9%), but open defecation (13.9%) and improper waste disposal practices, such as disposing of wastewater into open drains (37.5%), were prevalent. Most households consumed more than 20 L of water daily (63.6%), with monthly expenditures on water varying widely. While 40.6% of households spent $1–5 per month on water, a small but major portion faced higher costs. The study reveals that the community is aware of the importance of water safety and sanitation, but faces challenges in consistent water treatment and wastewater disposal. There is a need for enhanced awareness and education on the health risks of untreated water and support for affordable treatment methods. Improving sanitation infrastructure and providing equitable access to safe drinking water are critical for better health outcomes. Policy interventions and community engagement are essential to address these issues and ensure sustainable water safety practices.",

        "title": "Evaluation of the acceptability of ESIDA app, a smartphone-based clinical decision support application to improve infectious disease outbreak detection in Tanzania: clinician perspectives.",
        "abstract": "Epidemic-prone infectious diseases (EPIDs) such as dengue fever, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leptospirosis, Marburg virus disease, measles and cholera, to name a few, place a significant burden on the Tanzanian population and health system. Clinicians working in primary health facilities (PHFs), such as dispensaries, health centres, and basic hospitals, play a vital role in detecting cases and outbreaks. However, they often face challenges, including insufficient knowledge of these diseases and a lack of supporting resources, including surveillance guidelines, standard case definitions, and, most importantly, access to confirmatory diagnostic tests. Although Tanzania reports outbreaks of infectious diseases almost every year, a significant number of cases go undetected and contribute to delayed response and recurrent outbreaks. Smartphone-based clinical diagnostic decision support systems (CDSS) have been proven to help bridge case detection gaps. The Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (ESIDA) project proposed developing the ESIDA app, a smartphone-based CDSS, to aid clinicians in the detection of EPIDs. Before developing the app, the ESIDA project evaluated its acceptability among clinicians, the primary target users. The aim was to gather insights to inform the app development, ensuring its design and features are relevant and applicable in Tanzania context. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 clinicians, including medical doctors and clinical officers from public and private facilities in the Dar es Salaam region, which has reported frequent outbreaks of dengue and cholera. Data were collected and analyzed using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Clinicians were positive about the proposed ESIDA app and intended to use it once it was available. The facilitators and barriers to acceptability focused on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. Expected benefits, ease of use, and government involvement emerged as facilitators of acceptability, while high internet costs, workload, time constraints, infrastructure gaps, and patient resistance were identified as potential barriers. The development of the ESIDA app should prioritize maximizing system performance and benefits. They must also be user-friendly and in line with social norms. The necessary infrastructure must be in place for effective implementation.",

        "abstract": "Mozambique's minimal contribution to global gas emissions contrasts sharply with the significant impact climate change has on the region, particularly in terms of frequent droughts, cyclones, and floods. These climate-related disasters exacerbate vulnerabilities related to food security, human health, and economic growth. This study evaluates the impact of a Social Behavior Change (SBC)-based intervention on preparedness against water-borne diseases (WBDs) and vector-borne diseases (VBDs) among communities in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. This prospective, before-after, community-based study was conducted in six districts of Cabo Delgado province from October 2022 to December 2023. The intervention focused on promoting WASH practices and preventive measures through the Mozambican Ministry of Health's \"Familia Modelo\" strategy. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews with 1602 households at both baseline and endline. The study demonstrated significant improvements in key areas, including the availability of latrines, mosquito nets, food drying facilities, and sanitary landfills. Handwashing facilities, safe water treatment, and storage systems showed the largest increases. The median preparedness score improved from 3 (IQR 2-4) to 6 points (IQR 4-7) out of a maximum of 7 points (p < 0.0001). However, a small percentage of households lost access to certain amenities, and challenges persisted, particularly among internally displaced persons (IDPs), who did not show significant improvement in preparedness due to their unique challenges. The intervention improved preparedness in several domains, emphasizing the effectiveness of SBC approaches in reducing risk factors for climate-sensitive diseases. However, continued efforts are needed to address vulnerabilities, particularly among IDPs and overcrowded households. Education and community-based actions remain crucial for enhancing adaptive responses to climate hazards and mitigating the detrimental effects of climate change on public health.",

        "abstract": "Cholera remains a significant public health challenge in Zambia, particularly in the Copperbelt Province, where antibiotic-resistant Vibrio cholerae strains are increasingly threatening treatment efficacy. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cholera and the antibiotic resistance patterns of V. cholerae isolates at three tertiary hospitals in the region. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted across three major referral hospitals in the Copperbelt Province (Arthur Davison Children's Hospital, Kitwe Teaching Hospital, and Ndola Teaching Hospital) during the cholera outbreak from January to April 2024. Clinical samples from suspected cholera cases were analysed, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed following Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the European committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing methodology for Vibrio cholerae. To isolate Vibrio cholerae, alkaline peptone water and thiosulfate-citrate-bile salt-sucrose agar were utilized. The isolates were identified based on colony morphology, Gram staining, biochemical testing, and serotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Descriptive statistics were employed to assess the prevalence of Vibrio cholerae, and chi-square tests were applied with p-values of < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Of the 892 suspected cases, 334 (37.4%) were confirmed as V. cholerae through culture. The highest number of V. cholerae confirmed cases was recorded at Ndola Teaching Hospital 221 (24.8%), followed by Kitwe Teaching Hospital 88 (9.9%), while Arthur Davison Children's Hospital 25 (2.8%) reported the lowest. High antimicrobial resistance was observed trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 69 (74.2%), ampicillin 75 (54.3%), and imipenem 22 (46.8%). In contrast, erythromycin 25 (100%), gentamicin 6 (85.7%) and ciprofloxacin 118 (76.6%) remained highly effective. The overall prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Vibrio cholerae was 3.7%. Among these, resistance to four or more antibiotics was observed in 3 (1.2%), followed by resistance to the combination of Ciprofloxacin, Ceftazidime, and Tetracycline in 2 (0.8%). All other MDR patterns were detected in a single isolate each (0.4%). The high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Vibrio cholerae in the Copperbelt Province underscores the urgent need for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship and robust surveillance systems to inform effective cholera control strategies. Sustainable public health impact can be achieved through targeted immunization campaigns in endemic areas combined with strengthened water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions, including improved access to clean water, adequate sanitation infrastructure, hygiene promotion, and supportive policies, which are essential for reducing transmission and preventing future outbreaks in vulnerable populations. However, because the number of antibiotics used in antimicrobial susceptibility testing across isolates varies, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Such differences may affect the comparability and overall interpretation of resistance patterns.",

The objective of this scoping review was to describe the current evidence regarding the surveillance of <i>V. cholerae</i> in wastewater and wastewater-impacted environmental waters (including drinking water). We conducted a comprehensive electronic search, updated to January 2025. Following duplicate screening, we identified 114 eligible studies. The studies evaluated early WES warning systems, monitored trends in ongoing outbreaks, and described serogroups and virulent strains of toxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> circulating in communities. Most studies were conducted in South-East Asia (44%), particularly India and Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic. A large proportion of studies detected <i>V. cholerae</i> subgroup O1 or O139, and numerous virulent strains such as <i>ctxA/B</i>. Studies were generally poorly reported, for example, inconsistent reporting on sample management, data reliability, and sampling frequency were common. WES has not been widely integrated into existing surveillance systems for real-time cholera monitoring. Our findings underscore the need for further clearly reported research to clarify the role of WES for early warning systems for cholera outbreaks, and to identify strategies that may optimise WES implementation for public health benefit.",

New evidence has emerged and the ways in which the vaccines are used have changed. We aimed to provide an updated synthesis of evidence on protection conferred by kOCV. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search procedure as a previous systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported estimates of protection conferred by kOCVs against medically attended, confirmed cholera. Eligible studies in English, French, Spanish, or Chinese published up until March 8, 2024, including those identified in the previous review, were included. Data on efficacy and effectiveness were extracted, as were the number of doses, duration of follow-up, and age group. Efficacy and effectiveness estimates were summarised separately using random-effect models to estimate protection by time since vaccination; meta-regression models were used to estimate protection, by dose, as a function of time since vaccination. This updated study is registered along with the original review with PROSPERO (CRD42016048232). We identified 8205 records published online up until March 8, 2024, including 6224 articles from the previous review and 1981 articles from our new search (after Jan 1, 2016). Of these, 53 were eligible for full-text review. Five RCTs and ten observational studies from 23 publications were included. Average two-dose efficacy 12 months after vaccination was 55% (95% CI 46-62), declining to 44% (25-59) 48 months after vaccination. Average two-dose effectiveness was 69% (58-78) 12 months after vaccination, declining to 47% (9-70) 48 months after vaccination. Only one RCT assessed one-dose efficacy and found sustained protection for 24 months (57% [42-69]) among those 5 years and older with no significant protection in younger children. Average one-dose effectiveness 12 months after vaccination was 60% (51-68) and after 24 months was 47% (34-58). Using age group-specific meta-analysis, we found that average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years was half that of older individuals. Two doses of kOCV provide protection against medically attended cholera for at least 4 years after vaccination. One dose of kOCV provides protection for at least 2 years after vaccination, but wanes faster than that of two doses. Children younger than 5 years are less protected by kOCVs than those aged 5 years and older, regardless of the number of doses received. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Leveraging over 6,000 quality-filtered Vibrio genomes alongside six newly sequenced marine symbiotic strains representing 128 nominal and 57 unclassified Vibrio species, our study extends taxonomic breadth and resolution for investigating β-lactamase diversity. We identified 4,431 β-lactamases across 41 species, encompassing all four Ambler classes (A-D). Among these, carbenicillin-hydrolyzing Class A β-lactamases encoded by blaCARB family were the most prevalent (60.7%) and exhibited a clade-centric distribution particularly in Harveyi clade and V. cholerae, underscoring the influence of specific ecological and evolutionary pressures. We refined carbenicillin-hydrolyzing Class A β-lactamase classification into two subfamilies: CARB-17-like (blaCARB-17-like) confined to Harveyi clade and CARB-1-like (blaCARB-1-like) found exclusively outside Harveyi clade based on phylogenetic placement, sequence similarity, and inheritance patterns, providing a clearer framework for delineating their functional and phylogenetic nuances. Notably, blaCARB-17-like genes in nonpathogenic Harveyi Subclade II showed significantly relaxed selection, accompanied by unusual mutations within key conserved motifs especially catalytic serine residues, suggesting evolutionary drift that may compromise canonical enzymatic activity. Furthermore, blaCARB-17-like genes, present as a single copy, emerged as a core gene in Harveyi clade, showing promise as a diagnostic marker for clinically significant Harveyi clade species, despite limited yet significant interspecies genetic exchanges mediated by recombination or mobile genetic elements. Our study advances the understanding of β-lactamase evolution and genomic distribution in Vibrio, with broad implications for diagnostic applications and resistance management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Cholera outbreaks are increasing in frequency and severity, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Zambia, committed to ending cholera by 2025, instead experienced its most significant outbreak in 2024. This review examines the perceived regression in elimination efforts by addressing two questions: (i) What is known about cholera in Zambia? and (ii) What are the main suggested mechanisms and strategies to further elimination efforts in the region?. A scoping literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify relevant qualitative and quantitative research studies published between 1st January 2013 and 30th June 2024 using the search terms 'cholera' and 'Zambia'. We identified 53 relevant publications. With the increasing influence of climate change, population growth, and rural-urban migration, further increases in outbreak frequency and magnitude are expected. Risk factors for recurrent outbreaks, including poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services in unplanned urban settlements and rural fishing villages, continue to derail elimination efforts. Interventions are best planned at a decentralised, community-centric approach to prevent elimination and reintroduction at the district level. Pre-emptive vaccination campaigns before the rainy season and climate-resilient WASH infrastructure in cholera hotspots are also recommended. The goal to eliminate cholera by 2025 was unrealistic, as evidence points to the disease becoming endemic. Our findings confirm the need to align health and WASH investments with the Global Roadmap to Cholera Elimination by 2030 through a climate-focused lens. Recommendations for cholera elimination, including improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, remain elusive in many low-income settings like Zambia. Patient-level information on survival and transmissibility is lacking. New research tailored to country-level solutions and enhancing community participation is urgently required. Insights from this review will be integrated into the next iteration of the National Cholera Control Plan and could apply to other countries with similar settings.",

Epidemiological data was sourced from cholera outbreak line lists. The line list included both confirmed and suspected cholera cases of all ages admitted or reported to health facilities. The numerical priority index was calculated as a sum of four epidemiological indicators: incidence, mortality, persistence, and laboratory testing. Following a validation workshop, stakeholders selected a priority index threshold, identifying 78 sub-counties as initial PAMIs.

The median value of zonulin was 18.57 ng/mL in the patient group and 12.41 ng/mL in the control group. There was no significant difference in zonulin levels between the patient and control groups (p = 0.540). The mean claudin-3 (CLDN3) level was significantly lower in the patient group (3889.56) than the control group 4216.77 (p < 0.001). In the patient group, zonulin and claudin levels did not significantly differ by the need of mechanical ventilation and ICU administration (p > 0.05). In conclusion, CLDN3 levels were found to be significantly lower in patients with bronchiolitis than in the control group. This finding may indicate that low CLDN3 levels may be involved in pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, by impairing airway permeability Further studies with larger number of participants, investigating the effect of airway permeability on the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, which compare zonulin and CLDN3 levels according to disease severity, are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Avian coccidiosis, caused by Eimeria protozoa, presents a significant threat to poultry, with <i>Eimeria tenella</i> being particularly harmful due to its impact on the chicken cecum. Growing resistance to current treatments necessitates alternative therapeutic approaches. Consequently, this study employed an immunoinformatics approach to design a multiepitope vaccine targeting <i>E tenella</i>. Key proteins, including the sporulated oocyst TA4 antigen, alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase, and apical membrane antigen-1, were analysed for epitope prediction. Further comprehensive downstream analysis identified 13 MHC class I, 6 MHC class II, and 7 B-cell epitopes, which were linked with suitable linkers. Also, cholera toxin subunit B was incorporated as an adjuvant, creating a 531-amino-acid construct. The vaccine demonstrated favourable predicted antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and stability properties. Molecular docking predicted interaction with toll-like receptor 15, while immune response simulation showed potential induction of various immunocytes, including helper and cytotoxic T-cells, natural killer cells, and immunoglobulins. The vaccine was predicted to promote antigen clearance after the second dose, suggesting strong memory response potential. These findings indicate the designed vaccine could stimulate a potent protective immune response against <i>E tenella</i> infection. However, further in vitro and in vivo validation studies are necessary to confirm the vaccine's efficacy before clinical application in poultry immunization programmes.",

        "abstract": "Intestinal pathogens pose a significant global health burden, and traditional antibiotic treatments often disrupt the beneficial gut microbiota that plays a crucial role in maintaining host health through pathogen prevention and immune regulation. Although probiotics have emerged as promising therapeutic agents, their efficacy is limited by strain-dependent variations, survival challenges in the gastrointestinal tract, and inconsistent immune responses. Recent advances in genetic engineering, particularly CRISPR-Cas systems and their combinations with complementary technologies, such as Cre-lox and RecE/T, have enabled the precise modification of probiotic strains to enhance their therapeutic potential. These enhanced probiotics demonstrate improved functionality through multiple mechanisms, including increased adhesion via the expression of specific proteins (InlA, FnBPA, and LAP), targeted antimicrobial activity through engineered sensing systems (<i>Lactococcus lactis</i> detecting <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> CAI-1), and enhanced immunomodulation through cytokine production. Results have demonstrated the potential of genetically modified probiotics in preventing and treating gastrointestinal infections through mechanisms that include competitive exclusion, bacteriocin production, intestinal barrier reinforcement, and immune modulation. However, challenges remain in ensuring genetic stability and preventing horizontal gene transfer. Future research should focus on optimizing probiotic strains for targeted applications while addressing biosafety concerns. By understanding the complex interplay between probiotics, pathogens, and host immunity, innovative strategies can be developed to harness the full therapeutic potential of probiotic interventions in maintaining gut health.",

This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between intestinal flora alters and follicular helper T cells (Tfh), regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, and cytokines in SLE. In total, 23 patients with active SLE (SLE-A group), 18 patients with stable SLE (SLE-nA group), and 24 healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled. Tfh, follicular T regulatory (Tfr), and Treg cells were measured by flow cytometry, and fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The relationship between the gut microbiome and the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI-2k), zonulin (an indicator of intestinal permeability), IL-2, IL-6, and IL-21 levels was analyzed. Decreased Treg cells and imbalanced Tfh/Tfr were associated with elevated disease activity in SLE-A group. The increase in zonulin levels in SLE-A group indicated worsened intestinal mucosal barrier damage, potentially linked with the increase in the dominant microflora Escherichia-Shigella. Furthermore, the increase in zonulin was correlated with a severe imbalance in Tfh/Tfr. Moreover, decreased IL-2 levels were associated with a decrease in Ruminococcus and may modulate the reduction in Treg cells during disease progression. Zonulin also exhibited a negative correlation with IL-2. Zonulin may be involved in the Tfh/Tfr immune imbalance in patients with SLE, and Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus may contribute to disease development by regulating Treg cells and Tfh/Tfr imbalance. Taken together, these findings may provide new insights into the role of cytokines in the treatment of SLE.",

        "abstract": "To establish a standardized microsurgical protocol for atraumatic exposure of extended intraorbital optic nerve segments in rat models, enabling precision interventions in neural regeneration research. Aseptic surgical procedures were performed on anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, involving three critical steps: (1) precision skin incision with bilateral silk suture retraction, (2) meticulous periorbital adipose tissue dissection, and (3) atraumatic full-length optic nerve exposure. Post-exposure interventions comprised optic nerve crush (ONC) modeling, intrasheath injection, scaffold and hydrogel implantation. Validation encompassed functional (Functional Visual Evoked Potentials, FVEP), vascular (Fluorescein Fundus Angiography, FFA), and cellular (RGC density and axonal integrity via cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) anterograde tracing) assesments. The approach reliably exposed 5-mm intraorbital optic nerve segments (4.96 ± 0.13 mm) with intact vasculature (FFA-confirmed perfusion). Complete ONC validation was demonstrated through three principal findings: (a) Complete FVEP signal ablation (Ampliude P1 (OS/OD) pre-operation 1.05 ± 0.19, sham 1.00 ± 0.06, ONC 0.03 ± 0.02, *  p < 0.05), (b) Progressive RGC loss quantified by CTB anterograde signal attenuation (Week 1: 1496.7 ± 186.3; Week 2: 146.3 ± 13.0; Week 3: 110.0 ± 12.4;Week 4: 78.75 ± 5.1, * p <  0.05), and (c) Axonal discontinuity confirmed by anterograde CTB truncation. Scaffold implantation permitted CTB-traced axonal regrowth across the lesion site. This refined surgical protocol provides enhanced operative accessibility for optic nerve interventions, enabling precise modeling of neural injury and repair mechanisms while maintaining microvascular homeostasis. The technical reproducibility and quantifiable outcome measures establish a robust platform for translational research in neuroprotection and regenerative therapies.",

        "abstract": "In the past 20 years, Nigeria has confronted an array of six significant infectious disease outbreaks, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Lassa fever, meningitis, diphtheria, cholera and Ebola. Although the country has generally managed to address most of these infections effectively, there are still some shortcomings in the nation's public health response. This review examined the six most significant outbreaks of infectious diseases and the corresponding public health responses, evaluating the strengths and limitations of the country's public health system. This study focused on Nigeria. Nigeria is regarded as a country with the largest population in Africa. A narrative review approach was employed, which entailed identifying pertinent literature using search terms with various Boolean combinations derived from multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) database, the Web of Science and Africa Journals Online. The key strengths of Nigeria's public health system include surveillance, workforce development, prevention at entry points, risk communication and establishment of national reference libraries. However, the study also identified several areas of weakness, such as inadequate funding, inadequate efforts at the subnational level, poor coordination between public health and security authorities, a lack of integration between the animal and human health sectors, inadequate biosafety and biosecurity policies and programmes and logistical complexities. Despite the strengths, there are still weaknesses within Nigeria's public health system response to infectious diseases. The study outlined the various strengths and weaknesses of the Nigeria Public health system in combating infectious disease. Therefore, it is recommended that funding be increased, poverty and inequalities are addressed, efforts at the subnational level be increased, and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the public health sector and security authorities be established.",

        "abstract": "Flagellin, an essential structural protein of bacterial flagella, has emerged as a potent modulator of both specific and nonspecific immunity, demonstrating significant potential as a vaccine adjuvant and carrier. By inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12, flagellin activates the innate immune system, enhancing antigen-specific adaptive immune responses mediated by tumour-specific type 1 helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, thus positioning it as a valuable adjuvant or complementary therapy for various cancers and infectious diseases. This review explores recent strategies, innovations, and clinical applications of flagellin-based immunotherapies, particularly in the context of infectious diseases and cancers. Flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium has been extensively studied as a vaccine adjuvant for diseases like HIV, influenza, dengue, West Nile virus, poultry cholera, and bursal diseases and shows promise in treating lung metastasis, melanoma, colon, and prostate cancers. It has also proven effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. typhimurium. Notably, S. typhimurium flagellin-based vaccines for influenza have progressed to clinical trials. Additionally, flagellins from S. typhi, S. enteritidis, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli are being evaluated as vaccine candidates for plague, malaria, and infections caused by P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In cancer therapy, flagellin-based treatments, especially when combined with tumour antigens, have exhibited the ability to enhance anti-tumour immunity and improve patient outcomes. Other flagellin-based vaccines derived from S. Dublin, S. munchen, and Vibrio vulnificus have been employed in the treatment of prostate, lung, liver, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, as well as lymphoma, melanoma, and radiation-induced mucositis. Mobilan, a recombinant non-replicating adenovirus vector expressing Salmonella flagellin, is currently in a phase Ib clinical trial for prostate cancer. Overall, bacterial flagellin treatments are generally safe, well-tolerated, and associated with minimal side effects, making them a promising option for managing infectious diseases and cancers.",

        "abstract": "Traumatic optic neuropathies lead to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and axonal degeneration, primarily due to disrupted neurotrophic factor (NTF) supply from the brain and a neurotoxic cascade, potentially mediated by elevated retinal Zn²⁺ levels. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are two major NTFs known to support RGC survival and axon protection. Dipicolylamine (DPA), a Zn²⁺ chelator with high selectivity and affinity, offers a strategy to reduce excess Zn²⁺. To achieve sustained NTF delivery and Zn²⁺ reduction, we developed sulfonated poly(serinol hexamethylene urea) nanoparticles (S-PSHU NPs) co-loaded with CNTF, BDNF, and DPA. In vitro release studies demonstrated sustained release of CNTF and BDNF for up to 8 weeks and DPA for up to 4 weeks. In a rat optic nerve crush (ONC) model, DPA-loaded S-PSHU NPs showed dose-dependent elimination of retinal Zn²⁺. Additionally, in primary RGC culture, RGC activity and axon growth correlated with CNTF and BDNF dosage. In vivo, NTF-DPA-loaded S-PSHU NPs significantly enhanced RGC survival and axon protection post-ONC, as evidenced by cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)-labeled axons in the central visual centers of the brain, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, lateral geniculate nucleus, and superior colliculus. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: • Co-delivery of neurotrophic factors (NTFs: CNTF and BDNF) and a zinc chelator (dipicolylamine, DPA) promotes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon survival and protection. • Sustained release of NTFs for up to 8 weeks and DPA for up to 4 weeks. • DPA-loaded nanoparticles effectively eliminate excess retinal zinc after optic nerve injury. • NTF-DPA-loaded nanoparticles significantly improve RGC survival and axon protection in a rat optic nerve crush model.",

This article aims to review the factors contributing to the underestimation of cholera in Africa and explore potential solutions to better characterize the disease epidemiology and burden on the continent. We drew on our field experiences and existing literature to identify the key factors responsible for cholera underestimation in Africa. We also propose strategies to improve cholera surveillance and reporting. We identified several factors contributing to cholera underestimation, including weaknesses in the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, insecurity due to conflict situations, limited healthcare access, and the politicization of cholera outbreak data. We propose a comprehensive approach to address these challenges, including strengthening disease surveillance, adopting digital technologies to improve data collection and management, improving healthcare access, increasing public awareness and enhancing community engagement and participation in cholera reporting, and fostering political commitment to transparent data reporting.

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), molecular diagnostics, and biosensors are highlighted as tools for enhancing surveillance and improving outbreak response. Despite these advancements, Nigeria faces significant challenges, including inadequate laboratory infrastructure, insufficient environmental monitoring, and limited access to diagnostic tools in rural areas. Recommendations include strengthening diagnostic capacity, integrating AI-driven tools, and implementing proactive environmental surveillance. The manuscript underscores the importance of coordinated efforts among federal and state health agencies, international partners, and local communities to address the persistent cholera burden.

Clinical information on the adult patients with cholera in the community and referral CTCs was retrospectively analyzed. Clinical factors associated with the fatal outcome were explored by multivariate analysis, using Firth's penalized logistic regression. A total of 6578 adult cases were identified. The overall case fatality rate was 1.0% (51 of 5020), and it was highest in a referral CTC specializing in patients with underlying conditions (4.1% [32 of 772]). In the multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio, 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.09]), human immunodeficiency virus infections (5.68 [2.12-15.30]), diabetes mellitus (8.21 [1.38-34.00]), and severe dehydration at admission (5.97 [1.29-56.94]) were independently correlated with fatal outcomes.

        "abstract": "Multi-pathogen molecular diagnostics enhance our understanding of the pathogen-specific burden of diarrhea. However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities.

        "abstract": "To confirm the possibility of correcting protein-energy malnutrition in patients suffering from esophageal and gastric cancer using a new type of domestic enteral nutrition with a metabolic focus, such as DETOX, and to analyze the effect of correction of disorders on the course of the postoperative period. A total of 70 patients suffering from esophageal and gastric cancer were selected for participation in the study using the open randomization method and divided into two groups of 35 people. Patients of the first group took domestic enteral nutrition LEOVIT ONCO, patients of the second group took imported enteral nutrition. Anthropometric indicators, laboratory and questionnaire data were assessed: during the initial consultation, before admission to the hospital - 14 days before hospitalization, immediately upon hospitalization, before surgery, in the first three days after surgery, before discharge. Data collection and processing was carried out by the staff of the Department of Faculty Surgery No. 2 named after G.I. Lukomsky based on the University Clinical Hospital No. 4 of Sechenov University. Statistical analysis was performed using the StatTech v. 4.6.3 program (developer - StatTech LLC, Russia). Domestic detoxifying enteral nutrition ensures normalization of body weight, an increase in the level of total protein, albumin and transferrin in the blood of patients before discharge by 15.3%, 16.4% and 74%, respectively, compared with the initial level, while imported nutrition contributed to a less pronounced increase in these indicators - by 11.8%, 9.6% and 48%, respectively. Despite the fact that both groups managed to achieve the desired level of total protein, albumin, in the LEOVIT ONCO group we needed less effort in terms of parenteral nutrition, enzymatic correction of profuse diarrhea, manifested with a significant decrease in the BCC, additional infusions of albumin and amino acids, especially in patients with a BMI <18. Unlike patients taking imported enteral nutrition, in patients on the background of LEOVIT ONCO therapeutic nutrition, immune-inflammatory markers (NLR, MLR, PLR) normalized, diarrhea of the «cholera» type was stopped, bowel movements occurred regularly, the amount of feces was moderate, they had a soft consistency and a formed appearance, and there was also no intestinal paresis. LEOVIT ONCO therapeutic nutrition did not cause intolerance or allergic reactions, patients did not refuse to take it and drank the entire portion. This study of domestic and imported drugs for enteral nutrition demonstrates comparable, and in some key indicators, higher clinical and economic efficiency of domestic enteral nutrition products in the perioperative period in cancer patients with nutritional status disorders.",

        "abstract": "Cholera sicca is a rare and often overlooked variant of cholera, characterized by severe dehydration and circulatory collapse without the hallmark profuse diarrhea. This case report describes a 40-year-old previously healthy male who presented with abdominal distention, vomiting, and minimal bowel movements, initially mimicking bowel obstruction. The patient was hemodynamically unstable, with severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.95), acute kidney injury (creatinine 610 µmol/L), and hypovolemia shown by a collapsed inferior vena cava on imaging. Stool studies confirmed <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> infection, leading to a diagnosis of cholera sicca. Management included aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care, resulting in clinical improvement. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of cholera sicca, which can be misdiagnosed due to its atypical presentation. Unlike typical cholera, where profuse diarrhea facilitates early recognition, cholera sicca often presents with minimal or no diarrhea, leading to delayed treatment and higher mortality. Early recognition and aggressive fluid resuscitation are critical to improving outcomes. This report underscores the importance of considering cholera sicca in differential diagnoses, particularly in endemic regions, and emphasizes the need for enhanced diagnostic tools, such as point-of-care ultrasound, to assess volume status. Public health interventions, including improved water sanitation, mass vaccination campaigns, and healthcare worker training, are essential for preventing and managing cholera outbreaks. Cholera sicca is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management. This case serves as a reminder of the diverse presentations of cholera and the importance of early intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality in resource-limited settings.",

        "abstract": "Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease caused by Eimeria species in chickens, leading to substantial threats to the poultry industry worldwide. Vaccination has emerged as a pivotal preventive strategy, with subunit vaccines gaining significant attention due to their safety. Microneme protein 2 (MIC2) of Eimeria tenella (E. tenella) is a promising candidate antigen for coccidiosis vaccination. However, its immune protection efficiency still needs to be further improved. Here, we report that MIC2, cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and their fusion protein CTB-MIC2 are successfully recombinant expressed and produced in Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). Notably, CTB and CTB-MIC2 exhibit high affinity for GM1 ganglioside, whereas MIC2 does not. Furthermore, upon administration to mice, the fusion protein CTB-MIC2 triggered a more robust cellular and humoral immune response than MIC2 alone, as evidenced by inducing significantly higher levels of cytokines IFN-γ and IL-4, along with an elevated production of antigen-specific IgG antibodies. More importantly, CTB-MIC2 provided higher immune protection against E. tenella infections in chickens than MIC2. Taken together, these findings reveal that CTB fusion enhances the immunogenicity of MIC2, highlighting a promising strategy for developing effective anti-coccidial subunit vaccines.",

The pathogen has caused seven pandemics in history, with contaminated water identified as the infection source. Seasonal outbreaks, claiming approximately 21,000-143,000 lives yearly, are facilitated by contaminated water environments. This systematic review, therefore, determined the prevalence of V. cholerae in water environments. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. After the screening process, 87 articles were included in our study. RStudio version 4.3.3 was used in conducting our meta-analysis with the data subjected to the random-effects model. The included articles were from 38 countries, which spanned 6 continents. The prevalences of V. cholerae in water environments were as follows: drinking water (15.69%), untreated sewage (57.26%), treated sewage (95.18%), surface water (41.95%), groundwater (26.23%), and others (20.81%). Continental prevalence revealed the following: Australia (85.00%), North America (66.60%), Africa (42.07), South America (39.32%), Asia (29.28%), and Europe (24.48%).

The updated \"Chinese clinical practice guidelines for acute infectious diarrhea in children\" incorporates new evidence-based recommendations for managing acute infectious diarrhea in the Chinese pediatric population. Building on the 2018 edition guidelines, expert panels reviewed clinical evidence, assessed preliminary recommendations, and conducted open-ended discussions to finalize the updated guidelines. These guidelines are founded on the latest literature and evidence-based practices. A literature review was performed in databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, China Biomedical Database, and the Chinese Journal Full-text Database up to June 2024. The search focused on the terms \"acute diarrhea\" or \"enteritis\", along with \"adolescent\", \"child\", \"pediatric patient\", \"baby\", or \"infant\". The updated guidelines address various aspects of acute infectious diarrhea, including diagnosis, etiological evaluation, dehydration assessment, fluid therapy, diet therapy, medical therapy, and prevention strategies. The main updates focused on etiological diagnosis and the use of probiotics, racecadotril, zinc, and antibiotics in treating acute infectious diarrhea. The updated guidelines address disputed treatments for acute infectious diarrhea through evidence-based revisions. Standardized etiological evaluations guide management. Probiotics are moderately advised for viral watery diarrhea; racecadotril remains unsupported. Zinc supplementation is recommended for children >6 months in deficient regions. Antibiotics are restricted to cases with dysenteric-like symptoms, suspected cholera with severe dehydration, or comorbidities.",

Despite the severity of the disease, there is no proven post-exposure treatment available, emphasizing the critical need for the development of an effective vaccine. This study was aimed at designing a multi-epitope based vaccine candidate based on an in-silico approach. NiV's Structural proteins were screened for B and T-cell epitopes, assessing characteristics like antigenicity, immunogenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Two vaccine constructs (NiV_1 & 2) were designed using different adjuvants (Cholera toxin and Beta-defensin 3) and linkers and their predicted 3D structures were evaluated for interaction with Toll-Like Receptor TLR-3 using docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. Finally, The potential expression of the vaccine construct in Escherichia coli (E. coli.) was verified by cloning it into the PET28a (+) vector and immune simulations were undertaken. The study identified 30 conserved, antigenic, immunogenic, non-allergenic, and non-toxic epitopes with a broad population coverage. Based on the stability of vaccine construct in MD simulations results, NiV_1 was considered for further analysis. <i>In-silico</i> immune simulations of NiV_1 indicated a substantial immunogenic response. Moreover, codon optimization and in-silico cloning validated the expressions of designed vaccine construct NiV_1 in E. coli.

        "abstract": "Patchouli essential oil (PEO) obtained from <i>Pogostemon cablin</i>, acclaimed for its therapeutic properties and aroma, has gained increased attention for its potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmeceutical industries. However, the application of PEO is modest due to its hydrophobicity, poor solubility in aqueous media, and high volatility. Nanoemulsions (NEs) rescue these inconsistencies with their proficiency in encapsulating PEO as nanosized droplets, thus providing a new dimension to the modern-day drug delivery of PEO. The present work reports the preparation of patchouli essential oil-based nanoemulsions (PNEs) by ultrasonication using Tween 80 as an emulsifier and water as the continuous medium. Twelve PNEs were prepared with 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 oil-to-surfactant ratios (OSRs) and sonication times of 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. An increase in the sonication time and a decrease in the level of the OSR reduced the average droplet diameter (<i>Z</i><sub>avg</sub>) of the PNEs. PNE with 1:3 OSR and 20 min sonication was optimized for biological studies as it displayed the minimum <i>Z</i><sub>avg</sub> (∼14 nm), maximum stability upon centrifugation (5000 rpm), thermal treatment (30, 60, and 90 °C), and storage (4 weeks), where it showed a slowest Ostwald ripening rate (ω) of ∼6.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The optimized PNE showed <i>in vitro</i> anticancer activity against A549 lung cancer cells by showing cell cytotoxicity and inducing apoptosis. The observation of a lower IC<sub>50</sub> of the optimized PNE (0.71 μL mL<sup>-1</sup>) than that of PEO (1.13 μL mL<sup>-1</sup>) confirmed improved anticancer activity. The first evidence of anticancer activity of PNE against the A549 lung cancer cell line is presented. Moreover, the optimized PNE also showed antibacterial activity against <i><i>Vibrio cholerae</i></i>, <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i><i>Escherichia coli</i></i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i><i>Salmonella typhimurium</i></i> with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 3.12, 3.12. 6.25, 6.25, and 3.12 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.",

We constructed a dataset combining cholera outbreaks and requests, decisions, and deliveries of OCVs from the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, alongside additional covariates. Using machine learning algorithms, we assess the relative importance of socio-demographic, governance, and weather variables in predicting cholera outbreaks. We constructed and used an \"index of cholera risk\" as an instrumental variable to predict the likelihood of suspected cases and estimate the impact of cholera outbreaks on OCV allocation. The majority of OCVs (77.4%) were allocated reactively. Governments took an average of 299.6 days to request doses, international agencies took 10.4 days to decide, and it took 84 days for vaccines to be delivered. Countries experiencing a cholera outbreak were 31.7 and 36.5 percentage points more likely to request and receive a vaccine delivery in the same month as the outbreak, respectively. We confirmed that the probability of obtaining vaccines through a reactive mechanism was 48.4 percentage points higher compared to preventive allocation. When exploring the heterogeneity of impacts, OCVs were more likely to be requested, allocated, and delivered in countries with strong institutions and those not facing crisis situations. OCVs were also more likely to be allocated in the central parts of the continent. While OCV allocation is responsive to cholera outbreaks, addressing delays, particularly in high-risk countries, could improve their distribution and mitigate the impact of cholera outbreaks.

Recent <i>in vivo</i> studies have shown that hyaluronic acid based dissolving microarray patch (dMAP) could deliver house dust mite allergens through transdermal pathway and protect allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis <i>in vivo.</i> In this study, we explored the potential of dMAP for the transdermal delivery of gliadin proteins as a strategy to mitigate gliadin allergy. C3H/HeJ mice were sensitized to gliadin with cholera toxin via oral administration, followed by oral or intraperitoneal gliadin challenge. To evaluate the protective effects of transdermal immunotherapy (TDIT), gliadin-loaded dMAPs were applied twice a week to gliadin-sensitized mice for 4 weeks. Afterward, the mice were challenged with gliadin. The manufacturing process of dMAP did not alter the allergenicity of gliadin. TDIT significantly improved the anaphylaxis clinical score and stabilized core body temperature in the gliadin anaphylaxis model. It reduced mast cell protease-1 and gliadin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), and increased specific IgG₁, IgG<sub>2a</sub> and IgG<sub>2b</sub> levels. <i>Ex vivo</i> splenocyte study revealed that TDIT enhanced T helper type 1 (Th₁) cell population, interferon-γ expression, regulatory T cell population, and interleukin (IL)-10 expression, as well as suppressed Th₂ cell population and associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13).

Yet, information about the severity of cholera risk is limited as risk varies over time and changing weather patterns make historical cholera risk predictions less reliable. In this paper, we examine how households use geographically and temporally personalized cholera risk predictions to inform their beliefs and behaviors related to cholera and its aversion. We estimate how access to a smartphone application containing monthly cholera risk predictions unique to a user's home location affects households' beliefs about their cholera risk and their water use and hygiene behaviors. We find that households with access to this application feel more equipped to respond to environmental and health risks and reduce their reliance on surface water for bathing and washing-a common cholera transmission pathway. We do not find that households invest additional resources into drinking water treatment, nor do we find reductions in self-reported cholera incidence. Further, households with a static, non-personalized app containing public health information about cholera exhibit similar patterns of beliefs updating. Taken together, our results suggest that access to dynamic risk information can help households make safer water choices, yet improving design and credibility remain important dimensions for increasing application usability.",

To address this, we incorporate an inapparent cholera-infected compartment into the iSIR model and equip it with parameters depicting vaccination and compliance levels for water and food sanitation, handwashing, and safe fecal disposal. Our model shows that the bacteria shedding from the inapparent infection can significantly affect the spread of cholera. Also, we identify that lowering the bacteria ingestion rate among the susceptible and controlling the bacteria shedding from reported infected are two key components for obtaining a disease-free state in the long run. The model fitting to cholera outbreaks in Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, and Zimbabwe implies that at least 88.5% of cases are inapparent, with the first reporting appearing up to 11 weeks after the start of the outbreak. Additionally, we find that the combination of water and food sanitation and handwashing is the most effective intervention strategy for reducing the cholera outbreak peak if compliance with these measures remains at moderate or high levels. However, with low compliance, safe fecal disposal of the reported infected individuals combined with vaccination coverage of the susceptible population is suggested to obtain the lowest outbreak peak.",

Research on these bacteria and the diseases they cause has greatly influenced scientific progress, resulting in major advancements in the fields of microbiology, epidemiology, and public health. <i>Objectives:</i> This review aims to highlight the early groundbreaking discoveries in <i>Vibrio</i> research, particularly those that have significantly impacted the science of microbiology and global health. <i>Methods:</i> A comprehensive literature search was conducted across vast databases of biomedical and life sciences literature including PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. Additionally, a search of the grey literature was performed. Studies that marked early groundbreaking discoveries in <i>Vibrio</i> research, with wide implications for human society, were included. <i>Findings and conclusion:</i> Research on <i>Vibrio</i> has led to major advancements in our understanding of disease mechanisms, pathogen ecology, and the epidemiology of waterborne infections. A landmark discovery was the identification of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> in 1884, which played a crucial role in studying waterborne diseases such as cholera and led to the development of modern approaches to treat diarrheal diseases, such as the introduction of oral rehydration salt (ORS) therapy. Certain <i>Vibrio</i> strains, such as <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i>, are important models for studying flesh‑eating diseases, while others, such as <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> ST3, ST36, and <i>V. cholerae</i> O1, are the only marine bacteria known to cause global epidemics by spreading across continents. Key mechanisms in Gram‑negative bacteria, including the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, quorum sensing, and the type VI secretion system (T6SS), were first discovered in <i>Vibrio</i> species. Today, research on <i>Vibrio</i> bacteria remains crucial from a global health perspective, especially owing to the expanding effects of climate change on their worldwide distribution.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increases the risk of mortality and morbidity among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, the advancement of HCV treatment has made this viral infection curable. Thus, the main objective of this study was to comprehend the HCV genotype (GT) distribution and the efficacy of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among CKD patients in West Bengal. Over five years (January 2017 to December 2021), 310 HCV sero-reactive patients were enrolled in this observational prospective study. HCV RNA was quantified using qRT-PCR. The partial amplification of the core (405 bp) and NS5B (389 bp) region was performed by nested RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing for HCV genotype analysis using the NCBI genotyping tool. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA-X tool. The occurrence of HCV RNA positivity was 50.64% (n = 157), and of these 157 patients, 141 (89.81%) completed the DAAs treatment. The most important observation of the study was the prevalence of uncommon HCV genotype GT-1c (67.52%) followed by 1a, 4a, 3a, 1b, and 3b among CKD patients. The overall DAAs efficacy between January 2017 and December 2018 was ~ 97%, and in January 2019 and December 2021, ~ 95% among CKD patients. At the same time, in these two phases, DAAs efficacy among GT-1c-infected CKD patients was ˜ 96% and ˜ 93%, respectively. The prevalence of GT-1c among CKD patients was unusual in this geographic region. The overall efficacy of DAAs among the CKD population was encouraging. However, the downtrend of the DAAs efficacy in GT-1c may increase concern among this high-risk group in the future. Not applicable.",

        "title": "Social dynamics influencing cholera risk in the City of Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo: a qualitative study.",
        "abstract": "Cholera remains a major and increasing global public health problem for all people without adequate access to safe water. Goma, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has been a major cholera hotspot in Africa since 1994 and is currently experiencing one of the largest outbreaks in the world. This article contributes to the existing scholarship on cholera risk by utilizing a variety of qualitative research methods. Goma offers several advantages to a study of cholera as a city on the shores of Kivu Lake, but where the majority of population does not have access to clean water and experiences recurrent cholera epidemic outbreaks. Two local members of our research team are experts in public health and conducted all the interviews in Swahili and French. They also led transect walks and a participatory mapping workshop. Data were collected between 2021 and 2022 in six areas of Goma. Data were analysed using a qualitative software Open code 4.03 to generate codes for a thematic purpose. Our results show that the lack of water infrastructure was the main issue with cholera risk in Goma as it prompted use of unsafe drinking water from Lake Kivu, the small Lake vert and Mubambiro River. Additionally, there were specific social groups with an increased risk based on age and gender, health status, some occupational risks, and socio-economic status. Cholera risks were framed in relation to broader life-threatening events, such as natural disasters, that occurred in the city. Cholera risk was also ascribed to challenges with care seeking and treatment, and issues with implementation of prevention strategies. Finally, the lack of empowerment of local communities in cholera prevention measures was considered a secondary source of risk due to the emphasis on the public health outreach practices and short-term emergency responses. This work broadens our understanding of factors that contribute to cholera risk in Goma. These factors should be addressed by implementing diverse strategies that involve the affected communities rather than focusing on rapid public health outreach response interventions. In addition, the, development and the maintenance of a safe and reliable water infrastructures in the city is essential to reduce the chronic nature of cholera infection in the city of Goma.",

In pathogenesis, cholera is classified into cold and heat types. Cholera of heat type roots on <i>qi</i> and blood. If the pathogenic factors are mild and located shallowly, the sneezing method, followed by scraping method, is adopted to open meridians and collaterals, as well as the <i>qi</i> level, so as to eliminate pathogens. When the pathogens go deeply, the bloodletting technique is used to clean the toxic heat in blood level and reduce the reversed <i>qi</i>. For cholera of cold type, warm ironing moxibustion is delivered to promote <i>qi</i> circulation and disperse cold, and improve <i>qi</i> movement. If spasm and syncope occur in cholera, no matter of cold or heat identification, the emergent measure is operated with the external application of pungent, warm and salty herbal plaster at Yongquan (KI1).

        "abstract": "Cholera is a life-threatening diarrheal disease caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, with recurring outbreaks in Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region. Despite its endemic nature, outbreaks have primarily been reported by the health sector without comprehensive molecular epidemiological investigations. Limited studies have characterized outbreak dynamics, prevalence, and antimicrobial resistance, hindering effective public health interventions. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence, molecular characteristics, and antibiotic resistance of <i>V. cholerae</i> isolates from the 2023 outbreak in Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan, Iraq. A total of 1200 diarrheic stool samples were collected from Shar Hospital between July and October 2023. Bacterial isolation was performed using microbiological methods and automated VITEK 2 analysis, followed by serological identification (O1 and O139 antisera) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted to assess resistance patterns. The outbreak prevalence was 0.015%, with the highest infection rate in August (0.009%). The overall infection rate was 28.91% (347/1200), with the most affected age groups being 19-33 years (27.66%) and 34-48 years (26.22%). Infection was more common in females (55.6%) than males (44.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic similarity to the <i>V. cholerae</i> Kuwait1 strain, suggesting potential introduction from southern Iraq, possibly due to an influx of tourists. Furthermore, antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that all <i>V. cholerae</i> isolates were susceptible to most tested antibiotics; however, complete resistance (100%) was observed against amikacin, amoxicillin, amoxiclav, nalidixic acid, and trimethoprim, with partial resistance (30%) to tetracycline. Cholera remains a major public health concern in Kurdistan, particularly in Sulaymaniyah, due to recurrent outbreaks. Molecular techniques provided crucial insights into outbreak tracking and genetic relatedness, while AST profiling highlighted the urgent need for revised treatment guidelines. Strengthening water sanitation, continuous antimicrobial resistance monitoring, and targeted public health interventions are essential for preventing future outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "This study explored the effectiveness of plasma-activated water (PAW), generated by a newly developed compact generator, for decontaminating foodborne bacteria in oyster meats. The generator effectively produced PAW with antibacterial activity when the water passed through the plasma reactor in a single cycle. The temperature of the PAW produced by the developed device did not exceed 40 °C, enabling its direct application to biological tissues immediately after production and discharge from the plasma reactor. The effects of flow rates and post-discharge times on key reactive species-including hydrogen peroxide, nitrite, and nitrate-were analyzed, along with pH and temperature. Freshly produced PAW can completely inhibit both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> in vitro, with a 5-log reduction within 5 min of treatment. Application to oyster meats led to an 86.6% and 87.9% inactivation of <i>V. cholerae</i> and <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i>, respectively. These research findings indicate that PAW generated using the developed compact flow-through generator holds promise as a food safety solution for households. The fact that complete foodborne pathogen elimination was not achieved emphasizes the need for further optimization.",

This study aimed to assess the bacteriological quality of household drinking water in both cholera endemic and non-endemic areas in Greater Accra Region. a community-based cross-sectional comparative survey in cholera endemic and non-endemic communities was conducted. A total of 480 drinking water samples were collected. The membrane filtration technique was used for the quantification of coliform counts and Vibrio counts. The bacteria were further identified and characterized. The Kruskal Wallis rank test was used to determine any significant variations in the means of the log-transformed bacteria counts among specific factor variables. drinking water samples were contaminated with coliform counts exceeding the zero colony-forming units per 100 ml standard in most communities across cholera endemic and non-endemic areas. Vibrio counts were detected in all household water stored in vessels. Further characterization identified predominantly Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli. The coliform contamination levels were significantly higher in water stored in vessels compared to water directly obtained from the source. The contamination levels were generally higher during the wet season than the dry season. the household's stored drinking water and direct water sources were highly contaminated with coliform bacteria, posing a significant risk for the transmission of pathogenic waterborne diseases. Therefore, the need to implement an effective water treatment strategy to improve the quality of drinking water.",

This is the first report of the use of a commercial, rapid diagnostic assay in an outbreak setting. This method evaluation study was conducted at the National Health Laboratories Service (NHLS) Tshwane Microbiology laboratory in Pretoria, South Africa, during the outbreak period. Eighteen retrospective stored culture-positive Vibrio cholerae isolates and 102 prospective clinical specimens were processed on the EntericBio® Dx panel (Serosep, Limerick, Ireland) as well as the gold standard of culture. For the EntericBio® processing, stools were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the Roche LightCycler®. The diagnostic performance was compared between culture and the EntericBio® Dx assay. All discrepant results were resolved at a referral laboratory using an in-house PCR assay. The mean time to results using EntericBio® was 48 h earlier than culture results. Overall, the EntericBio® Dx panel demonstrated a sensitivity of 100 % for the detection of Vibrio species when compared to culture. Although the EntericBio® platform reported the results as Vibrio species, the pre-test probability was high for V. cholerae in an outbreak setting. Further serotyping methods have confirmed this. The quick turnaround time and excellent sensitivity of the EntericBio® platform expedites patient treatment and institution of appropriate infection control practices and has potential to rapidly control such outbreaks.",

Fasting blood samples were obtained in all participants. A multiplex assay was used to measure 48 chemokines and growth factors. An enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to measure plasma levels of human iFABP and zonulin. We found that in young female, at-risk drinkers had a lower level of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (p = 0.04) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (P = 0.04) than low-risk drinkers, while in males, an elevated level of interferon-gamma was found in at-risk drinkers compared to low-risk drinkers (P = 0.04). Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein levels were significantly higher and zonulin levels were significantly lower in at-risk-risk drinkers compared to low-risk drinkers (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively).

        "abstract": "Cholera is a severe infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> after colonization in the intestinal tract. Cholera toxin (CT), a key exotoxin protein, primarily causes acute secretory diarrhea and life-threatening complications in infected patients. Traditional approaches remain insufficient for effectively treating cholera, underscoring the need for innovative countermeasures to eliminate CT-caused symptoms. Here, we report a glycan-modified cellular nanosponge for the enhanced treatment of CT-induced secretory diarrhea. Specifically, intestinal epithelial cell membrane-camouflaged nanosponges are functionalized with a glycan receptor to promote their capability for CT neutralization, thereby competitively inhibiting CT entry into host cells. Moreover, an inhibitor is encapsulated into the cellular nanosponge to synergistically improve the therapeutic effect of diarrhea by blocking the excessive chloride ion efflux from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (a crucial anion channel) on the membrane of CT-intoxicated epithelial cells. Upon oral administration, the biomimetic nanomedicine effectively eliminates CT-induced secretory diarrhea and intestinal injuries in mice. Overall, this study highlights the potential of glycan-modified cellular nanosponges as promising and broad-spectrum therapeutic agents against secretory diarrhea caused by bacterial exotoxins.",

        "abstract": "Despite notable progress in public health throughout the 21st century, infectious diseases like tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera remain serious threats to global health, particularly in high-risk regions. Understanding the genetic factors that influence susceptibility and resistance to these diseases is essential for developing more effective strategies for their prevention and treatment. This study investigates the genetic variations associated with these infectious diseases with a focus on regions where these diseases are most prevalent. The aim of this study is to identify genetic variants that may influence susceptibility to tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera. A thorough analysis of genetic variants associated with susceptibility and resistance to tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera was conducted. Using publicly available genetic data from various ethnic groups. The allele frequency of the prioritized variants was calculated to assess their distribution within the different populations, including Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jewish, European (Non-Finnish), Latino/Admixed American, South Asian, East Asian, European (Finnish), North Asian, Southeast Asian, African American, and Swedish populations. The variants of the IL1β gene exhibiting the highest allele frequencies in the South Asian population were identified and subsequently examined within the local population. Specifically, the variants rs1143627 and rs1143629, which demonstrate the highest allele frequencies and are associated with typhoid, tuberculosis, and cholera, were subjected to detailed analysis. To determine their distribution and potential impact on disease susceptibility. In the local population, statistical analysis of the available sample revealed allele frequencies of 0.1128 % for IL1β (rs1143627) and 0.18 % for IL1β (rs1143629). Furthermore, these findings revealed that certain genetic profiles may play a role in the population's overall response to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera. This research has the potential to guide future public health strategies for more effective management and prevention of these diseases.",

        "abstract": "The Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS) has been an institution that has been forged over 80 years of existence, with contributions to the history of public health and epidemiological surveillance in Mexico; to do so, over the course of its institutional life, it has had to adapt to the contexts, realities, challenges and unforeseen events in terms of medical, sanitary and epidemiological care. In this sense, the Institute has modified its organizational structure on several occasions at managerial level, and, consequently, within the federal entities and in the medical care units. For this reason, this manuscript summarizes the main milestones and events that the Institute has experienced, focusing on its organic structure related to epidemiological surveillance; for example, the birth of the Epidemiological Surveillance and Contingency Support Coordination, as well as the Network of Laboratories for Epidemiological Surveillance and its growth, following a review mainly of the organization manuals of the Medical Benefits Administration and various institutional reports that are published annually, with many successes that have resulted from these changes and the alliances within the Institute, as well as the external ones that recall the strength and flexibility of the Institute's organizational structure.",

        "abstract": "The first immune response controls many bacterial and viral inflammatory diseases. Oral immunization with cholera toxin (CT) elicits antibodies and can prevent cholerae in endemic environments. While the IgG immune response to the toxin is well-documented, the IgA and IgM epitopes responsible for the initial immune reaction to the toxin remained uncharted. In this study, our objective was to identify and characterize immunologically and structurally these IgA and IgM epitopes. We conducted SPOT synthesis to create two libraries, each containing one hundred twenty-two 15-mer peptides, encompassing the entire sequence of the three chains of the CT protein. We could map continuous IgA and IgM epitopes by testing these membrane-bound peptides with sera from mice immunized with an oral vaccine (Schankol™). Our approach involved topological studies, peptide synthesis, and the development of an ELISA. We successfully identified seven IgA epitopes, two in CTA, two in CTB, and three in protein P. Additionally, we discovered eleven IgM epitopes, all situated within CTA. Three IgA-specific and three IgM-specific epitopes were synthesized as MAP4 and validated using ELISA. We then used two chimeric 45-mer peptides, which included these six epitopes, to coat ELISA plates and screened them with sera from immunized mice. This yielded sensitivities and specificities of 100%. Our findings have unveiled a significant collection of IgA and IgM-specific peptide epitopes from cholera toxins A, B, and P. These epitopes, along with those IgG previously identified by our group, reflect the immunoreactivity associated with the dynamic of the immunoglobulins switching associated with the cholera toxin vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Cholera, an acute diarrheal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae, remains a significant public health concern globally, with 1.4-4.0 million cases and 21,000-143,000 deaths annually. While the disease is endemic in 47 less-developed countries across Africa and Asia, the African continent has been particularly affected, with 19 of 29 countries reporting cases in 2023 being from Africa. To explore the trend of cholera outbreaks in Africa and analyze how climate change has contributed to the spread of the disease in the continent. A review of current cholera outbreaks in Africa, with particular focus on Sudan and Ethiopia as case studies, examining the relationship between climatic factors and cholera transmission. Recent outbreaks in Sudan (declared September 26, 2023) resulted in 5,414 suspected cases and 170 deaths (case fatality rate 3.1%) across nine states as of December 5, 2023. In Ethiopia's Somali region, 772 confirmed cases and 23 deaths were reported within two weeks, with approximately 80% of cases affecting children. Climate factors significantly influence cholera transmission: a 1 °C temperature rise doubled cholera cases in Zanzibar. Both drought conditions, which increase Vibrio cholerae concentration in groundwater, and heavy rainfall periods, which lead to flooding and breakdown of sanitary conditions, contribute to outbreak risks. Climate change impacts cholera transmission through rainfall patterns, temperature variations, and extreme weather events. Management recommendations include implementing accurate weather surveillance systems, strategic vaccination programs, flood-proof water supply infrastructure, and community engagement protocols. These interventions should be integrated while considering the growing influence of climate change on disease patterns. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "The use of antibiotics during a disease outbreak presents a critical tradeoff between immediate treatment benefits to the individual and the long-term risk to the population. Typically, the extensive use of antibiotics has been thought to increase selective pressures, leading to resistance. This study explores scenarios where expanded antibiotic treatment can be advantageous for both individual and population health. We develop a mathematical framework to assess the impacts on outbreak dynamics of choosing to treat moderate infections not treated under current guidelines, focusing on cholera as a case study. We derive conditions under which treating moderate infections can sufficiently decrease transmission and reduce the total number of antibiotic doses administered. We identify two critical thresholds: the Outbreak Prevention Threshold (OPT), where expanded treatment reduces the reproductive number below 1 and halts transmission, and the Dose Utilization Threshold (DUT), where expanded treatment results in fewer total antibiotic doses used than under current guidelines. For cholera, we find that treating moderate infections can feasibly stop an outbreak when the untreated reproductive number is less than 1.42 and will result in fewer does used compared to current guidelines when the untreated reproductive number is less than 1.53. These findings demonstrate that conditions exist under which expanding treatment to include moderate infections can reduce disease spread and the selective pressure for antibiotic resistance. These findings extend to other pathogens and outbreak scenarios, suggesting potential targets for optimized treatment strategies that balance public health benefits and antibiotic stewardship.",

This review synthesizes and discusses epidemiological data and consequences of simultaneous outbreaks in the DRC between January 2023 and March 2024. The findings highlight a 6.7% fatality rate and 3319 confirmed cases of mpox, with significant outbreaks in Kinshasa and 22 other provinces. Anthrax occasionally surfaced among cattle-raising villages, measles affected fewer than five children susceptible to the disease, and cholera outbreaks persisted in North Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika. Plague incidences, mostly bubonic, have been reported in Ituri province. Vulnerable groups, including children, mothers, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems, face increased risks due to poor healthcare access, hunger, and underlying medical conditions. Cultural beliefs, healthcare system issues, and socioeconomic instability impede effective response tactics. This strain on the fragile healthcare system highlights the need for increased surveillance, immunization efforts, and community involvement. To mitigate the effects of syndemic outbreaks, strengthening the DRC's health systems through international cooperation, integrated public health initiatives, and improved access to healthcare is crucial.",

        "abstract": "Zambia declared a cholera outbreak on 18 October 2023 and, as of 31 June 2024, had recorded 23 381 cases and 740 deaths. Of the patients seen at the 2 main cholera treatment centers in the capital Lusaka, a third of them were children aged 0 to 15 years. Despite the significant pediatric cholera burden, risk factors for mortality and prolonged hospitalization remain unknown. A retrospective data review was conducted by examining the clinical characteristics of patients aged 0 to 15 years hospitalized at the 2 cholera treatment centers between 15 October 2023 and 31 March 2024. Descriptive analysis was conducted for patient characteristics, and penalized logistic regression (PLR) was used to analyze risk factors for the outcomes. A total of 1891 patients were identified, among which 1.4% (18/1253) had fatal outcomes and 47.9% (399/833) had hospitalization >2 days. By the PLR, the following factors were independently correlated with hospitalization >2 days: HIV infection (odds ratio [OR], 6.89; 95% CI, 1.32-71.9), severe acute malnutrition (SAM; OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 2.91-61.1), and dehydration treatment plans B (OR, 3.93; 95% CI, 1.80-9.27) and C (OR, 7.54; 95% CI, 2.71-22.9). For the fatal outcome, none of them independently showed any significant correlations by the PLR, although younger age and SAM were positively associated by bivariate analysis. Comorbidities such as SAM and HIV, being on plan B or C, and deteriorating and requiring more intense treatment are associated with longer hospitalization. Risk factors for mortality need to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant B-subunit/Whole Cell Cholera Vaccine (rBS/WC) represents a new and effective way to protect against and control diarrhea. A test-negative case-control study was conducted to investigate the cross-protective effect of cholera vaccine immunization against bacterial infectious diarrhea in a real-world setting. Using a test-negative design, children aged 2-6 years with infectious diarrhea in Guangzhou City were selected as study subjects. A 1:4 propensity score matching based on the basic characteristics of the included study subjects, and vaccine effects were calculated after correcting for confounders. A total of 2796 children with laboratory-confirmed infectious diarrhea were enrolled in the study, and 316 pairs were successfully enrolled in the matching after Propensity Score Matching(PSM), totaling 1306. By conditional logistic regression analysis, The results showed that the total protective effect of ≥1 dose of rBS/WC vaccine against bacterial infectious diarrhea in children aged 2-6 years was 57.7 % (95 % CI: 30.3-74.3); the rBS/WC vaccine had the best protective effect of 74.8 % (95 % CI: 16.8-95.6) within 6 months of vaccination and then showed a decreasing trend. The vaccine's protective effect was 54.6 % (95 % CI: 22.1-73.5) against Salmonella and 69.2 % (95 % CI: -133.7-95.9) against Escherichia coli. Stratified analyses revealed higher point estimates of the protective effect obtained by vaccination among healthy children with good hygiene. These findings support the idea that the rBS/WC vaccination program is effective in the real world in preventing bacterial diarrhea in children. For people who are susceptible to bacterial diarrhea, the cholera vaccine is a good preventive option.",

        "abstract": "Endocarditis is a life-threatening infection of the heart valves, frequently caused by pathogenic bacteria. The growth of multidrug-resistant bacteria necessitates the development of innovative therapeutic techniques, such as vaccines. The current study employed core proteome analysis and a computational-based reverse vaccinology approach across multiple bacterial pathogens associated with endocarditis to identify prospective universal vaccine candidates. The core proteome analysis contained 121 highly pathogenic strains from ten distinct pathogens (<i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, <i>Streptococcus viridans</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i>, <i>Gemella morbillorum</i>, <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, and <i>Streptococcus gallolyticus</i>). The core proteome was subjected to a subtractive proteomics methodology. Three proteins that were virulent, non-homologous, antigenic, and non-allergenic have been identified as prospective candidates for vaccine development: 30S ribosomal protein S13, 50S ribosomal protein L6, and UMP Kinase. B and T cell epitopes were predicted from vaccine candidate proteins using a range of immune-informatics methods. An in silico vaccine was created by using meticulously chosen epitopes-seven Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), seven Linear B lymphocyte (LBL), and three Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes-and subsequently aligning them with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (MHC I & MHC II) and human TLR4. A Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) adjuvant was added to the vaccine to enhance the immunological response. The molecular interactions and binding affinity of the vaccine with TLR4 and MHC molecules were analyzed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. To ensure optimal vaccine protein expression, the vaccine was cloned and reverse-translated in <i>E. coli</i>. This methodology tackles the difficulties presented by the diversity of pathogens and antibiotic resistance, providing a strategic option for developing efficient and durable vaccines against infections associated with endocarditis.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the link between traditional practices, water stewardship, and cholera outbreaks in three rural Nigerian communities (Enugu, Delta, and Ondo States) in 2020. A sample of 180 participants, representing different socio-economic backgrounds, was surveyed using a mixed-methods approach. Knowledge-based pre-test and post-test measures were employed to assess changes in the understanding of cholera transmission, prevention, and water infrastructure. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were applied to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status, trust in traditional water sources, and cholera knowledge. Educational seminars were conducted, followed by six months, before administering the post-test to the same population. Key findings revealed that 47% of respondents washed animals in water sources, 42% did not treat their water, and 53% were unaware of cholera-reporting practices. The post-test results showed that 80% of participants could correctly identify cholera symptoms following educational interventions (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) program awareness was significantly associated with reduced cholera incidence (<i>p</i> = 0.005), while certain cultural practices, such as washing slaughtered animals in main water sources, were associated with increased cholera (<i>p</i> < 0.002). This study highlights the need for increased awareness of source water quality, better stewardship, and trust-building efforts to provide culturally appropriate interventions in mitigating these outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Cholera is a virulent infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative, comma-shaped bacteria Vibrio cholerae, after ingesting contaminated food and/or water. If left untreated, it can kill within 5 days. Since mid-2021 the world has recorded a notable increase in the seventh cholera pandemic, with high case fatality rate especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Oral cholera vaccines are established but not readily available on the market, or if they are, they are not pocket friendly for low-resource-income countries. Hence, with the advent of green factory biotechnology, plant-derived edible vaccines are such a promising approach to supplement conventional vaccine methods. Human travellers are often the major transmitters as they move from region to region. Poor sanitation and inadequate clean water supply are services not readily available in most Sub-Saharan African countries, coupled with insufficient surveillance services, lack of early detection facilities, and the public not having ample awareness concerning sanitation and hygiene. This article highlights the epidemiology of cholera in Africa and expounds on what drives the outbreaks of cholera in this region. The discussion provides an in-depth analysis of the factors leading to the forsaken cholera drivers, emphasizing economic factors, culture, and environmental influences, particularly within the Sub-Saharan African communities. It presents a strategic blueprint approach that includes public health awareness, community participation, government involvement, and exploring emerging research tools. By merging these proposals into a unified context, a collective and practical methodology would be established to tackle the impact of cholera epidemiology that has been sidelined in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Over the past 50 years, developing new vaccines has been pivotal in responding to emerging and re-emerging diseases globally. However, despite substantial partner support, introducing new vaccines in sub-Saharan Africa remains challenging. This systematic review documents the barriers to new vaccine introduction in sub-Saharan Africa by distinguishing between vaccines integrated into routine immunization programs and those introduced primarily for outbreak response. <b>Methods:</b> A comprehensive electronic search was conducted across five databases for articles published in English or French on the challenges of new vaccine introduction in sub-Saharan Africa. Three reviewers screened articles independently based on the titles and abstracts, with full-text assessments conducted for inclusion. Data were analyzed thematically and synthesized narratively. <b>Results:</b> A total of 796 articles were retrieved from the five databases. Following the screening, 33 articles were finally retained and included in the review. These articles concerned the introduction of eight new vaccines (malaria vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, HPV vaccine, Ebola vaccine, cholera vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, and typhoid vaccine). The analyses revealed coordination and financing challenges for six vaccines in seventeen countries, acceptability challenges for five vaccines in ten countries, logistical challenges for two vaccines in six countries, and quality service delivery challenges for three vaccines in thirteen countries. <b>Conclusions:</b> Addressing the challenges of introducing new vaccines in sub-Saharan Africa requires targeted, evidence-based strategies. Prioritizing political commitment, innovative funding, public education, workforce development, and infrastructure improvements will strengthen immunization systems and enable timely vaccine delivery. Collaborative efforts and a focus on local context can advance equitable health outcomes, safeguard public health, and support global immunization goals.",

        "abstract": "Cholera, a diarrheal disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, remains a global health threat in developing countries due to its high transmissibility and increased antibiotic resistance. There is a pressing need for alternative strategies, with an emphasis on anti-virulent approaches to alter the outcome of bacterial infections, given the increase in antimicrobial-resistant strains. <i>V. cholerae</i> causes cholera by secreting virulence factors in the intestinal epithelial cells. These virulence factors facilitate bacterial colonization and cholera toxin production during infection. Here, we demonstrate that sodium butyrate (SB), a small molecule, had no effect on bacterial viability but was effective in suppressing the virulence attributes of <i>V. cholerae</i>. The production of cholera toxin (CT) was significantly reduced in a standard <i>V. cholerae</i> El Tor strain and two clinical isolates when grown in the presence of SB. Analysis of mRNA and protein levels further revealed that SB reduced the expression of the ToxT-dependent virulence genes like <i>tcpA</i> and <i>ctxAB</i>. DNA-protein interaction assays, conducted at cellular (ChIP) and <i>in vitro</i> conditions (EMSA), indicated that SB weakens the binding between ToxT and its downstream promoter DNA, likely by blocking DNA binding. Furthermore, the anti-virulence efficacy of SB was confirmed in animal models. These findings suggest that SB could be developed as an anti-virulence agent against <i>V. cholerae,</i> serving as a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics or as an adjunctive therapy to combat cholera. The world has been facing an upsurge in cholera cases since 2021, a similar trend continuing into 2022, with over 29 countries reporting cholera outbreaks (World Health Organization, 16 December 2022, Disease Outbreak News, Cholera-global situation). Treatment of cholera involves oral rehydration therapy coupled with antibiotics to reduce the duration of the illness. However, in recent years, indiscriminate use of antibiotics has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. In this study, we have addressed the problem of antibiotic resistance by targeting virulence factors. Screening various compounds using <i>in silico</i> methods led to the identification of a small molecule, SB, that inhibits the virulence cascade in <i>V. cholerae</i>. We demonstrated that (i) SB intervened in ToxT protein-DNA binding and subsequently affected the expression of ToxT-regulated virulence genes (<i>ctxAB</i> and <i>tcpA</i>) and (ii) SB is a potential therapeutic candidate for the development of a novel antimicrobial agent.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides are small cationic molecules produced by eukaryotic cells to combat infection, as well as by bacteria for niche competition. Polymyxin B (PmB), a cyclic antimicrobial peptide, is used prophylactically in livestock and as a last-resort treatment for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in humans. In this study, a transcriptomic analysis in Vibrio cholerae showed that expression of the uncharacterized gene ompV is stimulated in response to PmB. We found that ompV is organized in a conserved four-gene operon with the two-component system carRS and virK in V. cholerae. A virK deletion mutant and an ompV deletion mutant were more sensitive to antimicrobials, suggesting that both OmpV and VirK contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Our transcriptomic analysis showed that the efflux pump vexAB, a known effector of PmB resistance, was upregulated in an ompV-dependent manner in the presence of PmB. The predicted structure of OmpV revealed a lateral opening in the β-barrel wall with access to an electronegative pocket in the barrel lumen that can accommodate PmB. Such an interaction could facilitate intracellular signaling through a conformational change in OmpV. This provides the first evidence of a specialized operon governing multiple systems for antimicrobial resistance in V. cholerae.",

The study population was individual healers who were residents of Benatsemay Woreda with different sociodemographic characteristics. An ethnoveterinary botanical survey was conducted to gather information on the traditional usage of plants in the livestock healthcare system. Information was collected by direct interview with 40 known traditional healers and 8 key informants. Animals reared in the area include cattle, goats, sheep, poultry, equine, dogs, and cats. The animals were ranked based on their population number and importance to the livelihood of the family. Accordingly, cattle are ranked first based on both criteria. Diseases of animals prevailing in the study area were identified and ranked based on their morbidity and mortality rates as well. From the diseases of cattle, CBPP is ranked first based on both morbidity and mortality rates via pairwise ranking. Among the diseases of goats, CCPP and salmonellosis were important diseases. The prevalent sheep disease is ovine pasteurellosis with the highest mortality rate. Among poultry diseases, NCD, fowl cholera, and fowl pox were the dominant diseases in the area. Epizootic lymphangitis and rabies were the most important diseases in equine and dogs/cats, respectively. Traditional healers use different plant species to treat these diseases. Twenty-three plant species were collected, preserved, and botanically named. Root, leaves, seeds, and other plant parts were recorded that could be employed to treat sick animals. The most widely practiced administration of medicinal plant preparations was the oral administration of infusion.",

        "abstract": "Microbial contamination of water sources is a pressing global challenge, disproportionately affecting developing regions with inadequate infrastructure and limited access to safe drinking water. In the Global South, waterborne pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths contribute to diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, resulting in severe public health burdens. Predictive modeling emerges as a pivotal tool in addressing these challenges, offering data-driven insights to anticipate contamination events and optimize mitigation strategies. This review highlights the application of predictive modeling techniques-including machine learning, hydrological simulations, and quantitative microbial risk assessment -to identify contamination hotspots, forecast pathogen dynamics, and inform water resource allocation in the Global South. Predictive models enable targeted actions to improve water safety and lower the prevalence of waterborne diseases by combining environmental, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. Water resources in the Global South are increasingly vulnerability to microbial contamination, and the challenge is exacerbated by rapid urbanization, climate variability, and insufficient sanitation infrastructure. This review underscores the importance of region-specific modeling approaches. Case studies from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia demonstrated the efficacy of predictive modeling tools in guiding public health actions connected to environmental matrices, from prioritizing water treatment efforts to implementing early-warning systems during extreme weather events. Furthermore, the review explores integrating advanced technologies, such as remote sensing and artificial intelligence, into predictive frameworks, highlighting their potential to improve accuracy and scalability in resource-constrained settings. Increased funding for data collecting, predictive modeling tools, and cross-sectoral cooperation between local communities, non-governmental organizations, and governments are all recommended in the review. Such efforts are critical for developing resilient water systems capable of withstanding environmental stressors and ensuring sustainable access to safe drinking water. By leveraging predictive modeling as a core component of water management strategies, stakeholders can address microbial contamination challenges effectively, safeguard public health, and contribute to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.",

        "abstract": "Cholera is a highly contagious bacterial disease that causes severe watery diarrhea. It spreads mainly through contaminated food or water containing <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O139 and remains a major global public health threat. We investigated an outbreak to identify its cause, source, and risk factors and to develop control measures. A suspected case was classified as the occurrence of acute watery diarrhea in a Dollo Ado District resident aged 2 or older between February 2, 2023 and March 15, 2023. A confirmed case was a suspected case with <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> detected in the patient's stool sample. An investigation of the outbreak was conducted; cases were described and the environment, where contamination may take place assessed and an unmatched case-control study conducted in Suftu Kebele, which served as the epi center of the outbreak. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for cholera infection. A total of 92 cases were identified, including 66 males and 26 females, with four deaths (4.3% fatality rate). Males had a higher attack rate (2.4 per 1,000 people) than females (1.6 per 1,000 people). Suftu village was the hardest-hit area (attack rate: 41 per 1,000 people). The outbreak began after a person suspected of having cholera returned from mandera, kenya, on February 2, 2023. Five days later, cases emerged in suftu village. Many residents practiced open defecation and used the dawa river for bathing, washing clothes, and drinking. Using untreated river water significantly increased the risk of infection (AOR = 20, 95% CI: 5.2-73). The outbreak likely started at a funeral of a suspected cholera case, spreading through contaminated river water. It was contained within a week by restricting river water use and preventing further contamination.",

        "abstract": "Biopolymers are natural polymers produced by the cells of living organisms such as plants, animals, microbes, etc. As these natural molecules possess antimicrobial activities against pathogens, they can be a suitable candidate for antimicrobials combating drug-resistant microorganisms including food-borne pathogens. Plant-derived biopolymers such as cellulose, starch, pullulans; microbes-derived chitosan, poly-L-lysine; animal-derived collagen, gelatin, spongin, etc. are proven to possess antimicrobial properties. They exert their antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens namely Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, etc. As antimicrobial resistance becomes a global phenomenon and threatens the effective prevention and treatment of infections caused by pathogens, biopolymers could be a promising candidate/substitute for conventional antimicrobials available in markets. Biopolymers can have detrimental effects on microbial cells such as disruption of the cell walls and cell membranes; damage to the DNA caused by strand breakage, unwinding, or cross-linking resulting in impeded DNA transcription and replication; lowering the amount of energy required for metabolic processes by compromising the proton motive force. Biopolymers also interfere with the quorum sensing mechanism and biofilm formation of microbes and modulate the host immune system by downregulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways resulting in the decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, conjugating these biopolymers with other antimicrobial agents could be a promising approach to control multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens. This review provides an overview of the various sources of biopolymers with special reference to their antimicrobial applications, especially against foodborne pathogens, and highlights their antimicrobial mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Vaccine policy and guideline recommendations require high quality evidence. A review of the evidence quality used to inform vaccine clinical practice guidelines could help guide researchers on how to improve the design of their clinical studies to produce evidence of greater value to decision-makers. In Australia, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) develops evidence-based vaccine clinical practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, a transparent, systematic and methodical framework for developing and presenting summaries of evidence and its certainty. We summarised the publicly available Australian GRADE assessments for the use of vaccines for prevention of cholera, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, human papillomavirus, influenza, meningococcal, pneumococcal, rabies and varicella zoster virus, including the certainty of evidence for each outcome (e.g., effectiveness, immunological or safety outcomes) and overall, in addition to the reasons for downgrade or upgrade of the certainty assessments. Across 25 research questions, 189 separate outcomes were assessed; of these 43 (22.8 %), 38 (20.1 %), 68 (36.0 %) and 40 (21.2 %) were classified as informed by very low, low, moderate and high certainty of evidence, respectively. Overall, 4 (16 %), 10 (40 %), 9 (36 %) and 2 (8 %) research questions across the disease areas had their overall certainty of evidence classified as very low, low, moderate and high, respectively. Certainty of evidence was downgraded for confounding, uncertainty in the effect estimation, and differences between the research questions asked by ATAGI and those answered in the studies. There is an unmet need to improve the quality of evidence available to vaccine policy-makers and National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups. This could be achieved by improving the design of vaccine trials, in particular improving the precision of statistical estimates, inclusion of relevant subpopulations and ensuring trial endpoints are better aligned with the needs of policy-makers.",

Utilization of N, N, N', N'-tetrakis-(2-Pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), a specific chelator of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, revealed positive medical potentials. However, its therapeutic effect in promoting RGCs survival and axon regeneration is restricted due to the inefficient drug delivery and limited absorption. To address this, this work developed a novel nanoparticles (NPs)-based drug delivery system with sustained release of TPEN, using oil-in-water (O/W) single-emulsion solvent evaporation method with various surfaces coatings. Optic nerve crush (ONC) and acute ocular hypertension (AOH) animal models were carried out to investigate the neuroprotective and axon regenerative effects of TPEN-loaded NPs. RGCs protection was systematically assessed through whole-mount retina immunostaining and hematoxylin eosin staining for histological changes. Electroretinography was used for evaluating visual function changes. Axon protection and regeneration were evaluated by SMI32 stain and intravitreal administration of cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB), respectively. <i>In vivo</i>, TPEN-loaded NPs achieved a comparable therapeutic effect on neuroprotection and axon regeneration after ONC, with a reduced frequency of vitreous injection and half of TPEN dosage compared to its solution. In the meantime, visual function was also more effectively preserved with TPEN-loaded NPs. Additionally, RGCs survival and axon protection after AOH were significantly enhanced after treating with TPEN-loaded NPs. The developed TPEN-loaded NPs show promise for pre-clinical testing of neuroprotective and neuro-regenerative therapies in glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae pathogens cause cholera, an acute diarrheal disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Biofilms in vibrios enhance their survival in natural ecosystems and facilitate transmission during cholera outbreaks. Critical components of the biofilm matrix include the <i>Vibrio</i> polysaccharides produced by the <i>vps</i>-1 and <i>vps</i>-2 gene clusters and the biofilm matrix proteins encoded in the <i>rbm</i> gene cluster, together comprising the biofilm matrix cluster. However, the biofilm matrix clusters and their evolutionary patterns in other <i>Vibrio</i> species remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigated the distribution, diversity, and evolution of biofilm matrix clusters and proteins across the <i>Vibrio</i> genus. Our findings reveal that these gene clusters are sporadically distributed throughout the genus, even appearing in species phylogenetically distant from <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Evolutionary analysis of the major biofilm matrix proteins RbmC and Bap1 shows that they are structurally and sequentially related, having undergone structural domain and modular alterations. Additionally, a novel loop-less Bap1 variant was identified, predominantly represented in two phylogenetically distant <i>V. cholerae</i> subspecies clades that share specific gene groups associated with the presence or absence of the protein. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that <i>rbmB</i>, a gene involved in biofilm dispersal, shares a recent common ancestor with Vibriophage tail proteins, suggesting that phages may mimic host functions to evade biofilm-associated defenses. Our study offers a foundational understanding of the diversity and evolution of biofilm matrix clusters in vibrios, laying the groundwork for future biofilm engineering through genetic modification. Biofilms help vibrios survive in nature and spread cholera. However, the genes that control biofilm formation in vibrios other than <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> are not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the biofilm matrix gene clusters and proteins across diverse Vibrio species to explore their patterns and evolution. We discovered that these genes are spread across different Vibrio species, including those not closely related to <i>V. cholerae</i>. We also found various forms of key biofilm proteins with different structures. Additionally, we identified genes involved in biofilm dispersal that are related to vibriophage genes, highlighting the role of phages in biofilm development.

In the pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, the DbfRS two-component system controls the biofilm lifecycle, a critical process for environmental persistence and host colonization. Here, we identified DbfQ, a small periplasmic protein encoded adjacent to <i>dbfRS</i>, as a direct modulator of pathway activity. DbfQ directly binds the sensory domain of the histidine kinase DbfS, shifting it toward phosphatase activity and promoting biofilm dispersal. In contrast, outer membrane perturbations, caused by mutations in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes or membrane-damaging antimicrobials, activate phosphorylation of the response regulator DbfR. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that DbfR phosphorylation leads to broad transcriptional changes spanning genes involved in biofilm formation, central metabolism, peptidoglycan synthesis, and cellular stress responses. Constitutive DbfR phosphorylation imposes severe fitness costs in an infection model, highlighting this pathway as a potential target for anti-infective therapeutics. We find that <i>dbfQRS</i>-like genetic modules are widely present across bacterial phyla, underscoring their broad relevance in bacterial physiology.

        "abstract": "Introduction Bukavu city is facing sanitation challenges, with many reported cases of epidemics such as cholera, salmonellosis, and other infectious diseases. Food and water sold under poor sanitation conditions are exposed to potential contamination by pathogenic bacteria. Consumers are therefore at risk of contracting bacterial infections, which could increase the burden of infectious diseases. Solid waste and wastewater management is unsatisfactory in Bukavu city. Few scientific investigations have been conducted to assess the influence of environmental conditions on food and water contamination. For these reasons, this study aimed to investigate the quality of food sold in restaurants and on the streets, as well as the types of water and milk produced and consumed, since food safety and environmental sanitation remain major public health challenges in Bukavu city. Objective The broad objective of this study was to assess the safety risks associated with food and water contamination by <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in Bukavu city, DR Congo. Methods A field observation was conducted to identify restaurant locations, and a probabilistic model was applied to determine the number of restaurants to be surveyed. A simple random method was then applied to survey 206 food handlers in restaurants across all three municipalities of Bukavu city. A total of 415 food samples from restaurants, 34 milk samples from dairy farms, and 104 water samples from taps, tanks, and wells were collected. <i>Salmonella enterica</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> were isolated from these samples, characterized, and identified through cultural methods and biochemical tests. Results The presence of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> was observed in 38.2% of pork, sausage, and ugali samples (n = 34 for each food), 35.5% of bread, 32.4% of beef and potatoes (n = 34 for each food), and 24.4% of beans (n = 41) tested positive for <i>S. enterica</i>. While <i>Escherichia coli</i> was not isolated from beans, beef, potato, sausage, or vegetable samples, the bacterium was most prevalent in fish (11.8%, n = 34). More than half (57.1%, n = 28) of the water samples from wells were contaminated by <i>S. enterica</i>, and 35.7% (n = 28) by <i>E. coli</i>. The high rate of well contamination could be explained by the location of wells near public waste disposal sites, sewage systems, and pathways frequently used by humans and animals. The presence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>E. coli</i> was not significantly different in food (p = 0.15) and water (p = 0.58), suggesting that the environmental conditions of Bukavu city are favorable for the growth of both bacterial species in food and water. However, food contamination by <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>E. coli</i> was significantly (p < 0.05) dependent on food handling practices such as \"frequency of cooking food\" and \"heating food before serving customers\" in both formal and informal restaurants (street-vended food). Conclusion Hygiene practices in Bukavu restaurants were not sufficient to guarantee safe food for human consumption, particularly during the serving stages. There is a need for public health and environmental decision-makers to develop or update guidelines in line with national and international standards to enhance public health countermeasures in and around wells, restaurants, and street-vended food and to improve water treatment and infrastructure in Bukavu city.",

        "abstract": "Cholera is an easily treatable disease, but many people are still unnecessarily dying from it. To improve current case management practices and prevent mortality requires a comprehensive understanding of who is at higher risk of dying. To identify the most common risk factors, a scoping review was undertaken, to explore the literature and summarise the evidence on cholera mortality and reported risk factors. Following the scoping review framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, LILACS, Scielo, Cochrane and Open Grey and African Journals Online were searched on 24 November 2021, without restrictions in language or date. After screening and assessing the records across predefined criteria, we performed a thematic analysis on mortality. A total of 77 studies were included in the final review. The potential reasons explaining the observed mortality were classified in the following categories: Patient characteristics; Healthcare; and Health-seeking behaviour. The identified risk factors were multi-dimensional, inter-dependent and context-specific. When exploring the patients' characteristics, the available data suggested that in many contexts, case fatality ratios were higher among males and older people, especially those aged 50 or above. Twelve studies reported the place of death, with the percentage of community deaths ranging from 23% to 96%. Evidence on comorbidities and cholera deaths was too scarce for analysis. Cholera has been a disease of global importance for more than two centuries. Despite this, our review highlighted that there has been limited published evidence about factors that increase the risk of cholera-related death.

        "abstract": "Cholera is a vaccine-preventable disease that has faced a surge in outbreaks and a shortage of vaccines. The new generation oral cholera vaccine (OCV) BBV131, featuring a simplified single stable O1 Hikojima strain, aims to enhance production efficiency and affordability. This study evaluates BBV131's immune profile, safety, and non-inferiority compared to Shanchol™ in healthy adults and children. Adding BBV131 to the vaccine stockpile could improve supply, simplify logistics, and ease administration efforts. In this randomised, modified, double-blind, multi-centre, phase III trial, 1800 participants were recruited across 10 clinical trial sites across India. Participants were stratified into three age groups (adults >18 years, children ≥5 to <18 years, and infants ≥1 to <5 years) and were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive either BBV131 or Shanchol™. All participants received two doses of the vaccine orally on days 0 and 14. Immunogenicity was assessed through blood samples collected at baseline, two weeks after each dose, and follow-ups at days 28, 56, 90, and 180. The primary endpoint focused on the proportion of participants achieving >4-fold increase in vibriocidal antibody titres against Ogawa and Inaba serotypes 14 days post two doses. While secondary endpoints included Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) measurements and safety. Safety was evaluated throughout the study, reporting solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs). Another cohort of 1800 was added to the above study as an addendum to expand the safety database. Of the 1800 enrolled participants, 1794 completed the study. Post-vaccination, the percentage of participants in the BBV131 group who exhibited a > 4-fold increase in anti-V. cholerae antibody titres were 68.25 % for Ogawa and 69.52 % for Inaba-demonstrating non-inferiority to Shanchol™, with a lower limit of 95 % CI above the non-inferiority margin. The safety profile revealed 257 AEs among 236 participants (13.1 %), with similar incidence across age groups and between vaccines; common AEs included dry mouth and headache. The findings indicate that BBV131 demonstrates non-inferior immunogenicity and comparable safety to Shanchol™ in healthy Indian adults and children, supporting its potential as an effective OCV.

        "title": "<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O47 associated with a cholera-like diarrheal outbreak concurrent with seasonal cholera in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The Ganges delta of the Bay of Bengal is a recognized hotspot for the emergence and spread of novel variants of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Despite being a diverse species, very little information is available concerning environmental and human-associated aspects of <i>V. cholerae</i> serogroups, other than the two major epidemic-related serogroups O1 and O139. This represents a crucial gap in understanding the spectrum of diversity, ecology, and epidemiology of the species influencing the dynamics of global cholera. In this study, we describe an emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i> displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in coastal Bangladesh where cholera has been endemic for centuries. This outbreak coincides with a rise in cases of cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O1, as well as frequency of isolation of serogroups O47 and O1 from the environment. The <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 isolates proved clonal in nature, and their genome biology revealed distinct features, with respect to multidrug resistance (MDR), serogroup-specific genes, genomic island combinations, and overall phylogenetic properties. Genome comparison confirmed the absence of canonical virulence factors of <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 and O139, namely, cholera toxin (CTX) and toxin-co-regulated pili (TCP), and the presence of putative virulence factors including type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and an MDR pseudo-compound transposon, carrying genes for macrolide resistance and extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Results of the study suggest that <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 could represent an emerging <i>Vibrio</i> pathogen with the potential to spread virulence and antimicrobial resistance traits impacting the management of cholera-like diseases.IMPORTANCEDespite the global insurgence of human diseases caused by Vibrios in recent years, most research focuses only on the O1 serogroup of <i>V. cholerae</i>, leaving a significant gap concerning the environmental and human-associated aspects of other serogroups found in nature. Although other serogroups are often found associated with sporadic diarrhea cases, in 1992-1993, a massive cholera-like diarrhea epidemic was initiated by a \"non-O1\" serogroup, namely, O139 that temporally displaced O1 from endemic cholera in the Bay of Bengal villages of Bangladesh and India, highlighting the potential threat they might pose. This study describes yet another emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i>, displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in a coastal locality in Bangladesh. Findings of the study offer critical insights into the genome biology of <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 and its potential implications for understanding their ecology and epidemiology of cholera-like diseases.",
