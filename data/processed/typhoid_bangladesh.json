        "title": "Interplay between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever: insights from endemic countries and a controlled human infection model.",
        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited. To investigate the association between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n = 92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop the disease, n = 97) and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n = 69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition and function were compared. We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against the development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had a higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22). This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections. Video Abstract.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common infectious diseases and remain a heavy burden, especially in some low-income countries. Although the global burden has decreased over the past three decades, an analysis of the burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever will help inform public health strategies. This study is aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of typhoid and paratyphoid, and the temporal trends while exploring potential associations with socio-demographic development over three decades (1990-2021). Data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2021. For this analysis, we calculated to demonstrate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021. From 1990 to 2021, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever showed declining trends globally and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, including incidence, mortality, and DALYs. For typhoid fever worldwide, new cases decreased by 62.12%, with an EAPC of -3.92 (-4.14, -3.71); deaths decreased by 50.65%, EAPC - 2.83 (-2.99, -2.66), and DALYs decreased by 52.30%, EAPC - 2.82 (-3.00, -2.64). For paratyphoid fever, new cases decreased by 73.15%, with an EAPC of -4.77 (-5.29, -4.26); deaths decreased by 65.44%, EAPC - 3.74 (-4.24, -3.24), and DALYs decreased by 68.42%, EAPC - 3.87 (-4.42, -3.31). For both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, children had the highest morbidity and mortality rates; males had higher rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs than females. However, among older patients, the absolute number of new cases and DALYs was higher in women. The burden is concentrated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, with only South Asia suffering severely from paratyphoid fever. Regarding typhoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of incidence are Burkina Faso (328.48) (SDI: 0.285), Bangladesh (303.14) (SDI: 0.492), and Papua New Guinea (299.45) (SDI: 418) which are in Western Sub-Saharan, South Asia, and Oceania. The top three countries in terms of mortality and DALYs are Bhutan (5.61; 434.23) (SDI: 0.473), Bangladesh (5.06; 382.38), and Burkina Faso (4.64; 352.57). Regarding paratyphoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of mortality and DALYs are the same, including Pakistan (1.05; 72.66), India (0.75; 53.42), and Nepal (0.72; 50.65) (SDI: 0.433), all of which are located in South Asia.",

        "abstract": "Enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A and, to a lesser extent, S. Paratyphi B and C, remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in resource-constrained settings. Typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) protect against S. Typhi but no vaccine to date protects against paratyphoid fever. There are several bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A products in development; however, the low incidence of paratyphoid fever in many settings limits the feasibility of phase 3 efficacy studies. Two bivalent vaccines adding the S. Paratyphi A-specific O:2 lipopolysaccharide conjugated to a protein carrier to TCV constructs have successfully completed phase 1 studies and will progress rapidly in their development. The WHO's Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) endorsed a regulatory pathway for a bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A vaccine that contemplates demonstrating protective efficacy against S. Paratyphi A infection in a controlled human infection model (CHIM). Since the use of CHIM data in lieu of phase 3 efficacy studies and to identify markers of immune protection is not yet widely accepted by regulatory bodies, the WHO organized a consultation with vaccine developers, manufacturers, and regulators. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the feasibility and considerations for the licensure of a bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A vaccine. The aim of the consultation was to gain alignment among key stakeholders and facilitate the pathway to licensure in endemic countries.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever remains a substantial public health challenge in low-income and middle-income countries. By 2023, typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) had been introduced in six countries globally, with more than 50 million doses distributed. Now that TCVs are being deployed, there is a need for observational studies to assess vaccine effectiveness in the field. We aimed to evaluate the validity of different observational study designs in estimating vaccine protection. We compared different observational and experimental study designs for assessing vaccine effectiveness by re-analysing data from the TyVAC Bangladesh trial, a participant-blinded and observer-blinded cluster-randomised controlled trial done in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 150 geographical clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine. Eligible children aged 9 months to 15 years were offered a single dose of the vaccine randomly assigned to their cluster of residence, and baseline vaccination was done between April 15 and May 15, 2018. We compared estimates of vaccine effectiveness from the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis-which assessed the risk of blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever among recipients of TCV versus recipients of Japanese encephalitis vaccine-with estimates from cohort study and test-negative case-control study design (TND) analyses, which compared recipients of TCV with non-vaccinees in the 75 geographical clusters where TCV was administered. We further conducted negative-control exposure (NCE) and negative-control outcome (NCO) analyses as bias indicators. 41 344 (67%) of 62 025 age-eligible children in the study area received the TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine during the baseline vaccination campaign. Among the 62 025 age-eligible children, 5582 blood-culture specimens were collected by passive surveillance, including 2546 (46%) specimens from the 75 TCV clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy was 89% (95% CI 81-93) in the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis, 79% (70-86) by the cohort design, 88% (79-93) by the TND when pan-negatives were used as test-negative controls, and 90% (75-96) by the TND when specimens positive for pathogens other than Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi were used as test-negative controls. Using NCE analysis, Japanese encephalitis vaccination was associated with an increased risk of typhoid fever compared with non-vaccinees in the 75 Japanese encephalitis clusters in the cohort design (incidence rate ratio 1·98 [95% CI 1·56-2·52]), but no significant association between Japanese encephalitis vaccination and typhoid fever was found with the TND. Similarly, an increased risk of non-typhoid infections was observed in the cohort NCO analyses when comparing vaccinees with non-vaccinees in both Japanese encephalitis vaccine clusters and TCV clusters, but not in the TND NCO analyses. Our findings suggests that the TND provides reliable estimates of TCV effectiveness, whereas the cohort design can bias vaccine effectiveness estimates, possibly due to unmeasured confounding effects, such as health-care-seeking behaviours. NCE and NCO approaches are useful tools for identifying such biases. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Typhi) and Paratyphi (<i>S</i>. Paratyphi) to provide an evidence base for prevention and control measures in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. From October 2020 to September 2022, we conducted prospective clinical surveillance and retrospective laboratory surveillance at health facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; and Karachi, Pakistan. Patients were eligible if they were outpatients with three or more days of fever in the last week. In Nepal and Pakistan, inpatients were eligible if they had suspected or confirmed enteric fever; in Bangladesh, only inpatients with confirmed enteric fever were enrolled. Patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever identified by hospital laboratories and laboratory network sites were also enrolled. Patients completed interviews and medical records were reviewed and abstracted. All enrolled patients had blood cultures performed. Antibiograms were performed to characterize drug sensitivity. We summarized the data descriptively. A total of 17,593 patients were enrolled from 19 facilities. Of these, 8410 patients had culture-confirmed enteric fever. Case counts in all countries decreased in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but increased over time in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Case counts remained low throughout the study period in Nepal. In all countries, typhoid was more common than paratyphoid; the proportion of paratyphoid cases ranged from 8.4% in Pakistan to 16% in Nepal. Extensively drug-resistant typhoid was common in Pakistan (69%), but was not detected in Bangladesh or Nepal. Cases of enteric fever decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, though it is not clear how much of this decrease relates to true changes in transmission versus health-seeking behavior.

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and disease containment. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This study aims to develop a lightweight machine learning-based diagnostic tool for the early and efficient detection of typhoid fever using clinical data. <b>Methods:</b> A custom dataset comprising 14 clinical and demographic parameters-including age, gender, headache, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, cough, fever range (°F), hemoglobin (g/dL), platelet count, urine culture bacteria, calcium (mg/dL), and potassium (mg/dL)-was analyzed. A machine learning metamodel, integrating Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Decision Tree classifiers with a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), was trained and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). <b>Results:</b> The proposed metamodel demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, achieving a precision of 99%, recall of 100%, and an AUC of 1.00. It outperformed traditional diagnostic methods and other standalone machine learning algorithms, offering high accuracy and generalizability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The lightweight machine learning metamodel provides a cost-effective, non-invasive, and rapid diagnostic alternative for typhoid fever, particularly suited for resource-limited settings. Its reliance on accessible clinical parameters ensures practical applicability and scalability, potentially improving patient outcomes and aiding in disease control.

        "abstract": "When delivered through vaccination Vi-polysaccharide antigen of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi protects against typhoid by inducing IgG anti-Vi antibodies. We aimed to determine whether the presence of antibodies following natural infection is associated with a lower incidence of typhoid fever in endemic regions. We analyzed data from a cohort study of typhoid fever conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Plasma IgG anti-Vi antibodies were measured using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in random serosurveys of a population that had not previously received typhoid vaccination. Participants were followed for up to 20 months for culture-confirmed typhoid fever. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations between antibody levels and typhoid risk. The ROC analysis revealed that IgG anti-Vi antibody titers were predictive of typhoid risk among the 8,261 serosurvey participants (area under the curve: 0·63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·58─0·67). Detection of any antibodies was associated with a lower risk of typhoid in crude analyses (hazard ratio (HR): 0·13; 95% CI: 0·03─0·52), though this association declined after adjustment (HR: 0·32; 95% CI: 0·07─1·40). A positive correlation was observed between IgG anti-Vi titers and age (correlation coefficient 0·35; p < 0·001), with a stepwise increase in detectable antibodies by age, ranging from 12·0% (280/2,333) in children under 5 years to 54·2% (463/854) in individuals 50 years and older (p < 0·001). In typhoid-endemic populations, IgG anti-Vi antibodies may indicate natural immunity to typhoid. The increasing seroprevalence with age suggests that these antibodies could serve as markers of cumulative past typhoid infections. Future research should explore these possibilities.

Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern and identifying the best tree-based ML models for determining the meteorological factors associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh. This study used district-level reported cases of waterborne diseases (cholera, amoebiasis, typhoid and hepatitis A) obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) sourced from NASA for the period spanning 2017 to 2020. Exploratory spatial analysis, spatial regression and tree-based machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 and 2020, Bangladesh reported 73, 606 cholera, 38, 472 typhoid, 2, 510 hepatitis A and 1, 643 amoebiasis disease cases. Among the waterborne diseases cholera showed higher incidence rates in Chapai-Nawabganj (456.23), Brahmanbaria (417.44), Faridpur (225.07), Nilphamari (188.62) and Pirojpur (171.62) districts. The spatial regression model identified mean temperature (β = 12.16, s.e: 3.91) as the significant risk factor of waterborne diseases. The optimal XGBoost model highlighted mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation as determinants associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2020. The findings from the study, incorporating the One Health perspective, provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat waterborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries. Precautionary measures and intensified surveillance need to be implemented in certain high-risk districts for waterborne diseases across the country.",

        "abstract": "There is a shortage of rapid, accurate, and low-cost assays for diagnosing enteric fever. The dual-path platform for typhoid (DPPT) assay had high accuracy in retrospective studies with banked plasma samples. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the DPPT assay in a prospective study using fingerstick capillary blood. For this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled children younger than 18 years, who presented at the Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute (Dhaka, Bangladesh) with at least 3 days of fever. We collected blood and nasal swabs, and did the following assays to assess the accuracy of DPPT: blood culture, serological assays for typhoid fever (DPPT assay, Widal, and Test-it), and molecular assays to identify alternative aetiologies (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], influenza, dengue virus, and Rickettsia spp). The primary outcomes of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay for diagnosis of enteric fever. We evaluated the accuracy of combined anti-haemolysin E and anti-lipopolysaccharide IgA readings using the DPPT assay in distinguishing culture-confirmed enteric fever from alternative aetiologies using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). Given the imperfect reference standard diagnostics for enteric fever, we used Bayesian latent class models, incorporating results from the typhoid and alternative aetiology diagnostics, to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the DPPT assay. We also did subgroup analyses for the assay across multiple biological variables. Between Aug 17, 2021, and July 16, 2022, we enrolled 501 participants who presented with at least 3 days of fever. 223 (45%) of 501 participants were female and 278 (55%) were male. 77 participants had culture-confirmed enteric fever (62 Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi and 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A) and 70 were culture-negative with PCR-confirmed alternative aetiology (34 influenza A or B, 22 dengue virus, seven Rickettsia spp, six RSV, and one participant co-infected with RSV and dengue virus). The AUC for DPPT on fingerstick capillary blood in distinguishing typhoid from alternative aetiologies was 0·969 (95% CI 0·943-0·994). In latent class analysis, the sensitivity of DPPT was 93% (95% credible interval [CrI] 87-97) and specificity was 89% (85-93). The balanced accuracy was higher for DPPT (91%, 95% CrI 87-94) than blood culture (81%, 78-85), Test-it (77%, 74-79), or Widal (70%, 67-73). Assay performance did not vary by sex, age, duration of fever at presentation, antibiotic use before presentation, Salmonella serotype, or sample type. The point-of-care DPPT assay achieved high diagnostic accuracy for enteric fever in a highly endemic community. This assay has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for enteric fever, allowing rapid diagnosis and treatment, and could facilitate more appropriate antimicrobial use.

        "abstract": "WHO currently recommends a single dose of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in high-burden countries based on 2-year vaccine efficacy data from large randomised controlled trials. Given the decay of immunogenicity, the protection beyond 2 years is unknown. We therefore extended the follow-up of the TyVAC trial in Bangladesh to assess waning of vaccine protection to 5 years after vaccination. We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial (TyVAC; ISRCTN11643110) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, between 2018 and 2021. Children aged 9 months to 15 years were invited to receive a single dose of TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine between April 15, 2018, and November 16, 2019, based on the randomisation of their clusters of residence. Children who received the Japanese encephalitis vaccine were invited to receive TCV at the final visit between Jan 6, and Aug 31, 2021, according to the protocol. This follow-on study extended the follow-up of the original trial until Aug 14, 2023. The primary endpoint of this study was to compare the incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid between children who received TCV in 2018-19 (the previous-TCV group) and those who received the vaccine in 2021 (the recent-TCV group), to evaluate the relative decline in vaccine protection. We also did a nested study using the test-negative design comparing the recent-TCV and previous-TCV groups with unvaccinated individuals, as well as an immunogenicity study in a subset of 1500 children. Compared with the recent-TCV group, the previous-TCV group had an increased risk of typhoid fever between 2021-23, with an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 3·10 (95% CI 1·53 to 6·29; p<0·0001), indicating a decline in the protection of a single-dose of TCV 3-5 years after vaccination. The extrapolated vaccine effectiveness in years 3-5 was 50% (95% CI -13 to 78), and was validated using the test-negative design analysis, with a vaccine effectiveness of 84% (74 to 90) in the recent-TCV group and 55% (36 to 68) in the previous-TCV group, compared with unvaccinated individuals. Anti-Vi-IgG responses declined over the study period. The highest rate of decay was seen in children vaccinated at younger than 2 years in the original trial. The inverse correlation between age and the decay of antibodies was also seen in the subgroup analysis of vaccine effectiveness, where the youngest age group (<7 years at fever visits) exhibited the fastest waning, with vaccine effectiveness dropping to 24% (95% CI -29 to 55) at 3-5 years after vaccination. A decline in the protection conferred by a single-dose TCV was observed 3-5 years after vaccination, with the greatest decline in protection and immune responses observed in children vaccinated at younger ages. A booster dose of TCV around school entry age might be needed for children vaccinated while younger than 2 years to sustain protection against typhoid fever during the school years when the risk is the highest.

        "abstract": "Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella Typhi restricts typhoid treatment options, heightening concerns for pan-oral drug-resistant outbreaks. However, lack of long-term temporal surveillance data on AMR in countries with high burden like Bangladesh is scarce. Our study explores the AMR trends of Salmonella Typhi isolates from Bangladesh, drawing comparisons with antibiotic consumption to optimize antibiotic stewardship strategies for the country. The typhoid fever surveillance from 1999 to 2022 included two pediatric hospitals and three private clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Blood cultures were performed at treating physicians' discretion; cases were confirmed by microbiological, serological, and biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined following CLSI guidelines. National antibiotic consumption data for cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin was obtained from IQVIA-MIDAS database for comparison. Over the 24 years of surveillance, we recorded 12,435 culture-confirmed typhoid cases and observed declining resistance to first-line drugs (amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole); multidrug resistance (MDR) decreased from 38% in 1999 to 17% in 2022. Cotrimoxazole consumption dropped from 0.8 to 0.1 Daily defined doses (DDD)/1000/day (1999-2020). Ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility persisted at >90% with unchanged consumption (1.1-1.3 DDD/1000/day, 2002-2020). Low ceftriaxone resistance (<1%) was observed, with slightly rising MIC (0.03 to 0.12 mg/L, 1999-2019). Azithromycin consumption increased (0.1 to 3.8 DDD/1000/day, 1999-2020), but resistance remained ≤4%. Our study highlights declining MDR amongst Salmonella Typhi in Bangladesh; first-line antimicrobials could be reintroduced as empirical treatment options for typhoid fever if MDR rates further drops below 5%. The analysis also provides baseline data for monitoring the impact of future interventions like typhoid conjugate vaccines on typhoid burden and associated AMR.",

        "abstract": "This is important to note that altered mental status is not a disease in itself, but rather a symptom with a wide range of potential diagnoses. But a structured approach to assessing the patients with this symptom frequently leads to helpful information and can rule out worst-case scenarios. In cases where fever is followed by changes in consciousness, quick assessment of the patient's level of consciousness and potential causes is decisive. A focused history and physical assessment can help differentiate between structural or medical causes. Asymmetrical neurological findings, such as a dilated and fixed pupil, dysconjugated extraocular movements and asymmetrical motor findings, suggest brainstem dysfunction due to a structural lesion, while symmetrical neurological findings usually indicate a medical disorder. A recent study aimed to identify features of different etiologies, demographic patterns, and common causes of both acute and prolonged febrile illness in patients. This cross-sectional type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Medicine, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from April 2014 to October 2015. Over the study period patients admitted with satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of study and purposively selected (non-probability) from the hospitalized patients. Total 100 cases with febrile illness and altered consciousness meeting the exclusion and inclusion criteria were examined and investigated to find out the actual etiology. Out of 100 patients, it was observed that 26(26.0%) of patients were suffering from pneumonia, 22(22.0%) urinary tract infection, 18(18.0%) meningitis, 14(14.0%) typhoid fever, 8(8.0%) meningo-encephalitis, 6(6.0%) cerebral malaria, 4(4.0%) tuberculosis and 2(2.0%) from tuberculoma. The result revealed that large number of patients with febrile illness and altered consciousness were suffering from pneumonia and urinary tract infection.",

        "abstract": "Enteric fever is a serious public health concern. The causative agents, Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, frequently have antimicrobial resistance (AMR), leading to limited treatment options and poorer clinical outcomes. We investigated the genomic epidemiology, resistance mechanisms, and transmission dynamics of these pathogens at three urban sites in Africa and Asia. S Typhi and S Paratyphi A bacteria isolated from blood cultures of febrile children and adults at study sites in Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Blantyre (Malawi) during STRATAA surveillance were sequenced. Isolates were charactered in terms of their serotypes, genotypes (according to GenoTyphi and Paratype), molecular determinants of AMR, and population structure. We used phylogenomic analyses incorporating globally representative genomic data from previously published surveillance studies and ancestral state reconstruction to differentiate locally circulating from imported pathogen AMR variants. Clusters of sequences without any single-nucleotide variants in their core genome were identified and used to explore spatiotemporal patterns and transmission dynamics. We sequenced 731 genomes from isolates obtained during surveillance across the three sites between Oct 1, 2016, and Aug 31, 2019 (24 months in Dhaka and Kathmandu and 34 months in Blantyre). S Paratyphi A was present in Dhaka and Kathmandu but not Blantyre. S Typhi genotype 4.3.1 (H58) was common in all sites, but with different dominant variants (4.3.1.1.EA1 in Blantyre, 4.3.1.1 in Dhaka, and 4.3.1.2 in Kathmandu). Multidrug resistance (ie, resistance to chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, and ampicillin) was common in Blantyre (138 [98%] of 141 cases) and Dhaka (143 [32%] of 452), but absent from Kathmandu. Quinolone-resistance mutations were common in Dhaka (451 [>99%] of 452) and Kathmandu (123 [89%] of 138), but not in Blantyre (three [2%] of 141). Azithromycin-resistance mutations in acrB were rare, appearing only in Dhaka (five [1%] of 452). Phylogenetic analyses showed that most cases derived from pre-existing, locally established pathogen variants; 702 (98%) of 713 drug-resistant infections resulted from local circulation of AMR variants, not imported variants or recent de novo emergence; and pathogen variants circulated across age groups. 479 (66%) of 731 cases clustered with others that were indistinguishable by point mutations; individual clusters included multiple age groups and persisted for up to 2·3 years, and AMR determinants were invariant within clusters. Enteric fever was associated with locally established pathogen variants that circulate across age groups. AMR infections resulted from local transmission of resistant strains. These results form a baseline against which to monitor the impacts of control measures.

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) causes severe and occasionally life-threatening disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water. Humans are the only reservoir, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure increases risk of typhoid. High-quality data to assess spatial and temporal relationships in disease dynamics are scarce. We analyzed data from a prospective cohort conducted in an urban slum area of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Passive surveillance at study centers identified typhoid cases by microbiological culture. Each incident case (index case) was matched to two randomly selected index controls, and we measured typhoid incidence in the population residing in a geographically defined region surrounding each case and control. Spatial clustering was evaluated by comparing the typhoid incidence in residents of geometric rings of increasing radii surrounding the index cases and controls over 28 days. Temporal clustering was evaluated by separately measuring incidence in the first and second 14-day periods following selection. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated using Poisson regression models. We evaluated 141 typhoid index cases. The overall typhoid incidence was 0.44 per 100,000 person-days (PDs) (95% CI: 0.40, 0.49). In the 28 days following selection, the highest typhoid incidence (1.2 per 100,000 PDs [95% CI: 0.8, 1.6]) was in the innermost cluster surrounding index cases. The IRR in this innermost cluster was 4.9 (95% CI: 2.4, 10.3) relative to the innermost control clusters. Neither typhoid incidence rates nor relative IRR between index case and control populations showed substantive differences in the first and second 14-day periods after selection. In the absence of routine immunization programs, geographic clustering of typhoid cases suggests a higher intensity of typhoid risk in the population immediately surrounding identified cases. Further studies are needed to understand spatial and temporal trends and to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted vaccination in disrupting typhoid transmission.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever causes substantial morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh plans to introduce typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) in its expanded program on immunization (EPI) schedule. However, the optimal introduction strategy in addition to the costs and benefits of such a program are unclear. We extended an existing mathematical model of typhoid transmission to integrate cost data, clinical incidence data, and recently conducted serosurveys in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the status quo (i.e., no vaccination) and eight vaccine introduction strategies including routine and 1-time campaign strategies, which differed by age groups targeted and geographic focus. Model outcomes included clinical incidence, seroincidence, deaths, costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each strategy. We adopted a societal perspective, 10-year model time horizon, and 3 % annual discount rate. We performed probabilistic, one-way, and scenario sensitivity analyses including adopting a healthcare perspective and alternate model time horizons. We projected that all TCV strategies would be cost saving compared to the status quo. The preferred strategy was a nationwide introduction of TCV at 9-12 months of age with a single catch-up campaign for children ages 1-15, which was cost saving compared to all other strategies and the status quo. In the 10 years following implementation, we projected this strategy would avert 3.77 million cases (95 % CrI: 2.60 - 5.18), 11.31 thousand deaths (95 % CrI: 3.77 - 23.60), and save $172.35 million (95 % CrI: -14.29 - 460.59) compared to the status quo. Our findings were broadly robust to changes in parameter values and willingness-to-pay thresholds. We projected that nationwide TCV introduction with a catch-up campaign would substantially reduce typhoid incidence and very likely be cost saving in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Ciprofloxacin is the first-line drug for treating typhoid fever in many countries in Africa with a high disease burden, but the emergence of non-susceptibility poses a challenge to public health programmes. Through enhanced surveillance as part of vaccine evaluation, we investigated the occurrence and potential determinants of ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility in Blantyre, Malawi. We conducted systematic surveillance of typhoid fever cases and antibiotic prescription in two health centres in Blantyre, Malawi, between Oct 1, 2016, and Oct 31, 2019, as part of the STRATAA and TyVAC studies. In addition, blood cultures were taken from eligible patients presenting at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, as part of routine diagnosis. Inclusion criteria were measured or reported fever, or clinical suspicion of sepsis. Microbiologically, we identified Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) isolates with a ciprofloxacin non-susceptible phenotype from blood cultures, and used whole-genome sequencing to identify drug-resistance mutations and phylogenetic relationships. We constructed generalised linear regression models to investigate associations between the number of ciprofloxacin prescriptions given per month to study participants and the proportion of S Typhi isolates with quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations in the following month. From 46 989 blood cultures from Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, 502 S Typhi isolates were obtained, 30 (6%) of which had either decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility, or ciprofloxacin resistance. From 11 295 blood cultures from STRATAA and TyVAC studies, 241 microbiologically confirmed cases of typhoid fever were identified, and 198 isolates from 195 participants sequenced (mean age 12·8 years [SD 10·2], 53% female, 47% male). Between Oct 1, 2016, and Aug 31, 2019, of 177 typhoid fever cases confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, four (2%) were caused by S Typhi with QRDR mutations, compared with six (33%) of 18 cases between Sept 1 and Oct 31, 2019. This increase was associated with a preceding spike in ciprofloxacin prescriptions. Every additional prescription of ciprofloxacin given to study participants in the preceding month was associated with a 4·2% increase (95% CI 1·8-7·0) in the relative risk of isolating S Typhi with a QRDR mutation (p=0·0008). Phylogenetic analysis showed that S Typhi isolates with QRDR mutations from September and October, 2019, belonged to two distinct subclades encoding two different QRDR mutations, and were closely related (4-10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) to susceptible S Typhi endemic to Blantyre. We postulate a causal relationship between increased ciprofloxacin prescriptions and an increase in fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility in S Typhi. Decreasing ciprofloxacin use by improving typhoid diagnostics, and reducing typhoid fever cases through the use of an efficacious vaccine, could help to limit the emergence of resistance.

        "abstract": "Typhoid-conjugate vaccines (TCVs) provide an opportunity to reduce the burden of typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, in endemic areas. As policymakers design vaccination strategies, accurate and high-resolution data on disease burden is crucial. However, traditional blood culture-based surveillance is resource-extensive, prohibiting its large-scale and sustainable implementation. Salmonella Typhi is a water-borne pathogen, and here, we tested the potential of Typhi-specific bacteriophage surveillance in surface water bodies as a low-cost tool to identify where Salmonella Typhi circulates in the environment. In 2021, water samples were collected and tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi bacteriophages at two sites in Bangladesh: urban capital city, Dhaka, and a rural district, Mirzapur. Salmonella Typhi-specific bacteriophages were detected in 66 of 211 (31%) environmental samples in Dhaka, in comparison to 3 of 92 (3%) environmental samples from Mirzapur. In the same year, 4,620 blood cultures at the two largest pediatric hospitals of Dhaka yielded 215 (5%) culture-confirmed typhoid cases, and 3,788 blood cultures in the largest hospital of Mirzapur yielded 2 (0.05%) cases. 75% (52/69) of positive phage samples were collected from sewage. All isolated phages were tested against a panel of isolates from different Salmonella Typhi genotypes circulating in Bangladesh and were found to exhibit a diverse killing spectrum, indicating that diverse bacteriophages were isolated. These results suggest an association between the presence of Typhi-specific phages in the environment and the burden of typhoid fever, and the potential of utilizing environmental phage surveillance as a low-cost tool to assist policy decisions on typhoid control.",

        "abstract": "Environmental surveillance, using detection of Salmonella Typhi DNA, has emerged as a potentially useful tool to identify typhoid-endemic settings; however, it is relatively costly and requires molecular diagnostic capacity. We sought to determine whether S. Typhi bacteriophages are abundant in water sources in a typhoid-endemic setting, using low-cost assays. We collected drinking and surface water samples from urban, peri-urban and rural areas in 4 regions of Nepal. We performed a double agar overlay with S. Typhi to assess the presence of bacteriophages. We isolated and tested phages against multiple strains to assess their host range. We performed whole genome sequencing of isolated phages, and generated phylogenies using conserved genes. S. Typhi-specific bacteriophages were detected in 54.9% (198/361) of river and 6.3% (1/16) drinking water samples from the Kathmandu Valley and Kavrepalanchok. Water samples collected within or downstream of population-dense areas were more likely to be positive (72.6%, 193/266) than those collected upstream from population centers (5.3%, 5/95) (p=0.005). In urban Biratnagar and rural Dolakha, where typhoid incidence is low, only 6.7% (1/15, Biratnagar) and 0% (0/16, Dolakha) river water samples contained phages. All S. Typhi phages were unable to infect other Salmonella and non-Salmonella strains, nor a Vi-knockout S. Typhi strain. Representative strains from S. Typhi lineages were variably susceptible to the isolated phages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that S. Typhi phages belonged to the class Caudoviricetes and clustered in three distinct groups. S. Typhi bacteriophages were highly abundant in surface waters of typhoid-endemic communities but rarely detected in low typhoid burden communities. Bacteriophages recovered were specific for S. Typhi and required Vi polysaccharide for infection. Screening small volumes of water with simple, low-cost (~$2) plaque assays enables detection of S. Typhi phages and should be further evaluated as a scalable tool for typhoid environmental surveillance.",

Blood culture remains the practical reference standard for diagnosis of typhoid fever, where culture testing is available, but novel diagnostic modalities are an important priority under investigation. Since 2017, remarkable progress has been made in defining the global burden of both typhoid fever and antimicrobial resistance; in understanding disease pathogenesis and immunological protection through the use of controlled human infection; and in advancing effective vaccination programmes through strategic multipartner collaboration and targeted clinical trials in multiple high-incidence priority settings.

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, or enteric fever, is a highly fatal infectious disease that affects over 9 million people worldwide each year, resulting in more than 110,000 deaths. Reduction in the burden of typhoid in low-income countries is crucial for public health and requires the implementation of feasible water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions, especially in densely populated urban slums. In this study, conducted in Mirpur, Bangladesh, we aimed to assess the association between household WASH status and typhoid risk in a training subpopulation of a large prospective cohort (n=98,087), and to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm in creating a composite WASH variable. Further, we investigated the protection associated with living in households with improved WASH facilities and in clusters with increasing prevalence of such facilities during a 2-year follow-up period. We used a machine learning algorithm to create a dichotomous composite variable (\"Better\" and \"Not Better\") based on 3 WASH variables: private toilet facility, safe drinking water source, and presence of water filter. The algorithm was trained using data from the training subpopulation and then validated in a distinct subpopulation (n=65,286) to assess its sensitivity and specificity. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the protective effect of living in \"Better\" WASH households and in clusters with increasing levels of \"Better\" WASH prevalence. We found that residence in households with improved WASH facilities was associated with a 38% reduction in typhoid risk (adjusted hazard ratio=0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.78; P<.001). This reduction was particularly pronounced in individuals younger than 10 years at the first census participation, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.66; P<.001). Furthermore, we observed an inverse relationship between the prevalence of \"Better\" WASH facilities in clusters and the incidence of typhoid, although this association was not statistically significant in the multivariable model. Specifically, the adjusted hazard of typhoid decreased by 0.996 (95% CI 0.986-1.006) for each percent increase in the prevalence of \"Better\" WASH in the cluster (P=.39). Our findings demonstrate that existing variations in household WASH are associated with differences in the risk of typhoid in densely populated urban slums. This suggests that attainable improvements in WASH facilities can contribute to enhanced typhoid control, especially in settings where major infrastructural improvements are challenging. These findings underscore the importance of implementing and promoting comprehensive WASH interventions in low-income countries as a means to reduce the burden of typhoid and improve public health outcomes in vulnerable populations.",

The recent availability of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV), an increasing incidence of disease caused by SPA and growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) across the genus Salmonella makes a bivalent STy/SPA vaccine a useful public health proposition. The uptake of a stand-alone paratyphoid vaccine is likely low thus, there is a pipeline of bivalent STy/SPA candidate vaccines. Several candidates are close to entering clinical trials, which if successful should facilitate a more comprehensive approach for enteric fever control. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has made advancing the development of vaccines that protect young children and working aged adults against both agents of enteric fever a priority objective. This \"Vaccine Value Profile\" (VVP) addresses information related predominantly to invasive disease caused by SPA prevalent in Asia. Information is included on stand-alone SPA candidate vaccines and candidate vaccines targeting SPA combined with STy. Out of scope for the first version of this VVP is a wider discussion on the development of a universal Salmonella combination candidate vaccine, addressing both enteric fever and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease, for use globally. This VVP is a detailed, high-level assessment of existing, publicly available information to inform and contextualize the public health, economic, and societal potential of pipeline vaccines and vaccine-like products for SPA. Future versions of this VVP will be updated to reflect ongoing activities such as vaccine development strategies and \"Full Vaccine Value Assessment\" that will inform the value proposition of an SPA vaccine. This VVP was developed by an expert working group from academia, non-profit organizations, public-private partnerships, and multi-lateral organizations as well as in collaboration with stakeholders from the WHO South-East Asian Region. All contributors have extensive expertise on various elements of the VVP for SPA and collectively aimed to identify current research and knowledge gaps.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid and paratyphoid remain common bloodstream infections in areas with suboptimal water and sanitation infrastructure. Paratyphoid, caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A, is less prevalent than typhoid and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends are less documented. Empirical treatment for paratyphoid is commonly based on the knowledge of susceptibility of Salmonella Typhi, which causes typhoid. Hence, with rising drug resistance in Salmonella Typhi, last-line antibiotics like ceftriaxone and azithromycin are prescribed for both typhoid and paratyphoid. However, unlike for typhoid, there is no vaccine to prevent paratyphoid. Here, we report 23-year AMR trends of Salmonella Paratyphi A in Bangladesh. From 1999 to 2021, we conducted enteric fever surveillance in two major pediatric hospitals and three clinics in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Blood cultures were performed at the discretion of the treating physicians; cases were confirmed by culture, serological and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined following CLSI guidelines. Over 23 years, we identified 2,725 blood culture-confirmed paratyphoid cases. Over 97% of the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole, and no isolate was resistant to all three. No resistance to ceftriaxone was recorded, and >99% of the isolates were sensitive to azithromycin. A slight increase in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is noticed for ceftriaxone but the current average MIC is 32-fold lower than the resistance cut-off. Over 99% of the isolates exhibited decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Salmonella Paratyphi A has remained susceptible to most antibiotics, unlike Salmonella Typhi, despite widespread usage of many antibiotics in Bangladesh. The data can guide evidence-based policy decisions for empirical treatment of paratyphoid fever, especially in the post typhoid vaccine era, and with the availability of new paratyphoid diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies.

Blood samples were collected and then subjected to automated BacT/Alert blood culture, microbial culture, TAC assay, and typhoid/paratyphoid test. The total number of study participants was 120, among them 48 (40%) samples showed a positive result in TAC card, 29 (24.16%) were TP positive and nine (7.51%) were culture positive. The number of organisms detected by the TAC card was 13 bacteria, three viruses, one protozoan, and one fungus. The sensitivity and specificity of the TAC assay for different bacterial pathogen compared to blood culture was 44.44%, and 90.99%, respectively. In contrast, the TP test had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 80%, respectively, compared to the blood culture test.

Due to climate change, floods and droughts have had devastating effects on human health by facilitating the spread of infectious illnesses including cholera, malaria, typhoid, dengue fever, and viral hepatitis A. Food instability, starvation, malnutrition, and a lack of potable water are only some of the indirect effects of flooding on health. Recently, one of the worst floods in history devastated Pakistan, affecting more than 333 million people along with a significant portion of the nation submerged. Malaria, dengue fever, and other ailments are on the rise in Pakistan, threatening to overwhelm the country's healthcare infrastructure.

        "abstract": "A cluster-randomised trial of Vi-tetanus toxoid (Vi-TT) conjugate vaccine conducted in urban Bangladeshi children found a high level of direct protection by Vi-TT but no significant vaccine herd protection. We reassessed the trial using a \"fried egg\" analysis to evaluate whether herd protection might have been obscured by transmission of typhoid into the clusters from the outside. A participant- and observer-blind, cluster-randomised trial was conducted between February 14, 2018 and August 12, 2019 in three wards of Mirpur, a densely populated urban area of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Children 9 months to under 16 years of age in 150 geographic clusters, which had a total of 311,289 persons present at baseline or entering during follow-up, were randomised by cluster to a single-dose of Vi-TT or Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine. Vi-TT protection against typhoid fever, detected at 8 treatment centres serving the study population, was compared in the original clusters for the trial, and for progressively more central subclusters (\"yolks\" of the \"fried egg\") of the cluster residents. If transmission of typhoid into the clusters had diluted observed vaccine herd protection, we hypothesised that analysis of the innermost \"yolks\" would reveal vaccine herd protection that was not evident in analysis of the entire clusters. The trial is registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN11643110. At ≤18 months of follow-up, total vaccine effectiveness (protection of Vi-TT recipients relative to JE vaccine recipients) was 85% (95% CI: 76%, 90%); indirect effectiveness (protection of non-Vi-TT recipients in Vi-TT clusters relative to non-JE vaccine recipients in JE vaccine clusters) was 17% (95% CI: -13%, 40%); and overall effectiveness (protection of all residents in the Vi-TT clusters relative to all residents of the JE vaccine clusters) was 57% (95% CI: 44%, 66%). Analyses of subpopulations in inner 75%, 50% and 25% \"yolks\" of the clusters failed to reveal significant changes in any of these estimates. Our analysis did not reveal Vi-TT herd protection in the trial. Consideration should be given to exploring whether targeting adults as well as children with Vi-TT yields appreciable levels of vaccine herd protection.

Even though antibiotics are usually used to treat typhoid fever, the spread of multi drug resistant <i>Salmonella typhi</i> is making antibiotics much less effective. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of multidrug-resistant <i>Salmonella typhi</i> from the clinical samples. During this study, 154 blood samples of suspected typhoid patients were collected from the hospital and diagnostic center located in Chattogram City, Bangladesh. Isolation and identification of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> was done by both biochemical tests. PCR analysis was also done for the confirmation of biochemical result. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed according to the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cefepime, cotrimoxazole, ceptriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and azithtomycin. Out of 154, 21 (13.64%) isolates were identified as <i>Salmonella typhi</i> and the prevalence of typhoid in Chattogram, Bangladesh was 13.64% (n = 21). It was also found that children under the age of 5 are the more vulnerable target of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> infection. Antibiotic resistance profiling revealed 85% isolates were Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) and highest resistance was found in case of Nalidixic acid. Although, most of the isolated <i>Salmonella typhi</i> were MDR, first generation antibiotics Co-trimoxazile, Chloramphenicol, and Ampicillin were found effective against <i>Salmonella typhi</i>.",

The study evaluated the clinical and laboratory characteristics and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> in children. This prospective research was conducted at Delta Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2017 to December 2019. A total of 200 pediatric cases of EF were included in this study who were either culture positive or had significantly raised Widal test titer for <i>Salmonella</i> with suggestive clinical features. All the patients had a fever, and most had coated tongue, vomiting, abdominal pain, organomegaly, and diarrhea. Among the selected 200 cases of EF, 43.5% were <i>Salmonella typhi</i> culture-positive. A high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was observed in a substantial number (53%) of patients. Ceftriaxone was the most sensitive (100%) antibiotic through laboratory analysis, followed by cefotaxime (95.1%). Among the oral antibiotics used, cefixime (92.8%) was the most sensitive.

We evaluated the proportion of AFI caused by specific pathogens among outpatients in Bangladesh. During May 2019-March 2020, physicians screened patients aged ≥2 years in outpatient departments of four tertiary level public hospitals. We randomly enrolled patients having measured fever (≥100.4°F) during assessment with onset within the past 14 days. Blood and urine samples were tested at icddr,b through rapid diagnostic tests, bacterial culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Acute and convalescent samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA) for Rickettsia and Orientia (R/O) and Leptospira tests. Among 690 patients, 69 (10%) had enteric fever (Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi orSalmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi), 51 (7.4%) Escherichia coli, and 28 (4.1%) dengue detected. Of the 441 patients tested for R/O, 39 (8.8%) had rickettsioses. We found 7 (2%) Leptospira cases among the 403 AFI patients tested. Nine patients (1%) were hospitalized, and none died. The highest proportion of enteric fever (15%, 36/231) and rickettsioses (14%, 25/182) was in Rajshahi. Dhaka had the most dengue cases (68%, 19/28). R/O affected older children and young adults (IQR 8-23 years) and was detected more frequently in the 21-25 years age-group (17%, 12/70). R/O was more likely to be found in patients in Rajshahi region than in Sylhet (aOR 2.49, 95% CI 0.85-7.32) between July and December (aOR 2.01, 1.01-5.23), and who had a history of recent animal entry inside their house than not (aOR 2.0, 0.93-4.3). Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae were the most common bacterial infections, and dengue was the most common viral infection among AFI patients in Bangladeshi hospitals, though there was geographic variability.

        "abstract": "The emergence of increasingly antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi) threatens to undermine effective treatment and control. Understanding where antimicrobial resistance in S Typhi is emerging and spreading is crucial towards formulating effective control strategies. In this genomic epidemiology study, we sequenced the genomes of 3489 S Typhi strains isolated from prospective enteric fever surveillance studies in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India (between 2014 and 2019), and combined these with a global collection of 4169 S Typhi genome sequences isolated between 1905 and 2018 to investigate the temporal and geographical patterns of emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant S Typhi. We performed non-parametric phylodynamic analyses to characterise changes in the effective population size of fluoroquinolone-resistant, extensively drug-resistant (XDR), and azithromycin-resistant S Typhi over time. We inferred timed phylogenies for the major S Typhi sublineages and used ancestral state reconstruction methods to estimate the frequency and timing of international and intercontinental transfers. Our analysis revealed a declining trend of multidrug resistant typhoid in south Asia, except for Pakistan, where XDR S Typhi emerged in 2016 and rapidly replaced less-resistant strains. Mutations in the quinolone-resistance determining region (QRDR) of S Typhi have independently arisen and propagated on at least 94 occasions, nearly all occurring in south Asia. Strains with multiple QRDR mutations, including triple mutants with high-level fluoroquinolone resistance, have been increasing in frequency and displacing strains with fewer mutations. Strains containing acrB mutations, conferring azithromycin resistance, emerged in Bangladesh around 2013 and effective population size of these strains has been steadily increasing. We found evidence of frequent international (n=138) and intercontinental transfers (n=59) of antimicrobial-resistant S Typhi, followed by local expansion and replacement of drug-susceptible clades. Independent acquisition of plasmids and homoplastic mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance have occurred repeatedly in multiple lineages of S Typhi, predominantly arising in south Asia before spreading to other regions.

        "abstract": "The incidence of enteric fever, an invasive bacterial infection caused by typhoidal Salmonellae (Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi), is largely unknown in regions without blood culture surveillance. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether new diagnostic serological markers for typhoidal Salmonella can reliably estimate population-level incidence. We collected longitudinal blood samples from patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever enrolled from surveillance studies in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Ghana between 2016 and 2021 and conducted cross-sectional serosurveys in the catchment areas of each surveillance site. We used ELISAs to measure quantitative IgA and IgG antibody responses to hemolysin E and S Typhi lipopolysaccharide. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to fit two-phase power-function decay models to the longitudinal antibody responses among enteric fever cases and used the joint distributions of the peak antibody titres and decay rate to estimate population-level incidence rates from cross-sectional serosurveys. The longitudinal antibody kinetics for all antigen-isotypes were similar across countries and did not vary by clinical severity. The seroincidence of typhoidal Salmonella infection among children younger than 5 years ranged between 58·5 per 100 person-years (95% CI 42·1-81·4) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to 6·6 per 100 person-years (4·3-9·9) in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal, and followed the same rank order as clinical incidence estimates.

We established the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) to inform these strategies. From September, 2016, to September, 2019, we conducted prospective clinical surveillance for Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) and Paratyphi (S Paratyphi) A, B, and C at health facilities in predetermined catchment areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; and Karachi, Pakistan. Patients eligible for inclusion were outpatients with 3 or more consecutive days of fever in the last 7 days; inpatients with suspected or confirmed enteric fever; patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever from the hospital laboratories not captured by inpatient or outpatient enrolment and cases from the laboratory network; and patients with non-traumatic ileal perforation under surgical care. We used a hybrid surveillance model, pairing facility-based blood culture surveillance with community surveys of health-care use. Blood cultures were performed for enrolled patients. We calculated overall and age-specific typhoid and paratyphoid incidence estimates for each study site. Adjusted estimates accounted for the sensitivity of blood culture, the proportion of eligible individuals who consented and provided blood, the probability of care-seeking at a study facility, and the influence of wealth and education on care-seeking. We additionally calculated incidence of hospitalisation due to typhoid and paratyphoid. A total of 34 747 patients were enrolled across 23 facilitates (six tertiary hospitals, surgical wards of two additional hospitals, and 15 laboratory network sites) during the study period. Of the 34 303 blood cultures performed on enrolled patients, 8705 (26%) were positive for typhoidal Salmonella. Adjusted incidence rates of enteric fever considered patients in the six tertiary hospitals. Adjusted incidence of S Typhi, expressed per 100 000 person-years, was 913 (95% CI 765-1095) in Dhaka. In Nepal, the adjusted typhoid incidence rates were 330 (230-480) in Kathmandu and 268 (202-362) in Kavrepalanchok. In Pakistan, the adjusted incidence rates per hospital site were 176 (144-216) and 103 (85-126). The adjusted incidence rates of paratyphoid (of which all included cases were due to S Paratyphi A) were 128 (107-154) in Bangladesh, 46 (34-62) and 81 (56-118) in the Nepal sites, and 23 (19-29) and 1 (1-1) in the Pakistan sites. Adjusted incidence of hospitalisation was high across sites, and overall, 2804 (32%) of 8705 patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever were hospitalised. Across diverse communities in three south Asian countries, adjusted incidence exceeded the threshold for \"high burden\" of enteric fever (100 per 100 000 person-years). Incidence was highest among children, although age patterns differed across sites. The substantial disease burden identified highlights the need for control measures, including improvements to water and sanitation infrastructure and the implementation of typhoid vaccines.

The reduction in typhoid risk among all residents associated with living in TCV clusters, Better WASH households, or both was evaluated using mixed-effects Poisson regression models. The adjusted reduced risk of typhoid among all residents living in the clusters assigned to TCV was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43%-65%; P < .001), and that of living in Better WASH households, regardless of cluster, was 37% (95% CI, 24%-48%; P < .001). The highest risk of typhoid was observed in persons living in households with Not Better WASH in the JE clusters. In comparison with these persons, those living in households with Better WASH in the TCV clusters had an adjusted reduced risk of 71% (95% CI, 59%-80%; P < .001). Implementation of TCV programs combined with achievable and culturally acceptable household WASH practices were independently associated with a significant reduction in typhoid risk.

        "abstract": "Modest improvements in household water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and typhoid vaccination can reduce typhoid risk in endemic settings. However, empiric evaluation of their combined impact is lacking. A total of 62,756 persons residing in 80 clusters in a Kolkata slum were allocated randomly 1:1 to either the typhoid Vi polysaccharide (ViPS) vaccine or hepatitis A (Hep A) vaccine. Surveillance was conducted for 2 years before and 2 years after vaccination. We classified households as having \"better\" or \"not better\" WASH, and calculated the prevalence of better WASH households in clusters using previously validated criteria. We evaluated the protection by better household WASH, better household WASH prevalence, and ViPS vaccination against typhoid in all cluster members present at baseline using Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, ViPS vaccination was associated with a 55% (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 35-69) reduction of typhoid risk and was similar regardless of better WASH in the residence. Living in a better WASH household was associated with a typhoid risk reduction of 31% (P = 0.16; 95% CI, -16 to 59) overall. The reduction was 48% (P = 0.05; 95% CI, -1 to 73) in Hep A clusters, 6% (P = 0.85; 95% CI, -82 to 51) in ViPS clusters, and 57% (P < 0.05; 95% CI, 15-78) in the population during the 2 years preceding the trial. These findings demonstrate a preventive association of better household WASH in the non-ViPS population, but, unexpectedly, an absence of additional protection from ViPS by better WASH in the ViPS population. This analysis highlights the importance of assessing the combination of WASH in conjunction with typhoid vaccines, and has implications for the evaluation of new-generation typhoid conjugate vaccines.",

Typhoid fever is endemic in areas where water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) infrastructure is poor. Serious complications develop in approximately 10%-15% of patients if left untreated, and this is driven by inadequate diagnostic methods and the high burden of antibiotic-resistant strains, complicating clinical management and ultimately prognosis. Asymptomatic chronic carriers, in addition to acutely infected patients, contribute to continued transmission through the shedding of the organism in the feces. The high morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever in low- and middle-income countries reinforce the need for an integrated control approach, which may ultimately lead to elimination of the disease in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) is a common cause of non-specific febrile infection in adults and children presenting to health care facilities in low resource settings such as the South Asia.  A 7-day course of a single oral antimicrobial such as ciprofloxacin, cefixime, or azithromycin is commonly used for its treatment. Increasing antimicrobial resistance threatens the effectiveness of these treatment choices. We hypothesize that combined treatment with azithromycin (active mainly intracellularly) and cefixime (active mainly extracellularly) will be a better option for the treatment of clinically suspected and culture-confirmed typhoid fever in South Asia. <b>Methods:</b> This is a phase IV, international multi-center, multi-country, comparative participant-and observer-blind, 1:1 randomised clinical trial. Patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever will be randomized to one of the two interventions: Arm A: azithromycin 20mg/kg/day oral dose once daily (maximum 1gm/day) and cefixime 20mg/kg/day oral dose in two divided doses (maximum 400mg bd) for 7 days, Arm B: azithromycin 20mg/kg/day oral dose once daily (max 1gm/day) for 7 days AND cefixime-matched placebo for 7 days. We will recruit 1500 patients across sites in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. We will assess whether treatment outcomes are better with the combination after one week of treatment and at one- and three-months follow-up. <b>Discussion:</b> Combined treatment may limit the emergence of resistance if one of the components is active against resistant sub-populations not covered by the other antimicrobial activity. If the combined treatment is better than the single antimicrobial treatment, this will be an important result for patients across South Asia and other typhoid endemic areas. <b>Clinicaltrials.gov registration:</b> NCT04349826 (16/04/2020).",

Numerous data gaps exist concerning the epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) and Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi (S Paratyphi), which are the causative agents of enteric fever. We aimed to determine the burden of enteric fever in three urban sites in Africa and Asia. In this multicentre population-based study, we did a demographic census at three urban sites in Africa (Blantyre, Malawi) and Asia (Kathmandu, Nepal and Dhaka, Bangladesh) between June 1, 2016, and Sept 25, 2018. Households were selected randomly from the demographic census. Participants from within the geographical census area presenting to study health-care facilities were approached for recruitment if they had a history of fever for 72 h or more (later changed to >48 h) or temperature of 38·0°C or higher. Facility-based passive surveillance was done between Nov 11, 2016, and Dec 31, 2018, with blood-culture collection for febrile illness. We also did a community-based serological survey to obtain data on Vi-antibody defined infections. We calculated crude incidence for blood-culture-confirmed S Typhi and S Paratyphi infection, and calculated adjusted incidence and seroincidence of S Typhi blood-culture-confirmed infection. 423 618 individuals were included in the demographic census, contributing 626 219 person-years of observation for febrile illness surveillance. 624 S Typhi and 108 S Paratyphi A isolates were collected from the blood of 12 082 febrile patients. Multidrug resistance was observed in 44% S Typhi isolates and fluoroquinolone resistance in 61% of S Typhi isolates. In Blantyre, the overall crude incidence of blood-culture confirmed S Typhi was 58 cases per 100 000 person-years of observation (95% CI 48-70); the adjusted incidence was 444 cases per 100 000 person-years of observation (95% credible interval [CrI] 347-717). The corresponding rates were 74 (95% CI 62-87) and 1062 (95% CrI 683-1839) in Kathmandu, and 161 (95% CI 145-179) and 1135 (95% CrI 898-1480) in Dhaka. S Paratyphi was not found in Blantyre; overall crude incidence of blood-culture-confirmed S Paratyphi A infection was 6 cases per 100 000 person-years of observation (95% CI 3-11) in Kathmandu and 42 (95% CI 34-52) in Dhaka. Seroconversion rates for S Typhi infection per 100 000 person-years estimated from anti-Vi seroconversion episodes in serological surveillance were 2505 episodes (95% CI 1605-3727) in Blantyre, 7631 (95% CI 5913-9691) in Kathmandu, and 3256 (95% CI 2432-4270) in Dhaka. High disease incidence and rates of antimicrobial resistance were observed across three different transmission settings and thus necessitate multiple intervention strategies to achieve global control of these pathogens.

Despite the advantages of this diphtheria toxoid mutant, low yields, production in inclusion bodies, and the requirement for specific growth conditions have limited the breadth of successful recombinant protein expression platforms available for its expression. We evaluated Pichia pastoris as a production host, using the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter and a modified α-mating factor signal peptide for secretion into the supernatant. Final purified yields >100 mg L<sup>-1</sup> culture were achieved when produced in a bioreactor, which is equivalent to the productivity obtained from bioprocesses using the native Corynebacterium diphtheriae host. Recombinant CRM197 was purified to ≥95% homogeneity and showed the expected endonuclease activity. Furthermore, mice immunized with a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi capsular Vi antigen conjugated to our recombinant CRM197 showed greater than 5-fold increase in immune response. Overall, the results demonstrate that Pichia pastoris is a suitable expression host for the production of high quality CRM197 for vaccine applications.",

While numerous epidemiological and genomic studies have been conducted for S. Typhi, there are limited data describing the genomic epidemiology of S. Paratyphi A in especially in endemic settings, such as Bangladesh. We conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 67 S. Paratyphi A isolated between 2008 and 2018 from eight enteric disease surveillance sites across Bangladesh. We performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of these sequence data incorporating sequences from 242 previously sequenced S. Paratyphi A isolates from a global collection and provided evidence of lineage migration from neighboring countries in South Asia. The data revealed that the majority of the Bangladeshi S. Paratyphi A isolates belonged to the dominant global lineage A (67.2%), while the remainder were either lineage C (19.4%) or F (13.4%). The population structure was relatively homogenous across the country as we did not find any significant lineage distributions between study sites inside or outside Dhaka. Our genomic data showed presence of single point mutations in gyrA gene either at codon 83 or 87 associated with decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility in all Bangladeshi S. Paratyphi A isolates. Notably, we identified the pHCM2- like cryptic plasmid which was highly similar to S. Typhi plasmids circulating in Bangladesh and has not been previously identified in S. Paratyphi A organisms. This study demonstrates the utility of WGS to monitor the ongoing evolution of this emerging enteric pathogen. Novel insights into the genetic structure of S. Paratyphi A will aid the understanding of both regional and global circulation patterns of this emerging pathogen and provide a framework for future genomic surveillance studies.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a notifiable disease within Australia. Although studies in endemic regions give an indication of acquisition risk, many countries lack reliable data, and little is known of the absolute or relative risk in Australian travellers. By combining notified case data with travel statistics provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the aim of this study was to give an indication of risk for typhoid acquisition among Australian travellers. Australian typhoid notifications between 1st January 2010 and 30th June 2017 were grouped by country of acquisition and age category (<15 or ≥15 years). Australian travel data were used to inform time at risk and incidence rate of Australian typhoid notifications pertaining to country and region of acquisition. Salmonella Paratyphi infections, though notifiable, were excluded as the focus was vaccine preventable illness. Data from New South Wales and Victoria were used to examine the incidence in those acquiring infection in their country of birth (COB) against travellers who did not. Nine hundred twenty-three cases of typhoid were notified over the period of review, 96% of which were acquired overseas. The greatest determinant of risk was travel destination, with countries in south Asia associated with highest crude incidence rate (252 per 100 000 person-years), particularly Bangladesh. Younger age and immigrants returning to their COB were generally associated with higher risk of acquisition. The risk of typhoid fever in Australian travellers to endemic regions is considerable. Immigrants returning to their COB appear to be at higher risk and it is likely that this risk extends to their traveling dependents. These findings help clinicians and public health officials to plan and advise pre-travel vaccination strategies with at-risk individuals and groups. Additional sociodemographic data collection with Australian typhoid notifications would enhance the surveillance of differing international travel risk groups leaving Australia.",

Still now blood culture is gold standard method for diagnosing typhoid fever, but this method is laborious, requires several days and detection rate is low. Failure of early laboratory diagnosis often leads to increased morbidity and mortality. This study was intended to apply a nested PCR in blood for early diagnosis of typhoid fever. In this cross sectional study blood samples were collected from 200 suspected typhoid fever patients attending Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (n PCR) of flagellin gene was done in all the blood samples. At the same time all blood samples were subjected to culture by lytic centrifugation method. Culture positive isolates were identified as S. typhi by biochemical tests. Among the 200 blood samples, 57 (28.5%) were positive for S. typhi on nested PCR where as blood culture was positive for S. typhi in 16 (8%) samples. Among the 57 PCR positive samples, only 15 (26.3%) samples were culture positive for S. typhi and rest 42 (73.7%) were culture negative.

However, an increase in resistance to key antimicrobials and the emergence of MDR and XDR in Salmonella Typhi poses a major threat for efficacious outpatient treatments. We recently identified tebipenem, an oral carbapenem licensed for use for respiratory tract infections in Japan, as a potential alternative treatment for MDR/XDR Shigella spp. Here, we aimed to test the in vitro antibacterial efficacy of this drug against MDR and XDR typhoidal Salmonella. We determined the in vitro activity of tebipenem in time-kill assays against a collection of non-XDR and XDR Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A (non-XDR) isolated in Nepal and Bangladesh. We also tested the efficacy of tebipenem in combination with other antimicrobials. We found that both XDR and non-XDR Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A are susceptible to tebipenem, exhibiting low MICs, and were killed within 8-24 h at 2-4×MIC. Additionally, tebipenem demonstrated synergy with two other antimicrobials and could efficiently induce bacterial killing. Salmonella Paratyphi A and XDR Salmonella Typhi display in vitro susceptibility to the oral carbapenem tebipenem, while synergistic activity with other antimicrobials may limit the emergence of resistance. The broad-spectrum activity of this drug against MDR/XDR organisms renders tebipenem a good candidate for clinical trials.",

The high burden of this age-old, preventable disease exacerbates constraints on the health systems of these countries. Currently, most patients are treated effectively in the community or outpatient departments, but with rising antimicrobial resistance and the dearth of novel antimicrobials in the horizon, we risk losing our primary defense against typhoid. Extensively drug-resistant Salmonella Typhi is spreading, and azithromycin is the last oral drug to continue treating typhoid in the community. With increasing azithromycin resistance, emergence of pan-oral drug resistant Salmonella Typhi is imminent. The high burden of typhoid is also an underlying cause of the unnecessary use of antimicrobials. In addition to implementing water sanitation and hygiene interventions to prevent typhoid, it is imperative to rapidly roll out typhoid conjugate vaccines in endemic countries. This will not only reduce the burden of typhoid but will also help interrupt the trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance.",

In a 3-year case-control study, we investigated typhoid among children aged <16 years (4670 febrile cases and 8549 age matched controls) living in an informal settlement, Nairobi, Kenya. 148 <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates from cases and 95 from controls (stool culture) were identified; a carriage frequency of 1 %. Whole-genome sequencing showed 97% of cases and 88% of controls were genotype 4.3.1 (Haplotype 58), with the majority of each (76% and 88%) being multidrug-resistant strains in three sublineages of the H58 genotype (East Africa 1 (EA1), EA2, and EA3), with sequences from cases and carriers intermingled. The high rate of multidrug-resistant H58 <i>S</i>.

        "abstract": "Decisions about typhoid fever prevention and control are based on estimates of typhoid incidence and their uncertainty. Lack of specific clinical diagnostic criteria, poorly sensitive diagnostic tests, and scarcity of accurate and complete datasets contribute to difficulties in calculating age-specific population-level typhoid incidence. Using data from the Strategic Typhoid Alliance across Africa and Asia program, we integrated demographic censuses, healthcare utilization surveys, facility-based surveillance, and serological surveillance from Malawi, Nepal, and Bangladesh to account for under-detection of cases. We developed a Bayesian approach that adjusts the count of reported blood-culture-positive cases for blood culture detection, blood culture collection, and healthcare seeking-and how these factors vary by age-while combining information from prior published studies. We validated the model using simulated data. The ratio of observed to adjusted incidence rates was 7.7 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 6.0-12.4) in Malawi, 14.4 (95% CrI: 9.3-24.9) in Nepal, and 7.0 (95% CrI: 5.6-9.2) in Bangladesh. The probability of blood culture collection led to the largest adjustment in Malawi, while the probability of seeking healthcare contributed the most in Nepal and Bangladesh; adjustment factors varied by age. Adjusted incidence rates were within or below the seroincidence rate limits of typhoid infection. Estimates of blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever without these adjustments results in considerable underestimation of the true incidence of typhoid fever. Our approach allows each phase of the reporting process to be synthesized to estimate the adjusted incidence of typhoid fever while correctly characterizing uncertainty, which can inform decision-making for typhoid prevention and control.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT) is recommended by WHO for implementation in high-burden countries, but there is little evidence about its ability to protect against clinical typhoid in such settings. We did a participant-masked and observer-masked cluster-randomised trial preceded by a safety pilot phase in an urban endemic setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 150 clusters, each with approximately 1350 residents, were randomly assigned (1:1) to either Vi-TT or SA 14-14-2 Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine. Children aged 9 months to less than 16 years were invited via parent or guardian to receive a single, parenteral dose of vaccine according to their cluster of residence. The study population was followed for an average of 17·1 months. Total and overall protection by Vi-TT against blood culture-confirmed typhoid were the primary endpoints assessed in the intention-to-treat population of vaccinees or all residents in the clusters. A subset of approximately 4800 participants was assessed with active surveillance for adverse events. The trial is registered at www.isrctn.com, ISRCTN11643110. 41 344 children were vaccinated in April-May, 2018, with another 20 412 children vaccinated at catch-up vaccination campaigns between September and December, 2018, and April and May, 2019. The incidence of typhoid fever (cases per 100 000 person-years) was 635 in JE vaccinees and 96 in Vi-TT vaccinees (total Vi-TT protection 85%; 97·5% CI 76 to 91, p<0·0001). Total vaccine protection was consistent in different age groups, including children vaccinated at ages under 2 years (81%; 95% CI 39 to 94, p=0·0052). The incidence was 213 among all residents in the JE clusters and 93 in the Vi-TT clusters (overall Vi-TT protection 57%; 97·5% CI 43 to 68, p<0·0001). We did not observe significant indirect vaccine protection by Vi-TT (19%; 95% CI -12 to 41, p=0·20). The vaccines were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events judged to be vaccine-related were observed. Vi-TT provided protection against typhoid fever to children vaccinated between 9 months and less than 16 years. Longer-term follow-up will be needed to assess the duration of protection and the need for booster doses. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Typhi and <i>S</i>. Paratyphi imported to England, we aim to guide effective empirical treatment.<b>Methodology.</b> All English isolates of <i>S</i>. Typhi and <i>S</i>. Paratyphi 2014-2019 underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing; results were compared to a previous survey in London 2005-2012. Risk factors for antimicrobial resistance were analysed with logistic regression models to predict adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for resistance to individual antibiotics and multi-drug resistance.<b>Results.</b> We identified 1088 cases of <i>S</i>. Typhi, 729 <i>S</i>. Paratyphi A, 93 <i>S</i>. Paratyphi B, and one <i>S</i>. Paratyphi C. In total, 93 % were imported. Overall, 90 % of <i>S</i>. Typhi and 97 % of <i>S</i>. Paratyphi A isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin; 26 % of <i>S</i>. Typhi were multidrug resistant to ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, and chloramphenicol (MDR+FQ). Of the isolates, 4 % of <i>S</i>. Typhi showed an extended drug resistance (XDR) phenotype of MDR+FQ plus resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, with cases of XDR rising sharply in recent years (none before 2017, one in 2017, six in 2018, 32 in 2019). For <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates, resistance to ciprofloxacin was associated with travel to Pakistan (aOR=32.0, 95 % CI: 15.4-66.4), India (aOR=21.8, 95 % CI: 11.6-41.2), and Bangladesh (aOR=6.2, 95 % CI: 2.8-13.6) compared to travel elsewhere, after adjusting for rising prevalence of resistance over time. MDR+FQ resistance in <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates was associated with travel to Pakistan (aOR=3.5, 95 % CI: 2.4-5.2) and less likely with travel to India (aOR=0.07, 95 % CI 0.04-0.15) compared to travel elsewhere. All XDR cases were imported from Pakistan. No isolate was resistant to azithromycin. Comparison with the 2005-2012 London survey indicates substantial increases in the prevalence of resistance of <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates to ciprofloxacin associated with travel to Pakistan (from 79-98 %) and Africa (from 12-60 %).<b>Conclusion.</b> Third-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin remain appropriate choices for empirical treatment of enteric fever in most returning travellers to the UK from endemic countries, except from Pakistan, where XDR represents a significant risk.",

We aimed to provide a better understanding of the genetic characteristics and transmission patterns associated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) iNTS serovars across the continent. A total of 166 iNTS isolates collected from a multi-centre surveillance in 10 African countries (2010-2014) and a fever study in Ghana (2007-2009) were genome sequenced to investigate the geographical distribution, antimicrobial genetic determinants and population structure of iNTS serotypes-genotypes. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in the context of the existing genomic frameworks for various iNTS serovars. Population-based incidence of MDR-iNTS disease was estimated in each study site. <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium sequence-type (ST) 313 and <i>Salmonella</i> Enteritidis ST11 were predominant, and both exhibited high frequencies of MDR; <i>Salmonella</i> Dublin ST10 was identified in West Africa only. Mutations in the <i>gyrA</i> gene (fluoroquinolone resistance) were identified in <i>S</i>. Enteritidis and <i>S</i>. Typhimurium in Ghana; an ST313 isolate carrying <i>bla</i><sub>CTX-M-15</sub> was found in Kenya. International transmission of MDR ST313 (lineage II) and MDR ST11 (West African clade) was observed between Ghana and neighbouring West African countries. The incidence of MDR-iNTS disease exceeded 100/100 000 person-years-of-observation in children aged <5 years in several West African countries. We identified the circulation of multiple MDR iNTS serovar STs in the sampled sub-Saharan African countries. Investment in the development and deployment of iNTS vaccines coupled with intensified antimicrobial resistance surveillance are essential to limit the impact of these pathogens in Africa.",

        "abstract": "Global annual reports of visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar (\"black fever\") reduced from 200,000 cases in 2012 to 23,804 in 2015. India, Bangladesh and Nepal reported 80% of the global cases in 2012, but 39% in 2015. We sought to identify major amenable barriers to early diagnosis of kala-azar in peripheral areas of Mymensingh district, an area of Bangladesh that was highly endemic for kala-azar. We conducted sequential exploratory mixed methods research. Qualitative data were first derived from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions among 29 patients diagnosed with kala-azar, their families, and neighbours. Preliminary results from qualitative analysis were used to design a structured questionnaire, which was administered to collect data on the processes leading to the diagnosis of kala-azar from 102 patients. Qualitative and quantitative data were integrated consistent with the chronology for kala-azar patients seeking care. The study was conducted from September 2011 to May 2012 in Fulbaria and Gaffargaon sub-districts of Mymensingh. The median delay from fever onset to confirmatory diagnosis of kala-azar was 60 days, with 38% of the cases diagnosed within 30 days. Public health facilities and Gaffargaon sub-district achieved high proportions of early diagnosis. Individual barriers to early diagnosis were low awareness of symptoms and treatment facilities, poverty, and traditional beliefs. Other factors were the remoteness of health care centres, wet season transport difficulty, mis-diagnosis as typhoid, limited availability of rK-39 testing at the community level, and the inclusion of splenomegaly in the case definition. Targeted community awareness campaigns appropriate for underprivileged communities will increase care seeking and consequently diagnosis. Improved diagnostic guidelines and a strong referral chain for kala-azar will accelerate diagnosis. These steps will contribute significantly to the National Kala-azar Elimination Program of Bangladesh, especially during the post-elimination era.",

The optimum treatment protocol for this type of serovar has not been established. This study compared different antimicrobial regimens for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever which was conducted in the medicine ward of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and outdoor setting in private practice in Dhaka metropolitan city, Mymensingh and Sylhet town from January 2017 to December 2017. Bangladeshi adults with uncomplicated typhoid fever were included in this an open-label randomized controlled trial. Ciprofloxacin (20mg/kg of body weight/day for 14 days), azithromycin (20mg/kg/day for 14 days), and Cefixime (16mg/kg/day for 14 days) were compared. Of the 81 enrolled patients, 62 were eligible for analysis (61 S. enterica serovar Typhi, 1 Salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi A). Of the S enterica serovar Typhi isolates, 88.7% (55/62) were MDR and 93.5% (58/62) were nalidixic acid resistant (NAR). The clinical cure rate was 62% (13/21) with ciprofloxacin, 71% (15/21) with Cefixime, and 85% (17/20) with azithromycin (p=0.053). The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) fever clearance time for patients treated with azithromycin (5.8 days [5.1 to 6.5 days]) was shorter than that for patients treated with cefixime (7.1 days [6.2 to 8.1 days]) and ciprofloxacin (8.2 days [7.2 to 9.2 days]) (p<0.001). All three antibiotics were well tolerated. A 7-day course of azithromycin can be successfully used in uncomplicated typhoid fever due to isolates of MDR S enterica serovar Typhi.",

This cross-sectional comparative study was performed among which of fifty confirmed enteric fever and hundred non enteric febrile adult patients in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2015 to December 2015. Purposive sampling technique was implied for convenience of the study. In this study, history of step ladder fever, diarrhoea and relative bradycardia, ceacal gurgle, abdominal distension were proved to be powerful markers of enteric fever with high specificity (100.0%, 90.0%, 95.0%, 92.0% and 95.0% respectively). Tender right iliac fossa (RIF) and coated tongue, hepatomegaly were moderately powerful with 86.0%, 88.0%, 89.0% specificity respectively.

Whole-genome sequences of three Azith<sup>R</sup>  <i>S</i>. Typhi isolates (MIC >256 mg/L) were analysed and compared with a global collection to investigate the azithromycin resistance mechanism and phylogenetic structure. Clinical information is reported for one of the three patients infected with Azith<sup>R</sup>  <i>S</i>. Typhi. The three Azith<sup>R</sup> isolates belonged to the H58 lineage and were genetically identical; they were distantly related to contemporaneous <i>S</i>. Typhi from Nepal and Azith<sup>R</sup>  <i>S</i>. Typhi recently described in Bangladesh. Azithromycin resistance was mediated by a non-synonymous mutation in the <i>acrB</i> gene (R717L). The three Azith<sup>R</sup> isolates showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (double mutation in the <i>gyrA</i>: S83F and D87G), and were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole. Clinical information from one patient suggested non-response to azithromycin treatment. This is the first molecular description of Azith<sup>R</sup>  <i>S</i>. Typhi in Nepal. These organisms showed no phylogenetic link to Azith<sup>R</sup>  <i>S</i>. Typhi in Bangladesh. Our data suggest that increasing use of azithromycin may pose a strong selective pressure driving the emergence of Azith<sup>R</sup>  <i>S</i>. Typhi in South Asia. Further investigations are needed to evaluate treatment responses to azithromycin, predict evolutionary trajectories, and track the transmission of these organisms.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid incidence in children is higher in urban areas than in rural areas of Bangladesh. This study examined whether healthy urban children harboured higher levels of Salmonella genes than healthy rural children. Stool samples from 140 children were studied: 70 from rural areas and 70 from urban metropolitan areas. The stool samples of urban children contained more Salmonella genes (median 4, IQR 3-4) than those of rural children (median 3, IQR 3-4). This suggests that urban Bangladeshi children have more Salmonella genes in their guts than rural children. Especially, in those under 12 months of age, the Salmonella gene prevalence in urban children was unique. They had more Salmonella genes (median 4, IQR 4-5) than rural children in the same age group (median 3, IQR 2.5-4). We also found more Salmonella genes in urban children who drank tap water (median 4, IQR 3-5) than in rural children whose water source was tube well water (median 3, IQR 2-4) and boiled pond water (median 3, IQR 3-3.5). However, there was no significant difference of Salmonella genes between urban children who drank tap-water and children whose water source was a tube well (median 4, IQR 3-4). These data suggest that the urban environment, including the drinking water supply system, increases the likelihood of healthy children in urban areas harbouring more potentially pathogenic Salmonella organisms in their gut than found in rural healthy children.",

This study aims to determine the spectrum of AMR and associated genes encoding aminoglycoside, macrolide and β-lactam classes of antimicrobials in bacteria isolated from hospitalised patients in Bangladesh. 430 bacterial isolates from patients with respiratory, intestinal, wound infections and typhoid fever, presenting to clinical care from 2015 to 2019, were examined. They included Escherichia coli (n = 85); Staphylococcus aureus (n = 84); Salmonella typhi (n = 82); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 42); Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 36); coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 28); Enterococcus faecalis (n = 27); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 26); and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 20). Reconfirmation of these clinical isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility tests was performed. PCR amplification using resistance gene-specific primers was done, and the amplified products were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. 53% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), including 97% of Escherichia coli. There was a year-wise gradual increase in MDR isolates from 2015 to 2018, and there was an almost twofold increase in the number of MDR strains isolated in 2019 (P = 0.00058). Among the 5 extended-spectrum β-lactamases investigated, CTX-M-1 was the most prevalent (63%) followed by NDM-1 (22%); Escherichia coli was the major reservoir of these genes. The ermB (55%) and aac(6')-Ib (35%) genes were the most frequently detected macrolide and aminoglycoside resistance genes, respectively.

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever remains a significant health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, with incidence rates of >100 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. Despite the prequalification of safe and effective typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV), some uncertainties remain around future demand. Real-life effectiveness data, which inform public health programs on the impact of TCVs in reducing typhoid-related mortality and morbidity, from an African setting may help encourage the introduction of TCVs in high-burden settings. Here, we describe a cluster-randomized trial to investigate population-level protection of TYPBAR-TCV<sup>®</sup>, a Vi-polysaccharide conjugated to a tetanus-toxoid protein carrier (Vi-TT) against blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever, and the synthesis of health economic evidence to inform policy decisions. A total of 80 geographically distinct clusters are delineated within the Agogo district of the Asante Akim region in Ghana. Clusters are randomized to the intervention arm receiving Vi-TT or a control arm receiving the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine. The primary study endpoint is the total protection of Vi-TT against blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Total, direct, and indirect protection are measured as secondary outcomes. Blood-culture-based enhanced surveillance enables the estimation of incidence rates in the intervention and control clusters. Evaluation of the real-world impact of TCVs and evidence synthesis improve the uptake of prequalified/licensed safe and effective typhoid vaccines in public health programs of high burden settings.

Physical examination and preoperative investigations of the patient suggested a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal perforation, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary-level hospital for surgical management. A positive blood culture, intraoperative findings, and histopathology of an intestinal biopsy confirmed ileal perforation due to typhoid fever.

Clinical management of enteric fever remains a challenge with the emergence of ESBL-producing strains, especially XDR Salmonella Typhi from Sindh, Pakistan. All strains of S. Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A isolated from cases presenting with symptoms of enteric fever in England and Wales, between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2020, were characterized using WGS. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using an agar dilution method. ESBL strains contributed to 69 cases of enteric fever (S. Typhi n = 68, S. Paratyphi A n = 1); 68 were imported (Pakistan n = 64, Iraq n = 2, Bangladesh n = 1 and India n = 1). Ages ranged from 1 to 56 years, 36/69 (52%) were children, 52% were female and the duration of hospital stay ranged from 1 to 23 days. The ESBL phenotype was conferred by the presence of blaCTX-M-15 (S. Typhi n = 67 and S. Paratyphi A n = 1) or blaCTX-M-55 (S. Typhi n = 1). An IncY plasmid harbouring blaCTX-M-15 and qnr was detected in 56 strains from Pakistan. The IncY plasmid was absent in the remaining strains and there was evidence of a 4 kb ISEcpl-blaCTX-M-15-tnp gene cassette insertion into the chromosome at one of three integration points. Chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M-15 within the XDR Sindh strains may lead to the maintenance of resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure.

        "title": "Tracking the Emergence of Azithromycin Resistance in Multiple Genotypes of Typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i>.",
        "abstract": "The rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid, have led to fears of untreatable infections. Of specific concern is the emerging resistance against azithromycin, the only remaining oral drug to treat extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid. Since the first report of azithromycin resistance from Bangladesh in 2019, cases have been reported from Nepal, India, and Pakistan. The genetic basis of this resistance is a single point mutation in the efflux pump AcrB (R717Q/L). Here, we report 38 additional cases of azithromycin-resistant (AzmR) <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi and Paratyphi A isolated in Bangladesh between 2016 and 2018. Using genomic analysis of 56 AzmR isolates from South Asia with AcrB-R717Q/L, we confirm that this mutation has spontaneously emerged in different <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi and Paratyphi A genotypes. The largest cluster of AzmR Typhi belonged to genotype 4.3.1.1; Bayesian analysis predicts the mutation to have emerged sometime in 2010. A travel-related Typhi isolate with AcrB-R717Q belonging to 4.3.1.1 was isolated in the United Kingdom, increasing fears of global spread. For real-time detection of AcrB-R717Q/L, we developed an extraction-free, rapid, and low-cost mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA). Validation of MAMA using 113 AzmR and non-AzmR isolates yielded >98% specificity and sensitivity versus phenotypic and whole-genome sequencing assays currently used for azithromycin resistance detection. With increasing azithromycin use, AcrB-R717Q/L is likely to be acquired by XDR strains. The proposed tool for active detection and surveillance of this mutation may detect pan-oral drug resistance early, giving us a window to intervene.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In the early 1900s, with mortality of ∼30%, typhoid and paratyphoid ravaged parts of the world; with improved water, sanitation, and hygiene in resource-rich countries and the advent of antimicrobials, mortality dwindled to <1%. Today, the burden rests disproportionately on South Asia, where the primary means for combatting the disease is antimicrobials. However, prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is rising and, in 2016, an extensively drug resistant Typhi strain triggered an ongoing outbreak in Pakistan, leaving only one oral drug, azithromycin, to treat it. Since the description of emergence of azithromycin resistance, conferred by a point mutation in <i>acrB</i> (AcrB-R717Q/L) in 2019, there have been increasing numbers of reports. Using genomics and Bayesian analysis, we illustrate that this mutation emerged in approximately 2010 and has spontaneously arisen multiple times. Emergence of pan-oral drug resistant <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi is imminent. We developed a low-cost, rapid PCR tool to facilitate real-time detection and prevention policies.",

Typhi organisms have been subsequently reported in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. Here, we aimed to understand the molecular basis of AMR in 66 S.

Typhi organisms with the R717Q mutation in the acrB gene that was recently found to confer resistance to azithromycin in Bangladesh. Six out of the seven azithromycin-resistant S. Typhi isolates also exhibited triple mutations in gyrA (S83F and D87N) and parC (S80I) genes and were resistant to ciprofloxacin. These contemporary ciprofloxacin/azithromycin-resistant isolates were phylogenetically distinct from each other and from those reported from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.

Here, we analyzed Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) data to estimate the burden of enteric fever hospitalization among children aged <15 years and identify risk factors for hospitalization in Bangladesh. SEAP used hospital surveillance paired with a community-based health-care utilization assessment. In SEAP hospital surveillance, blood was obtained for culture from children aged <15 years with ≥3 days of fever. In the hospital catchment area, a health-care utilization survey (HCUS) was conducted to estimate the proportion of febrile children hospitalized at the study hospitals. We analyzed hospital surveillance and HCUS data to estimate the health care-adjusted incidence of enteric fever hospitalization, and conducted univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. From July 2017 through June 2019, 2243 laboratory-confirmed enteric fever cases were detected in 2 study hospitals; 673 (30%) were hospitalized. The health care-adjusted incidence of enteric fever hospitalization among children <15 years old was 303/100 000 children/year (95% confidence interval [CI], 293-313). Salmonella Typhi contributed most to the enteric fever hospitalization incidence (277/100 000 children/year; 95% CI, 267-287).

Factors independently associated with enteric fever hospitalization included fever duration, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and leukocytopenia. We estimated a high burden of hospitalization due to enteric fever among children aged <5 years in Bangladesh.

Results can inform public health policies to prevent enteric fever. The study was conducted at 2 pediatric health facilities in Dhaka. For the patient and caregiver's perspective, we administered questionnaires on costs incurred from illness onset until the survey dates to caregivers of patients with blood culture positive cases at enrollment and 6 weeks later to estimate the direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect costs. From the perspective of the health care provider, we collected data on quantities and prices of resources used by the 2 hospitals to estimate the direct medical economic costs to treat a case of enteric fever. We collected costs in Bangladeshi takas and converted them into 2018 US dollars. We multiplied the unit cost per procedure by the frequency of procedures in the surveillance case cohort to calculate the average cost per case. Among the 1772 patients from whom we collected information, the median cost of illness per case of enteric fever from the patient and caregiver perspective was US $64.03 (IQR: US $33.90 -$173.48). Median direct medical and nonmedical costs per case were 3% of annual labor income across the sample. From the perspective of the healthcare provider, the average direct medical cost per case was US $58.64 (range: US $37.25 at Hospital B, US $73.27 at Hospital A). Our results show substantial economic burden of enteric fever in Bangladesh, with higher costs for patients receiving inpatient care.

We screened suspected enteric fever cases from 6 hospitals in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, and enrolled patients if blood culture was prescribed by the treating physician. We used generalized additive regression models to analyze the probability of receiving blood culture by age, and linear regression models to analyze changes by month to the proportion of febrile cases prescribed a blood culture compared with the burden of febrile illness, stratified by hospital. We used logistic regression to analyze predictors for receiving antibiotics empirically. We descriptively reviewed changes in antibiotic therapy by susceptibility patterns and coverage, stratified by country. We screened 30 809 outpatients resulting in 1819 enteric fever cases; 1935 additional cases were enrolled from other hospital locations. Younger outpatients were less likely to receive a blood culture. The association between the number of febrile outpatients and the proportion prescribed blood culture varied by hospital. Antibiotics prescribed empirically were associated with severity and provisional diagnoses, but 31% (1147/3754) of enteric fever cases were not covered by initial therapy; this was highest in Pakistan (50%) as many isolates were resistant to cephalosporins, which were commonly prescribed empirically. Understanding hospital-level communication between laboratories and physicians may improve patient care and timeliness of appropriate antibiotics, which is important considering the rise of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Characterizing healthcare-seeking patterns for acute febrile illness is critical for generating population-based enteric fever incidence estimates from facility-based surveillance data. We used a hybrid model in the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) to assess incidence of enteric fever at 6 study hospitals in 3 countries. We recruited individuals presenting to the hospitals and obtained blood cultures to evaluate for enteric fever. For this analysis, we undertook cluster random household surveys in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2 sites); Karachi, Pakistan; Kathmandu, Nepal; and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal between January 2017 and February 2019, to ascertain care-seeking behavior for individuals with 1) fever for ≥3 consecutive days within the past 8 weeks; or 2) fever resulting in hospitalization within the past year. We also collected data about disease severity and household demographics and assets. We used mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression models to identify determinants of healthcare seeking at study hospitals and determinants of culture-confirmed enteric fever. We enrolled 31 841 households (53 926 children) in Bangladesh, 25 510 households (84 196 children and adults) in Nepal, and 21 310 households (108 031 children and adults) in Pakistan. Children <5 years were most likely to be taken to the study hospitals for febrile illness at all sites. Household wealth was positively correlated with healthcare seeking in 4 of 5 study sites, and at least one marker of disease severity was positively associated with healthcare seeking in 3 of 5 catchment areas. Wealth and disease severity were variably predictive of blood culture-confirmed enteric fever. Age, household wealth, and disease severity are important determinants of healthcare seeking for acute febrile illness and enteric fever risk in these communities, and should be incorporated into estimation models for enteric fever incidence.",

        "abstract": "Enteric fever, a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, frequently presents as a nonlocalizing febrile illness that is difficult to distinguish from other infectious causes of fever. Blood culture is not widely available in endemic settings and, even when available, results can take up to 5 days. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of clinical features, including both reported symptoms and clinical signs, of enteric fever among patients participating in the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), a 3-year surveillance study in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. Outpatients presenting with ≥3 consecutive days of reported fever and inpatients with clinically suspected enteric fever from all 6 SEAP study hospitals were eligible to participate. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of select clinical features against blood culture results among outpatients using mixed-effect regression models with a random effect for study site hospital. We also compared the clinical features of S. Typhi to S. Paratyphi A among both outpatients and inpatients. We enrolled 20 899 outpatients, of whom 2116 (10.1%) had positive blood cultures for S. Typhi and 297 (1.4%) had positive cultures for S. Paratyphi A. The sensitivity of absence of cough was the highest among all evaluated features, at 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.0-74.7), followed by measured fever at presentation at 59.0% (95% CI, 51.6-65.9) and being unable to complete normal activities for 3 or more days at 51.0% (95% CI, 23.8-77.6). A combined case definition of 3 or more consecutive days of reported fever and 1 or more of the following (a) either the absence of cough, (b) fever at presentation, or (c) 3 or more consecutive days of being unable to conduct usual activity--yielded a sensitivity of 94.6% (95% CI, 93.4-95.5) and specificity of 13.6% (95% CI, 9.8-17.5).

The Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) is a prospective study of enteric fever incidence in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Nested within SEAP, we evaluated the accuracy of self-reported antibiotic use and investigated the association between antibiotic use and blood culture positivity. Between November 2016 and April 2019, we collected urine samples among a subset of SEAP participants to test for antibiotic use prior to the hospital visit using an antibacterial activity assay. All participants were asked about recent antibiotic use and had a blood culture performed. We used mixed-effect logit models to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial use on blood culture positivity, adjusted for markers of disease severity. We enrolled 2939 patients with suspected enteric fever. Antibiotics were detected in 39% (1145/2939) of urine samples. The correlation between measured and reported antibiotic use was modest (κ = 0.72). After adjusting for disease severity, patients with antibiotics in their urine were slightly more likely to be blood culture positive for enteric fever; however, the effect was not statistically significant (prevalence ratio, 1.22 [95% confidence interval, .99-1.50]). The reliability of self-reported prior antibiotic use was modest among individuals presenting with fever to tertiary hospitals. While antibiotics are likely to reduce the sensitivity of blood culture, our findings indicate that there is still considerable value in performing blood culture for individuals reporting antibiotic use.",

As a part of the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP), we investigated the extent measured the burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among confirmed enteric fever cases in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. From September 2016-September 2019, SEAP recruited study participants of all age groups from its outpatient, inpatient, hospital laboratory, laboratory network, and surgical sites who had a diagnosis of febrile illness that was either suspected or blood culture confirmed for enteric fever. Antimicrobial resistance of isolates was determined by disc diffusion using Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute cut-off points. We reported the frequency of multidrug resistance (MDR)(resistance to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol), extensive drug resistance (XDR) (MDR plus non-susceptible to fluoroquinolone and any 3rd generation cephalosporins), and fluoroquinolone (FQ) and azithromycin non-susceptibility. We enrolled 8,705 blood culture confirmed enteric fever cases: 4,873 (56%) from Bangladesh, 1,602 (18%) from Nepal and 2,230 (26%) from Pakistan. Of these, 7,591 (87%) were Salmonella Typhi and 1114 (13%) were S. Paratyphi. MDR S. Typhi was identified in 17% (701/4065) of isolates in Bangladesh, and 1% (19/1342) in Nepal. In Pakistan, 16 % (331/2084) of S. Typhi isolates were MDR, and 64% (1319/2074) were XDR. FQ nonsusceptibility among S. Typhi isolates was 98% in Bangladesh, 87% in Nepal, and 95% in Pakistan. Azithromycin non-susceptibility was detected in 77 (2%) in Bangladesh, 9 (.67%) in Nepal and 9 (.59%) isolates in Pakistan. In Pakistan, three (2%) S. Paratyphi isolates were MDR; no MDR S. Paratyphi was reported from Bangladesh or Nepal. Although AMR against S. Paratyphi was low across the three countries, there was widespread drug resistance among S. Typhi, including FQ non-susceptibility and the emergence of XDR S. Typhi in Pakistan, limiting treatment options. As typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) is rolled out, surveillance should continue to monitor changes in AMR to inform policies and to monitor drug resistance in S. Paratyphi, for which there is no vaccine.",

Whether typhoid immunization should be prioritized in periurban and rural communities has been unclear. We performed population-based surveillance for enteric fever in 1 urban catchment (Kathmandu) and 1 periurban and rural catchment (Kavrepalanchok) as part of the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP). We recruited individuals presenting to outpatient and emergency departments at 2 study hospitals with suspected enteric fever and performed blood cultures. Additionally, we conducted a household survey in each catchment area to characterize care seeking for febrile illness. We evaluated spatial heterogeneity in febrile illness, care seeking, and enteric fever incidence. Between September 2016 and September 2019, we enrolled 5736 participants with suspected enteric fever at 2 study hospitals. Among these, 304 (5.3%) were culture positive for Salmonella Typhi (249 [81.9%]) or Paratyphi A (55 [18.1%]). Adjusted typhoid incidence in Kathmandu was 484 per 100 000 person-years and in Kavrepalanchok was 615 per 100 000 person-years. While all geographic areas for which estimates could be made had incidence >200 per 100 000 person-years, we observed spatial heterogeneity with up to 10-fold variation in incidence between communities. In urban, periurban, and rural communities in and around Kathmandu, we measured a high but heterogenous incidence of typhoid. These findings provide some support for the introduction of conjugate vaccines in Nepal, including outside urban areas, alongside other measures to prevent enteric fever.",

The objectives of the study were to characterize disease incidence among patients with enteric fever. We report the burden of enteric fever at selected sites of Karachi, Pakistan. During September 2016 to September 2019, prospective surveillance was conducted at inpatient, outpatient, surgical departments, and laboratory networks of Aga Khan University Hospital, Kharadar General Hospital, and surgery units of National Institute of Child Health and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from all suspected or confirmed enteric fever cases. Overall, 22% (2230/10 094) of patients enrolled were culture-positive for enteric fever. 94% (2093/2230) of isolates were Salmonella Typhi and 6% (137/2230) were S. Paratyphi. 15% of isolates multi-drug resistant (MDR) to first-line antibiotics and 60% were extensively drug-resistant (XDR), resistant to first-line antibiotics, fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporin. Enteric fever cases have increased during the last 3 years with large proportion of drug resistant S. Typhi cases. However, the burden of paratyphoid is still relatively low. Strengthening the existing surveillance system for enteric fever and antimicrobial resistance at the national level is recommended in Pakistan to inform prevention measures. While typhoid vaccination can significantly decrease the burden of typhoid and may also impact antimicrobial resistance, water, sanitation, and hygiene improvement is highly recommended to prevent the spread of enteric fever.",

Between September 2016 and September 2019, all cases of nontraumatic ileal perforation with a clinical diagnosis of typhoid were enrolled from 4 tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, 2 pediatric hospitals in Bangladesh, and 2 hospitals in Nepal. Sociodemographic data were collected from patients or their caregivers, and clinical and outcome data were retrieved from medical records. Tissue samples were collected for histopathology and blood cultures where available. Of the 249 enrolled cases, 2 from Bangladesh, 5 from Nepal and 242 from Pakistan. In Pakistan, most of the cases were in the 0-15 (117/242; 48%) and 16-30 (89/242; 37%) age groups.

Culture or histopathology confirmed total 15 (11%) enteric fever cases with ileal perforation are similar to the clinically diagnosed cases. There were 16/242 (7%) deaths from Pakistan. Cases of ileal perforation who survived were more likely to have sought care before visiting the sentinel hospital (P = .009), visited any hospital for treatment (P = .013) compared to those who survived. Although surveillance differed substantially by country, one reason for the higher number of ileal perforation cases in Pakistan could be the circulation of XDR strain of S. Typhi in Karachi.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever, caused by <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (<i>S.</i> Typhi), is a global health concern and its treatment is problematic due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Rapid detection of patients infected with AMR positive <i>S.</i> Typhi is, therefore, crucial to prevent further spreading. <i>C</i>lustered <i>R</i>egularly <i>I</i>nterspaced <i>S</i>hort <i>P</i>alindromic <i>R</i>epeats and CRISPR-associated genes (CRISPR-Cas), is an adaptive immune system that initially was used for typing purposes. Later, it was discovered to play a role in defense against phages and plasmids, including ones that carry AMR genes, and, at present, it is being explored for its usage in diagnostics. Despite the availability of whole-genome sequences (WGS), very few studied the CRISPR-Cas system of <i>S.</i> Typhi, let alone in typing purposes or relation to AMR. In the present study, we analyzed the CRISPR-Cas system of <i>S.</i> Typhi using WGS data of 1059 isolates obtained from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan in combination with demographic data and AMR status. Our results reveal that the <i>S.</i> Typhi CRISPR loci can be classified into two groups: A (evidence level >2) and B (evidence level ≤2), in which we identified a total of 47 unique spacers and 15 unique direct repeats. Further analysis of the identified spacers and repeats demonstrated specific patterns that harbored significant associations with genotype, demographic characteristics, and AMR status, thus raising the possibility of their usage as biomarkers. Potential spacer targets were identified and, interestingly, the phage-targeting spacers belonged to the group-A and plasmid-targeting spacers to the group-B CRISPR loci. Further analyses of the spacer targets led to the identification of an <i>S.</i> Typhi protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, TTTCA/T. New <i>cas</i>-genes known as <i>DinG</i>, <i>DEDDh</i>, and <i>WYL</i> were also discovered in the <i>S.</i> Typhi genome. However, a specific variant of the <i>WYL</i> gene was only identified in the extensively drug-resistant (XDR) lineage from Pakistan and ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage from Bangladesh. From this work, we conclude that there are strong correlations between variations identified in the <i>S.</i> Typhi CRISPR-Cas system and endemic AMR positive <i>S.</i> Typhi isolates.",

        "abstract": "Sustained investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) have lagged in resource-poor settings; incremental WASH improvements may, nonetheless, prevent diseases such as typhoid in disease-endemic populations. Using prospective data from a large cohort in urban Kolkata, India, we evaluated whether baseline WASH variables predicted typhoid risk in a training subpopulation (n = 28 470). We applied a machine learning algorithm to the training subset to create a composite, dichotomous (good, not good) WASH variable based on 4 variables, and evaluated sensitivity and specificity of this variable in a validation subset (n = 28 470). We evaluated in Cox regression models whether residents of \"good\" WASH households experienced a lower typhoid risk after controlling for potential confounders. We constructed virtual clusters (radius 50 m) surrounding each household to evaluate whether a prevalence of good WASH practices modified the typhoid risk in central household members. Good WASH practices were associated with protection in analyses of all households (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], .37-.90; P = .015). This protection was evident in persons ≥5 years old at baseline (HR = 0.47; 95% CI, .34-.93; P = .005) and was suggestive, though not statistically significant, in younger age groups (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, .27-1.38; P = .235). The level of surrounding household good WASH coverage was also associated with protection (HR = 0.988; 95% CI, .979-.996; P = .004, for each percent coverage increase). However, collinearity between household WASH and WASH coverage prevented an assessment of their independent predictive contributions. In this typhoid-endemic setting, natural variation in household WASH was associated with typhoid risk. If replicated elsewhere, these findings suggest that WASH improvements may enhance typhoid control, short of major infrastructural investments.",

Historical evidence has shown that contamination of water systems used for household consumption or agriculture are key transmission routes for Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A. The World Health Organization now recommends that typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV) be used in settings with high typhoid incidence; consequently, governments face a challenge regarding how to prioritize typhoid against other emerging diseases. A key issue is the lack of typhoid burden data in many low- and middle-income countries where TCV could be deployed. Here we present an argument for utilizing environmental sampling for the surveillance of enteric fever organisms to provide data on community-level typhoid risk. Such an approach could complement traditional blood culture-based surveillance or even replace it in settings where population-based clinical surveillance is not feasible. We review historical studies characterizing the transmission of enteric fever organisms through sewage and water, discuss recent advances in the molecular detection of typhoidal Salmonella in the environment, and outline challenges and knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to establish environmental sampling as a tool for generating actionable data that can inform public health responses to enteric fever.",

        "abstract": "Building on previous multicountry surveillance studies of typhoid and others salmonelloses such as the Diseases of the Most Impoverished program and the Typhoid Surveillance in Africa Project, several ongoing blood culture surveillance studies are generating important data about incidence, severity, transmission, and clinical features of invasive Salmonella infections in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. These studies are also characterizing drug resistance patterns in their respective study sites. Each study answers a different set of research questions and employs slightly different methodologies, and the geographies under surveillance differ in size, population density, physician practices, access to healthcare facilities, and access to microbiologically safe water and improved sanitation. These differences in part reflect the heterogeneity of the epidemiology of invasive salmonellosis globally, and thus enable generation of data that are useful to policymakers in decision-making for the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs). Moreover, each study is evaluating the large-scale deployment of TCVs, and may ultimately be used to assess post-introduction vaccine impact. The data generated by these studies will also be used to refine global disease burden estimates. It is important to ensure that lessons learned from these studies not only inform vaccination policy, but also are incorporated into sustainable, low-cost, integrated vaccine-preventable disease surveillance systems.",

However, there are few data on anti-polysaccharide responses following transcutaneous vaccination of polysaccharides, despite the role that anti-polysaccharide responses play in protecting against intestinal mucosal and respiratory pathogens. Whether transcutaneous vaccination with a conjugate polysaccharide vaccine would be able to induce memory responses is also unknown. To address this, we transcutaneously vaccinated mice with virulence antigen (Vi) polysaccharide of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (the cause of typhoid fever), either in unconjugated or conjugated form (the latter as a Vi-DT conjugate). We also assessed the ability of the immunoadjuvant cholera toxin to impact responses following vaccination. We found that presenting Vi in a conjugate versus nonconjugate form transcutaneously resulted in comparable serum IgG responses but higher serum and lamina propria lymphocyte IgA anti-Vi responses, as well as increased IgG memory responses. The addition of immunoadjuvant did not further increase these responses; however, it boosted fecal IgA and serum IgG anti-Vi responses. Our results suggest that transcutaneous vaccination of a conjugate vaccine can induce systemic as well as enhanced mucosal and memory B-cell anti-polysaccharide responses.",

Anaerobic bacterial communities have been hypothesized to mediate colonization resistance against <i>Salmonella</i> species by producing short-chain fatty acids, yet the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota in human patients with typhoid fever remain ill defined. We prospectively collected fecal samples from 60 febrile patients admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, with typhoid fever or nontyphoidal febrile illness and from 36 healthy age-matched controls. The collected fecal samples were subjected to 16s rRNA sequencing followed by targeted metabolomics analysis. Patients with typhoid fever displayed compositional and functional disruption of the gut microbiota compared with patients with nontyphoidal febrile illness and healthy controls. Specifically, typhoid fever patients had lower microbiota richness and alpha diversity and a higher prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa. In addition, a lower abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing taxa was seen in typhoid fever patients. The differences between typhoid fever and nontyphoidal febrile illness could not be explained by a loss of colonization resistance after antibiotic treatment, as antibiotic exposure in both groups was similar. his first report on the composition and function of the gut microbiota in patients with typhoid fever suggests that the restoration of these intestinal commensal microorganisms could be targeted using adjunctive, preventive, or therapeutic strategies.",

There is need for validated clinical criteria to define cases that are BC negative, both to help direct empiric antibiotic treatment and to better evaluate the magnitude of protection conferred by typhoid vaccines. To derive and validate a clinical rule for defining BC-negative typhoid fever, we assessed, in a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial of Vi-polysaccharide (ViPS) typhoid vaccine in Kolkata, India, 14,797 episodes of fever lasting at least 3 days during 4 years of comprehensive, BC-based surveillance of 70,865 persons. A recursive partitioning algorithm was used to develop a decision rule to predict BC-proven typhoid cases with a diagnostic specificity of 97-98%. To validate this rule as a definition for BC-negative typhoid fever, we assessed whether the rule defined culture-negative syndromes prevented by ViPS vaccine. In a training subset of individuals, we identified the following two rules: rule 1: patients aged < 15 years with prolonged fever accompanied by a measured body temperature ≥ 100°F, headache, and nausea; rule 2: patients aged ≥ 15 years with prolonged fever accompanied by nausea and palpable liver but without constipation. The adjusted protective efficacy of ViPS against clinical typhoid defined by these rules in persons aged ≥ 2 years in a separate validation subset was 33% (95% CI: 4-53%). We have defined and validated a clinical rule for predicting BC-negative typhoid fever using a novel vaccine probe approach.

Comparative studies could expedite the licencing process, and the availability of a standardised ELISA method alongside the 1st International Standard (IS) 16/138 for anti-typhoid capsular Vi polysaccharide IgG (human) will facilitate this process. To this end, a non-commercial ELISA based on a coat of Vi and poly-l-lysine (Vi-PLL ELISA) was evaluated by 10 laboratories. Eight serum samples, including IS 16/138, were tested in the standardised Vi-PLL ELISA (n = 10), a commercial Vi ELISA (n = 3) and a biotinylated Vi ELISA (n = 1). Valid estimates of potencies relative to IS 16/138 were obtained for all samples in the Vi-PLL ELISA and the commercial ELISA, with good repeatability and reproducibility evident from the study results and concordant estimates obtained by the two ELISA methods.
