        "title": "Chronic urticaria and vitamin D supplementations: a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "Chronic urticaria (CU), especially chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), is a long-term inflammatory skin condition marked by wheals and/or angioedema lasting over six weeks. Emerging evidence suggests a link between vitamin D deficiency and immune dysregulation associated with CU. Given vitamin D's immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, this review explores the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation in CU management. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines Electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were searched using relevant keywords. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-control, and observational studies assessing serum vitamin D levels or supplementation in patients with CU. Data extraction and bias assessment were independently conducted using standardized tools: the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Eleven studies involving 1,491 participants were included. Most studies demonstrated significantly lower serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CU compared to healthy controls. Vitamin D supplementation, particularly in individuals with a deficiency, was associated with reductions in urticaria activity scores, symptom severity, and improved quality of life. High-dose regimens (e.g., 4,000 IU/day or 60,000 IU/week) appeared more effective. However, results varied due to heterogeneity in study design, dosage, and patient characteristics. Vitamin D supplementation may serve as a safe, accessible adjunct to standard CU treatment, particularly for those with confirmed deficiency. While evidence suggests potential benefits, further high-quality RCTs are needed to establish causality, optimal dosing, and long-term efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Dysphagia and malnutrition increase with age and are correlated with adverse clinical outcomes. Researchers have not fully studied the safety and effectiveness between oral nutrition pathway and tube feeding in dysphagic and malnourished elderly individuals. Elderly individuals > 65 years old with nutrition risk admitted to the department of geriatrics from 58 third-grade hospitals between September 2020 and December 2022 were recruited. The analysis was conducted in patients with moderate dysphagia. Baseline characteristics, including demography, nutrition, swallowing function and body function, were collected per inclusion. Nutritional suggestions were given by geriatricians and nutritionists. Nutritional therapy pathways were recorded, and the body and functional measurements were repeated at discharge and the 90-day follow-up. Adverse outcomes, including new-onset pneumonia, falls, unplanned readmission and all-cause death were recorded. A total of 1027 hospitalized elderly individuals were included, with 168 (16.4%) having moderate dysphagia. Among the participants receiving oral nutrition or tube feeding, 91 (81.3%) and 45 (80.4%) gained sufficient calories after nutritional intervention and were included in the analysis. The median age was 89 (IQR: 82-92) years, 43 (31.6%) were female, and 128 (94.1%) were malnourished. Ninety-one (66.9%) patients were treated with oral nutrition (oral diet or oral nutritional supplements), and 45 (33.1%) were treated with tube feeding. Among the oral nutrition patients, 11 (12.1%), 3 (3.3%), 14 (16.7%) and 2 (2.6%) had new-onset pneumonia, all-cause death, readmission and falls, respectively. The corresponding events in the tube-feeding group were 5 (11.1%), 1 (2.2%), 7 (16.7%) and 1 (2.5%). No statistically significant difference was observed between nutrition treatment pathways. BMI, grip strength and calf circumference increased similarly between the oral nutrition and tube-feeding groups, whereas the percentage of improved MNA-SF status was greater in the oral nutrition group than in the tube-feeding group (53% vs. 26%, p = 0.004). Among moderately dysphagic geriatric inpatients with malnutrition or nutritional risk, oral nutritional may demonstrate comparable safety to tube feeding regarding new-onset pneumonia, all-cause death, readmissions, and falls during short term follow-up. Oral nutrition may also demonstrate comparable effectiveness in terms of energy supply and improving function, and oral nutrition may be more effective in improving nutritional status.

        "abstract": "Noma (cancrum oris) is a severe gangrenous disease of the mouth and oro-facial structures. Noma often affects young children living in extreme poverty, malnutrition and poor sanitation. Gaps remain in understanding its aetiology, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment. We systematically searched databases for all primary research studies (clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control, cross-sectional, other observational studies, case studies/series) reporting noma patients of any age up to 7 December 2022. The 366 publications (published between 1839 and 2022) included in our scoping review describe 15 082 patients. Although 53 cohort and 29 cross-sectional studies were identified, enrolling 13 489 patients, interventional research remains extremely limited, with only six studies identified (101 patients, range: 7-26) and only one in the past decade, highlighting a critical gap in treatment evaluation. A total of 380 different treatment modalities were described, which underscores lack of a standardised practice. Disease aetiology remains unclear, with 117 microorganisms reported across 113 studies, yet none more consistently linked to noma development. Since 2000, 91.2% of cases have been reported in Sub-Saharan Africa, though occurrences outside the 'noma belt' and into Asia and the Americas suggest a broader risk. The 212 potential risk factors identified in 269 (73.5%) publications reflect substantial heterogeneity, complicating efforts to determine definitive causative factors. Additionally, the inconsistent definition and reporting of noma staging significantly hinder comparability across studies, with wide adoption of the WHO staging classification needed. This comprehensive review of the literature underscores the urgent need for robust, policy-driven research to address the vast knowledge gaps in the physiopathology of noma and the limited evidence currently available to guide therapeutic and preventive policies. Collective action and increased research investment are crucial, especially now that noma is officially recognised as a neglected tropical disease by the WHO.",

        "title": "Utility of phase angle in children with intestinal failure.",
        "abstract": "Bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived phase angle has been gaining attention in clinical research as a potential biomarker of cell membrane integrity, which may reflect aspects of nutritional status, muscle quality, and overall cellular health. Although phase angle has been associated with various conditions, including malnutrition and reduced strength, it is not currently established as a definitive tool for assessing these outcomes. Rather, it is considered an indirect indicator, with lower values suggesting potential alterations in cell membrane function that may occur in the context of disease or malnutrition. The aims of this study were to 1) compare bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived phase angle in children with intestinal failure to that of healthy literature controls; 2) examine the relationship between phase angle and nutritional status variables in this cohort of children with intestinal failure. Prospective descriptive cross-sectional study in a cohort of children 1-18 years with intestinal failure. Phase angle was calculated from reactance and resistance values derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis measurements as follows: [arctangent (Reactance/Resistance) x 180°/π]. Anthropometric measurements including weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness, and mid-upper arm muscle circumference was calculated. Body composition was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry as part of routine monitoring. Strength and physical activity were assessed by handgrip strength and accelerometry, respectively. Data on subject characteristics were collected. Two-sample t-test was used to compare phase angle of children with intestinal failure to healthy age and sex matched literature controls. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between phase angle and nutritional status variables. Sixty-eight children with intestinal failure, mean age 8.9 ± 4.2 years, 25 dependent on parenteral nutrition were studied. Children with intestinal failure had lower phase angle compared to literature controls (5.0 vs 6.0, p < 0.001). Phase angle scores were found to be significantly associated with mid-upper arm circumference (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.27, p = 0.002), handgrip strength (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, p = 0.003), and mid-upper arm muscle circumference (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.29, p < 0.001). All relationships were positively mediated by age. These findings suggest that phase angle may provide valuable insights into muscle mass and strength aspects of health beyond conventional assessments, but further study is required before incorporating it into clinical practice for assessing children with intestinal failure.",

        "abstract": "The majority of paediatric tuberculosis (TB) cases remain undiagnosed or unreported, with only 55% of the estimated 1.25 million paediatric TB cases reported in 2023. We leveraged the INPUT study to characterise the clinical presentations and factors associated with TB diagnosis and treatment success in children under 5 years in Cameroon and Kenya. We conducted a prospective cohort analysis nested in the INPUT study, implemented from May 2019 to June 2021 to assess the integration of paediatric TB services into child healthcare services. All children presenting in participating health facilities, presumed with TB and eligible to the INPUT study, were enrolled and followed up from diagnosis to treatment initiation and completion. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore factors associated with TB diagnosis. Of the 790 children enrolled in the cohort, 458 (58.0%) were aged <2 years; the most frequent suggestive TB symptoms were cough (76.5%), fever (34.9%), night sweats (21.2%), loss of appetite (33.5%) and fatigue (35.9%). Overall, 157 (19.9%) children were diagnosed with TB disease, including 13/157 (8.3%) bacteriologically confirmed and 84/157 (53.5%) with a chest radiography evocative of TB. In multivariable analysis, living in rural area (aOR 1.9; 95% CI (1.1 to 3.5)), presenting with fever >10 days (aOR 1.8; 95% CI (1.1 to 3.1)), having HIV (aOR 3.9; 95% CI (1.7 to 8.9)), presenting with acute malnutrition (aOR 2.8; 95% CI (1.5 to 5.2)), living with someone coughing in the household for more than 2 weeks (aOR 1.8; 95% CI (1.0 to 3.0)) and presenting with peripheral lymphadenitis (aOR 9.5; 95% CI (4.3 to 20.9)) were significantly associated with TB diagnosis in children under 5 years with signs and symptoms suggestive of TB. All children diagnosed with TB were initiated on treatment; 136 (86.6%) achieved treatment success according to WHO definition. In the context of integrated, decentralised evaluation of paediatric TB in the INPUT study, most TB diagnoses in children under 5 years old were made clinically-radiologically. Decentralised strategies enhancing the clinical diagnosis, including repeated capacitation of clinicians to the use of treatment decision algorithms and increased access to chest radiography, could overcome underdiagnosis of paediatric TB.

        "abstract": "Vitamin D has an immunomodulatory effect on innate and adaptive immunity within the body, which partially explains its links to inflammation-induced epithelial changes seen in asthma. Various evidence suggest a potential link between vitamin D deficiency and asthma control and severity. This study aimed to determine the vitamin D levels in asthmatic children and their association with asthma severity and control. A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted on 72 children with persistent asthma aged 5 to 18 years old in a tertiary hospital in Kelantan. Asthma severity was assessed using the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines based on treatment given. Asthma control was evaluated using both parent/patient self-administered Asthma Control Test (ACT) or Children's Asthma Control Test (c-ACT) scores accordingly to their age and asthma control GINA classification. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were measured, with <52 nmol/L defined as deficient and 52-73 nmol/L as insufficient. Of the 72 children with persistent asthma, 40.3% had vitamin D deficient and 38.9% had vitamin D insufficient with a mean 25(OH)D level of 58.74 nmol/L. Being female, older age group and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with vitamin D deficiency (p =<0.05). Lower vitamin D levels were significantly associated with increased asthma severity (p =0.020). There was no significant association between vitamin D levels and asthma control based on GINA classification (p =0.470) and c-ACT/ACT scores (p =0.052). High prevalence of vitamin D deficient and insufficient was found among children with persistent asthma. Vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with increased asthma severity. This group of children needs further evaluation for intervention. We recommend routine assessments of vitamin D levels among children with moderate to severe asthma.",

HIV might be clustering health conditions among adolescents in India, contributing to suicidal ideation (SI). We used data from a cross-sectional and conveniently sampled study among adolescents (15-19 years) at a tertiary care government hospital conducted between August 2018 and June 2020. Latent class analysis was used to identify syndemic vulnerability for SI according to differential clustering of mental health conditions, malnutrition, food insecurity, and parental loss. A total of 195 adolescents were included in the analysis. SI was reported by 20.51% of the adolescents. Three latent classes of syndemic vulnerability were identified: 1. Low syndemic vulnerability (Class I) 2. Multiple syndemic vulnerability (Class II) 3. Mental health syndemic vulnerability (Class III). HIV status was associated with a five-fold increase in multiple vulnerabilities. Class II and Class III were associated with a nine-fold and eight-fold increase in SI. Mental health syndemic vulnerability was seen to moderate the relationship between HIV status and SI. Findings indicate that syndemic-informed interventions should target mental health screening, treatment, and nutritional intervention at the individual level, food security, and support for parental loss at the societal level among adolescents, including adolescents with HIV.",

        "abstract": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gluten intake in foods and cereals. Weight loss, persistent diarrhea, and starvation are all possible outcomes. A lack of awareness about CD and malnutrition among medical students and healthcare professionals can result in inadequate nutritional guidance and delayed diagnoses, ultimately compromising patient outcomes and treatment adherence. Greater education and training programs for medical students can help alleviate these concerns and enhance patient outcomes. This study aims to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding nutritional deficiencies related to celiac disease among medical students and healthcare providers in Egypt. The secondary outcome is to identify knowledge gaps and potential barriers to effective implementation. This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. The targeted population included students enrolled in any Egyptian medical institution during the academic year 2024-2025, as well as healthcare providers. The questionnaire included sections on demographic information, knowledge about celiac disease and nutritional deficiencies, and attitudes towards nutritional management of celiac disease. Using a convenient sampling method, it was distributed electronically in the English language. A total of 1233 people participated in the study. The median knowledge of celiac disease was 13, indicating that only 11% of individuals had adequate understanding of the condition (8-19). The median knowledge of women and those who lived in cities was higher (p = 0.003 and ←0.001, respectively). Physicians in internal medicine had a greater median level of expertise than pediatricians, indicating a significant difference in specialty among healthcare practitioners (p = 0.01). Only 11.9% of participants demonstrated sufficient understanding of the nutritional inadequacies linked to a gluten-free diet. The median knowledge of women and non-Egyptian individuals was higher (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Different governorate regions had significantly different knowledge medians (p = 0.002), with Delta governorates having a higher median than Greater Cairo (p = 0.004).

A retrospective observational study was conducted using universal sampling from October to December 2023. Data were collected for adult patients receiving PN for more than 48 hours between July 2022 and July 2023 at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz. Among 90 patients included, 30 (33.3%) developed RS. Upon consideration of interaction terms due to collinerity of variables, a statistically significant correlation was observed between pre-existing electrolyte derangements and RS occurrence (p = 0.001). Phosphate levels showed the most significant decline post-PN initiation (43%), followed by potassium (19%) and magnesium (17%), primarily within the first 24 hours. No significant associations were found between BMI, fasting duration, unintentional weight loss, or medication history and RS. However, fasting for more than five days (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 0.4-17.7) and ≥10% unintentional weight loss (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 0.4-7.7) increased the likelihood of RS. RS is prevalent among adult PN patients, predominantly with mild severity. Pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities, especially in phosphate levels, were robust predictors.

        "abstract": "Microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and can have toxic effects on organisms. The effects of microplastics can include food dilution. This occurs when an animal feels full after consuming particles but does not gain nutrition from them. This satiety signal might limit further feeding, resulting in malnutrition. Environmental concentrations of microplastics and food are relevant to the risk of food dilution. The ratio of ingested microplastics to food by volume should determine the degree of food dilution and other toxicity pathways. To examine the possibility of a relationship between food availability and the effects of microplastics on animal health, we used a fully factorial design experiment exposing Daphnia magna to three concentrations of microplastic fragments (none, low, high). We exposed Daphnia to a mixture of three microplastic polymers (polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene) and three levels of food availability (low, medium, high). We found that microplastics negatively affected survival only in the high exposure treatment and that food availability improved survival across all treatments. Higher survival of Daphnia in the high microplastics, high food treatment compared with the high microplastics, medium and low food treatments suggests that the two factors interact additively. Food availability also positively influenced reproduction and growth, whereas microplastic exposure did not. Future studies and the interpretation of past work should closely consider the relationship between food availability and microplastics, as the effect of microplastics on survival appears to be mediated by the abundance of food. Exposures to the same microplastic concentration across different levels of food will produce different experimental outcomes, which will affect the thresholds determined by risk assessments.",

        "abstract": "Micronutrient uptake is impaired after pancreatico-duodenectomy (PD) because of malabsorption, reduced absorptive capacity, and poor oral intake. Biochemical depletion is reported in cohort studies, but deficiency states are predominantly reported in case reports, making it difficult to assess occurrence rates. Although national guidelines recommend monitoring of micronutrients, there are no guidelines on what this should consist of. We undertook a narrative review to explore the incidence of deficiency and make recommendations for clinical management using data from randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case reports. We established that iron, zinc, and vitamin D deficiencies are common. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are rare and occurred in patients who discontinued pancreatic enzymes but are otherwise nutritionally well, whereas trace element and B vitamin deficiencies occurred as part of a more generalized malnutrition state. We make recommendations for identification and treatment of micronutrient deficiencies and recommend routine assessment of iron, zinc, and vitamin D status and bone density in all patients who have undergone curative treatment and take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) or have benign disease. In those with malnutrition or not taking PERT, additional screening for vitamins A, E, and K; selenium; copper; and magnesium should be undertaken. A pragmatic approach should be taken for those with limited long-term survival, with a focus on iron status, as this will impact quality of life.",

        "title": "Research progress on rehabilitation programs for dysphagia in patients with ischemic stroke: A Narrative review.",
        "abstract": "This review aims to explore the various symptoms caused by ischemic stroke and summarize current clinical care and rehabilitation treatment options for post-stroke dysphagia. Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, with the highest prevalence in developing countries. Among them, ischemic stroke is the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of strokes and is the focus of current stroke research. More than one-third of ischemic stroke patients will be affected by post-stroke functional impairments, including but not limited to claudication, upper limb dysfunction, visual impairment, swallowing dysfunction, etc. Swallowing disorders refer to symptoms such as pain, weakness in chewing, prolonged swallowing time, choking when eating or drinking, and coughing due to abnormal function of the swallowing center and motor-sensory pathways and reduced control of the oral and throat muscles. Severe dysphagia will not only affect the patient's nutritional intake and cause malnutrition, but may also cause serious complications such as dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, and suffocation, leading to poor prognosis and even death. Therefore, the care and rehabilitation treatment of such patients have important clinical significance. The treatment strategies integrated in this review provide a variety of approaches for the rehabilitation of patients with post-stroke dysphagia, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine and the necessity of multidisciplinary collaboration. Future studies should establish standardized research designs and evaluation indicators to improve the reproducibility of the research and the reliability of the results, hoping to provide more references for the treatment of swallowing dysfunction and the improvement of subsequent clinical care programs.",

        "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes recurrent oral lesions with reactivation triggered by factors such as stress, hormones, and nutrition. Immune suppression caused by these factors plays an important role in HSV-1 reactivation and requires comprehensive management. This case report aims to analyze the relationship between triggering factors and recurrent HSV-1 infection and to achieve therapy to prevent recurrence. A 39-year-old woman came with recurrent ulcers every month during her menstrual cycle. The results of the anamnesis showed other factors such as malnutrition and stress. Clinical examination showed ulcers on the lips, labial mucosa, and gingiva. A hemogram (complete blood count) examination revealed normal results, IgG anti-HSV-1 with reactive results, and IgM anti-HSV-1 non-reactive. The diagnosis was Herpes Labialis and Recurrent Intraoral Herpes (RIH). Pharmacological therapy was acyclovir cream, chlorine dioxide mouthwash, acyclovir tablets, and vitamins. Non-pharmacological therapy includes improving oral hygiene, stress management (evaluation using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21/DASS-21), and improving nutrition. By the third visit, ulcers on the labial mucosa and lip commissures showed improvement, however, a new ulcer developed on the lower labial mucosa. The use of oral acyclovir tablets, hyaluronic acid gel, and stress management monitored using DASS-21 resulted in complete ulcer healing by the fifth visit. The multifactorial triggers for recurrent HSV-1 infection in this case are stress, hormonal, and nutritional. Pharmacological therapy in the form of acyclovir and chlorhexidine requires comprehensive management that combines antiviral therapy, stress management, and lifestyle changes by improving nutrition to overcome recurrent HSV-1 infections in the future.",

        "abstract": "Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of >10 fluid-filled cysts in the liver. While PLD can occur in isolation, it is most commonly associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, adding complexity to its management. PLD is often asymptomatic but can lead to hepatomegaly, causing symptoms such as abdominal distension, pain and discomfort, early satiety, gastroesophageal reflux, and malnutrition, ultimately affecting patients' quality of life. Current treatment strategies, including pharmacological and interventional approaches, focus on reducing liver volume and alleviating symptoms. However, management remains largely symptomatic, as no definitive therapies exist to halt cyst progression. Liver transplantation is the only curative option for patients with severe, progressive disease and refractory complications. The EASL guidelines recognize that PLD-related symptoms, primarily due to hepatomegaly, can contribute to involuntary weight loss and recommend assessing symptomatic patients for malnutrition and sarcopenia. Although evidence suggests that patients with PLD may be at risk of malnutrition, original data on the quality and extent of nutritional alterations remain scarce. The potential influence of nutrition on disease progression, symptom burden, and overall well-being is also largely unexplored. Given these knowledge gaps, addressing nutritional challenges, such as early satiety, is essential for optimizing symptom management and maintaining overall nutritional status. This review outlines a possible pathophysiology of malnutrition, specific dietary considerations and recommendations, and weight management in patients with PLD. Additionally, dietary complexities in patients with concurrent renal involvement are discussed, offering a practical framework for clinicians and dietitians in managing this challenging condition.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Heart failure (HF) is frequently associated with skeletal muscle wasting, reduced functional capacity, and malnutrition. High-protein diets offer a promising nutritional intervention to improve these outcomes in individuals with HF. <b>Objective:</b> This systematic review evaluated randomized controlled trials of high-protein dietary interventions in HF populations, with emphasis on intervention characteristics, quantitative benefits, and risk of bias. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to June 2025. Eligible studies enrolled adults (≥18 years) with HF, implemented high-protein regimens (≥1.1 g/kg/day or ~25-30% of energy), and reported on functional capacity, body composition, muscle strength, clinical outcomes, or biochemical markers. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted data, and assessed bias (Cochrane RoB 2). Heterogeneity in dosing, duration, and outcomes precluded meta-analysis; we therefore provide a narrative synthesis. <b>Results:</b> Ten trials (nine randomized controlled trials, one pilot) involving 1080 patients (median n = 38; range 21-652) were included. High-protein interventions yielded mean improvements in six-minute walk distance of +32 ± 14 m, lean body mass gain of +1.6 ± 0.9 kg, and 9 ± 4% enhancement in quality-of-life scores; muscle strength effects varied from -2% to +11%. Two studies reported an 18% reduction in HF readmissions (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The risk-of-bias assessment identified two low-risk, three moderate-risk, and one high-risk study. Key limitations include small sample sizes, varied protein dosing (1.1-1.5 g/kg/day), short follow-up (2-6 months), and outcome heterogeneity. <b>Conclusions:</b> High-protein dietary strategies appear to confer modest, clinically relevant gains in functional capacity, nutritional status, and HF readmission risk. Larger, well-powered trials with standardized dosing and longer follow-up are necessary to establish optimal protein targets, long-term efficacy, and safety.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Adequate vitamin D levels are essential for various physiological functions, including cell growth, immune modulation, metabolic regulation, DNA repair, and overall health span. Despite its proven cost-effectiveness, widespread deficiency persists due to inadequate supplementation and limited sunlight exposure. <b>Methods</b>: This systematic review (SR) examines the relationship between vitamin D and the reduction of cancer risk and mortality, and the mechanisms involved in cancer prevention. This SR followed the PRISMA and PICOS guidelines and synthesized evidence from relevant studies. <b>Results</b>: Beyond genomic actions via calcitriol [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D]-receptor interactions, vitamin D exerts cancer-protective effects through mitigating inflammation, autocrine, paracrine, and membrane signaling. The findings reveal a strong inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and the incidence, metastasis, and mortality of several cancer types, including colon, gastric, rectal, breast, endometrial, bladder, esophageal, gallbladder, ovarian, pancreatic, renal, vulvar cancers, and both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. While 25(OH)D levels of around 20 ng/mL suffice for musculoskeletal health, maintaining levels above 40 ng/mL (100 nmol/L: range, 40-80 ng/mL) significantly lowers cancer risks and mortality. <b>Conclusions</b>: While many observational studies support vitamin D's protective role in incidents and deaths from cancer, some recent mega-RCTs have failed to demonstrate this. The latter is primarily due to critical study design flaws, like recruiting vitamin D sufficient subjects, inadequate dosing, short durations, and biased designs in nutrient supplementation studies. Consequently, conclusions from these cannot be relied upon. Well-designed, adequately powered clinical trials using appropriate methodologies, sufficient vitamin D<sub>3</sub> doses, and extended durations consistently demonstrate that proper supplementation significantly reduces cancer risk and markedly lowers cancer mortality.",

This study assessed whether and how different nutritional disorders diagnosed at admission could influence early recovery after hip replacement. <b>Methods</b>: A prospective analytical study was designed to include 60 patients scheduled for elective primary hip replacement and assess their nutritional status to diagnose 5 malnutrition phenotypes: undernutrition, sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and sarcopenic undernutrition. Outcome measures were 24 h change in neutrophils, 72 h change in haemoglobin, and 10-day gait speed regain. <b>Results</b>: Haemoglobin reached the nadir at day 2-3 and partially recovered by day 10 in all patients, with sarcopenia and undernutrition being the strongest predictors of the postoperative drop (-2.37 g∙dL<sup>-1</sup> and -0.80 g∙dL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Neutrophils peaked immediately after surgery and returned to baseline levels at discharge, with sarcopenic undernutrition displaying a blunted response after surgery (-16.20%, <i>p</i> < 0.01).

Accordingly, accurate prediction of energy intake requirements is necessary. This study aimed to estimate the energy intake required to prevent weight loss in residents of Japanese long-term care facilities. Body weight and 12-day dietary intake were measured from residents aged ≥75 years with a body mass index (BMI) < 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who were consuming a regular or chopped diet. In the survey, individuals with oral intake were included, while those with swallowing problems, serious illnesses, dietary restrictions, or medications causing appetite loss were excluded. The rate of body-weight loss and the energy intake per kilogram of body weight (kcal/kg BW) during each 6-month period were calculated. The energy intake per kilogram of body weight corresponding to the rate of body-weight loss of 0% was estimated from the regression line between the rate of body-weight loss and energy intake per kilogram of body weight. The data was analyzed for 99 residents (15 men and 84 women, age 89.3 ± 5.0 years, BMI 20.3 ± 2.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). From the regression results in all participants, the energy intake per kilogram of body weight corresponding to the rate of body-weight loss of 0% was 31.4 kcal/kg BW overall and 33.4 kcal/kg BW for those with a BMI < 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

While ischemic strokes are more common, hemorrhagic strokes have a worse prognosis. TBI often affects young adults and leads to long-term disability. A critical concern in these patients is the frequent development of chronic critical illness, compounded by metabolic disturbances and malnutrition that hinder recovery. <b>Objective</b>: This study aimed to compare changes in nutritional status parameters under standard enteral nutrition protocols and clinical outcomes in prolonged/chronic critically ill patients with TBI or stroke versus such a population of patients without TBI or stroke. <b>Methods</b>: This matched prospective-retrospective cohort study included intensive care unit (ICU) patients with TBI or stroke from the Federal Research and Clinical Center of Intensive Care Medicine and Rehabilitology and patients without these conditions from the eICU-CRD database. Inclusion criteria comprised age 18-74 years, ICU stay >5 days, and enteral nutrition. Patients with re-hospitalization, diabetes, acute organ failure, or incomplete data were excluded. Laboratory values and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index). <b>Results:</b> After PSM, 29 patients with TBI or stroke and 121 without were included. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in 21 laboratory parameters and three hospitalization outcomes. On day 1, the TBI/stroke group had higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, total protein, and albumin, but lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose. By day 20, they had statistically significantly lower calcium, BUN, creatinine, and glucose. This group also showed less change in lymphocytes, calcium, and direct bilirubin. Hospitalization outcomes showed longer mechanical ventilation duration (<i>p</i> = 0.030) and fewer cases of acute kidney injury (<i>p</i> = 0.0220) in the TBI/stroke group. <b>Conclusions:</b> TBI and stroke patients exhibit unique metabolic patterns during prolonged/chronic critical illness, differing significantly from other ICU populations in protein/glucose metabolism and complication rates.

Vitamin D deficiency is an established risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, lower vitamin D serum levels are associated with worse disease outcomes. However, current randomized clinical trials provide conflicting evidence about the beneficial role of vitamin D on disease progression. Most studies have evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical and radiological activity, yet very few have examined the impact on brain atrophy. <b>Methods:</b> A 4-year observational, non-interventional study design was applied to evaluate the association between vitamin D supplementation and disease progression. Altogether, 132 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients were enrolled in the study (97 subjects in the group with vitamin D supplementation and 35 subjects in the group without supplementation). The analyzed groups were similar in terms of age, body mass index, sun exposure, comorbidities, nicotinism, duration of the disease, and current treatment. The number of relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale assessments, and the number of new/enlarged T2-weighted lesions and gadolinium-enhancing lesions in magnetic resonance imagining analyses, as well as 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels, were assessed every 12 months of a 4-year follow-up, whereas brain atrophy was assessed at the baseline and after 36 months using two-dimensional measurements. <b>Results:</b> After 36 months, a significant increase in atrophy was observed in both groups; however, patients without vitamin D supplementation had a significantly higher increase in intercaudate distance, third ventricle width, and bicaudate ratio after 36 months of observation (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

However, current screening tools such as the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) may lack the sensitivity needed to identify those who would benefit most. Muscle quality assessed by Computed Tomography (CT), specifically muscle radiodensity in Hounsfield Units (HUs), has emerged as a promising alternative for risk stratification. <b>Objective</b>: To evaluate the prognostic performance of CT-derived muscle radiodensity in predicting adverse postoperative outcomes in colorectal cancer patients, and to compare it with the performance of the MUST score. <b>Methods</b>: This single-center cross-sectional study included 201 patients with non-metastatic colon cancer undergoing elective laparoscopic resection. Patients were stratified based on enrollment in a multimodal prehabilitation program, either within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol or a non-ERAS pathway. Nutritional status was assessed using MUST, SARC-F questionnaire (strength, assistance with walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs, and falls), and the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. CT scans at the L3 level were analyzed using automated segmentation to extract muscle area and radiodensity. Postoperative complications and hospital stay were compared across nutritional screening tools and CT-derived metrics. <b>Results</b>: MUST shows limited sensitivity (<27%) for predicting complications and prolonged hospitalization.

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic eating disorder with the highest mortality rate among psychiatric conditions. Malnutrition and starvation lead to long-term impairments in metabolic processes, hormonal regulation, and immune function, offering potential diagnostic and prognostic value. This study aimed to identify immune-metabolic-hormonal markers associated with treatment response and nutritional rehabilitation. <b>Methods</b>: Fifty hospitalized female patients with AN were included. Anthropometric measurements and venous blood samples were collected at admission and discharge, following partial nutritional recovery. Blood analyses included complete blood count, serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, triglycerides, glucose, NT-pro-BNP, TSH, free thyroxine (fT4), sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, iron, and vitamin D. Composite immune-inflammatory indices calculated were neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR); neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein (NHR), monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein (MHR), platelet-to-high-density lipoprotein (PHR) and lymphocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein (LHR) ratios; systemic immune-inflammation (SII), and systemic inflammation response (SIRI) indexes. <b>Results</b>: Responders (R) and non-responders (NR) differed significantly at baseline in levels of sodium, chloride, fT4, monocyte count, MCV, NLR, MLR, SII, and SIRI (all: R < NR; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Predictive ability for treatment response was confirmed by AUC values (95%CI): sodium = 0.791 (0.622-0.960), chloride = 0.820 (0.690-0.950), fT4 = 0.781 (0.591-0.972), monocytes = 0.785 (0.643-0.927), MCV = 0.721 (0.549-0.892), NLR = 0.745 (0.578-0.913), MLR = 0.785 (0.643-0.927), SII = 0.736 (0.562-0.911), SIRI = 0.803 (0.671-0.935). The lower levels of inflammation and chloride are particularly predictive of better nutritional recovery, accounting for 26% of the variability in treatment response. <b>Conclusions</b>: The study demonstrated important insights into the hematological, metabolic, hormonal, and immune-inflammatory mechanisms associated with nutritional recovery in AN.",

        "abstract": "Cell membrane capacitance (<i>C<sub>m</sub></i>) is a potential biomarker that reflects the structural and functional integrity of cell membranes. It is essential for physiological processes such as signal transduction, ion transport, and cellular homeostasis. In clinical practice, <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> can be determined using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), a non-invasive technique for analysing the intrinsic electrical properties of biological tissues across a range of frequencies. <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> may be relevant in various clinical fields, where high capacitance is associated with healthy and intact membranes, while low capacitance indicates cellular damage or disease. Despite its promise as a prognostic indicator, several knowledge gaps limit the broader clinical application of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>. These include variability in measurement techniques (e.g., electrode placement, frequency selection), the lack of standardised measurement protocols, uncertainty on how <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> is related to pathology, and the relatively low amount of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> research. By addressing these gaps, <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> may become a valuable tool for examining cellular health, early disease detection, and evaluating treatment efficacy in clinical practice. This review explores the fundamental principles of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> measured with the BIS technique, its mathematical basis and relationship to the biophysical Cole model, and its potential clinical applications. It identifies current gaps in our knowledge and outlines future research directions to enhance the understanding and use of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>.

        "title": "A Decade-Long Case Series Report on the Surgical Management of Complicated Umbilical Hernia in Patients with Decompensated Liver Cirrhosis Utilizing Incisional Negative Pressure Therapy.",
        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>. Umbilical hernia is particularly common among patients with liver cirrhosis, affecting about 20% of this group, compared to 3-8.5% in healthy individuals. This increased prevalence is mainly due to weakened abdominal fascia, elevated intra-abdominal pressure, and malnutrition. The rapid progression of umbilical hernias often leads to complications such as skin necrosis, perforation, and strangulation. Historically, patients with liver cirrhosis and complicated umbilical hernia have faced high morbidity and mortality rates. However, recent advancements in perioperative management, especially in controlling ascites, have improved outcomes in elective treatments. Despite these advancements, managing patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and complicated umbilical hernia in emergency settings remain a significant surgical challenge. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for complicated umbilical hernia at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana from 2015 to 2024, using prospectively collected data. This analysis involved implementing hernioplasty combined with incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) as part of the surgical protocol. The primary endpoint of our study was the rate of local complications, while the secondary endpoints included the rate of systemic complications and 90-day mortality. <i>Results</i>: We treated 28 consecutive patients with complicated umbilical hernia and liver cirrhosis. Local wound complications were observed in three (10.7%) patients. Systemic complications developed in 10 patients (35.7%). The median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (range: 5-29), and no readmissions were recorded within the 30-day period. Two (7.1%) patients died within 90 days. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our experience indicates that iNPWT, when combined with surgical repair, can be safely utilized, yielding outcomes comparable to elective hernia repairs, even in emergency contexts. Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to validate these findings and optimize treatment protocols.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder with diverse subtypes. Recent evidence has suggested a link between vitamin D deficiency and IBS; however, the associations between vitamin D levels, IBS subtypes, and hematological-biochemical parameters remain unclear. The aim of this research was to investigate the associations between vitamin D status, IBS subtypes, and sex, along with their relationships with biochemical and hematological parameters. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This retrospective study included 240 patients diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome IV criteria at Van Yüzüncü Yıl University Medical Faculty Hospital. The patients were classified as diarrhea-predominant (IBS-D), constipation-predominant (IBS-C), or mixed-type (IBS-M). The patients' serum vitamin D levels and hematological (hemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts, and mean corpuscular volume) and biochemical (ferritin, iron, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B12 levels) parameters were evaluated at baseline and after vitamin D supplementation. Sex-related differences were assessed. <i>Results:</i> Baseline vitamin D levels were low in all IBS subtypes, with no significant differences between the groups. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in a significant increase in serum vitamin D levels across all subtypes (<i>p</i> = 0.001). No significant correlations were identified between vitamin D levels and hematological or biochemical parameters. Sex differences in vitamin D levels were only significant in the IBS-M group, both at baseline and post-treatment (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among all IBS subtypes and significantly improves with supplementation, independently of the subtype. Although no associations were found between vitamin D levels and laboratory parameters, the observed sex differences in patients with IBS-M highlight the need for further research into potential sex-related pathophysiological mechanisms. These findings support the integration of routine vitamin D assessment and supplementation into the clinical management of IBS, especially in patients with the IBS-M subtype and female sex, to potentially improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this review is to summarize the prevalence, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatments currently available for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in children. SIBO is a clinical entity characterized by the presence of an excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel leading to several nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms due to malabsorption and malnutrition, such as bloating, flatulence, belching, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, steatorrhea, fatigue and stunted growth. Initially thought to develop specifically in the context of abnormal or postsurgical gastrointestinal anatomy, it has then been recognized that it can be associated with other nonsurgical conditions, such as gastrointestinal dysmotility, disorders of gut-brain interactions and chronic use of drugs. The uncertainty regarding the exact cut-off of excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel has led to the absence of a universally accepted definition of SIBO making well-designed research to assess the best diagnostic and therapeutic approaches challenging. Current available diagnostic tools includes duodenal/jejunal aspirate with culture and hydrogen breath tests, which all have some limitations and pitfalls that prevent accurate sampling. The treatment goal should be to treat the underlying causes, restore the healthy intestinal microflora, relieve the symptoms and address the associated complications. The use of antibiotics represents the treatment cornerstore. However, they are commonly used despite the scarce published evidence and the absence of agreement on the dose and duration of the treatment. Currently, data on best diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in children remain lacking. Novel diagnostic approaches for SIBO are emerging and may facilitate further research.",

Retrospective cross-sectional. National database. Data from the National Inpatient Sample for 712 patients who underwent surgery for Zenker diverticulum 2016 to 2021 were analyzed using multivariate regressions. Frailty was defined as at least 1 frailty-defining diagnosis from the Johns Hopkins ACG® Frailty Indicator. Elixhauser Comorbidity Index was calculated to quantify comorbidity burden. 12.2% of patients were identified as frail, 77.0% of whom had a weight loss or malnutrition diagnosis. Frailty predicted increased length of stay (mean, 4.09 days [95% CI: 2.98-5.20]) and increased costs (mean, $10,500.36 [95% CI: $6885.76-$14,114.95]). Frail patients were more likely to have medical complications compared to non-frail patients (OR = 2.84 [95% CI: 1.66-4.84]). Elixhauser Comorbidity Index was predictive of hospital mortality (OR = 1.78 [95% CI: 1.27-2.51]) and likelihood of endoscopic surgical complications (OR = 1.25 [95% CI: 1.05-1.47]), but frailty was not predictive of either. Frailty is not associated with increased risk of surgical complications or mortality and is not an absolute contraindication to Zenker diverticulum surgery. Frailty predicts length of stay, costs, and medical complications in Zenker diverticulum surgery and should be used with comorbidity to stratify patient risk for surgery.

During the conflict, the health system fragmentation under differing geopolitical control led to unequal access to TB prevention, diagnostics and management social determinants such as poverty, malnutrition, inadequate water and sanitation, and lack of proper shelter, along with risks associated with disadvantaged groups, including internally displaced people, detainees, former detainees, and rural communities, not only increase the risk of TB transmission and the activation of latent infections but also hinder active case finding. Tackling these risks requires re-establishing the National TB Program (NTP) across the country, which acts equitably across all geographical areas to identify new cases, support robust surveillance activities, ensure drug resistance is identified promptly, and monitor treatment. Leadership from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, with support from other stakeholders e.g., humanitarian, civil society or private sector can support the NTP and optimize health worker education and referral pathways.

This commentary aims to provide insight into the study while suggesting a more detailed approach to defining malnutrition, refeeding syndrome, and edema. There are several diagnostic criteria for diagnosing malnutrition, some of which might overlap with the criteria of refeeding syndrome risks. A precise nutritional and hydration status assessment is needed before starting nutritional therapy for patients with restrictive EDs. With the potential occurrence of refeeding edema during the refeeding practice in these individuals, this commentary discusses the available assessment methods to differentiate edema and other conditions that are related to acute body weight gain. Furthermore, this commentary also outlines the potential pathomechanism involved and provides future recommendations for studies and clinical practice. Understanding the pathomechanism of the development of refeeding edema is important to ensure patient safety during refeeding practices in patients with restrictive EDs.

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Prematurely born newborns with low birth weight constitute a group of patients who require special care from the first days of life. Prematurity and low birth weight affect about 13.4 million infants. Risk factors include placental disorders but also factors related to the mother, such as smoking, alcohol drinking, drug use, malnutrition, or certain diseases. It is imperative to educate women of reproductive age (15-49) about the basic factors influencing embryonic development, such as oral health, diet, medicine intake, and harmful habits. Even though most women are aware of the negative impact of harmful habits on the fetus, still too little attention is paid to oral health in pregnant women. Poor oral health may influence the well-being of the future mother, as well as of the child. Therefore, women of reproductive age and those who are pregnant must have adequate knowledge on this subject. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of Polish women of reproductive age (15-49) regarding oral health during pregnancy, including the impact of dental treatment, oral hygiene, and maternal oral conditions on pregnancy outcomes and the health of the newborn. <b>Materials and Methods</b>: This was a cross-sectional study of 508 women, in the reproductive age, whose age ranged from 18 to 49 years old. The surveys were conducted from April 2020 to November 2020. The questionnaire was originally developed based on the available literature and consisted of seven sections: basic information, general health and habits, pregnancy status and dental care, knowledge of treatment options during pregnancy, oral health status and its association with the risk of preterm birth, prematurity and the child's oral health, and breastfeeding and oral development. <b>Results</b>: After excluding incomplete questionnaires, a total of 499 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Women participating in the study had a fairly good understanding of the impact of oral health on the fetus and the role of breastfeeding in the development of the stomatognathic system (from 50% to 70% correct answers). However, even though most respondents had completed higher education (344/68.94%), their knowledge of oral health, preterm birth, and low birth weight was very limited (including the impact of inflammation on the intrauterine development of the child or bacteria and transfer across the placenta). In these sections, the percentage of correct answers ranged from less than 20% to 50%. When analyzing knowledge by age, education, number of births, and place of residence, the highest levels of knowledge were observed among respondents with higher education, particularly those aged 27-32. <b>Conclusions</b>: Respondents had a fairly good understanding of the general impact of oral health during pregnancy and recognition of the importance of breastfeeding for infants. However, their knowledge about the impact of bacteria and inflammation in the mother's oral cavity on prematurity and low birth weight was limited. Therefore, educating women of reproductive age and pregnant women on this topic is essential, as it may help reduce the adverse consequences of prematurity.",

Coronary care units (CCUs) play a pivotal role in the care of patients experiencing acute or decompensated heart failure, offering a highly monitored environment with immediate access to advanced cardiac interventions. The management of heart failure in CCUs involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes hemodynamic monitoring, pharmacologic therapy, respiratory support, and, in selected cases, mechanical circulatory assistance. The early identification of deterioration, rapid therapeutic escalation, and close monitoring of cardiac function are hallmarks of CCU care. However, the complexity and severity of illness in this population are compounded by a high risk of infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and device-related infections. These infections not only increase morbidity and prolong hospitalization but also significantly impact mortality and healthcare costs. The immunocompromised state of many heart failure patients-due to poor perfusion, malnutrition, and the use of invasive devices-further elevates their vulnerability. Effective infection prevention, early diagnosis, and targeted antimicrobial therapy are, therefore, critical components of heart failure management within CCUs. This intersection of advanced cardiac care and infection control highlights the need for integrated, multidisciplinary strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.",

Quality of life scale total score and \"physical well-being\" and \"functional well-being\" subscale scores were significantly lower in patients received ≥4 cycle at the end of treatment (d = 0.590, d = 0.500, d = 0.621, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and 3 months later (d = 0.500, d = 0.516, d = 0.562, respectively; <i>p</i> < 0.05) but improved within 6 months. Significant correlations were found between taste alterations and recent weight loss, affordability of energy requirements, and decreased quality of life. A higher number of adjuvant chemotherapy cycles was associated with greater taste alterations, nutritional challenges and lower quality of life, especially in the early post-treatment. These changes are often transient and tend to return to baseline levels within 3-6 months after treatment.",

        "abstract": "Increasing evidence demonstrates the mutualistic connection between the microbiome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment. Drugs disrupt the microbial balance and, conversely, changes in the microbiome influence therapy. A new field, pharmacomicrobiomics, examines the role of the microbiome in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug toxicity. The multimodal therapeutic management of AML, along with disease-related immunosuppression, infection, and malnutrition, creates the unique microbial profile of AML patients, in which every delicate modification plays a crucial role in pharmacotherapy. While both preclinical and real-world data have confirmed a bilateral connection between standard chemotherapy and the microbiome, the impact of novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy remains unknown. Multi-omics technologies have provided qualitative and mechanistic insights into specific compositional and functional microbial signatures associated with the outcomes of AML therapy, but require a large-scale investigation to draw reliable conclusions. In this review, we outline the role of the microbiome within the therapeutic landscape of AML, focusing on the determinants of post-treatment dysbiosis and its effects on the therapeutic response and toxicity. We explore emerging strategies for microbiota modulation, highlighting their safety and efficacy. Advances in microbiome-based approaches are an inevitable step toward precision medicine in AML. However, clinical research in a well-defined group of immunocompromised patients is needed to study their variable effects on human health and determine safety issues.",

        "abstract": "Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is characterized by insufficient intestinal length to support absorption causing malnutrition. The bowel adapts to SBS via intestinal dilation and delayed gastric emptying but still often requires long-term parenteral nutrition. Current surgical options to lengthen the bowel pose significant risks and often provide limited expansion. 'Distraction enterogenesis' has been proposed as a technique to induce intestinal lengthening for SBS. The deployment of the intestinal expansion sleeve (IES) device is hypothesized to result in significant intestinal lengthening in vivo. A Roux-en-Y was created in the jejunum of seven rats for isolated IES deployment. The IES was precontracted over a Bucatini noodle and inserted into the isolated roux limb. After 4 weeks of deployment, rats were sacrificed, Roux-en-Y length recorded, and histology analyzed. A paired <i>t</i>-test was performed to compare initial and final roux limb lengths and histopathological tissue remodeling. Intestinal distraction evaluated at 4 weeks post deployment of the IES resulted in a significant 30.2% elongation in roux limb length (43.6 ± 14.4 mm to 56.4 ± 20.8 mm (<i>p</i> = 0.043, n = 7). IES samples showed changes in mucosal and submucosal integrity and bowel wall thickness in response to IES lengthening. In samples with partial mucosal erosion, the basal/regenerative layers of the mucosa were preserved. Distraction enterogenesis with significant intestinal lengthening in vivo has been achieved with the IES device. Histologic changes suggest all bowel functional layers and attributes are maintained through distraction enterogenesis. Future constructs of the IES may benefit from the addition of immunomodulators. Increasing intestinal mass with these devices may complement the treatment paradigm for SBS.",

        "abstract": "Cancer treatment itself and particularly chemotherapy unavoidably affects host cells, often producing a variety of side effects, e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever, and further decreases in appetite, physical activity, and body weight. These effects, combined with biochemical and histological injuries to major organ systems, may result in a profound nutritional insufficiency. This study aimed to determine the nutritional status of patients receiving chemotherapy. A prospective study was conducted among 64 adults newly diagnosed cancer patients of various sites, admitted to the Oncology Department at European Gaza Hospital (EGH), and scheduled for the first cycle of chemotherapy. The nutritional status of each patient was assessed using the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and anthropometry before commencing the first cycle of the chemotherapy regimen (pre) and after completing the chemotherapy regimen (post). Additionally, biochemical and dietary intake assessments were also performed. Nutritional status worsened after the completion of a chemotherapy regimen. It has been found that 80.3% of patients suffered from malnutrition (moderate and severe) after the completion of the chemotherapy regimen based on SGA in comparison to 35.9% who were malnourished before commencing the first cycle of chemotherapy. The results reported the presence of a functional vitamin B12 deficiency, such that there is a drastic reduction in serum vitamin B12 levels (355.0(IQR 115.0) to 219.0(IQR 177.0) pg/mL, P < 0.001), accompanied by a significant increase in it is related metabolites methylmalonic acid (MMA) (3.9(IQR 3.0) to 49.7(IQR 32.0) ng/mL, P < 0.001), and homocysteine (Hcy) (3.90(IQR 0.85) to 12.60(IQR 7.05) ng/mL, P < 0.001) after the completion of chemotherapy regimen. Dietary intake in terms of macronutrients and micronutrients changed significantly after the completion of chemotherapy regimen. Cancer patients who received chemotherapy were at risk of malnutrition hence it is a wise practice to conduct thoroughly and deep nutritional assessment for each patient at the baseline, during treatment and after the completion of chemotherapy regimen.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition is a prevalent issue in critically ill elderly patients and is closely linked to poor clinical outcomes. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of four nutritional indices-modified nutrition risk in the critically ill (mNUTRIC), Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)-in predicting intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes. This prospective cohort study included elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) who were admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital. Nutritional indices (mNUTRIC, GNRI, HALP, and NLR) were evaluated for their prognostic value in predicting 28-day mortality, ICU mortality, and ICU length of stay (LOS) using multivariable regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Seventy-three patients were included, with a median age (interquartile range) of 74 (10) years and 56.2% male. The mNUTRIC score was identified as an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (OR = 2.505, 95%CI: 1.164-5.391, p = 0.019) and ICU mortality (OR = 2.736, 95%CI: 1.350-5.545, p = 0.005), with strong predictive performance (AUC: 0.864 and 0.858, respectively). It was also associated with prolonged ICU LOS (RR = 1.117, 95% CI: 1.033-1.207, p = 0.005). While GNRI exhibited good predictive performance (AUC: 0.811 and 0.799 for 28-day mortality and ICU mortality, respectively), it was not an independent factor. In contrast, HALP and NLR showed limited prognostic value for mortality. The mNUTRIC score was identified as the strongest prognostic tool, with GNRI also demonstrating considerable predictive value for mortality outcomes, enhancing nutritional risk screening and clinical decision-making in elderly ICU patients.",

        "abstract": "Adequate nutrition can mitigate side-effects and improve recovery for patients with locally advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer (LAHNSCC), while malnourishment can increase morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the baseline nutritional status of patients with LAHNSCC planned for curative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), the evolution of nutritional status during the course of CRT and to assess whether nutrition impacted their clinical outcomes. This was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a Phase III randomized controlled trial conducted between 2013 and 2017 in 300 patients with LAHNSCC who were randomly assigned to receive either cisplatin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once-a-week or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once-in-3-weeks concurrently with radiation. This analysis included 112 patients for whom nutritional parameters were recorded. Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) forms were used to evaluate malnutrition severity at different treatment stages. Scores on the PG-SGA ranged from 0 to 35, with higher scores denoting greater malnutrition. Scores were grouped, with 0-3 indicating normal to mild malnutrition, and ≥ 4 denoting moderate to severe malnutrition. Baseline scores were compared with subsequent scores and survival outcomes were analyzed. At baseline assessment, 42.8% of patients had normal to mild malnutrition, while 57.1% had moderate to severe malnutrition. There were higher baseline malnutrition rates in women, users of smokeless tobacco, and patients with buccal mucosa tumors. By day 21 of treatment, 44 (56.4%) patients had moderate to severe malnutrition, while 34 (43.6%) had normal nutrition or mild malnutrition. Among those with moderate to severe malnutrition at baseline, 13 (29.5%) patients had an improvement in their nutritional status, while 14 (41.2%) patients with normal to mild nutrition at baseline had deterioration in their nutritional status during the course of CRT. Baseline nutritional status did not significantly impact progression-free, locoregional relapse-free or overall survivals. Pre-treatment nutrition is crucial for managing weight and reducing treatment complications in patients with LAHNSCC. Over 40% of patients with normal baseline nutrition have deterioration of their nutritional status during CRT. We were unable to find any correlation between nutrition and clinical outcomes in patients with LAHNSCC receiving curative CRT. Larger studies are needed to explore the impact of nutrition on treatment outcomes, emphasizing regular dietary assessments and interventions to improve patient compliance.

A total of 173 enteral nutrition patients in the ICU admitted to our hospital from January 2020 to January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into a control group (without RS, n = 128) and an observation group (with RS, n = 45) based on whether they developed RS. The general data such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) of patients were compared. The enteral nutrition-related indexes of two groups such as gastrointestinal decompression before feeding, diuretic application before feeding, and parenteral nutrition were compared. The risk factors of RS in ICU enteral nutrition patients were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Patients in the observation group received targeted nursing strategies according to the risk factors. The levels of serum phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, albumin, and prealbumin were detected before and after nursing intervention. The proportion of age ≥ 60 years, BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, diabetes history, cerebrovascular disease, severe pneumonia, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score > 20, duration of mechanical ventilation ≥ 3 days, NRS 2002 rating high risk in the observation group was much higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group had a much higher proportion of whole protein nutrient solution, nasoenteric tube feeding, protein intake ≥ 1.2 g/kg, feeding speed > 50 ml/h, and enteral nutrition temperature 36-38℃ than the control group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis pointed out that age ≥ 60 years, NRS 2002 score > 5, duration of mechanical ventilation ≥ 3 days, APACHE II score > 20, feeding speed > 50 ml/h, protein intake ≥ 1.2 g/kg, and enteral nutrition temperature 36-38℃ were independent risk factors of enteral nutrition patients complicated with RS in ICU (P < 0.05). After the intervention of targeted nursing strategies, the serum levels of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, albumin, and prealbumin were obviously elevated than before (P < 0.05). Age, NRS 2002 score, mechanical ventilation time, APACHE II score, feeding speed, protein intake, and enteral nutrition temperature are all risk factors of refeeding syndrome in ICU enteral nutrition patients. Targeted nursing intervention according to the influencing factors can effectively improve the efficacy of enteral nutrition and reduce or prevent other complications.",

        "abstract": "Serum albumin (ALB) has traditionally been regarded as a marker of nutritional status. However, recent studies suggest its changes are closely linked to inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and disease severity, limiting its role as a sole indicator of nutritional status. Yet, clinical practice continues to rely on ALB to monitor nutritional interventions, with a paucity of high-quality evidence on its dynamic associations with clinical outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the comprehensive associations of ALB dynamics with inflammation, nutritional status, and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients, providing evidence to optimize clinical management. This secondary analysis utilized data from a prospective observational cohort study conducted in 34 tertiary hospitals across China between June and September 2014. A total of 2959 patients hospitalized for 7-30 days with complete data were included. Standardized protocols were used to collect demographics, nutritional indices (Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, Subjective Global Assessment), hematology, biochemistry results, and clinical outcomes (complications, length of stay, costs). Subgroup analyses were performed based on inflammatory status changes, nutritional therapy administration, department type, baseline nutritional status, and advanced age. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified cutoff values for infection-related complications. Correlation analyses and multivariable linear regression models determined independent predictors of ALB changes. Among 2959 patients, 1894 (64.0%) experienced a decrease in ALB during hospitalization, which significantly impacted primary outcomes, including prolonged length of stay, increased hospitalization costs, and higher complication rates. Significant ALB decline was also strongly associated with worsened nutritional status, weight loss at discharge, exacerbated gastrointestinal symptoms, functional impairments, and edema (P < 0.001 for all). Compared to binary categorization (increase vs. decrease), the magnitude of ALB change demonstrated a stronger correlation with infection-related complications across all subgroups. Subgroup-specific cutoff values stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in infection-related complication rates (P < 0.05), aiding early identification and intervention. Independent predictors of ALB decline included advanced age, surgical status, lower baseline handgrip strength and its change during hospitalization, higher baseline ALB and globulin levels, baseline Prognostic Nutritional Index, baseline inflammatory status and its exacerbation, elevated platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and intensive care unit admission. Dynamic changes in ALB serve as a critical indicator of inflammation-nutrition interplay, with its reduction effectively predicting infection-related complications, clinical outcomes, and nutritional deterioration. This is particularly valuable in older adults, inflammatory-variable, surgical, and non-malnourished patients. The conventional view of ALB as a pure nutritional marker requires revision. Joint monitoring with inflammatory biomarkers and multidisciplinary interventions targeting high-risk populations are recommended.",

Among these, equations based on basic clinical variables-age, sex, height, and weight-are potentially applicable to a broad range of patients. This study aimed to examine the validity of multiple ASM estimation equations in hospitalized older patients by investigating their associations with adverse outcomes, including mortality and functional decline. This study used data from the Japan Hospital Acquired Complications project, a multicenter observational study, and included patients aged ≥65 years. ASM was estimated at admission using four previously reported equations. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) was calculated and classified as low based on predefined cut-off values. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess association between low ASMI, in-hospital or 3-month post-discharge mortality, and in-hospital Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) worsening. A total of 1012 patients (mean age 83.9 ± 6.6 years; 57.4 % female) were analyzed. During hospitalization or within three months after discharge, 109 patients died. Low ASMI, as defined by several equations, was significantly associated with this mortality after adjusting for confounders. Additionally, low ASMI was significantly associated with in-hospital CFS worsening (n = 175), across all equations. Estimated ASM based on clinical information was associated with mortality and worsening frailty. These simple equations are widely applicable for assessing muscle mass and may contribute to facilitating the diagnosis of sarcopenia and malnutrition.",

While intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is widely used to reduce malaria incidence, the potential additional benefits of combining it with lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) remain unclear. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the effects of LNS in combination with IPTp on malaria incidence, maternal nutritional status, and birth outcomes. A comprehensive search of 4 databases-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CENTRAL-and the gray literature via GOOGLE Scholar-was conducted in January 2024, and updated in July 2024. The review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included studies assessing LNS and IPTp for outcomes related to malaria, nutritional status, or birth outcomes. The review identified 17 studies, focused on 5 main trials: 2 with small-quantity LNS (SQ-LNS), 2 with balanced energy-protein (BEP), and 1 trial with large-quantity LNS (LQ-LNS). LNS supplementation did not significantly affect malaria incidence, anemia, or nutritional status. However, some studies reported improvements in birth outcomes, particularly among specific subgroups and those with baseline undernutrition. Variability in study methodologies and supplementation protocols influenced these findings. While LNS and IPTp show potential for improving selected birth outcomes, the evidence for their effect on malaria incidence or maternal anemia remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of LNS and IPTp among vulnerable groups of women in malaria-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with cardiovascular disease. Up to 60% of patients with coronary artery disease and even higher percentages of patients with heart failure (HF) or pulmonary hypertension have ID. However, the evidence for an association between ID including anemia and arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF) is less clear. The prevalence of ID increases with the severity of cardiac and renal dysfunction and would be more common in women. Increased blood loss due to antithrombotic therapy or gastrointestinal or renal disease and insufficient dietary iron intake, reduced iron absorption secondary to low-grade inflammation associated with congestion or reduced gastric acidity may cause ID. Both anemia and ID are associated with poor clinical outcomes, each may confer risk factors independently. There is growing evidence that ID is an important therapeutic target in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), even in the absence of anemia. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose improved symptoms, ID-related quality of life, and exercise capacity and reduced hospitalizations for worsening HF in patients with HFrEF even mildly reduced EF (<50%). ID is easy to treat and effective in patients with HFrEF. These patients should be investigated for possible ID. Malnutrition has also been linked to cardiovascular disease. Both selenium and iron deficiencies have been associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with HF. And selenium deficiency was associated with new-onset AF in nonsmoking participants. Interventional studies investigating the effects of optimizing the micronutrient status in at-risk populations are needed to assess causality, especially in those with ID. These recommendations may be extended to those populations based on evidence from future clinical trials.",

        "title": "Ocular Insights: Exploring Uveitis as a Manifestation of Celiac Disease.",
        "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition that mainly affects the small intestine and often leads to issues with nutrient absorption. People with CD commonly experience symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, stomach pain, fatty stools, unintended weight loss, and low iron levels. In addition to its intestinal manifestations, CD is also associated with a range of extraintestinal features and comorbid conditions. Although uveitis is a rare manifestation of CD, we report, to our knowledge, the first documented case from Pakistan of posterior uveitis secondary to CD in an 11-year-old girl. The patient presented to the OPD with complaints of a gradual, painless loss of vision in both eyes over a four-month period. Notably, she exhibited no associated ocular, GI, or malabsorptive symptoms. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/24 in the right eye and hand movement only in the left eye. Ocular findings included bilateral +1 anterior chamber cells without keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, or iris nodules. The anterior segment inflammation was accompanied by bilateral vitritis, vasculitis, choroiditis, and optic disc atrophy. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to rule out other potential causes of uveitis and to develop a treatment plan. Despite oral and topical corticosteroids, there was no significant control of intraocular inflammation. Immunosuppressive therapy was initiated, but disease progression continued, ultimately resulting in complete vision loss. Typically, children with CD who present with classic symptoms, such as bloating and diarrhea, are promptly diagnosed and treated. However, patients without these hallmark intestinal symptoms may remain undiagnosed, potentially leading to irreversible complications like severe vision loss. This case, along with previous reports in the literature, highlights the importance of considering CD in the differential diagnosis of uveitis, even in the absence of GI symptoms, particularly in patients who are unresponsive to standard steroid therapy and after exclusion of other known causes of uveitis.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition is a common yet frequently underrecognized condition among patients with gastrointestinal cancers, significantly impacting treatment tolerance, postoperative recovery, and long-term outcomes. This narrative review explores the clinical implementation of the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria in gastrointestinal oncology, with a particular focus on its impact on multidisciplinary workflows and the evolving role of clinical dietitians. A structured literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify English-language publications from 2018 to 2025 that included the terms \"GLIM,\" \"malnutrition,\" \"gastrointestinal cancer,\" \"nutritional assessment,\" and \"oncology.\" Fifty-three articles were selected for inclusion based on their relevance to GLIM criteria implementation and interdisciplinary care models in oncologic settings. In clinical practice, the GLIM framework has elevated nutrition care from an ancillary task to a core component of oncology management. The adoption of GLIM criteria encourages interprofessional collaboration, involving surgeons, oncologists, nurses, and dietitians. It also necessitates the use of tools such as bioelectrical impedance analysis and computed tomography to assess muscle mass, as well as laboratory markers of inflammation, further reinforcing the technical competencies required of dietitians. However, barriers remain. Implementation is hindered by limited training, workflow inconsistencies, time constraints, and disparities in access to diagnostic tools, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, institutional variability and lack of integration into reimbursement systems pose systemic challenges. To support sustainable adoption, many institutions have established structured referral pathways, interdisciplinary training initiatives, and electronic health record algorithms for GLIM-based assessment. These efforts are crucial for overcoming barriers and standardizing care. Furthermore, GLIM-based protocols have improved patient engagement and empowered patients to participate more actively in their nutritional care, especially through the use of standardized tools like the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment. Looking forward, further research is needed to validate simplified diagnostic methods, improve equity in access, and assess long-term impacts on survival and quality of life. Policy reforms, including the recognition of GLIM-based malnutrition in coding systems, could enhance institutional incentives for implementation. Ultimately, the GLIM criteria provide not only a diagnostic tool but also a foundational framework for advancing equitable, interdisciplinary, and patient-centered nutrition care in oncology.",

        "abstract": "Wasting is one of the most concerning growth and development issues in India, as in other parts of the world. Such children require carefully calibrated nutrition, together with management of co-morbidities. Both community and facility-based management are available for addressing the problem. Nutrition rehabilitation centres (NRCs) have been set up at health facilities in many districts to provide interventional measures to those malnourished children who require facility-based care. However, effective management of a case at the facility level with limited resources is always a challenge. To assess the service availability and readiness of facility-based management of children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in an NRC of Jorhat, and to identify the opportunities and barriers to facility-based management of SAM children. A descriptive (exploratory) qualitative study was done in the NRC of Jorhat for a period of six months, including six key informants and 12 caregivers. The data were collected through key informant interviews (KIIs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) using semi-structured KII and IDI guides, as well as an observation guide to collect data on facility readiness, which was done by both observation and interview methods. Thematic analysis was done through inductive coding. The facility had a deficiency of helper/attendant and medical social worker (MSW) and lacked resuscitation and suction equipment. No separate sleeping arrangements were present for the caregivers. Other than these, sufficient ward equipment, kitchen, and pharmacy supplies were present. The major opportunities observed were the support from the medical college administration and the district health administration. The strength was a functioning NRC with dedicated staff. The major challenges from the facility side were a shortage of supporting staff and a shortage of some emergency equipment. From the beneficiary side, the major challenges were long duration of stay, financial loss, and poor nutritional awareness. The present study has highlighted various challenges, both from the healthcare provider and beneficiary side, involving diverse areas such as human resources, financial issues, essential supplies, workload, nutritional awareness, and time constraints. However, all the beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with the services in the NRC.",

        "abstract": "Frailty is common among older patients with cancer and may influence treatment outcomes. This study evaluated frailty prevalence and its association with unplanned hospitalizations in adult cancer patients. We prospectively included 2,081 patients with newly diagnosed cancer from three medical centers in Taiwan (2018-2022) who were scheduled to undergo cancer treatment. Frailty was assessed using a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 7 days before treatment initiation. Patients were categorized as fit, pre-frail, or frail to assess the impact on 90-day unplanned hospitalization. The prevalence of fit, pre-frail, and frail patients was 16.7%, 32.2%, and 51.0%, respectively. Frailty was associated with older age, unmarried status, lower education, unemployment, poor ECOG performance status, cancer site, and advanced stage (all p < 0.001). Core contributors to frailty across cancer sites included malnutrition, comorbidity, and polypharmacy. Functional impairment was prominent in patients with gastrointestinal, hematologic, and genitourinary cancers, while cognitive impairment was notable in those with genitourinary cancers. Unplanned hospitalization rates were highest in the frail group (41.5%), followed by pre-frail (34.4%) and fit (25.9%) patients. Frailty remained independently associated with unplanned hospitalizations after adjustment: pre-frail (adjusted OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.06-1.94; p = 0.018) and frail (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.55-2.76; p < 0.001). Frailty was prevalent and significantly associated with increased risk of unplanned hospitalization. These findings support the integration of frailty screening in routine oncology care to guide clinical decisions for vulnerable cancer patients.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining optimal nutrition is often an important concern for persons with cystic fibrosis (PWCF). With the introduction of effective modulators, the focus has now shifted from preventing malnourishment to instead stabilizing weight and preventing further weight gain. Research on how PWCF experience and manage their nutrition in this new era remains limited. The Exploring Attitudes Toward Nutrition (EATN) study employed a qualitative, multi-site approach to conduct semi-structured interviews with 44 adults living with CF. These interviews explored participants' definitions of \"good\" nutrition, the facilitators that help support their diet and lifestyle, and the barriers they face. Thematic analysis was used to identify key barriers and facilitators across personal, social, and healthcare-related domains. Interviews revealed PWCF defined nutrition in a multitude of ways, from 'a means to achieve optimal health,' to categorizing foods as \"good\" or \"bad.\" Key facilitators for maintaining good nutrition included support from registered dietitian/CF care teams, convenience, physical activity, social support, and observations of weight stabilization after elexacaftor/tezacaftor /ivacaftor (ETI). Conversely, barriers included lack of convenience or time, gastrointestinal symptoms, sick days/ hospitalization, negative dietitian/care team member experiences, finances, and the impact of medications or enzymes. Understanding these supports and challenges is essential for developing effective and personalized nutritional strategies for PWCF. Enhancing access to knowledgeable dietitians, simplifying nutritional recommendations, and addressing cost barriers can significantly improve nutritional outcomes. Future research should focus on applicable solutions that utilize existing successful strategies while addressing common barriers many with CF face.",

It typically affects individuals aged >50 years and can lead to severe complications, including protein-losing enteropathy, chronic diarrhea, and malnutrition, if not diagnosed early. We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented with a 2-month history of diarrhea, weight loss, and hair loss. Endoscopic and histopathological examinations revealed diffuse polyposis throughout the gastrointestinal tract, consistent with CCS findings. The patient was treated with a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, which led to marked clinical and endoscopic improvements. No recurrence was observed during 1 year of follow-up period. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the typical clinical and diagnostic features of CCS. Owing to its nonspecific presentation, diagnosis may be delayed, potentially worsening the prognosis. Therefore, CCS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of middle-aged or older patients who present with multiple gastrointestinal polyps accompanied by ectodermal symptoms. Early recognition and appropriate immunosuppressive therapy are essential for improving patient outcomes and preventing complications. Long-term surveillance is necessary because of the potential for polyp recurrence or malignant transformation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) and Artery of Percheron (AOP) infarction share overlapping presentations, including mental status changes, ocular-motor signs, and similar thalamic MRI findings; but require distinct time-sensitive treatment, making prompt differentiation critical. WE results from thiamine deficiency, often due to alcohol use, causing oxidative damage in highly metabolically active brain regions. In contrast, an AOP infarction results from thrombotic occlusion of a rare perforating artery. The aim of this case report is to delineate the similarities and differences between WE and AOP infarction and to underscore the importance of early empiric thiamine replacement. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old man presented with altered mental status, fever, and generalized weakness. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) showed cerebellar hypoattenuation, prompting activation of a code stroke. The lesion was later deemed artifactual, and he was admitted for further evaluation. The following morning, the patient's condition acutely changed, with new oculomotor abnormalities and worsening right lower extremity weakness. An urgent brain MRI demonstrated symmetric hyperintensities in the medial thalami. Uncertain whether the lesions represented an AOP infarction or WE, the team ordered a serum thiamine analysis, which returned low. Intravenous thiamine was initiated, resulting in rapid clinical improvement, and confirming WE as the final diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS WE can closely mimic AOP infarction both on clinical presentation and on radiologic appearance. High-dose thiamine is a low-risk, potentially lifesaving intervention, particularly when initial CT imaging is nondiagnostic and further imaging is pending. Empiric thiamine administration is especially warranted if MRI shows bilateral thalamic lesions of uncertain etiology.",

        "abstract": "Modern cancer therapy is effective at reducing tumor burden and extending lifespan. However, cancer therapy also induces various gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that are dose-limiting, reduce quality of life, and potentially lead to treatment failure. Standard medical nutrition therapy for patients undergoing cancer treatment focuses on preventing weight loss and malnutrition but not reducing GI symptoms. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess efficacy of nutrition therapy to reduce GI side-effects during cancer treatment via systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search was conducted in Scopus and PubMed databases. A meta-analysis was performed on articles meeting inclusion criteria to estimate the pooled effect size on GI symptoms, separated by nutrition intervention type (nutrient supplementation, oral nutrition supplement, or dietary counseling). Further Subgroup analyses were conducted based on cancer type, cancer therapy, and nutrient intervention. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata/MP version 17.0 using 2-sided tests with p < 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance. 15,556 articles were captured by the search algorithm, and 139 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Articles reported 12 different GI symptoms, resulting in 151 total meta-analyses across symptom, cancer treatment, and nutrition intervention subtypes. Meta analyses indicated that collectively (all interventions combined), nutrient supplementation reduced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea incidence (all p < 0.001). Oral nutrition supplements had no effects on GI symptoms (all p > 0.05). Dietary counseling reduced constipation and diarrhea incidence. While 9 individual nutrient supplementation interventions reduced 8 symptoms, probiotic supplementation had some of the strongest effects on abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea incidence. This meta-analysis supports implementation of specific medical nutrition therapies to treat GI symptoms during cancer therapy and identifies those requiring additional investigation. Given the large variation in responses within and across studies, future experiments should explore personalized nutrition-based strategies to optimize treatment efficacy.

The serum creatinine/albumin ratio (CAR), a marker of renal dysfunction and malnutrition, has shown prognostic value in other critical illnesses but remains underexplored in HF patients. This retrospective cohort study included 1,893 HF patients hospitalized at the Fourth People's Hospital of Zigong, China, between December 2016 and June 2019. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between CAR and 28-day mortality. Dose-response relationship was assessed using restricted cubic spline analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated survival differences, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated CAR's predictive performance. Patients with CAR ≥ 3.5 were older, had worse cardiac function, and had more comorbidities than those with CAR < 3.5.A linear relationship was observed between CAR and 28-day mortality. Each 1-unit increase in CAR was associated with a 14% higher mortality risk (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.21, <i>p</i> < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that CAR had an AUC of 77.1%, which was slightly higher than creatinine alone (76.2%) and markedly better than BNP (68.0%) and albumin alone (64.9%).

The Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) is widely used for dysphagia screening; however, its reliability in advanced AD, where cognitive impairments hinder self-reporting, remains uncertain.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EAT-10 in detecting dysphagia and aspiration across different AD stages.MethodsThe study included 30 AD patients classified into mild, moderate, and advanced stages based on Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Dysphagia was assessed using EAT-10 and validated through Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) and the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). Statistical analyses included the Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (p < 0.05).ResultsEAT-10 scores significantly differed across AD stages (p = 0.001), with mean scores of 3.11 ± 1.17 (mild), 11.70 ± 4.64 (moderate), and 18.00 ± 6.90 (advanced). Unsafe swallowing and aspiration were observed in 43.3% and 23.3% of patients, respectively, with higher prevalence in advanced AD. ROC analysis determined an EAT-10 cut-off score of 15 for unsafe swallowing (AUC: 0.96, sensitivity: 88%, specificity: 77%) and 18 for aspiration (AUC: 0.81, sensitivity: 81.2%, specificity: 75%). Strong correlations were found between EAT-10 and PAS scores (r = 0.812, p < 0.001).ConclusionsEAT-10 is an effective screening tool for dysphagia and aspiration risk in early and moderate AD stages.

In June 2022, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published advice, stating that low vitamin B12 is now considered to be a common side effect. It advises checking levels in patients with symptoms of B12 deficiency, as well as monitoring those at risk of B12 deficiency.Despite efforts to promote evidence-based practice, there is still a gap in the translation of research findings into policies and clinical practice. The above research has been shared widely in the academic and specialist diabetes literature over a prolonged period. The purpose of the scoping review is to explore what evidence is available regarding clinicians' awareness of the association between metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, how this evidence is implemented into frontline clinical practice and what screening processes are recommended or exist. This is a protocol for a scoping review to be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews 20. The databases to be searched will include MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed), British Nursing Index, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (accessed via EBSCO), alongside searching for grey literature such as Electronic Theses Online Service (EThOS), DART European and Kings College London Research Portal. Titles and abstracts of articles will be reviewed by the authors. If articles are representative of the inclusion criteria, the articles will go through a full-text review by the authors. The results of the search and study inclusion/exclusion process will be reported and presented in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses flow diagram. Data will be extracted from papers, using the recommended JBI data extraction tool. The search will commence in August 2025, and the review is expected to be completed by November 2025.The search will commence in August 2025, and the review is expected to be completed by November 2025. As this is a scoping review protocol that did not involve any human participants, human data or human tissue, no ethical approval was required. Our dissemination strategy includes peer review publication, presentation at conferences and with relevant stakeholders.",

        "title": "Association Between Taste Disorders and Malnutrition in Older Adults: A Scoping Review.",
        "abstract": "Taste disorders and malnutrition are both age-related conditions that, individually, may have negative consequences but which are also probably associated with each other, making the consequences even worse. This scoping review was performed to systematically map and synthesize the existing evidence on the association between taste disorders and malnutrition in older adults. Four electronic literature databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched. Title and abstract screening as well as full-text screening was performed by 2 authors independently. Studies of older adults (aged ≥65 years) in diverse settings that described the association between taste disorders and malnutrition were included based on the Population Concept Context framework. A standardized data extraction template enabled the recording of information about general study characteristics, methods used to assess taste disorders and malnutrition, and estimates of associations. The literature search yielded 1060 results; after an update search, 40 articles were included in this scoping review. Most of these studies were performed in acute care (50%) or community settings (32.5%). Most applied subjective methods alone to assess taste (47.5%) and used different combinations of parameters to assess malnutrition (67.5%). Most of the studies that applied subjective methods found associations between taste disorders and nutritional intake, and malnutrition risk and unintentional weight loss. Studies that used objective methods to assess taste were only occasionally able to detect an association between taste and malnutrition parameters. Our results suggest subjective and objective assessments may capture different aspects of taste dysfunction. Research in this field is important to increase in-depth knowledge about the complex associations between taste disorders and malnutrition parameters. A greater awareness of the relevance of taste disorders in clinical practice is warranted and may lead to improvements in the identification and subsequent treatment of these disorders.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition and frailty are common, with rates increasing as kidney disease progresses and with ageing. Conservative kidney management has emerged as a kidney failure treatment that prioritises quality of life and symptom management, typically offered to the elderly. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and impact of frailty and malnutrition on hospitalisations, quality of life and mortality in people with kidney failure. This two-year longitudinal study recruited people choosing conservative kidney management and, as a comparator group, people aged 75 years and over who were commenced on dialysis. Participants underwent assessment of frailty, nutritional status and quality of life every 6 months. Hospitalisation and death data were extracted from medical records. A total of 85 participants were recruited (n = 60 conservative kidney management, n = 25 dialysis). At baseline, 56% were assessed as frail and 33% as malnourished. In the total cohort, frailty was associated with a higher rate of hospitalisations, and longer hospital stays. These associations appeared to be driven by the dialysis group, as no differences in hospitalisation rates or length of stay were observed in the conservative kidney management group based on frailty status. In the conservative kidney management group, frailty was not associated with mortality (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.71-2.84; p = 0.3), however, being malnourished was associated with reduced 2-year survival (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.13-3.90; p = 0.024). Frailty and malnutrition are common, resulting in adverse outcomes in elderly conservative kidney management and dialysis populations. Nutrition is a key intervention in both frailty and malnutrition, with clinical trials needed to evaluate safe and effective interventions.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive frailty can lead to an impaired functional capacity and a poor quality of life, especially in patients on hemodialysis. This study aimed to investigate cognitive frailty and its risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis. A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and June 2021 involving 220 patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis at a hospital-based hemodialysis center in northern Taiwan. Data were collected using a structured survey covering demographics, cognitive function, physical frailty, depressive symptoms, physical activity, and nutritional status. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for cognitive frailty. In total, 220 patients were recruited. Prevalences of cognitive impairment, physical frailty, depressive symptoms, and cognitive frailty were 46.8%, 10.0%, 52.3%, and 9%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, and years of hemodialysis, identified malnutrition (aOR = 12.405; 95% CI = 3.29-46.81) and physical inactivity (aOR = 89.445; 95% CI = 5.87-1363.93) as significant risk factors for cognitive frailty. The study suggests the need for strategies to enhance physical activity and nutritional status to prevent cognitive frailty in patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis.",

        "title": "Correlation Between Postoperative Complications and Serum Albumin Levels in Abdominal Surgery: A Prospective Observational Study.",
        "abstract": "Background Hypoalbuminemia is a widely recognized marker of malnutrition and systemic inflammation. Its association with postoperative complications is increasingly emphasized in surgical risk stratification, particularly in abdominal procedures. However, limited prospective data from Indian populations exist to validate its predictive utility in routine clinical practice. Objective This study aimed yo assess the correlation between preoperative serum albumin levels and the incidence of postoperative complications in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted over a nine-month period at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna. A total of 69 patients undergoing elective or emergency abdominal surgery were enrolled. Preoperative serum albumin levels were measured within 24 hours prior to surgery, and patients were categorized into hypoalbuminemic (<3.5 g/dL) and normoalbuminemic (≥3.5 g/dL) groups. Postoperative complications, duration of hospital stay, and relevant demographic and clinical variables were recorded. Statistical analyses included Chi-square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and multivariate logistic regression. Results Among 69 patients, 45 (65.2%) were hypoalbuminemic. Postoperative complications were significantly more frequent in the hypoalbuminemic group, with 26 patients (57.8%) experiencing complications compared to only three of 24 patients (12.5%) in the normoalbuminemic group (p < 0.001). The mean hospital stay was also significantly longer in hypoalbuminemic patients (10.1 ± 2.9 days vs. 6.9 ± 2.0 days; p < 0.0001; Cohen's d = 1.32). Multivariate logistic regression identified hypoalbuminemia (OR = 12.68; 95% CI: 3.01-53.53; p = 0.001) and surgery duration (p = 0.045) as independent predictors of postoperative complications, while age and comorbidity status were not statistically significant. Conclusion Preoperative hypoalbuminemia is a strong and independent predictor of postoperative complications and prolonged hospitalization in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Serum albumin should be routinely evaluated as part of preoperative assessment to guide perioperative planning and optimize outcomes.",

Malnutrition is a common and under-recognized comorbidity in COPD, impacting muscle function, immune response, and disease progression. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on 150 COPD patients at a tertiary care hospital in Chennai. Nutritional status was assessed using body mass index (BMI), mid-arm circumference (MAC), and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores. COPD severity was graded according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2025 criteria. Results A significant positive correlation was observed between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)% predicted and nutritional markers (BMI: r = 0.41, MNA: r = 0.45, MAC: r = 0.38, all p < 0.001). As COPD severity increased, nutritional status declined significantly. Comorbidities, including hypertension and depression, were more common in advanced COPD. Conclusion Nutritional status strongly correlates with COPD severity. Early nutritional assessment and targeted interventions are essential in COPD management to improve outcomes.",

        "abstract": "While vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is implicated in both asthma and osteoporosis, the synergistic mechanisms linking these comorbidities remain unexplored. This study introduces a novel murine model of VDD-induced concurrent asthma and osteoporosis, uniquely addressing their bidirectional exacerbation through NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and oxidative stress crosstalk. Female C57 mice were stratified into control, bronchial asthma (BA), osteoporosis (OP), BA+OP, and VDD+BA+OP groups, with therapeutic evaluation of low-dose (LD) and high-dose (HD) vitamin D supplementation. Unlike prior studies, our results demonstrate that VDD amplifies airway resistance and bone microstructural deterioration via NLRP3-driven pyroptosis (elevated cleaved caspase-1, N-terminal gasdermin D and suppressed antioxidant defenses (reduced glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and elevated malondialdehyde). Critically, HD supplementation reversed these effects more robustly than LD, restoring pulmonary compliance, trabecular integrity (bone volume/total volume: 0.0298 vs 0.0356 in VDD+BA+OP), and suppressing inflammasome activity. Mechanistically, we identify a feedforward loop wherein VDD-induced oxidative stress primes NLRP3 activation, which further exacerbates inflammation and bone resorption-a pathway uniquely mitigated by HD vitamin D. These findings provide the first evidence of HD vitamin D's dual therapeutic efficacy in comorbid asthma-osteoporosis, offering a paradigm shift in targeting the NLRP3/oxidative stress axis for managing multifactorial inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "This single-center study conducted in Turkey aims to assess the impact of preoperative nutritional status based on global leadership initiative on malnutrition criteria on 30-day postoperative surgical outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent PD. Patients were classified into 2 groups based on preoperative nutritional assessments of global leadership initiative on malnutrition criteria: malnourished (n = 23; 46%) and nonmalnourished (n = 27; 54%). Preoperative data, including demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative data, final pathological results, and postoperative 30-day outcomes, including overall and major (Clavien-Dindo > II) complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), and 30-day mortality rates, were recorded and compared. A total of 50 patients were included in the study. Demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, and comorbidities were similar between the groups (P > .05). The mean Clavien-Dindo grade was 3 in the malnourished group and 2 in the nonmalnourished group (P = .001). Malnourished patients had a significantly higher rate of major complications (73.9%) compared to nonmalnourished patients (14.8%)(P = .001). The median LOS was similar between the 2 groups. The rate of postoperative transfusions was higher in the malnourished group (P = .033). Postoperative 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the malnourished group (26.1%) compared to the nonmalnourished group (0%) (P = .006). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that malnutrition was an independent predictor of postoperative major complications (OR: 16.3, 95% CI: 3.9-66.8, P = .001). Preoperative malnutrition is a strong predictor of 30-day postoperative major complications and mortality following PD in patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.",

        "title": "Neuroprotective role of pyrroloquinoline quinone in folate deficiency-induced blood-brain barrier disruption.",
        "abstract": "Healthy neurodevelopment requires adequate folates (vitamin B9), which are critical for key biosynthetic and homeostatic processes in the central nervous system (CNS). In the brain, folate transport is mediated by three major pathways: folate receptor alpha (FRα), proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), and reduced folate carrier (RFC). Folate uptake primarily occurs at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) by concerted actions of FRα and PCFT. Alterations in this transport pathway can result in cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), a rare but devastating pediatric condition associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Recent findings highlight the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as an alternative route for folate delivery, particularly through RFC upregulation. We hypothesized that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an activator of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and PGC-1α, key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, could enhance RFC expression at the BBB and mitigate CFD-induced damage. Using in vitro and in vivo models of folate deficiency, we investigated its impact on BBB integrity, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and assessed PQQ's ability to reverse these effects. Human brain microvessel endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) cultured in control folate-sufficient (FS) or folate-deficient (FD) medium were treated with PQQ (1 or 5 µM) or vehicle control for 24 h. Wildtype (C57BL6/N) mice received FD (0 mg/kg folate), or FS (2 mg/kg folate) diet and underwent a 10-day (20 mg/kg/day, i.p) PQQ treatment. Following treatment, hCMEC/D3 cells and isolated mouse brain capillaries were analyzed using qPCR, ELISA, and immunoblotting to assess gene and protein expression of tight junction proteins, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, mitochondrial transcription factors, and folate transporters. BBB permeability was evaluated in vivo using the sodium fluorescein (NaFl) assay. FD significantly increased the gene and/or protein expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, endothelial adhesion molecules and oxidative stress markers, while tight junction proteins were significantly downregulated both in vitro and in vivo. The NaFl assay confirmed increased BBB permeability in FD mice. PQQ treatment effectively reversed these changes by upregulating RFC and PCFT expression, restoring BBB permeability, mitigating inflammatory and oxidative stress responses and improving mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α/NRF-1 signaling. These results highlight the impact of brain FD on BBB integrity, potentially contributing to neurological deficits seen in CFD disorders with PQQ providing a promising therapeutic strategy.",

However, it remains unclear how early changes in muscle mass after the initiation of PD affects the clinical outcome. This study aimed to identify factors influencing changes in lean tissue mass (LTM) over six months in new PD patients and to assess their prognostic significance. We conducted a study of 90 new PD patients. Over a six-month period, we recorded changes in LTM and adipose tissue mass (ATM) using bioimpedance spectrometry. Outcome measures included patient and technique survival rates. After 6 months of PD, body weight and body mass index remained unchanged, but 42 patients (46.7%) had decrease in LTM for ≥ 1 kg. The percentage of LTM (LTMp) also dropped from 63.4 ± 13.6% to 61.5 ± 13.4% (p = 0.006), accompanied by an increase in ATM. Multiple linear regression models showed a strong correlation between changes in LTM and ATM; for every 1 kg increase in ATM, there was a 1.01 kg decrease in LTM (95% confidence interval: 0.797 to 0.855, p < 0.0001). However, the change in LTM during the first six months of PD was not associated with patient or technique survival rates. Although the overall body weight was static, there was a trend of reduction in LTM and a concommitant increase in ATM during the first 6 months of PD. However, these changes were not associated with adverse clinical outcome.",

        "abstract": "Mammary gland epithelial dysfunction is one of the serious consequences of subchronic dietary vitamin A deficiency (VAD). However, the underlying mechanism of this process is incompletely known. Consequently, we utilized a virgin rat model of dietary VAD (3 and 6 months) and subsequently intervened with a vitamin A sufficient (VAS) diet (0.5 or 1 month) prior to treatment completion. This experimental model allowed us to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of mammary gland tissue dysfunction caused by VAD. Dietary VAD for 3 and 6 months caused increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the mammary gland parenchyma and glandular cells, with increased inflammation and apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. These changes can be reversed with a VAS diet. Imbalances between the NF-κB and retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathways underlie mammary gland dysfunction following subchronic VAD. Nulliparous rats fed a VAD diet experience mammary gland epithelial dysfunction because of inflammation, apoptosis, and impaired cell growth.",

        "abstract": "Acute Radiation Enteritis (ARE) is a common complication of pelvic radiotherapy, with incidence rates exceeding 60% in older adult populations. Especially, grade ≥2 ARE can lead to treatment interruptions, malnutrition, and even septic shock, thereby impairing patients' quality of life and survival outcomes. However, existing risk prediction models are predominantly developed based on younger populations or mixed cohorts, lacking sophisticated evaluation tools tailored to older adult patients. To establish a predictive nomogram for grade ≥2 ARE in older adult cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, a retrospective cohort study of 251 older adult cervical cancer patients who received pelvic radiotherapy between January 2018 and March 2024 was conducted. Independent risk factors identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression were incorporated into a nomogram. The model performance was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The incidence of grade ≥2 ARE in our cohort was 61.35%. Independent risk factors included age (OR = 1.881, 95%CI: 1.015-3.484), hypertension (OR = 4.577, 95%CI: 2.402-8.720), diabetes (OR = 5.503, 95%CI: 2.206-13.726), Dmean_R (OR = 1.309, 95%CI: 1.155-1.483), and lactate dehydrogenase-to-albumin ratio (LAR), (OR = 1.872, 95%CI: 1.381-2.538). The nomogram exhibited strong discriminative ability (0.825, 95% CI: 0.774-0.877), and excellent calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, <i>p</i> = 0.744). This nomogram integrates both clinical and dosimetric parameters to enable precise risk stratification for grade ≥2 ARE in older adult cervical cancer patients, facilitating personalized prevention strategies and optimized treatment planning.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability and burden worldwide. Recent studies have highlighted the link between undernutrition and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke, indicating that undernutrition may directly affect stroke severity. However, the extent to which nutritional status at stroke onset influences stroke severity remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between undernutrition on admission and stroke severity in patients with acute stroke. This retrospective cross-sectional study included hospitalised patients with acute stroke. Nutritional status was determined using the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Multiple linear regression analyses identified covariates associated with NIHSS scores, including GLIM-defined undernutrition and risk of undernutrition according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form and the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index. This study included 563 patients with acute stroke (median age, 81 years). Those with GLIM-defined undernutrition had high NIHSS scores. Multiple regression analysis revealed that GLIM-defined undernutrition (β = 0.136, <i>p</i> = 0.002), risk of undernutrition according to the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (β = 0.160, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and risk of undernutrition according to the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (β = 0.081, <i>p</i> = 0.043) were independently associated with increased NIHSS scores. The presence or risk of undernutrition at the time of hospital admission is associated with severe stroke in patients with acute stroke. This finding indicates the necessity for further research to understand the impact of nutrition on stroke severity and develop effective prevention strategies.",

This encephalopathy is typically suspected in alcoholics adults, but it is important to remember that other less known and suspected causes can determine the development of the non-alcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy. In non-alcoholic patients, the primary causes of Wernicke's encephalopathy include hyperemesis gravidarum, restrictive diets and malnutrition, cancer, post-operative complications following bariatric surgery. Few data are reported regarding non-alcoholic thiamine deficiency, especially within the paediatric population. We describe the case of an 11-year-old Caucasian male with obesity who experienced prolonged emesis after the beginning of a strictly hypocaloric dietary regimen. This resulted in biliary colic episodes and subsequent necessity for cholecystectomy. The day after surgery, the patient developed acute visual impairment, horizontal nystagmus and diplopia, which were attributed to thiamine deficiency. Wernicke's encephalopathy was suspected, so a blood sample was immediately collected to assay thiamine levels and empiric thiamine supplementation was started. Already from the day after the beginning of the treatment, the patient showed a significant improvement in his clinical conditions. This case study delineates clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of our patient and provides information regarding the red-flag risk factors of non-alcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy in children. The aim is to increase the likelihood of suspecting the diagnosis and to promptly start the therapy, which is both simple and lifesaving.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of malnutrition in patients undergoing abdominal surgery exceeds 50%, and postoperative nutritional support is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols highlight early nutrition support, their impact on different nutritional strategies remains unclear. This study assessed the effects and safety of enteral nutrition (EN), early-supplemental parenteral nutrition (E-SPN), late-supplemental parenteral nutrition (L-SPN), and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through network meta-analysis. Three databases were searched to obtain randomized controlled trials involving four interventions for postoperative nutritional supportive therapy in abdominal surgical patients. We used The Cochrane Handbook tool (2.0) to assess the risk bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the occurrence of postoperative adverse events. Network meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14. A total of 48 studies involving 6277 patients were included. Network meta-analysis showed that compared with other nutritional therapy E-SPN was likely more effective than other modalities in terms of reduction of postoperative adverse events (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.81-5.02), infectious adverse events (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.59-6.15), non-infectious adverse events (OR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.14-5.34), shortening the resumption of exhaust time (SMD = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.59-1.36), and improvement of serum albumin (SMD = -2.74, 95% CI: -4.98-0.50). The final surface under the cumulative ranking curve value indicated that E-SPN achieved the best effect in those outcomes. The obtained results support using E-SPN in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, which might reduce adverse events, shorten recovery time, and improve patient outcomes. However, since serum albumin is primarily an inflammatory marker rather than a direct indicator of nutritional status, its role in evaluating SPN benefits should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to assess SPN's effectiveness in patients undergoing surgery according to an ERAS protocol.",

Evidence-based guidelines recommend screening for malnutrition and sarcopenia to prevent associated adverse consequences, including reduced survival. This study aimed to describe awareness and perceptions of nutrition-related issues and practices in ovarian cancer among Australian healthcare professionals. A national survey was completed between November 2023 and March 2024. The 24-item survey evaluated awareness and perceptions of nutrition-related issues, screening and referral practices for malnutrition and sarcopenia at specific timepoints (from diagnosis, during, and/or post-treatment) and barriers to nutrition care in ovarian cancer. Professionals (n = 57) were predominantly nurses (39%), dietitians (23%), or surgeons (19%). The most reported nutrition-related issues at diagnosis were weight loss (67%), overweight/obesity (54%), and sarcopenia (44%). During treatment, weight loss (70%) and sarcopenia (65%) were prominent, while post-treatment, weight gain (46%) and sarcopenia (39%) were most reported. The perceived clinical importance of malnutrition and sarcopenia varied according to professional discipline. Professionals identified chemotherapy as the treatment with the highest nutrition risk (97%), and 75% reported observing self-initiated dietary changes during treatment, yet 18% indicated their health services did not screen for nutrition risk, and 58% did not screen for sarcopenia. Key barriers were lack of established processes for sarcopenia screening (75%), limited dietetic services (60%), and lack of specific referral pathways (58%). The perceived importance of malnutrition and sarcopenia in ovarian cancer varies according to professional discipline despite robust evidence of the importance to clinical outcomes.",

Clinical examination revealed a systolic murmur, and echocardiography identified sterile vegetations on the mitral valve. Blood cultures were negative, and further evaluation ruled out malignancy and autoimmune disease, leading to a diagnosis of NBTE likely precipitated by profound malnutrition. The patient was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation, cautious nutritional rehabilitation, and intensive psychiatric support. Over a four-week hospitalization, she showed significant improvement in nutritional status and resolution of vegetations on follow-up imaging.

Although classically associated with chronic alcohol misuse, it may also occur in non-alcoholic individuals due to causes such as persistent vomiting, malnutrition, or gastrointestinal disorders. We present a rare case of WE in a 35-year-old woman who developed internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), a highly unusual manifestation in this context. She presented with a one-week history of blurred and double vision, gait unsteadiness, and persistent bilious vomiting, resulting in significant weight loss. Neurological examination revealed right INO with preserved convergence, positive Romberg's sign, and gait ataxia. Imaging revealed fibrous dysplasia of the left temporal bone, but no intracranial abnormalities were suggestive of WE. Based on clinical findings, a clinical diagnosis of WE secondary to persistent vomiting was made. Prompt intravenous thiamine led to a rapid resolution of symptoms. This case underscores the importance of early recognition of atypical WE manifestations, even in the absence of classic imaging findings.

This retrospective study included 191 patients with localized bronchiectasis treated at our center between January 2013 and November 2023. The optimal cutoff value for ALI was determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative complications. A nomogram was constructed based on the independent risk factors. The predictive performance of the nomogram model was evaluated using calibration curve, and its accuracy was assessed via the ROC curve. The optimal ALI cutoff value was 43.1. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that ALI [odds ratio (OR): 3.006; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.351-6.686; P=0.007], low body mass index (BMI) (OR: 0.868; 95% CI: 0.760-0.992; P=0.04), and operation time (OR: 1.010; 95% CI: 1.002-1.018; P=0.02) were independent risk factors for postoperative complications. A nomogram incorporating these factors was developed, showing good predictive performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.776.

This study explored behaviors about decision-making of ANH in hospice patients and their family caregivers, aiming to identify the trajectory and influencing factors of the decision. This study employed constructivist grounded theory. Using purposive and theoretical sampling methods, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 hospice patients and family caregivers in three Grade IIIA hospitals in Mainland China. Thematic analysis involved initial coding, focused coding, and theoretical coding to develop main categories and core categories. This study identified a core category, alongside two main categories. A framework titled \"The decision-making process of ANH for hospice patients and family caregivers\" was developed. This decision-making began with the detection of malnutrition and progressed through five core stages, including \"symptom shock\", \"risk trade-offs\", \"goal formation\", \"final decision\", and \"moral distress\". Multiple individual, medical, and social factors influenced the final decision-making process of ANH. Through the framework, this study can enhance health care providers' understanding of the decision-making process and also can aid in tailoring support to align treatment choices with patients' preferences. The study highlights the interplay between emotional and rational aspects in decision-making of ANH and emphasizes the need for health care providers to recognize individual, medical, and social factors. These findings can enhance the decision-making experience of hospice patients and family caregivers, ultimately improving the quality of hospice care.",

This study aims to assess the association of a conditional cash transfer programme (<i>Bolsa Família</i> Program (BFP)) with child nutrition nationwide in Brazil. We used the Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health Birth Cohort (baseline data from the National Registry for Social Programmes (CadÚnico) linked with live births and nutrition registries) to conduct a longitudinal population-based study between 2008 and 2015. This cohort study followed children from birth until 5 years old between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015. Children exposed were those who received the BFP benefit at any time during follow-up and were compared with those who never received it. Malnutrition outcomes were assessed using height-for-age, weight-for-height and body mass index-for-age z-scores classified according to WHO cut-offs. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions and kernel-based matching were performed. Subgroup analyses considered maternal education and urban/rural areas of residence. Our cohort included 3 116 138 children born in Brazil between 2008 and 2015. BFP participation was associated with a 17% lower chance of stunting (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.85). Additionally, BFP was associated with a 19% higher chance of wasting (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.22). The protective association with stunting was more pronounced in children from less-educated mothers (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81) and those living in rural areas (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.81). BFP participation was associated with higher overweight/obesity among children from mothers with 8 or more years of education and living in urban areas, while those with 3 or fewer years of education and living in rural areas experienced protective effects. Our findings suggest a complex relationship between BFP participation and child malnutrition outcomes. The study underscores BFP participation's benefits in child nutritional outcomes, emphasising the programme's potential to reduce stunting in all children and to reduce overweight/obesity in the most vulnerable ones. However, BFP was also associated with an increased risk of overweight/obesity, which may be a consequence of overlapping stages of Brazil's rapid nutrition transition, a scenario that contributes to the double burden of malnutrition. Further research is needed to understand this finding better.",

        "abstract": "Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a rare but recognized manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). As an initial presentation of SLE, PLE is exceptionally uncommon, particularly in pediatric patients. We report the case of a 15-year-old Vietnamese girl with no significant past medical or family history, who presented with PLE as the initial manifestation of SLE. Clinical features included bilateral eyelid and lower extremity edema, ascites, and hypoalbuminemia, in the absence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, hepatic dysfunction, or malnutrition. Stool α1-antitrypsin concentration was markedly elevated at >231 mg/dL (normal <26.8 mg/dL), supporting the diagnosis of PLE in conjunction with clinical features and therapeutic response. Immunological evaluation revealed positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, and lupus anticoagulant, hypocomplementemia, along with proteinuria equivalent to >0.5 g/24 h, fulfilling the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE. The patient also developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Treatment with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, and warfarin resulted in significant clinical improvement. At 7 months of follow-up, she remained clinically stable, with normalized serum albumin levels and resolution of thrombosis. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing PLE as an initial symptom of SLE in resource-limited settings. Heightened awareness of this rare presentation can facilitate early diagnosis and optimal management, improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is gaining importance among patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). We assessed whether the BACES score reflects HRQOL and associated factors in these patients. Data were collected from the nationwide NTM-KOREA prospective cohort of patients with NTM-PD who started antibiotic treatment and included symptoms, Quality of Life-Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) questionnaire, nutritional status using the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) and Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), physical activity, body composition, spirometry, handgrip strength, and 6-min walking distance. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were used for analysis. As the BACES score increased, so did the odds (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) of cough (1.24 [1.04-1.48]), dyspnea (1.69 [1.28-2.27]), weight loss (1.78 [1.36-2.36]), and malnutrition, defined as MNA-SF score ≤ 7 (1.71 [1.21-2.45]), and PNI < 45 (2.14 [1.66-2.81]). The QOL-B respiratory symptom score (estimate: -2.259, P = 0.002) and 6-min walking distance (estimate: -18.015, P < 0.001) were negatively associated with the BACES score. Moreover, the odds of adipopenia (1.08 [1.03-1.13]), possible sarcopenia (1.80 [1.35-2.45]), and sarcopenia (2.09 [1.48-3.03]) increased in women.

        "abstract": "Proteins are essential biomolecules that play indispensable roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating systemic metabolic processes. Protein deficiency is closely associated with age-related chronic diseases. Our purpose is to reveal the reason of protein deficiency in the elderly and potential treatments. A systematic literature search mainly on human studies addressing gastrointestinal aging and amino acid homeostasis was conducted. This review investigated the effects of aging on protein metabolism and summarized age-related physiological changes that collectively disrupt protein homeostasis. These changes include reduced secretion of gastric acid and digestive enzymes, which impair protein digestion in the stomach and small intestine. Weakened intestinal motility further delays the transit of digested proteins, reducing the efficiency of amino acid absorption. Additionally, decreased function of amino acid transporter proteins in the intestines and muscles limits the availability of amino acids for protein synthesis. Impaired liver and kidney function exacerbates these issues by affecting amino acid catabolism and clearance. Together, these alterations lead to an imbalance in amino acid homeostasis, contributing to protein deficiency, increasing the risk of sarcopenia in the elderly. Overall, we highlight changes in protein digestion, absorption, and amino acid metabolism in the elderly, and gives the possibility of improving amino acid utilization efficiency in the elderly, paving the way for new treatments for age-related protein deficiency in the future.",

        "abstract": "Growing evidence demonstrates that the immunoregulatory properties of vitamin D are primarily mediated by its active hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol). This secosteroid modulates immune homeostasis through three principal mechanisms: (1) strengthening antimicrobial defense via innate immune potentiation, (2) downregulating pathological inflammatory cascades, and (3) fine-tuning adaptive immunity through lymphocyte differentiation control. Clinically, serum concentrations of the inactive precursor, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), exhibit an inverse correlation with systemic immune activation and the prevalence/severity of dermatological conditions, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and systemic sclerosis. Suboptimal 25(OH)D3 levels are thus recognized as a modifiable risk factor for such disorders, with vitamin D3 supplementation demonstrating therapeutic potential in improving clinical outcomes. Furthermore, prolonged vitamin D3 supplementation may reduce disease incidence across a spectrum of dermatopathologies. This review synthesizes contemporary mechanistic and clinical insights into vitamin D's immunoregulatory role in cutaneous diseases. To optimize therapeutic efficacy, future clinical trials should incorporate analysis of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms as a predictive biomarker in vitamin D3 intervention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Social frailty and malnutrition are considered major health issues in community-dwelling older adults undergoing rehabilitation. This study aimed to examine the relationship between social frailty and malnutrition among community-dwelling older adults undergoing rehabilitation. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study. The study included older adults requiring Level 1 or 2 support who were undergoing rehabilitation within the Long-Term Care (LTC) system at three facilities between April 2022 and December 2023. This observational study assessed calf circumference, 5-m walking speed, and Timed Up and Go performance. Physical and social frailty were assessed using the Japanese version of Fried's Cardiovascular Health Study criteria, which incorporates Makizako's five-item questionnaire. Malnutrition was evaluated according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic criteria. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the independent association between each assessment and undernutrition. In total, 211 older participants (median age: 81 years) were included in the study. Physical and social frailties were present in 29.3 % (62 cases) and 58.7 % (124 cases) of participants, respectively. In the crude model, social frailty was significantly associated with malnutrition (OR (odds ratio) = 2.42, 95%CI (confidential interval): 1.15-5.11, p = 0.020; E-value = 1.57). In the adjusted model, both physical frailty (adjusted OR = 1.18, 95 % CI: 1.03-3.31, p = 0.038) and social frailty (adjusted OR = 2.55, 95 % CI 1.22-5.34, p = 0.013) were independently associated with GLIM criteria for malnutrition. This study demonstrates that social frailty is significantly associated with malnutrition. Notably, this is the first study to suggest that social frailty may contribute to malnutrition in older adults. These findings highlight the importance of assessing social frailty in older adults undergoing rehabilitation in LTC settings.",

        "abstract": "Vitamin D (VitD) plays an important role in immune modulation. VitD deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to acute respiratory syndrome as observed in COVID-19. We evaluated potential associations between serum VitD levels and risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalisation, within the overall and cancer populations. We performed a nested case-control study within the UK biobank cohort, among all individuals with at least one serum VitD level measurement at baseline (2006-2010) and a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results recorded, and individuals with previous cancer diagnosis. Binary multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess associations between VitD levels and risk of COVID-19 infection (positive PCR), and hospitalisation (COVID-19-positive PCR in hospital), and stratified by ethnicity. Of 151,543 participants, 21,396 tested positive for COVID-19. Of 24,400 individuals with cancer, 2,608 tested positive. In the total cohort, VitD insufficiency (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0.97, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.94-1.00) and deficiency (aOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.90-0.99) were associated with slightly lower odds of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, both VitD insufficiency (aOR 1.19, 95%CI 1.08-1.31) and deficiency (aOR 1.36, 95%CI 1.19-1.56) were associated with higher odds of COVID-19 hospitalisation. Among Asian (aOR 1.50; 95%CI 1.08-2.07) and Black (aOR 1.57; 95%CI 1.14-2.16) participants, VitD deficiency was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 infection. Among White participants, VitD insufficiency was associated with slightly lower odds of COVID-19 infection (aOR 0.97; 95%CI 0.86-0.95), while both VitD insufficiency (aOR 1.19; 95%CI 1.08-1.32) and deficiency (aOR 1.44; 95%CI 1.25-1.66) were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation. In the cancer population, vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher odds of infection only among Black participants (aOR 3.50; 95%CI 1.22-10.01); no other associations were observed. Low VitD levels were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation but showed only a weak association with infection risk. Black and Asian populations had higher infection risk associated with VitD deficiency, but this did not translate to increased hospitalisation. In contrast, White populations with low VitD levels exhibited a higher risk of hospitalisation. There was no evidence of an interaction between VitD levels and ethnicity affecting infection or hospitalisation risk. In the cancer cohort, no significant associations were observed for COVID-19 infection or hospitalisation.",

        "abstract": "The development of novel formulations to promote an accelerated wound healing process is an important need in medicine. Yerba mate (YM) (Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil.) exhibits significant biological activities, and we here developed a YM-based formulation (YMF), combining a natural and polyphenol-rich YM extract with a mixture of amino acids and vitamins, and assessed its healing effect in undernourished rats in comparison to normonourished rats subjected to excisional wounds. Two full-thickness wounds were performed when the weight difference between the normal and undernourished groups reached 30%-35%, and then the diet of both the undernourished control undernourished treated groups was changed to a normal nutritional condition. The treatment consisted of supplying rats with YMF (15 mL/100 g body weight/day) in replacement of drinking water from 7 days before surgery until the end of these studies. Wound closure analysis revealed a progressive increase in wound contraction in undernourished rats treated with YMF until an advanced stage of healing as compared to control animals. Histology showed a higher total score with better angiogenesis and inflammation scores in YMF-treated animals (p < 0.01). Some hematological and biochemical variables were significantly correlated with the nutrition and YMF treatment. Besides, the body weight of animals did not change during the treatment, with the exception of day 12 after surgery, when this parameter was higher in the undernourished treated group than in the undernourished control group (p < 0.05). Taken together, the new YMF improved the healing of excisional wounds in a preclinical animal model and could be considered a nutraceutical for the treatment of nutritionally affected patients with complex wounds. Practical Application: This work has revealed the potential of the new yerba mate-based formulation (YMF) for improving the healing wound in an animal model of undernutrition subjected to surgery. Although we used a single YMF dose selected from preclinical-clinical safety and efficacy studies in diverse therapeutic scenarios, YMF can be considered a nutraceutical for the treatment of nutritionally affected patients undergoing surgery with complex wounds. Further clinical testing to confirm efficacy, optimal dosing, and specific therapeutic window of application is needed.",

However, it is unclear which specific body composition is the determining factor affecting the bioavailability of vitamin D after supplementation. The aim of this study was to determine which body components affect the bioavailability of vitamin D. In order to ensure the compliance of the study subjects and avoid the impact of sunlight on vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels, the subjects received multiple intramuscular (i.m.) injections of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> until their serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were above 30 ng/mL. All subjects received two i.m. injections of 600,000 IU vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, and dose adjustments were made every 6 weeks based on whether serum 25(OH)D levels were sufficient. The levels of serum 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and corrected using body fat mass index (FMI). Based on the 100% difference in 25(OH)D levels before and after vitamin D supplementation, the sample size was calculated, and 20 subjects would provide over 95% of the power to show the difference. After two dose adjustment, the serum 25(OH)D levels of all subjects were above 30 ng/mL. The subjects were divided into ≤ 1,200,000 IU vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (<i>n</i>=10) and ≥ 2,400,000 IU vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (<i>n</i>=15) based on the i.m. dose of vitamin D<sub>2</sub>. The results showed that compared with subjects receiving ≤ 1,200,000 IU vitamin D<sub>2</sub>, subjects receiving ≥ 2,400,000 IU of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> had a higher total body fat mass index (FMI), particularly with higher trunk fat content and high visceral adipose tissue mass. However, the dosage of vitamin D<sub>2</sub> supplementation was not related to BMI and lean mass content. The body fat content, especially trunk fat content, is the main body component that affects the bioavailability of vitamin D in healthy adults. Healthy adults with high trunk fat content have low bioavailability of vitamin D and require relatively high dose of vitamin D to achieve sufficient levels. http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2300070641.",

        "abstract": "Steatotic liver disease (SLD) may be caused by cardiometabolic risk factors, drugs/toxins, viral hepatitis, genetic diseases, malnutrition, or panhypopituitarism. SLD can advance to steatohepatitis with resulting lipid accumulation, inflammation, and hepatocellular damage. SLD is associated with pituitary dysfunction, in particular growth hormone deficiency, as insulin resistance leads to lipid buildup and oxidative stress. Growth hormone replacement may improve liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients with hypopituitarism. We report a case of a 20-year-old man who was referred to Hepatology with abnormal liver enzymes. He had panhypopituitarism from a resected pituitary mass, for which he was treated with levothyroxine, hydrocortisone, growth hormone, and testosterone. He presented with elevated liver enzymes, normal liver function, obesity, dyslipidemia, and had no extrahepatic manifestations of chronic liver disease. Work-up for secondary causes of liver disease, including infectious, autoimmune, drug-induced, and genetic causes, were negative. An abdominal ultrasound revealed moderate hepatic steatosis with mild hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. His liver enzymes remained elevated, and his biochemical liver function remained normal despite withdrawal of hepatotoxic medications. Liver biopsy showed grade II/III steatohepatitis with stage III-IV fibrosis. The biopsy results suggested that panhypopituitarism, with growth hormone deficiency and related metabolic dysfunction, caused his liver disease. This is a unique case of an aggressive form of SLD due to panhypopituitarism, and treating growth hormone deficiency with hormone replacement did not improve liver enzymes or liver damage. Physicians should recognize SLD as a serious complication of panhypopituitarism and resulting growth hormone deficiency and follow patients closely given the risk of disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Disease-related malnutrition in hospitalized adult medical patients is a syndrome associated with substantially higher morbidity, disability, both short- and long-term mortality, delayed recovery, and increased healthcare costs compared to individuals without malnutrition. Research on malnutrition has aimed to translate existing knowledge of its pathophysiology into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize current evidence on the use of biomarkers to individualize nutritional therapy. There is particular interest in developing nutritional interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of disease-related malnutrition within hospital environments. Recent high-quality randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that nutritional therapy significantly reduces morbidity and other complications associated with malnutrition in selected patient populations. Additionally, there is growing evidence that phenotyping patients through assessing nutritional biomarkers or adapted risk screening scores may enhance our ability to characterize them in terms of prognosis and likelihood of treatment response. Currently, several promising biomarkers have been identified, including markers of inflammation (e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)), indicators of chronic disease (e.g., creatinine, prealbumin, albumin, and red cell distribution width), measures of muscle health (e.g., hand grip strength and CT scan results), endocrine and exocrine markers, estimates of catabolism as well as emerging metabolomic indicators. While the clinical use of individual biomarkers requires careful assessment, machine learning and artificial intelligence show promise for improving the analysis and interpretation of existing data in the near future. It is crucial to use biomarkers to distinguish etiology at an individual level when implementing nutritional treatment interventions. The key challenge ahead is to determine the most effective way to incorporate these biomarkers into established assessment tools, optimizing personalized nutritional care for patients with malnutrition.",

        "abstract": "Interventions addressing malnutrition (under- and overnutrition) among adolescents have not been developed in The Gambia. We aim to coproduce the first phase of 'The Health-Secure Partnership' (HSP) - an innovative multicomponent intervention for adolescents in rural areas of The Gambia. Inference drawn from existing evidence and public contribution suggest that the future intervention would ideally involve nutrition-specific components coupled with changes to wider school and community contexts, delivered in partnerships between schools and local communities. The design of HSP is underpinned by health promoting school and community centred approaches, informed by a systems-thinking lens. The project activities will be conducted in three linked stages. Stage 1: Current nutrition-related activities and environments will be observed in four rural Gambian schools, their local village communities, and one additional village which does not have a school. Around 50 key stakeholders (such as teachers, parents, community members, and wider systems stakeholders) will complete questionnaires on their views on the current nutrition-related context and systems, cultural norms, and actions needed to address adolescent malnutrition. Focus groups and interviews will then be conducted with approximately 70 adolescent girls and boys to understand their experiences and opinions about their intervention needs. Stage 2: Potential intervention components, session content and mode/s of delivery will be explored in meetings and workshops with the consortium and stakeholders (including adolescents) to achieve consensus on the intervention format. Examples of session content, and intervention resources will be made, and a community event held to see what the public think of the ideas and materials. Stage 3: A description of the intervention and a codesigned evaluation plan will be documented. Dissemination will include publications, presentations, song and drama to suit a range of audiences (adolescents and their communities, other stakeholders, academics, and policy makers). This study protocol presents our plans for the HSP intervention development project, addressing a critical gap in the evidence base. Findings will inform subsequent research phases exploring the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among adolescents.",

        "abstract": "Low levels of the enzyme ADAMTS13 and elevated inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with worse outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). IL-6 produced by leukaemia cells suppresses ADAMTS13 activity and impairs hematopoietic differentiation. Vitamin D, which has known for its immunomodulatory effects, may reduce IL-6 levels. This study investigated the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IL-6 and ADAMTS13 levels in patients newly diagnosed with AML. A total of 38 newly diagnosed AML patients and 14 healthy individuals were included. IL-6 and ADAMTS13 levels were measured in both groups at baseline. Among AML patients, 34 were found to have vitamin D deficiency. Seventeen of these patients received oral vitamin D supplementation for 28 days in addition to their standard chemotherapy. Serum levels of IL-6, ADAMTS13 and vitamin D were measured on the 1st and 28th days of chemotherapy. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Spearman correlation. AML patients had significantly higher IL-6 (7.19 vs. 1.15 pg/mL; p = 0.00001) and lower ADAMTS13 (684 vs. 1205 ng/mL; p = 0.001) compared to controls. ADAMTS13 significantly increased by Day 28 (p = 0.0001), while IL-6 showed no overall change. However, among vitamin D-deficient patients receiving supplementation, IL-6 levels decreased significantly by Day 28 (p = 0.049). A negative correlation was found between vitamin D and IL-6 on Day 28 (r = -0.485; p = 0.035). No significant effect of vitamin D status was observed on ADAMTS13 levels. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in IL-6 levels, but did not influence ADAMTS13 levels in patients with AML. These findings support the potential role of vitamin D as an adjunct anti-inflammatory agent during induction chemotherapy. Further studies with larger samples and longer follow-up are recommended to clarify its therapeutic relevance.

        "title": "Medicinal plants: nutritional, immunological and therapeutic role in treating cancer-related malnutrition: a comprehensive review.",
        "abstract": "Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, following microbial infection, with an estimated 16 million deaths projected by 2040. However, natural resources can potentially treat up to 60% of cancer cases. Various cancers, including those affecting the breast, prostate, stomach, colon, lung, liver, kidney, bone, skin, and blood, have strong dietary connections regarding their occurrence and prevention. Cancer and its treatments, particularly chemotherapy, are closely associated with malnutrition in humans. The adverse effects of medical therapies and the disease itself often prevent patients with cancer from meeting their nutritional needs through regular food intake. The etiology of malnutrition in patients with cancer is complex and multifactorial, influenced by the type and location of cancer, disease stage, side effects of treatment, economic status, functional capacity, symptoms impacting nutrition, fasting requirements, inadequate dietary therapy, and awareness of the clinical staff regarding the role of dietary habits in diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life. Although there have been advances in drug-targeted therapies, they remain unelucidated, and therefore, this review aims to elucidate the relationship between cancer, chemical treatments, and malnutrition. In addition, it highlights the significant role of medicinal plants in treating various cancers and mitigating the adverse side effects of chemotherapy, offering a comprehensive understanding of their nutritional, immunological, and therapeutic benefits.",

        "title": "Preoperative nutrition status in children with congenital heart disease and its impact on postoperative outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Despite the significant advancement in congenital heart disease (CHD) surgery over the years, the mortality and morbidity rate in children undergoing CHD surgery is substantial, especially in lower-middle-income countries. Evidence shows that malnutrition contributes to morbidity and mortality in these children, with a negative impact on their surgical outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the impact of preoperative nutritional status on postoperative outcomes among patients with CHD. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, ProQuest, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 2000, to Mar 1, 2024. Twenty-one studies were included in the review with 22,621 malnourished and 60,402 well-nourished children undergoing CHD surgery. Malnourished children had a significantly longer LOS in the hospital, with a standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.49 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.88] days, a longer ICU stay (SMD 0.51 [95% CI 0.16-0.86] days), a higher RACHS-1/STAT score (SMD 1.72 [95% CI 1.32-2.25]), and a higher mechanical ventilation time (SMD 0.46 [95% CI 0.18-0.74] hours). However, there was no significant difference in mortality, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.82 [95% CI 0.94-3.5], and postoperative infection rates (OR 1.27 [95% CI 0.05-35.02]) between the malnourished and well-nourished groups. Malnourished children undergoing CHD surgery experience significantly worse postoperative outcomes in terms of hospital and ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation time. Efforts to improve preoperative nutritional status could potentially enhance these outcomes.",
