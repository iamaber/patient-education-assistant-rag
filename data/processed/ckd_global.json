        "abstract": "We report the perioperative management of a 67-year-old woman with recurrent renal cell carcinoma (RCC) complicated by complete inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction, confirmed intraoperatively, who underwent en bloc resection of the tumor and involved segment of the IVC. Significant anesthetic challenges included stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD), intraoperative hemodynamic instability related to tumor manipulation, and the need to anticipate potential physiological effects of IVC clamping and unclamping. A multimodal anesthetic strategy including general anesthesia, bilateral rectus sheath block, invasive monitoring, and individualized fluid and vasopressor therapy allowed for responsive management of hemodynamic fluctuations. Postoperatively, the patient had an uncomplicated recovery in the intensive care unit. This report highlights the importance of meticulous perioperative planning, intraoperative adaptability, and multidisciplinary coordination in managing complex and evolving oncovascular scenarios.",

        "title": "Immunoadsorption as a Rescue Therapy for Very High Anti-B Titer in ABO-Incompatible Kidney Transplantation.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND ABO-incompatible (ABOi) kidney transplantation has been performed for several years, with the understanding that elevated antibody titers against the donor blood group are associated with a heightened risk of antibody-mediated rejection. The primary strategy for managing ABOi transplantation involves desensitization through antibody removal and the administration of rituximab. Effective methods for antibody removal include plasmapheresis, double filtration plasmapheresis, and immunoadsorption, using specialized absorbent columns. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old woman with end-stage kidney disease who received an ABO-incompatible (B to O) kidney allograft from her husband. Her initial anti-B antibody titer was 1: 2048 (by gel column-agglutination). During the pre-conditioning phase, sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) combined with rituximab failed to reduce the anti-B antibody titer below 1: 512, and a bleeding complication occurred as a result of DFPP. Subsequently, a rescue approach involving specific anti-B antibody immunoadsorption was implemented, achieving an anti-B titer of 1: 32 on the day of the operation. The living donor kidney transplantation was performed successfully without significant complications. CONCLUSIONS We present the first case using immunoadsorption as a rescue therapy for DFPP-resistant anti-B titers prior to ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. Among the available antibody removal protocols, immunoadsorption has demonstrated favorable outcomes. This technique can be performed over extended durations to accommodate larger plasma volumes while minimizing the risk of bleeding complications, making it an effective rescue strategy for cases that are resistant to traditional apheresis methods.",

        "abstract": "As the epidemiology of infective endocarditis (IE) evolves, updated antimicrobial management assessments are needed. This study aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics, causative microorganisms, and antibiotic susceptibility of patients with healthcare-associated (HAIE) and community-acquired infective endocarditis (CAIE), as well as identify risk factors for 28-day mortality. The findings are intended to guide the treatment of both HAIE and CAIE. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 131 IE patients treated at Kocaeli University Hospital from December 2016 to December 2022. Data were extracted from hospital records and patients were classified into HAIE and CAIE groups. Comparative analyses were performed between the groups, and risk factors for 28-day mortality in IE patients were determined. Among the 131 patients, 51.9% had CAIE and 48.1% had HAIE. Predisposing factors were present in 85.5% of cases, with degenerative heart valves most common in CAIE (30.9%) and hemodialysis (HD) in HAIE (60%). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was more common as a comorbidity in HAIE than in CAIE (65.1% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.001). Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), troponin, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) at admission correlated with increased 28-day mortality. Blood culture positivity was greater in HAIE (75%), with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) as the leading pathogen (38%). Mitral valve involvement was most common overall (38.9%), with aortic and mitral valve involvement higher in CAIE (p = 0.047 and p = 0.039, respectively). Complications such as valve insufficiency (64.1%), neurological events (33.6%), heart failure (27.5%), brain embolism (22.9%), and arrhythmia (8.4%) were associated with 28-day mortality, which was 11.5% across all IE patients. The incidence of HAIE is increasing, particularly in non-nosocomial cases, with HD emerging as a significant risk factor. This highlights the need for tailored empirical treatment strategies based on patient risk profiles. In our study, the high rate of CoNS as a causative agent is noteworthy. Although all cases met diagnostic criteria, the predominance of CoNS may have been influenced by local clinical practices. Therefore, local microbiological data should be taken into account when planning treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "People with metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) had higher risk of extrahepatic multimorbidity, and fibrosis is the strongest prognostic factor for mortality in MASLD. This study aimed to investigate how fibrosis was associated with multimorbidity and their relationships with all-cause mortality. We utilized data from the UK Biobank. MASLD was identified via a Fatty Liver Index ≥ 60 and the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors. The fibrosis-4 (FIB4) score was used to measure liver fibrosis. Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more long-term conditions (LTCs) from a prespecified list of 47 LTCs. Logistic regressions estimated the cross-sectional association between FIB4 scores and multimorbidity prevalence, while Cox models assessed the prospective association between FIB4 scores, multimorbidity and mortality. We included 127,470 participants with MASLD (41.7% female, age 57.4 years, 21.3% with multimorbidity, 2.2% with high FIB4 scores). 14,471 deaths were recorded during 13-year follow-up. Compared to low FIB4 scores, high FIB4 scores were associated with 41% higher prevalence of multimorbidity (OR 1.41 (95%CI 1.30-1.54)), and 94% higher all-cause mortality (HR 1.94 (95%CI 1.77-2.13)), while adjusting for multimorbidity reduced the association by 10%, primarily driven by contributions from cardiovascular diseases, extrahepatic cancers, and chronic kidney disease. FIB4 scores were positively associated with higher multimorbidity and mortality in MASLD patients. Adjustment for multimorbidity reduced 10% the relationship between fibrosis and mortality, with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic kidney disease contributing notably to this reduction. These findings underscore the importance of managing both fibrosis and multimorbidity in MASLD patients.",

        "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease mutually interact, presenting distinct clinical dilemmas where the optimal risk-benefit profile of antithrombotic therapy remains undefined. This study was conducted using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing hemodialysis. The primary outcomes included thromboembolism and intracranial hemorrhage rates, while major bleeding and all-cause death were secondary outcomes. Selecting patients not taking antithrombotics as a reference, Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed for those taking antiplatelets, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), and warfarin. The net clinical benefit was obtained by balancing the efficacy and safety of each antithrombotic therapy. There were 13,311 patients on hemodialysis recorded as with atrial fibrillation, the mean age was 63.1 ± 12.8 years, with the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 3.3 ± 1.6. One-fifth of the patients received antithrombotic therapy, with 67.1% using antiplatelet drugs. Warfarin was associated with an increased thromboembolic risk (HR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.56), while findings for DOACs remain inconclusive. In net clinical benefit analysis, with warfarin demonstrated the most unfavorable profile, and DOACs exhibited comparable net clinical benefit to antiplatelet agents (0.57; 95% CI, - 0.56-1.70). This study provides real-world evidence on the use of antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation patients undergoing hemodialysis. The findings highlight the profound complexity and uncertainty in managing this high-risk population, underscoring the importance for comprehensive assessment, individualized treatment approaches, and further dedicated research to establish optimal prevention and treatment strategies.",

The before and after test using L34 and a randomized placebo-controlled trial using placebo, L34, and LGG, for 4 weeks in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 (CKD) together with the in vitro experiments using indoxyl sulfate (IS, a representative uremic toxin) were performed. In comparison with the baseline, 4-week-L34 administration reduced gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUTs), except total IS, and attenuated several biomarkers, including i) systemic inflammation, as measured by cytokines and neutrophil extracellular traps using citrullinated histone 3, cell-free DNA, and fluorescent-stained nuclear morphology; ii) gut permeability defect (beta-D-glucan but not by endotoxemia); and iii) gut dysbiosis (fecal microbiome analysis). Additionally, L34-conditioned media attenuated IS-induced injuries on Caco-2 enterocytes, THP-1-derived-macrophages, and isolated neutrophils. Despite the possible different active compounds, both probiotics similarly attenuated IS-induced inflammation in vitro and in patients when compared with the placebo.

However, research on other active components of <i>L. barbarum</i> extract (ELB) for the therapy of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is limited. This study aims to investigate the renoprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of ELB in CKD. ELB was extracted from <i>L. barbarum</i> fruits using 85% ethanol reflux, followed by vacuum concentration and sequential extraction to remove polysaccharides. Chemical components and target genes were identified using TCMSP and UniProt databases, followed by pharmacology network construction and GO/KEGG pathway analysis. A 5/6 nephrectomy model in Sprague-Dawley rats was used to study the renoprotective effects of ELB, with H&E staining and biochemical analyses. Western blot analysis assessed IL-6 and VEGF expression in renal tissues. Chemical analysis of ELB identified 188 components, with 45 meeting screening criteria, and 34 linked to 94 target genes. The intersection with CKD-related genes yielded 39 overlapping genes, with quercetin having the most targets. GO/KEGG pathway analyses highlighted significant biological processes and pathways. A PPI network identified IL-6, VEGFA, CASP3, EGFR, ESR1, and PPARG as hub genes. In a 5/6 nephrectomy rat model, ELB treatment significantly reduced renal damage, serum BUN and SCr levels, as well as IL-6 and VEGF expression in renal tissues, validating its renoprotective effects and supporting bioinformatics predictions. This work identified the intricate components and pharmacological actions of ELB, which is devoid of LBP. The findings preliminarily confirm the potential of ELB as a novel therapeutic agent for preventing and managing CKD.",

Owing to rapid digital healthcare development, metaverse technologies have emerged as novel approaches to patient management. Patients on hemodialysis may benefit from these technologies in terms of pain management, physical deconditioning, and psychological distress. However, evidence of their effectiveness is unclear. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched the CINAHL, Cochrane Library Central, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus electronic databases for randomized controlled trials investigating metaverse interventions in patients on hemodialysis from inception to November 2024. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted the data, with methodological quality assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were pooled using random and fixed effects approaches. Fourteen studies (11 trials) met the inclusion criteria. The most common technology used among the studies was virtual-reality (VR) while the remainders used sensor-based exercise gamification. Meta-analytic findings indicated that VR significantly reduced arteriovenous fistula cannulation pain and moderately improved hemodynamics (oxygen saturation and heart rates), selected physical outcomes (6-min walk test, physical activity, and gait speed), and depressive symptoms. VR-based interventions appear promising for pain management and some physical improvements in patients on hemodialysis. To maximize the clinical utility of metaverse interventions in hemodialysis care settings, future studies should investigate a wider variety of metaverse modalities (such as augmented and mixed realities) and establish standardized outcome measurement periods.",

        "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to temporary renal ischaemia is a common, life-threatening complication of many invasive surgical procedures, particularly among the critically ill, frail and elderly. Since no targeted interventions are currently available, innovative strategies for prediction, early detection and personalised treatment of AKI are urgently needed. Based on our results from preclinical renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury models, we postulate that the excess release of cytotoxic calcium phosphate-loaded particles from dying cells and their reuptake by neighbouring cells drive a self-perpetuating necroinflammatory process causing AKI. Furthermore, replenishing the hepatokine fetuin-A, which is rapidly consumed in this process by binding and rendering inert the cellular calcium phosphate debris, can disrupt this vicious cycle. We hypothesise that low plasma levels of fetuin-A are an important patient-specific biomarker associated with AKI and worse clinical outcome after cardiovascular surgery (CVS). This is a monocentric, prospective, observational study in which the behaviour of fetuin-A in association with frailty and AKI is assessed in 100 patients undergoing elective CVS. The primary objective is to describe the difference between serum fetuin-A at baseline and the day after surgery. Secondary objectives include the description of the course of fetuin-A and a panel of biomarkers with high temporal granularity measured before and during surgery (five time points), and at days 1, 2 and 3 after operation. A potential association of fetuin-A with the occurrence of AKI (at day 7 or discharge) or with chronic kidney disease (at day 90) is investigated. In addition, the Edmonton Frailty Scale (recorded as patient reported outcome measure at baseline and day 90) is used to determine how the degree of frailty affects surgical outcomes. An interim analysis will be conducted after 30 patients have been included. This study was approved by the cantonal ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission) Bern (ID: 2023-02024) and is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Results of the study, which will be published in a peer-review journal, will determine whether our aforementioned hypothesis is correct. If so, an established correlation between fetuin-A levels and CVS-associated AKI would facilitate the transitioning of our preclinical work to patient-centred research. NCT06471621.",

        "abstract": "Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) refers to the acute or chronic impairment in the functioning of the kidneys and heart, which ultimately causes multiorgan disease. CRS has become a global threat, with high disease-associated illness and mortality rates having a significant impact on the healthcare system. Kidney diseases also share various mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction. The current treatment strategies for CRS mainly focus on symptomatic relief rather than disease mitigation. In recent years, research has been performed to explore the potential targets in managing CRS. In this review, the literature evaluation of different signaling mechanisms including Wnt/β-catenin, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)- adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS/STING), NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) pathway, histone deacetylase (HDAC), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), α-klotho, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and oxidative damage concerning the pathophysiological aspects of CRS were discussed. We highlighted a few new emerging pathways with a protective role, some with a disease-progressive role, and some with a diversified role in CRS. This scientific review can help researchers identify promising treatment strategies to manage CRS. As stated in this review, these pathways can be the basis for introducing potential inhibitor molecules of disease-progressing targets. Also, this scientific review will help identify molecules with agonistic properties as a protective way to transform current treatment strategies into more specific, effective treatment strategies against CRS with minimum side effects.",

        "abstract": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition primarily affecting the face, which greatly influences patients' quality of life and mental well-being. This research aimed to examine environmental and dietary factors, systemic comorbidities, and their effects on the quality of life and psychological impact of rosacea in Chinese patients. The study was an observational case-control design involving 200 individuals with rosacea and 200 healthy participants. Participants completed a questionnaire addressing skin color, specific habits, dietary and environmental factors, comorbidities, and assessments of quality of life and depression levels using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. The chi-square test was employed to compare the distribution of general characteristics. Univariate analysis was conducted using Pearson's chi-square test. DLQI is a continuous scale analyzed via independent t-test and PHQ-9 is an ordinal scale analyzed via Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used for nonparametric correlation between two ranked variables. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chi-square results with OR and 95% CI indicated significant associations between rosacea and factors such as female gender, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, environmental influences (sun exposure, use of cosmetics/hair products, exercise, exposure to hot weather, hot baths), dietary factors (dairy products, hot coffee consumption), and comorbidities (diabetes mellitus). No significant links were found with skin colors, dietary factors (fatty food, hot and spicy food, hot tea, sweet food), or other comorbidities (hypertension, high cholesterol, Helicobacter pylori, cancer, Crohn's/ulcerative colitis, dry eye syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and migraine). The rosacea group showed notably higher DLQI scores with moderate effect (9.0%), large effect (40.5%), and extremely large effect (45.5%), along with elevated PHQ-9 scores for depression compared to controls, highlighting a significant impact on their quality of life and mental health. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient demonstrated a significantly positive correlation between DLQI and PHQ-9 scores among participants (rho = 0.423, p < 0.001), indicating that greater quality of life impairment is linked to increased depression levels. These results underscore the complex nature of rosacea and its significant psychosocial burden. Addressing modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation, avoid alcohol, hot coffee and dairy products intake, sun protection, cessation of cosmetic products) and incorporating (DLQI/PHQ-9 screening) mental health screening and psychological support into treatment could enhance patient outcomes. Further research is necessary to clarify causal mechanisms and improve management strategies, which will aid in preventing and improving rosacea conditions and treatment approaches in the future.",

These toxins originate from endogenous metabolism, gut microbiota, and dietary intake and include protein-bound UTs such as p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and indole acetic acid, as well as small, water-soluble toxins such as trimethylamine-N-oxide and phenylacetylglutamine. Their accumulation promotes oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, contributing to vascular damage and associated with CV risk. Current management strategies focus on dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, oral sorbents, emerging pharmacological approaches, and advanced dialysis techniques, but clinical outcomes remain inconsistent. Recent trials have demonstrated the potential of agents such as sevelamer, high-amylose-resistant starch, and AST-120 to reduce UT levels and improve certain vascular markers. However, more robust, long-term studies are necessary to fully establish the therapeutic efficacy and optimize treatment strategies to mitigate the impact of gut-derived UTs on CKD and CV health.",

        "abstract": "The growing burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in India, characterized by rising prevalence, complex treatment regimens, and substantial economic and psychological impact, necessitates a simplified, patient-centered approach to glycemic management. This expert consensus document presents evidence-based recommendations for streamlined glycemic care focused on enhancing treatment adherence, minimizing pill burden, and improving clinical outcomes. An expert panel of endocrinologists and diabetologists convened across eight advisory board meetings to review current evidence and generate practical strategies. Emphasis was placed on the early use of combination therapies, particularly sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, with or without metformin, tailored to individual patient profiles. The consensus underscores the importance of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) to improve adherence and cost-effectiveness. In addition to pharmacologic strategies, lifestyle interventions, including medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, and sleep hygiene, are advocated. Special considerations are provided for managing T2D with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, emphasizing the pleiotropic benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. The recommendations also address barriers in the Indian healthcare landscape, including limited access to care and treatment inertia. This consensus aims to support clinicians, researchers, and policymakers in implementing an integrative, simplified care model that addresses the multifaceted challenges of T2D management in India. By adopting these recommendations, healthcare providers can enhance patient outcomes, reduce complications, and alleviate the socioeconomic burden of T2D.",

With organ transplantation offering hope to patients with end-stage organ disease, understanding the incidence and risk factors of POD is crucial, as it can significantly affect patients' prognosis and healthcare costs. To systematically evaluate the incidence and risk factors of POD following organ transplantation to facilitate clinical prevention and optimize patient management and prognosis. Multiple databases such as PubMed and their reference lists were comprehensively searched using a combination of keywords related to organ transplantation and POD. Relevant observational studies on patients who had undergone solid organ transplantation and randomized controlled trials containing relevant analyses were included. Duplicated, data-deficient, non-English, and non-original data studies were excluded. Data were extracted independently by two researchers and then cross-checked. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 was employed for data analysis. The pooled incidence of POD was calculated according to the data type, and the fixed or random effect model was employed to analyze risk factors based on heterogeneity. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessments were performed. A total of 39 relevant literatures were included. The overall incidence of POD in the organ transplant group was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 18%-22%]; liver transplant group, 22% (95%CI: 17%-26%); lung transplant group, 34% (95%CI: 23%-45%); and kidney transplant group, 6% (95%CI: 2%-10%). Primary graft dysfunction increased the POD risk, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) of 1.78 (1.09-2.91). A history of hepatic encephalopathy increased the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 3.19 (2.30-4.43). The higher the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, the greater the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 1.52 (1.09-2.12). A history of alcohol abuse increased the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.84 (1.74-4.65). Thus, the higher the model for end-stage liver disease score, the greater the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.49 (1.14-5.43). POD was more likely to develop in patients with preoperative infections, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.78 (1.56-4.97). The use of diuretics increased the POD risk, with a pooled OR (95%CI) of 2.36 (1.38-4.04). In this study, the overall incidence of POD in patients who underwent organ transplantation is 20%. The incidence varies among different types of organ transplantation, and multiple factors can increase the POD risk.",

Despite global awareness, data on the epidemiology and clinical profile of VHD in Malaysia remain limited. This study aimed to determine the echocardiographic detection rate of newly diagnosed VHD in tertiary care centres in Perak, Malaysia, as well as to examine its clinical characteristics, aetiologies, severity, associated comorbidities, and the rate of patient acceptance for valve intervention. A retrospective, multi-center study was conducted involving patients who underwent echocardiography over a six-month period. The data were then analysed to address the study objectives. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.0. Of the 12,610 patients who underwent echocardiography, 946 were newly diagnosed with VHD, yielding a detection rate of 7.5%. The median age of VHD patients was 67 years, with a slight female predominance. The median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 57%. Approximately 66% of patients were symptomatic, with dyspnoea being the most common symptom (46.85%). Pulmonary hypertension was observed in 35.3% of patients. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was present in 12.2% of cases. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was the most common valve lesion (34.1%), followed by tricuspid regurgitation (TR, 32.3%) and aortic regurgitation (AR, 19.2%). Functional aetiology was the most frequent cause of VHD, accounting for 59%. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was responsible for 51.7% of mitral stenosis (MS) cases, while degenerative causes predominated in AR (74.9%), aortic stenosis (AS) (84.6%), and primary MR (71.4%). The majority of VHD cases were mild (65.6%), with 29.2% moderate and 5.1% severe. Among VHD patients, 34.7% had clinically significant moderate or severe disease. In this subgroup, the predominant aetiologies were functional for MR (52.1%), TR (96.7%), and pulmonary regurgitation (PR, 100%), while degenerative causes were prevalent in AR (63.6%) and AS (84.3%), and RHD was the leading cause of MS (57.1%). Multiple valve involvement was observed in 72.6% of cases. Two-valve involvement accounted for 52.5%, with MR and TR being the most common combination (68.7%), mainly due to functional causes. AS was significantly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia. MR showed strong associations with AF, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and ischemic heart disease (IHD), while TR was more common in females. Despite 6.7% of patients requiring valve intervention, only 24.2% consented. A total of 36.4% declined intervention, primarily due to concerns about advanced age (62.5%) and fear of surgery (29.2%), while 39.4% remained undecided. The echocardiographic detection rate of newly diagnosed VHD was 7.5%, with functional MR being the most common lesion (20.7%). The majority of patients refused valve intervention, primarily due to old age. This study provides valuable insight into the burden and management challenges of VHD in Malaysia.",

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a high-morbidity condition that necessitates high-cost and time-intensive care, the present study aims to investigate the prevalence and economic burden of ESKD among Iranian Hajj pilgrims during the last decade. All demographic information, risk factors, prevalence and Hospital costs of ESKD were extracted from the database and medical records of the Hajj Pilgrimage Medical Centre, Iranian Red Crescent Society through file reading. Also, the multiple logistic regression model was used. In total, the study encompassed data on 469,581 Hajj pilgrims. According to the findings, the highest prevalence of ESKD was observed in pilgrims aged 70 years and above. Results show that for the gender variable, the odds of having ESKD among women is 0.523 times that of men, for the creatinine (Cr), for each unit increase in the level of blood creatinine, the odds of having ESKD will be 1.383 times, Additionally, in pilgrims with diabetes (1) and hypertension (HTN), the odds of ESKD are 2.33 and 3.345 times, respectively. Results show that the mean total hospital costs are $4178.4. The present study shows a significant difference in the prevalence of ESKD in age, gender, and distribution in different provinces. To reduce the mortality and morbidity of ESKD patients, appropriate medication prescriptions, on-time dialysis, lifestyle modifications, and the reduction of disease complications through consultation with a nephrologist are essential during Hajj.",

Using the Singapore Diabetic Cohort (N=9660), multi-state Markov models were constructed to derive chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage-specific transition probabilities for disease progression based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. These were internally validated in 50% training and 50% testing datasets and further validated in national administrative datasets (N=73,256). A cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis for a hypothetical intervention of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) was conducted from a healthcare system perspective, across different time horizons, in low-risk (G0-G2) and high-risk individuals (G3-G4) based on eGFR-defined DKD risk stages. Annually, more than half of the participants (53.0-88.8%) stayed in the same DKD stage, with the probabilities of progressing or regressing to the next DKD stage being highest between stages G0 and G1. The SGLT2i intervention was cost-effective when given in low-risk, but not in high-risk, individuals with type 2 diabetes in both the short and the long term. Additionally, implementing the SGLT2i intervention would incur a 5 year cumulative cost increase of 41.5%, assuming an annual 5% increase in market uptake. We developed a robust model of DKD progression based on real-world data and demonstrated its value through economic modelling of risk-stratified interventions with known effectiveness. This model can aid policymakers and health professionals in evaluating population-level interventions for evidence-based policy decisions.",

Cox regression models were used to assess the relationships between different stages of CKM and CLD. Mediation analysis was performed to assess the role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in the CKM-CLD relationship. Our findings demonstrated that, after adjustment for confounding factors, CKM Stage 3 (HR = 2.215, 95 % CI: 1.202-4.082) and Stage 4 (HR = 3.231, 95 % CI: 1.743-5.990) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing chronic lung disease (CLD). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that participants at CKM Stages 3-4 had a higher incidence of CLD compared to those at Stages 0-2 (HR = 1.662, 95 % CI: 1.441-1.917, P < 0.001). Mediation analysis further suggested that hsCRP levels partially mediated the relationship between CKM and peak expiratory flow (PEF), accounting for 2.25 % of the effect (95 % CI: 0.42 % -5.00 %, p = 0.022). Advanced stages of CKM, specifically stages 3 and 4, are significantly associated with an increased risk of developing CLD.

Despite vaccination successes, new virus variants persist, affecting unvaccinated and immunocompromised individuals (ICI) severely. These high-risk groups face elevated mortality and hospitalization rates. Vigilance and targeted health measures remain crucial post-pandemic. The aim of this study was to develop consensus on the unmet needs in COVID-19 prevention among ICI. We performed a Delphi study involving 45 experts, including physicians, health managers, policymakers, public health experts, members of medical societies and patient organizations. Consensus was achieved at 65% for each identified strategy using a scale ranging from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" Three Delphi rounds were conducted to address four key questions: identifying unmet needs in COVID-19 prevention for ICI; identifying the characteristics that distinguish ICI as a susceptible group; determining the main outcomes of COVID-19 in ICI; and indicating action plans for protecting ICI. The first round involved voting on pre-identified indicators. The second and third rounds involved analyzing the gathered information and voting on each indicator to achieve consensus. A retention rate of 80% was achieved. Out of 89 valid indicators analyzed, 23 achieved consensus. These included: eight indicators highlighting the importance of raising awareness about COVID-19 and vaccination outcomes, ensuring safety and understanding, and developing targeted immunization strategies for ICI; five indicators identifying susceptible groups within ICI, such as individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy, those with primary immunodeficiencies, solid organ transplant recipients, patients with chronic kidney disease, and bone marrow transplant recipients; two indicators showing improvements in clinical outcomes and reduced hospitalizations; and eight indicators recommending the development of effective therapies, more immunogenic vaccines, and treatments for viral infections in ICI. The study emphasized the importance of targeted immunization strategies, monitoring, and tailored education to address diverse needs of ICI.

This condition is strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) which have been recently renamed as acute myocardial ischemic syndromes (AMIS). In CKD patients, the atypical presentation of symptoms complicates the diagnosis and management of angina, a condition that can, if not promptly addressed, rapidly progress to myocardial infarction. Traditional diagnostic tools, such as the electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, are less reliable in this population due to CKD-related baseline alterations, necessitating advanced imaging techniques for accurate assessment. Management strategies for transient myocardial ischaemia in CKD must also carefully balance the risk related to myocardial ischemia against potential complications from invasive procedures, such as further renal impairment and bleeding. Tailored therapeutic approaches, including adjusted medication regimens and innovative revascularization techniques, are crucial to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. Additionally, asymptomatic myocardial infarction is notably prevalent in CKD, often remaining undetected and posing significant prognostic implications. The interplay of traditional and non-traditional risk factors, such as uremia-induced toxicity and chronic inflammation, further exacerbates the risk for plaque instability in CKD patients. This review highlights the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach to managing myocardial ischemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), incorporating meticulous risk stratification and personalized treatment plans.",

We conclude that SGLT2i may reduce the risks for AKI in humans. We speculate on mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may protect against AKI.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality among adults. Given recent RSV vaccine authorizations, data on groups at highest risk are needed to support vaccine program decision making. We identified adults aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RSV and hospitalizations with RSV-related diagnostic codes in Ontario, Canada (2017-2019). We calculated incidence of hospitalization with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression stratified by demographic and clinical risk factors, and substratified by age. We reported secondary outcomes including the proportion of individuals with fatal outcomes. Over 2 respiratory virus seasons, we identified 3928 RSV-associated hospitalizations. Incidence increased steadily with age from 2.0 (95% CI, 1.8-2.3) per 100 000 for those aged 18-49 years to 43.7 (95% CI, 41.0-46.6) per 100 000 for those aged 70-79 years, with a sharp increase to 134.7 (95% CI, 128.6-141.1) per 100 000 for those aged ≥ 80 years. Incidence was higher for those with comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease (receiving dialysis) (494.7; 95% CI, 410.7-595.8) and transplant recipients (370.9; 95% CI, 318.0-432.6), as well as for those living in lower (22.4; 95% CI, 21.1-23.7) versus higher-income neighborhoods (11.8; 95% CI, 10.8-12.8). Among those hospitalized, 10.3% (n = 403) died within 30 days of admission, and 93.1% of deaths occurred in those aged ≥ 60 years. Of survivors, 44.6% of community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 60 years had functional decline requiring formal supports at discharge. We found a substantial burden of RSV among older adults, particularly among those with preexisting medical conditions and those of lower socioeconomic status. These results will inform equitable vaccine recommendations for adults.",

Bleeding prevalence varies widely, ranging from 1% to 10% in clinical trials and 2.8% to 11% in real-world studies, with a significant impact on mortality. The Academic Research Consortium for High Bleeding Risk criteria are well-validated, classifying approximately 50% of patients as high bleeding risk, who subsequently experience higher post-PCI bleeding rates.

        "abstract": "The American Heart Association (AHA) introduced the concept of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health and stage, reflecting the interaction among metabolism, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the cardiovascular system. However, the association between CKM stage and the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has not been validated. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term CVD risk associated with CKM health metrics and CKM stage using data from a population-based cohort study. In total, 5293 CVD-free participants were followed up to around 13 years in the Chinese Multi-provincial Cohort Study. Considering the pathophysiologic progression of CKM health metrics abnormalities (comprising obesity, central adiposity, prediabetes, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, CKD, and metabolic syndrome), participants were divided into CKM stages 0, 1, and 2. The time-dependent Cox regression models were used to estimate the cardiovascular risk associated with CKM health metrics and stage. Additionally, broader CVD outcomes were examined, with a specific assessment of the impact of stage 3 in 2581 participants from the CMCS-Beijing subcohort. Among participants, 91.2% (4825/5293) had at least one abnormal CKM health metric, 8.8% (468/5293), 13.3% (704/5293), and 77.9% (4121/5293) were in CKM stages 0, 1, and 2, respectively; and 710 incident CVD cases occurred during a median follow-up time of 13.3 years (interquartile range: 12.1 to 13.6 years). Participants with each poor CKM health metric exhibited significantly higher CVD risk. Compared with stage 0, the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for CVD incidence was 1.31 (0.84-2.04) in stage 1 and 2.27 (1.57-3.28) in stage 2. Significant interactive impacts existed between CKM stage and age or sex, with higher CVD risk related to increased CKM stages in participants aged <60 years or females. These findings highlight the contribution of CKM health metrics and CKM stage to the long-term risk of CVD, suggesting the importance of multi-component recognition and management of poor CKM health in CVD prevention.",

This cross-sectional study was carried out at the Outpatient Department of General Medicine, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from 1st July to 31<sup>st</sup> December, 2023. Non-probability consecutive sampling was employed. Demographic data was collected and anemia was evaluated through Complete Blood Counts for each participant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23. The study included a cohort of 209 participants with an average age of 40.78 ± 6.37 years and a mean BMI of 26.12 ± 4.11 kg/m². Among the participants, 72.2% were male and 27.8% were female. The most common CKD patterns were normocytic (41.1%), hypochromic microcytic (32.5%), and hypochromic macrocytic (26.3%). The majority of participants (78.9%) had experienced CKD for over one year. No significant association was found between the types of anemia in CKD and gender, underlying cause of CKD, age, BMI, or duration of the disease.

Currently, there is a lack of research on VO in PD patients specifically focusing on the unique group of long duration PD patients. No studies have yet examined the impact of long dialysis vintage on VO from the perspective of research subjects. This study conducted in-depth interviews with long duration PD patients to explore their positive experiences in volume management. Using purposive sampling, 10 long duration PD patients from a nephrology department at a tertiary hospital in Baoding City, China, from September, 2024 to October 2024 were selected as interview subjects in this retrospective study. The phenomenological approach in qualitative research was employed, conducting semi-structured in-depth interviews with these patients using the \"knowledge-attitude-practice\" theoretical framework and incorporating a literature-designed interview guide. Among the 10 interviewees, there were four males and six females aged 35 to 64 years. Data analysis extracted four main themes: illness perception, positive attitude, excellent compliance, and social support. The volume management in long duration PD patients was influenced by multiple factors. This study identified themes of illness perception, positive attitude, excellent adherence, and social support. The results may guide clinical healthcare professionals in helping PD patients actively address VO and implement targeted interventions to improve their quality of life.",

        "abstract": "The escalating global burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), driven by aging populations and rising metabolic comorbidities, underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence highlights the gut microbiome as a pivotal modulator of renal pathophysiology through the gut-kidney axis, with microbial dysbiosis exacerbating gut microbial metabolites (e.g., uremic toxins), systemic inflammation, and multi-organ damage. This narrative review explores the divergent impacts of kidney replacement therapies (KRT)-hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD)-on gut microbiota dynamics: HD is associated with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria enrichment, reduced butyrate-producing taxa (e.g., <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>), and systemic microbial translocation; whereas PD-driven glucose absorption and iron supplementation foster pathogenic proliferation (e.g., <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>) and impair short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism. Current interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, plant-based diets (PBDs), and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), demonstrate potential in mitigating dysbiosis and uremic toxin accumulation. PBDs reduce inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP) and lower all-cause mortality risk by 24% in PD patients; synbiotics (e.g., <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> + galactooligosaccharides) reduce serum p-cresyl sulfate by 20% in HD patients; and FMT increases levels of short-chain fatty acids (propionate, butyrate) and lowers trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) concentrations in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy mouse models. However, clinical translation remains challenged by small sample sizes, heterogeneous outcomes, and a lack of hard endpoints. Future research must prioritize standardized protocols, personalized microbial profiling, and synergistic integration of dietary and microbiome-targeted therapies. Bridging mechanistic insights with clinical validation will advance precision medicine in ESRD management, offering transformative potential for patients burdened by this therapeutic impasse.",

Understanding the impact of comorbidities on COVID-19 outcomes is essential for improving patient management. To date, analyses of comorbidities affecting COVID-19 severity in a heterogeneous Swiss cohort across multiple outbreak waves are unavailable. The objective of this study was to explore the role of comorbidities on COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients from a diverse Swiss cohort and to evaluate the association between comorbidities and specific in-hospital complications. This retrospective, observational, single-center study included adult patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 for at least one night at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland (KSBL), between March 2020 and December 2021. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and gender were performed to analyze the association between comorbidities and critical condition (defined as severe disease or in-hospital death) and complications. A total of 1124 patients were included in the study (median age 66, range 19-100 years, 60% male). A total of 76% of patients had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were arterial hypertension (47%), obesity (27%), and diabetes mellitus (24%). Overall, 16% of patients experienced a critical condition, and 25.5% had any type of complication. Patients without comorbidities had the lowest rates of critical condition (5.3%) and complications (10.2%). Obesity (OR 2.01, <i>p</i> < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.67, <i>p</i> = 0.004), arterial hypertension (OR 1.65, <i>p</i> = 0.006), arrhythmia (OR1.87, <i>p</i> = 0.003), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.72, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were found to be associated with critical condition. The most frequently observed complication was acute kidney failure, affecting 17.1% of the study population, while patients with arrhythmia showed the highest overall complication rate (42%). Our findings are consistent with previous research, confirming the relevance of specific comorbidities as key risk factors for critical COVID-19 outcomes. Among all comorbid conditions evaluated, asthma appeared to have the least impact on disease severity. Future research should focus on the impact of the combination of comorbidities on the disease severity of COVID-19, as well as the long-term effects of COVID-19 for patients with certain comorbidities.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in intensive-care unit (ICU) patients and is associated with increased mortality. Elderly patients tend to have more comorbid chronic diseases and are more prone to AKI than younger populations, resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and a higher incidence of AKI. Our aim in this study was to investigate the prognostic utility of BUN/albumin ratio (BAR) in predicting mortality in elderly critically ill patients with AKI. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This study was conducted retrospectively on 154 elderly patients with AKI who were admitted to the ICU between October 2023 and September 2024.Data on the following demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical cards and electronic records. Results: In the non-survivor group, among comorbidities, lung disease was higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05), GCS was lower, and APACHE II was higher among clinical scores (<i>p</i> < 0.001). In the non-survivor group, diuretic use (<i>p</i> = 0.03), oliguria, RRT, vasopressor requirement, sepsis, and MV rates (<i>p</i> < 0.001),as well as BUN, phosphate, LDH, Crp, APTT, INR, and BAR rates, were higher (all <i>p</i> < 0.05) and albumin was lower (<i>p</i> = 0.01).

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The worldwide prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to increase, representing a major concern for public health systems. CKD is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis, which may exacerbate disease progression by increasing the levels of uremic toxins, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress. Modulation of the gut microbiota through biotic supplementation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to slow CKD progression and mitigate its complications. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 10-month synbiotic supplementation on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), circulating concentrations of indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in patients with stage IV-V CKD not receiving dialysis, in comparison to placebo. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Fifty non-dialysis CKD IV-V patients were assigned (n = 25 each) via matched, non-randomized allocation (age, sex, and primary disease) to synbiotic or placebo. This single-blind, placebo-controlled trial blinded participants and laboratory personnel. The synbiotic group received daily capsules containing <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> La-14 (2 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/g) + fructooligosaccharides; controls received identical placebo. Adherence was monitored monthly (pill counts, diaries), with < 80% over two visits resulting in withdrawal. The eGFR, IS, p-CS, IL-6, and MDA were measured at baseline and month 10. <i>Results</i>: Forty-two patients (21/arm) completed the study; eight withdrew (4 per arm). At 10 months, the change in eGFR was -1.2 ± 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (synbiotic) vs. -3.5 ± 3.0 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (placebo); between-group difference in change was 2.3 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI: 0.5-4.1; <i>p</i> = 0.014; adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.07).

No significant differences were observed for p-CS, IL-6, or MDA after correction. <i>Conclusions</i>: Synbiotic supplementation over a 10-month period resulted in a trend toward decreased serum IS levels in patients with advanced CKD, suggesting potential benefits of microbiota-targeted therapies. However, no significant effects were observed on renal function, inflammatory, or oxidative stress markers. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore the long-term impact of synbiotics in CKD management.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity is steadily increasing in patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, it is still debatable whether obesity affects outcomes after kidney transplantation. This study evaluated the relationship between pretransplant obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and posttransplant outcomes in Korean kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). We investigated prospective nationwide cohort data from the Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) from 2014 to 2021. KTRs were categorized into 4 groups based on pretransplant BMI: underweight (< 18.5), normal weight (18.5-22.9), overweight (23-24.9), and obesity (≥ 25). Posttransplant outcomes, including death-censored allograft loss, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality, were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was employed to assess associations between BMI and posttransplant outcomes. A total of 9,130 KTRs were finally analyzed. The mean age was 49.9 ± 11.6 and 60.2% of KTRs were male. The prevalence of obesity in KTRs was 28.6% and continued to increase (24.8% in 2014 to 32.5% in 2021). Obese KTRs were characterized by male predominance, shorter dialysis vintage, and more diabetes as primary kidney disease. Kaplan-Meier curve showed a significant difference in death-censored allograft loss among BMI groups (P = 0.007). Obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) was as an independent risk factor for death-censored allograft loss (adjusted hazard ratio 1.511, 95% confidence interval 1.063-2.148, P = 0.021), but not for cardiovascular events or mortality. Our study evaluated BMI across a spectrum of categories, suggesting that obesity is an independent risk factor for graft survival in KTRs. Risk stratification using BMI and strategies to prevent obesity should be considered in the preparation for kidney transplantation. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "Managing acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with pulmonary edema is challenging in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on dialysis. While hemodialysis (HD) is often chosen for rapid fluid removal, peritoneal dialysis (PD) may better preserve hemodynamic stability in patients prone to circulatory compromise. This study evaluated whether continuing PD in patients who develop ACS and pulmonary edema while already on PD is feasible for improving oxygenation and fluid management without switching to HD. This retrospective single-center study reviewed 13 PD patients who experienced 15 ACS episodes complicated by pulmonary edema. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, Killip classification, PD regimen modifications, and outcomes. Adjustments to PD prescriptions and their effectiveness were assessed. Among the 15 episodes, 11 (73.3%) were successfully managed with PD alone, while 4 (26.7%) required temporary HD due to insufficient fluid removal. Most cases were Killip Class II (20%) or III (73.3%). The average ICU stay was 4 days, and in-hospital mortality was 20%. Continuation of PD in patients who develop ACS accompanied by pulmonary edema appears feasible in most cases, provided that PD prescriptions are carefully individualized. Switching to HD is not invariably required, but thoughtful patient selection and close monitoring remain essential to optimize clinical outcomes.",

        "title": "An artificial intelligence model to predict mortality among hemodialysis patients: A retrospective validated cohort study.",
        "abstract": "Hemodialysis stands as the most prevalent renal replacement therapy globally. Accurately identifying mortality among hemodialysis patients is paramount importance, as it enables the formulation of tailored interventions and facilitates timely management. The objective of the study was to establish and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict mortality among hemodialysis patients. The data of 559 patients with hemodialysis at a large tertiary hospital were retrospectively analyzed, and those of 82 patients were extracted from another tertiary hospital. The patients from the large tertiary hospital constituted the model development cohort, and the patients from another tertiary hospital constituted the external validation cohort. The patients in the model development cohort were randomly divided into a training cohort and an internal validation cohort at a ratio of 8:2. The machine learning algorithms used to develop the models for the training group included logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The predictive performances of all the models were evaluated using discrimination and calibration. In addition, a comprehensive scoring system to evaluate the prediction performance of the model was also used, the scoring system had the scores ranging from 0 to 50. The optimal model had the highest total score for the internal and external validation, and was further deployed as an AI application using Streamlit. The rates of mortality at one year, four years, and seven years in the model development group were determined to be 2.68%, 15.38%, and 33.09%, respectively. The model, which predicted mortality at these time points, achieved impressive area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.979 (95% CI: 0.959-0.998), 0.933 (95% CI: 0.916-0.958), and 0.935 (95% CI: 0.895-0.976), respectively, using the eXGBM model. The corresponding accuracies were 0.931, 0.889, and 0.931, with precision values of 0.891, 0.857, and 0.891, and brier scores of 0.051, 0.096, and 0.051, respectively. Notably, the eXGBM model outperformed other models with a score of 46 in the comprehensive scoring system, followed by the NN model with a score of 35. External validation further confirmed the robust predictive performance of the eXGBM model, with an AUC value of 0.892 (95% CI: 0.840-0.945). The eXGBM model emerged as the most reliable predictor of mortality among hemodialysis patients in this study. This model has been made available online at https://mortality-among-hemodialysis-bpypyb4dxvq4hja29kwsev.streamlit.app/ . Users can simply access the link, input relevant features, and receive predictions on mortality risk. Furthermore, the AI model provides insights into how the predictions were generated and offers personalized recommendations for intervention strategies. This study has successfully developed and validated an AI application for assessing mortality risk in hemodialysis patients. This tool empowers healthcare professionals to promptly identify individuals at high risk of mortality, thereby aiding in clinical decision-making and intervention planning. For patients at high risk of early death, caution is advised when considering kidney transplant surgery. Conversely, for those with a high probability of extended survival, kidney transplant surgery may present a favorable treatment option.",

To address this, we developed the kidney intelligent diagnosis system (KIDS), a noninvasive model for renal biopsy prediction using 13,144 retinal images from 6773 participants. The KIDS achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.839-0.993 for CKD screening and accurately identifies the five most common pathological types (AUC: 0.790-0.932) in a multicenter and multi-ethnic validation, outperforming nephrologists by 26.98% in accuracy. Additionally, the KIDS further predicts disease progression based on pathological classification. Given its flexible strategy, the KIDS can be adapted to local conditions to provide a tailored tool for patients.

        "abstract": "The growing burden of chronic kidney disease has significantly increased the demand for hemodialysis, with reliable vascular access being vital for treatment success. Although the radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) remains the first option as a long term hemodialysis access, challenges related to aging patient population and prevalence of comorbidities may compromise maturation and durability. Therefore, this systematic review with meta-analysis aims to determine the patency and maturation rates of radiocephalic AVF, focusing on how different patient characteristics and surgical methodologies impact these rates. Pubmed, Web of Science and Cochrane were systematically searched for studies assessing patency and maturation rates of radiocephalic AVF. Primary and secondary endpoints were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis, with sources of heterogeneity being explored by meta-regression. Thirty-six cohort studies were selected, 15 of which were prospective. The meta analytical incidence of primary patency rates at 30 days, and at 1, 2, and 3 years after fistula creation was 84.18%, 68.43%, 59.86% and 55.10%, respectively. Additionally, the meta-analytical incidence of maturation failure, infection, aneurysm degeneration, early-thrombosis and reintervention rates was 24.7%, 3.9%, 3.6%, 6.3% and 29.4%, respectively. All the variables previously referred had high levels of heterogeneity associated. Furthermore, meta-regression analysis identified previous vascular access construction and latero-lateral anastomosis as factors associated with higher maturation failure rates. The significant heterogeneity observed in the endpoints evaluated highlight the complexity of radiocephalic AVF management. These findings underline the need for standardized clinical practices and further large-scale studies to identify factors influencing radiocephalic AVF outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Safe, stable, and nurturing childhood relationships and environments promote optimal child development. It is less understood how these experiences measurably affect individuals' lifelong health and well-being into adulthood. To assess health and life opportunities and economic value associated with positive childhood experiences (PCEs) reported by adults. This cross-sectional study used Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data from adults (≥18 years) from 4 states (Kansas [2020], Montana [2019], South Carolina [2020], and Wisconsin [2015]), analyzed from May 2023 to April 2024. Seven PCEs (adult made you feel safe and protected, felt you belonged in high school, felt supported by friends, at least 2 adults that took an interest in you, felt your family stood by you, enjoyed community traditions, and felt able to talk to your family). Primary outcomes were PCE prevalence by count (1-2, 3-5, or 6-7 PCEs), adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) representing the association of PCEs with adult outcomes, and the estimated economic value of PCE-associated, averted morbidity and mortality for chronic health conditions and risk behaviors. Regression models of adult cohorts by PCE exposure and matched by demographic characteristics were used to assess associations of PCEs with current life opportunities (postsecondary education and income), health risk behaviors (moderate to heavy drinking and smoking), chronic health conditions (arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], depression, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, overweight or obesity, and stroke), and overall physical and mental health. Prevented fractions for the population were used to calculate the reduced proportion of total disease-specific medical spending and healthy life-years savings associated with PCEs. The sample size was 20 916 individuals (11 357 female [54.3%]; 4469 aged 55-64 years [21.4%]). Approximately one-half of adults (53.1%; 95% CI, 52.1-54.1) reported a high PCE score. A higher PCE score was associated with increased likelihood of attaining postsecondary education (1-2 PCEs: aPR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06; 3-5 PCEs: aPR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23-1.67; 6-7 PCEs: aPR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.42) and greater annual household income (1-2 PCEs: aPR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.69; 3-5 PCEs: aPR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.40-2.16; 6-7 PCEs: aPR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.75-2.68), and lower likelihood of smoking (3-5 PCEs: aPR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.89; 6-7 PCEs: aPR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57-0.72). Higher PCE scores were also associated with lower prevalence of most chronic conditions (any condition for those with 3-5 PCEs: aPR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93; any condition for those with 6-7 PCEs: aPR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.83) including arthritis, asthma, cancer, COPD, depression, diabetes, heart disease, overweight or obesity, and poor general physical or mental health compared with having no PCEs. The estimated annual economic value of PCE-associated, reduced chronic disease in the 4 analyzed states was $215.9 billion ($3.1 billion in lower medical spending cost and $212.8 billion in additional healthy life-years) for respondents with PCE scores of 3 or more, which corresponded to an estimated $28 132 per adult per year, or $782 000 over their lifetimes. This cross-sectional study quantified the importance of PCEs for lifelong health and well-being. The economic benefits associated with PCEs support consideration of strategies to promote these childhood experiences.",

The study focuses on developing a robust high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for cinacalcet quantification to support therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetics. A bioanalytical method using cinacalcet-D3 (CCT-D3) as an internal standard and tandem mass spectrometry in positive ion mode for accurate quantification employing Triple Quad Mass spectrometer in normal mode and a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column. The method was comprehensively validated, demonstrating reliability through high precision, accuracy, linearity within the range of 0.300-150.00 ng/mL, and stability, all in compliance with established bioanalytical guidelines. Furthermore, its environmental sustainability was assessed using modern green chemistry evaluation metrics. This study presents a robust, selective LC-MS/MS assay for quantifying cinacalcet in human plasma. The assay demonstrates excellent linearity, precision, and recovery, making it suitable for pharmacokinetic studies, therapeutic drug monitoring, and bioequivalence or bioavailability assessments.",

It typically occurs in the context of chronic urinary obstruction, renal calculi, and persistent infection, with <i>Escherichia coli</i> as the most common pathogen. XGP is frequently referred to as \"the great imitator\" because its clinical and radiographic features can mimic those of other renal conditions, including tumors. Radiologically, XGP is characterized by the \"bear paw\" sign, a distinctive finding on imaging that represents dilated renal calyces and pelvis filled with pus, which can aid in differentiating it from other diseases. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical, as untreated XGP can lead to progressive renal destruction, involving surrounding structures and potentially causing life-threatening complications. The role of imaging, particularly CT, in diagnosing and staging the disease cannot be overstated, as it provides crucial information to guide treatment and improve patient outcomes. We report the case of a 56-year-old diabetic male who presented with left-sided lumbar pain and fever. Laboratory findings indicated leukocyturia and bacteriuria with <i>E coli</i> growth. Renal ultrasound showed kidney enlargement and pyelocaliceal dilation. A CT scan revealed the characteristic \"bear paw\" sign, strongly suggesting the diagnosis of XGP. The patient was treated with antibiotics and a percutaneous drainage of the thick pyelocaliceal content was performed. This case highlights the importance of imaging in diagnosing XGP and guiding management.",

Controlling for baseline potassium, standard of care, and BMI, SPS and SZC were superior to patiromer (p=0.001 and p=0.022, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between SPS and SZC (p=0.206).

Given asprosin's potential as a biomarker for disease progression, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis on its relationship with DKD in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were systematically searched. Standard mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Fisher's Z transformation were used to examine the relationship between asprosin and DKD. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and its version for cross-sectional studies. Heterogeneity (I² > 50%) was analyzed with a random-effects model. Six studies (n = 1340) were included.

This case series included adult patients who consecutively underwent deceased-donor KTx for end-stage kidney disease at our center between January 2019 and June 2022. All patients received inverted KTx combined with ultrashort anisoperistaltic end-to-side ureteroureterostomy, without ureteral stenting. Descriptive analysis focused on the major perioperative outcomes within 90 days post-transplantation. Cohort analysis of 211 patients revealed major postoperative complications requiring reoperation in 15 patients (7.11%). Reoperations for urological reasons included four patients (1.90%) with ureteral stricture and ureteral fistula in two patients each (0.95%). Ureteral strictures were managed with pyeloureterostomy, and ureteral fistulas were treated with end-to-end ureteral re-anastomosis, double-j stenting, JP drain placement, or pyeloureterostomy. Non-urological complications leading to reoperation included peri-graft collections and infections such as surgical hematoma (1.42%), deep surgical infection (1.90%), and wound dehiscence (1.90%). Three patients (1.42%) ultimately underwent transplantectomy because of graft loss after severe infection in two patients (0.95%) and acute rejection plus infection in one patient (0.47%). All the remaining patients were treated with surgical exploration, evacuation/irrigation, and wound closure. Vascular complications occurred in one patient with an arterial stricture (0.47%). Delayed graft function was found in 82.9% of the patients, with 95.26% achieving resolution within 4 weeks post-transplantation. Inverted KTx combined with ultrashort end-to-side ureteroureterostomy is a feasible and safe technique with low rates of urological and vascular complications in our experience. To our knowledge, this is the largest case series using this combined surgical approach as the primary technique for deceased-donor KTxs.",

Between 2013 and 2022, eight cats presented to our ophthalmology service with corneal plaques, following prior management of corneal ulceration. Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed on all cats. Additional tests included complete blood count, serum biochemistry (including ionized calcium), bacterial and fungal cultures of corneal samples, and histopathological (hematoxylin-eosin-saffron and Von Kossa staining) examinations of lesions. All cats had similar opacities: an axial anterior stromal opaque corneal plaque of acute onset, following a previous episode of corneal ulceration. Seven cats had at least one comorbidity: chronic kidney disease (4/8), ureteral obstruction secondary to calcium oxalate lithiasis (2/8), polytrauma (2/8), or a suspected spindle cell tumor (1/8). Ionized hypercalcemia was observed in one cat prior to corneal deposit development. At corneal deposit diagnosis, all cats had already been treated with various topical treatments, the most frequent being sodium hyaluronate (6/8) and neomycin-polymyxin B (5/8), and six cats received methadone for pain management of their underlying conditions. Bacterial and fungal cultures (Cat 1) yielded negative results, and histopathological examination (Cats 1, 4) revealed calcium salt deposition in the cornea. Surgical removal by superficial keratectomy was successful in two cats (Cats 1, 4), and no recurrence was observed during long-term follow-up. This series described presumed or confirmed calcium corneal deposits in cats with different metabolism disorders. All cats had prior corneal ulceration and topical treatments, and 7/8 had comorbidities.",

        "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has led to a growing demand for kidney transplantation (KTx). Identifying risk factors that enable improved allograft survival through novel therapeutic agents, advanced biomarkers, and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data integration are critical to addressing this challenge. Drugs, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and finerenone, have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients but lack comprehensive long-term evidence in KTx patients. The use of biomarkers, including circulating cytokines and transcriptomics, coupled with AI, could enhance early detection and personalized treatment strategies. Addressing patient self-management and addressing health access disparities may be more achievable using technologies used at home rather than traditional models of healthcare and thus lead to increased transplant success, both in terms of transplantation rates and allograft longevity.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the most prevalent pathology within the circulatory system. Among its chronic complications, ischemic mitral valve regurgitation (IMR) is observed in approximately 15% of patients with sustained myocardial ischemia. The presence of this complex valvular defect significantly increases both overall mortality and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. Notably, the presence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing surgical revascularization has been shown to double the risk of death. Despite the well-established etiology of IMR, data regarding the efficacy of surgical interventions and the determinants of postoperative outcomes remain inconclusive. <b>Methods:</b> The objective of the present study was to evaluate both early and long-term outcomes of surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to ischemic heart disease. Particular attention was given to the influence of the severity of regurgitation, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and the dimensions of the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) on the postoperative prognosis. An additional aim was to identify preoperative risk factors associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 421 patients diagnosed with ischemic mitral regurgitation who underwent concomitant mitral valve surgery and CABG. Exclusion criteria included emergent and urgent procedures as well as non-ischemic etiologies of mitral valve dysfunction. <b>Results:</b> The study cohort comprised 34.9% women and 65.1% men, with the mean age of 65.7 years (±7.57). A substantial proportion (76.7%) of patients were aged over 60 years. More than half (51.5%) presented with severe heart failure symptoms, classified as NYHA class III or IV, while over 70% were categorized as CCS class II or III. Among the surgical procedures performed, 344 patients underwent mitral valve repair, and 77 patients required mitral valve replacement. Additionally, 119 individuals underwent concomitant tricuspid valve repair. Short-term survival was significantly affected by the presence of hypertension, prior cerebrovascular events, and chronic kidney disease. In contrast, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were identified as significant predictors of adverse late-term outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> Interestingly, neither the preoperative severity of mitral regurgitation nor the echocardiographic measurements of LA and LV dimensions were found to significantly influence surgical outcomes. The perioperative risk, as assessed by the EuroSCORE II (average score: 10.0%), corresponded closely with observed mortality rates following mitral valve repair (9.9%) and replacement (10.4%). Notably, the need for concomitant tricuspid valve surgery was associated with an elevated mortality rate (12.4%). Furthermore, the preoperative echocardiographic evaluation of LA regurgitation severity, as well as LA and LV dimensions, did not exhibit a statistically significant impact on either early or long-term surgical outcomes. However, a reduced LVEF was correlated with increased long-term mortality. The presence of advanced clinical symptoms and the necessity for tricuspid valve repair were independently associated with a poorer late-term prognosis. Importantly, the annual mortality rate observed in the late-term follow-up of patients who underwent surgical treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation was lower than rates reported in the literature for patients managed conservatively. The EuroSCORE II scale proved to be a reliable and precise tool in predicting surgical risk and outcomes in this patient population.",

Despite its multifactorial pathophysiology, no gold-standard treatment has been established. This review explores various therapeutic options and evaluates their effectiveness based on recent clinical studies and meta-analyses. Therapies targeting novel mechanisms have evolved in recent years. Difelikefalin, a κ-opioid receptor agonist, represents a breakthrough in systemic treatment, demonstrating efficacy with a favorable safety profile. Another opioid-based therapy, nalfurafine, has shown notable symptom relief in multiple clinical studies, with a low risk of abuse. Sertraline, an antidepressant, offers another alternative, although its delayed onset remains a limitation. Nonpharmacologic approaches are also evolving. Phototherapy, particularly UV-B therapy, modulates the immune response, reduces inflammation, and effectively alleviates itching in hemodialysis patients. Personalized treatment strategies are crucial, as responses vary among patients. Further research, including comparative and long-term studies, is essential to refine treatment algorithms and improve patient outcomes. By integrating new pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options, CKD-aP management is shifting toward a more tailored and effective approach that addresses the individual needs of each patient.",

        "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Urinary tract infections (UTIs) remain a significant public health issue worldwide, particularly affecting the geriatric population with increased morbidity and mortality. Aging-related immune changes, comorbidities, and urogenital abnormalities contribute to the higher incidence and complexity of UTIs in elderly patients. Antimicrobial resistance, especially extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and carbapenem resistance, poses a major challenge in managing UTIs in this group. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective, multicenter study included 776 patients aged 65 and older, hospitalized with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection between January 2019 and August 2024. Clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were collected and analyzed. Urine samples were obtained under sterile conditions and pathogens identified using conventional and automated systems. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed according to CLSI standards. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with ESBL production, carbapenem resistance, and mortality. <b>Results:</b> Among the patients, the median age was 78.9 years, with 45.5% female. ESBL production was detected in 56.8% of <i>E. coli</i> isolates and carbapenem resistance in 1.2%. <i>Klebsiella</i> species exhibited higher carbapenem resistance (37.8%). Independent predictors of ESBL production included the presence of urogenital cancer and antibiotic use within the past three months. Carbapenem resistance was associated with recent hospitalization, absence of kidney stones, and infection with <i>non-E. coli</i> pathogens. Mortality was independently associated with intensive care admission at presentation, altered mental status, Gram-positive infections, and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and urinary incontinence. <b>Discussion:</b> Our findings suggest that urinary pathogens and resistance patterns in elderly patients are similar to those in younger adults reported in the literature, highlighting the need for age-specific awareness in empiric therapy. The identification of risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms emphasizes the importance of targeted antibiotic stewardship, especially in high-risk geriatric populations. Multicenter data contribute to regional understanding of resistance trends, aiding clinicians in optimizing management strategies for elderly patients with UTIs. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights that <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i> species are the primary causes of UTIs in the elderly, with resistance patterns similar to those seen in younger adults. The findings also contribute important data on risk factors for ESBL production and carbapenem resistance, supported by a robust patient sample.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 has been linked to prolonged immune dysfunction and long-term health complications. Herpes zoster (HZ), a marker of impaired cell-mediated immunity, may signal increased vulnerability to infections, cardiovascular disease, and potentially cancer. However, its association with colorectal cancer (CRC) after COVID-19 has not been fully explored. To investigate the long-term risks of cardiovascular events, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and CRC in COVID-19 survivors who developed HZ compared to those who did not. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Global Collaborative Network. Adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2022 were included. Among the full cohort (aged ≥18 years), 27,664 patients with post-COVID HZ were identified. Due to platform limitations, propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to a restricted subgroup of patients aged 55-60 years, yielding a 1:1 matched cohort for controlled comparisons. Outcomes were assessed over a three-year follow-up. In the matched age-restricted cohort, patients with post-COVID HZ had significantly higher risks of cardiovascular events, acute respiratory failure, sepsis, and CRC compared to matched controls. Subgroup analyses identified age ≥ 50, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension as strong independent risk factors across outcomes. Despite the low absolute CRC incidence, cancer-free survival significantly favored the non-HZ group. Herpes zoster reactivation after COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Enhanced surveillance and early CRC screening may benefit this high-risk population.",

        "abstract": "Protocol biopsies are a fundamental component in the management of kidney transplant recipients, offering critical insights into graft health by detecting subclinical pathological changes undetectable through routine clinical and laboratory assessments. Conducted at predetermined intervals, these biopsies enable early identification of subclinical rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy, drug-induced toxicities, viral infections such as BK polyomavirus nephropathy, and recurrence of primary glomerular diseases. Early detection facilitates timely therapeutic interventions, including immunosuppressive regimen adjustments, which are pivotal in preserving graft function and improving long-term outcomes. While the optimal timing and frequency of protocol biopsies vary, early post-transplant biopsies within the first year are widely advocated. High-risk groups, including ABO- and HLA-incompatible recipients and those with recurrent primary nephropathies, particularly benefit from surveillance biopsies. Despite the invasive nature and associated risks of biopsy procedures, most experts agree that the benefits outweigh the risks in selected populations. However, the role of routine protocol biopsies in low-risk patients remains debated due to unclear long-term outcome improvements and resource considerations. Retrospective observational studies have demonstrated the ability of protocol biopsies to detect subclinical pathological changes such as rejection, drug toxicity, viral infections, and recurrent diseases before clinical or laboratory abnormalities appear. These studies also highlight the impact of biopsy-guided interventions on graft survival and management in high-risk groups (e.g., HLA- and ABO-incompatible recipients, and patients at risk for disease recurrence). Furthermore, randomized controlled trials provide higher-level evidence showing that protocol biopsy-guided interventions improve graft function, reflected by better serum creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rates, compared to indicated biopsies alone. They also emphasize the importance of both early and late surveillance biopsies for predicting long-term outcomes. Expert opinion and consensus acknowledge the benefits of protocol biopsies for early detection and tailored management but also highlight ongoing debates regarding their routine use in low-risk patients due to risks, costs, and resource considerations. Overall, protocol biopsies represent a valuable tool for personalized graft monitoring and management, aiding in early detection of complications, guiding immunosuppressive therapy, and enhancing graft longevity. Further multicenter randomized trials are needed to refine guidelines and optimize their clinical utility.",

Radiation dose to bone marrow throughout treatment was assessed at < 0.3 Gy for both patients, within safe limits. The highest contribution of radiation dose to bone marrow (60% and 47% for patient 1 and patient 2 respectively) was due to the radioactivity retained in blood before the first HD session. Cumulative radiation exposure to dialysis staff was well within local safety constraints (300μSv per year) at 7μSv and 23μSv for patient 1 and 2 respectively.

This evidence-based consensus statement summary provides recommendations for the assessment and monitoring of adults with MAFLD in primary care. Adults with type 2 diabetes, obesity or two or more other metabolic risk factors should be tested for MAFLD. Hepatic steatosis should be evaluated using ultrasound, whereas the presence and complications of type 2 diabetes and obesity should be assessed according to current Australian guidelines. Cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnoea are common in people with MAFLD and should be considered as part of a holistic health assessment. Alternative causes of hepatic steatosis, including excess alcohol consumption, must be considered, and patients with elevated serum aminotransferase levels should be tested for hepatitis B and C infection and iron overload. The risk of advanced liver fibrosis requires assessment using the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index; a low score (< 1.3) is associated with a more than 95% negative predictive value for advanced liver fibrosis. People with an indeterminate FIB-4 score (between 1.3 and 2.7) should undergo second-line assessment with liver elastography or a direct liver fibrosis serum test or, if these tests are unavailable, should be referred to an expert clinician in liver disease. People with MAFLD and a high FIB-4 score (> 2.7), an elevated direct liver fibrosis serum test, high elastography results or with clinical, laboratory or imaging evidence of cirrhosis should be referred for further evaluation. Individuals with a low FIB-4 score (< 1.3), low elastography or direct liver fibrosis serum test results should be monitored with a repeat FIB-4 test at least every three years.

However, data on age-specific cardiometabolic multimorbidity and real-world treatment gaps remain limited. We conducted a retrospective study of 227 PLWH aged ≥50 years at a tertiary HIV center in Taiwan, stratified into premature-old (50-64 years) and old (≥65 years) groups.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate how IR, assessed via the estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR), and metabolism-related comorbidities influence new-onset CKD. This two-stage retrospective cohort study (cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses) used data from health check-up participants at the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital (2009-2021). The cross-sectional analysis included 83 346 participants with or without CKD; the longitudinal analyses included 13 738 participants without prior CKD who visited the hospital at least two times. The cross-sectional phase of this study analyzed the relationship between IR and CKD; the longitudinal phase analyzed the relationship between IR and new-onset CKD. The mediating role of metabolism-related comorbidities was also explored. In the cross-sectional analysis, 6.77% (n=5643) of patients had prior CKD. The eGDR was significantly higher in the non-CKD group than in the CKD group (9.16±2.11 vs 7.19±2.32, p<0.001). Higher eGDR was associated with lower CKD prevalence (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.93, P for trend<0.001). In the cohort analysis, the average time to trigger endpoint events was 2.95±2.02 years, with 403 (2.93%) new-onset CKD cases reported. A linear correlation was observed between eGDR and new-onset CKD (p<0.001), with higher eGDR linked to reduced CKD risk (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.96, P for trend=0.002). Mediation analysis revealed significant indirect effects of diabetes mellitus (17.1%), systolic blood pressure (22.0%), glycated hemoglobin (11.1%), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (9.7%) (all p<0.05). IR is independently linked to new-onset CKD, with blood glucose, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness mediating this relationship.

The National Kidney Foundation partnered with a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) to evaluate an approach to increase guideline-recommended testing among patients at high-risk for developing CKD. Through electronic health record (EHR) data analysis, eligible patients were identified to receive an at-home, semi-quantitative urine albumin-creatine ratio (uACR) testing kit. The kits provided immediate results via a smartphone application, as well as automatically routed to the clinic EHR for the patient's provider to coordinate necessary follow-up care. This initiative was conducted in Missouri, USA in 2023 and evaluated using domains of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Results reflect that 1496 of 4677 (32%) eligible patients completed uACR testing with 50% receiving abnormal results indicative of albuminuria. Of those with evidence of albuminuria, 84% had follow-up visits and 32% completed appropriate follow-up testing based on clinical guidelines. Albuminuria was prevalent across all age groups, with 69% of abnormal results appearing in patients under 60 years. Consistent with national data, patients identifying as Black were significantly more likely to have albuminuria in this cohort (<i>P</i> < .0001). Notably, most patients with albuminuria had an eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Findings highlight the urgency of improving uACR testing for early CKD diagnosis, especially in safety-net settings. The findings also demonstrate the utility of at-home testing to improve access to care across underserved communities and represent a replicable, efficient model to identify those with high risk of CKD progression. While the program required significant time and coordination, this can be streamlined for analogous programs. Future opportunities exist to further the impacts including additional quality improvement activities to ensure follow-up testing and close gaps in CKD care.",

        "abstract": "ObjectivesExercise is a frontline therapy for the management of chronic cardiometabolic disease, however traditional tertiary health care service models do not include exercise physiology. We aimed to explore professional roles, practices, and services regarding exercise care in chronic cardiometabolic disease from the perspectives of specialist doctors and nurses.MethodsUsing a qualitative description design, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 32 doctors and 26 nurses involved in the care of relevant patients with liver, kidney, or cardiac disease, or diabetes, across hospital and community settings in a Queensland metropolitan health service. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsFour overarching themes were identified. Despite universal acceptance of the multifactorial benefits of exercise, there was a lack of confidence in patients' capabilities to exercise and safety concerns due to complex comorbidities. Interviewees considered themselves 'promotors not prescribers' of exercise. There was no structured exercise history taken outside of cardiac rehabilitation units with significant variability in advice provided. Access to exercise specialist services was limited and disease-specific, with inconsistent and fragmented referral pathways. General Practitioners were considered responsible for facilitating exercise specialist involvement in ongoing care, with onus placed on patients to initiate.ConclusionsThere is an evidence-practice gap between the established benefits of exercise for chronic disease management and access to exercise professionals and services, resources, and knowledge. This deprioritises exercise as a frontline therapy with patient care implications. This study identified a need to transform the way that exercise care is accessed and delivered in tertiary settings.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent condition with substantial morbidity and mortality, and dietary and nutritional factors often play a key role in its progression. Choline, an essential nutrient, has been linked to various health outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the association between dietary choline intake and CKD remains unclear. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2005 to 2020, this study aimed to investigate the association between dietary choline intake and CKD among 29,094 participants. Dietary choline intake was assessed through two 24-hour recall interviews, and CKD was defined according to the 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines. To analyze the relationship between choline intake and CKD, weighted binary logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were applied. The study found that a higher dietary choline intake was inversely associated with the risk of CKD (odds ratio [OR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Participants in the highest quartile of choline intake had a significantly lower risk of CKD than those in the lowest quartile (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; <i>p <</i> 0.001). RCS analysis revealed a linear relationship between dietary choline intake and the risk of CKD. This study provides evidence of an inverse relationship between dietary choline intake and CKD risk, suggesting a potential protective role of choline in the prevention and management of CKD. Further longitudinal and molecular studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.",

In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, research has shifted from the traditional renal ischemia-centric view to a multidimensional interplay involving microcirculatory disturbances, immune metabolic disorders, and programmed cell death. Regarding diagnosis, traditional Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria exhibit limitations, whereas novel biomarkers and imaging techniques offer new avenues for early diagnosis. Therapeutic strategies encompass early intervention, hemodynamic management, renal replacement therapy, and targeted therapies; however, controversy persists regarding the optimal timing and methods of their initiation.

We compared traditional ML models (eg, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.86), outperforming XGBoost (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows.

MASLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as a condition of steatotic liver disease (SLD) with one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The variety of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Subjects with T2D have a doubled risk of developing MASLD, and vice versa. Furthermore, the presence of T2D is considered a risk factor for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related mortality in patients with MASLD as well as the presence of MASLD is associated with adverse outcomes in T2D population, including cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases. The relationship between MASLD and T2D is bidirectional. Given the fact that a mutually detrimental relationship between T2D and MASLD exists, the approach to managing MASLD is undergoing a transformative phase, with increasing attention toward the use of anti-hyperglycemic agents. In this review, we explore the emerging role of anti-hyperglycemic agents in the context of MASLD treatment, examining the latest scientific evidence and assessing the effectiveness of these novel approaches. Understanding the interconnection between diabetes and MASLD could open new therapeutic perspectives and guide the formulation of more effective treatment protocols for this growing metabolic epidemic.",

IgAN is characterized by episodic microscopic hematuria, which can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Managing therapeutic interventions for psoriasis patients requiring dialysis due to ESRD presents significant challenges. We present a case of severe plaque psoriasis in a patient concurrently diagnosed with IgAN who is dependent on hemodialysis. Over the past two months, his condition has worsened without any identifiable triggers. Physical examination revealed generalized scaly plaques on the scalp, trunk, and extremities, resulting in a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score of 19.2. Laboratory tests confirmed end-stage renal insufficiency, with no other abnormalities detected. Consequently, the patient was prescribed subcutaneous secukinumab following a standard regimen. He achieved complete resolution of symptoms after eight weeks of treatment and experienced no recurrence during a one-year follow-up. His kidney-related parameters remained stable during secukinumab therapy. To summarize, this case report discusses a patient with severe psoriasis who also has concurrent IgAN and ESRD, successfully treated with secukinumab. It reinforces the rapid efficacy and enduring safety of secukinumab in managing psoriasis in hemodialysis-dependent patients with IgAN comorbidity. Zeno Fratton et al has reported that an interleukin (IL)-17A/F inhibitor effectively treats moderate-to-severe psoriasis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

        "abstract": "Carcinoid tumours are rare, slow-growing neuroendocrine neoplasms that often remain asymptomatic until metastatic spread or the development of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is characterised by flushing, diarrhoea, and bronchospasm due to the secretion of vasoactive hormones. These tumours commonly arise in the gastrointestinal tract but can also occur in other organs, namely, the lungs, genitourinary tract, and pancreas. Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF), a rare inflammatory disease, involves chronic inflammation leading to fibrous scarring and compression of surrounding structures like the ureters and blood vessels. Carcinoid heart disease secondary to fibrous valve thickening can also occur and causes high morbidity and mortality. This case report highlights a 52-year-old woman who developed a rare complication of RPF along with carcinoid heart disease secondary to a carcinoid tumour. Her symptoms, initially misdiagnosed as menopausal, included a four-year history of diarrhoea, uncontrolled hypertension, and flushing. She was admitted with abdominal pain, acute kidney injury, and bilateral hydronephrosis. Imaging and biochemical tests revealed a primary ileocecal carcinoid tumour with hepatic metastases, RPF causing ureteric obstruction, and elevated chromogranin A/B and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels. Cardiac involvement included severe tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and impaired left ventricular function, consistent with carcinoid heart disease. Management involved nephrostomy placement following failed bilateral ureteric stenting, octreotide infusions to prevent carcinoid crisis, and symptomatic control with lanreotide. The patient continues to receive multidisciplinary care from cardiology, urology, and oncology. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing carcinoid tumours with atypical presentations and rare complications like RPF.",

However, early incident acute heart failure (HF) can lead to increased resource utilization postablation. In the Multicenter prospective Cohort study examining Left Atrial Pressure and the risk of early incident Heart failure after catheter ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (CLAPHAF) study, we examined risk factors for HF after AF ablation. Of the 286 subjects enrolled, 11.8% of subjects experienced incident HF a median 14 (12, 31) days from ablation. Risk factors for incident HF were persistent AF, recurrent post ablation AF, procedural IV fluid administration, longer case duration, and lower procedural blood pressures. A threshold of 1400 mL fluid administration had 2.21 odds ratio increase in incident HF (1.03-4.70, p = 0.04). The secondary endpoint of AF-free HF correlated with chronic kidney disease, lack of class 3 antiarrhythmic drug use, longer procedure duration, and increased IV fluid administration. Administration of ≥1400 mL corresponded with a 3.00 odds ratio for incident AF-free HF (1.03-8.72, p = 0.04). Multivariable analysis revealed no independent risk factors for HF or AF-free HF. In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, greater procedural IV fluid administration was a consistent risk factor for early incident HF after AF ablation, independent of recurrent AF. Low blood pressure during the case should perhaps trigger more pressor use and less fluid use in this population with impaired atrial function. A threshold of 1400 mL IV fluid administration is reasonable to consider periprocedural diuretic titration.",

Descriptive longitudinal retrospective study. The target population was non-hospitalized patients followed by an ostomy nurse specialist for more than 6 months in an ostomy clinic located in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. The sample comprised 360 persons with an ostomy; their mean age was 66.33 (SD 13.74) years; a slight majority 56.45% (n = 197) were men. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent ostomy surgery between January 2015 and December 2019. Sociodemographic and relevant clinical variables, reported symptoms, and use and perception of an abdominal compression binder, and the characteristics of PSH in patients with PSH were collected. The diagnosis of PSH was made by CT scan, physical examination, or a combination of both techniques. A majority of participants (71.7%, n = 258) underwent ostomy surgery to manage a malignancy; most (65.8%, n = 237) had not undergone previous abdominal surgeries. More than half (68.69%, n = 248) had comorbid conditions such as hypertension, thyroid disorders, dyslipidemia, cardiopathy, Parkinson disease, additional types of cancer such as breast, prostate and lung, depression, anxiety, benign prostatic hyperplasia/prostatic enlargement, or chronic kidney disease. Less than 1 in 10 (8.6%, n = 31) underwent intraoperative prophylactic mesh placement during ostomy surgery. Stoma site marking was performed in 44.7% (n = 161), and preoperative education with the ostomy nurse specialist was documented in 39.2% (n = 141). Presence of a PSH was determined by abdominal CT scan in 135 (37.5%), versus 41.49% (n = 149) who had a PSH detected by physical examination alone. Parastomal hernia severity was classified in 51.01% (n = 76) of cases; 81.57% (n = 62) were type I or III, based on the European Hernia Society classification system. The mean time of development of PSH was 8.57 (SD 6.09) months. In this study, patients with PSH were older and had more associated comorbidities. They had PSH-related discomfort and did not use an abdominal compression binder because it was uncomfortable.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to rise, highlighting the urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions to address its various complications including sarcopenia. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein found in mammalian breast milk, exhibits various biological activities and holds potential for treating CKD and its complications. This study investigated the effects of lactoferrin on CKD progression, its complications, and underlying mechanisms. A mouse model of adenine-induced renal failure was used as a CKD model. Lactoferrin was administered during the same period as adenine administration to assess its preventative effect on the progression of CKD. In another experiment, lactoferrin was administered after the adenine administration period to examine its effect on already advanced CKD. Effects of lactoferrin on renal function, renal pathology, and muscle atrophy were evaluated. Additionally, mechanistic insights were explored through mRNA and protein expression profiling, gut microbiota characterization, and metabolomic analysis. Lactoferrin administration improved reduction of renal function, and mitigated renal atrophy, and tubulointerstitial damage, and ameliorated skeletal muscle atrophy in CKD mice. In the skeletal muscle, CKD induced aberrant activation of mTOR1, impaired autophagy, and disrupted branched-chain amino acid metabolism. These abnormal activation of the proteolysis pathways was ameliorated by lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrin attenuated dysbiosis-induced production of microbiota-derived uremic toxins, thereby reducing the indoxyl sulfate accumulation in blood and muscle. These effects contributed to decreased renal damage and delayed sarcopenia progression. Collectively, these findings suggest that lactoferrin may serve as a promising preventive and therapeutic agent for CKD-associated sarcopenia via the gut-kidney-skeletal muscle axis.",

This systematic review seeks to enhance our understanding of the clinical characteristics, genotype-phenotype correlations, and treatment outcomes in patients with complete CFI deficiency, including three novel cases. We conducted a comprehensive literature review of cases published from 1996 to November 2024, identifying 49 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the CFI gene. Among the 49 patients, the mean age at initial presentation was 7.19 (± SD: 9.75) years. Most patients presented with infectious manifestations (n: 37, 75.5%), particularly sepsis (n: 18, 36.7%). The predominant pathogens were encapsulated organisms, particularly Neisseria meningitidis. Immune dysregulatory manifestations involved rheumatologic (n: 14, 28.57%), neurologic (n: 11, 22.4%), and renal (n: 8, 16.3%) disorders. Immunological evaluations showed low or absent levels of C3 and CFI in most patients. Genetic analysis identified 45 distinct mutations; less deleterious mutations, such as missense and splicing variants, were more common in those with immune dysregulation. Notably, three patients treated with eculizumab demonstrated significant clinical improvement. Complete CFI deficiency presents a varied clinical spectrum, from asymptomatic to recurrent infections and immune dysregulation. Early diagnosis and targeted therapies, such as eculizumab, may improve patient outcomes.

Compared with those meeting both LDL-C and non-HDL-C thresholds, being above both thresholds was associated with an increased rate of the primary outcome for people without diabetes/CKD (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.15) and for those with diabetes/CKD (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.09-1.23). Being below the LDL-C threshold but above non-HDL-C threshold was associated with an increased rate of the primary outcome for people with diabetes/CKD (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.30). These findings support the residual risk associated with incompletely controlled LDL-C or non-HDL-C levels after statin initiation for primary prevention.",

        "title": "Global, regional, and national prevalence of kidney failure with replacement therapy and associated aetiologies, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",
        "abstract": "Kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) such as dialysis or transplantation represents a severe stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and poses a major global health burden. Although many CKD cases are diagnosed in the earlier stages, the greatest risk occurs when CKD progresses to KFRT. Despite its considerable financial and imposing impact on public health, there is a notable gap in international policies addressing CKD and KFRT. To bridge this gap and help policy makers and health systems effectively tackle the public health challenge of KFRT, a better understanding of the disease burden is essential. Thus, this analysis aims to provide a detailed overview of the global prevalence of KFRT and its associated aetiologies with estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) from 1990 to 2023. This study defined KFRT as individuals on maintenance dialysis for 90 days or more or those who have undergone a kidney transplant, aligning with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Renal registries served as the primary data sources. Prevalence and underlying aetiology estimates (type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and other causes) were generated with DisMod-MR 2.1, an epidemiological Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression modelling tool. Both all-age and age-standardised estimates were reported and accompanied with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2023, the number of global cases of KFRT was 4·59 million (95% UI 4·17-5·08) for both sexes and all ages, with an age-standardised prevalence of 50·7 (46·1-56·0) per 100 000 population. Over the past three decades, there has been a steady increase in KFRT prevalence globally. The highest prevalence was found in the GBD high-income regions, while the lowest was observed in sub-Saharan Africa. KFRT prevalence was generally higher in countries classified within the World Bank's high-income and upper-middle-income groups, while lower prevalence was more common in countries within the World Bank's low-income and lower-middle-income groups. Additionally, a pronounced sex disparity was identified, where male dialysis and transplant prevalence estimates were consistently higher than those for females in most countries. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension were among the leading associated aetiologies of KFRT globally. From 1990 to 2023, the all-age and age-standardised prevalence estimates across the ascribed aetiologies increased for KFRT, with the largest increases associated with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. KFRT affects approximately 5 million people globally, with high treatment and mortality costs. Our study unveiled considerable geographical variation in KFRT prevalence, which should be seen as indicators of health-care system opportunities. As the prevalence of the leading aetiologies of KFRT-type 2 diabetes and hypertension-continues to rise, there is a crucial need to prioritise the development and implementation of cost-effective strategies aimed at preventing CKD and its progression to KFRT, particularly in low-resource settings. These preventive efforts must happen in tandem with efforts to expand capacity for dialysis and transplant services. Gates Foundation.",

        "title": "The Role of Non-HDL Cholesterol and Apolipoprotein B in Cardiovascular Disease: A Comprehensive Review.",
        "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading global cause of morbidity and mortality, even in the era of aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. This persistent residual risk has prompted a reevaluation of atherogenic lipid markers, with non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) emerging as superior indicators of the total atherogenic particle burden. Unlike LDL-C, non-HDL-C includes cholesterol from all atherogenic lipoproteins, while Apo B reflects the total number of atherogenic particles regardless of cholesterol content. Their clinical relevance is underscored in populations with diabetes, obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia, where LDL-C may not adequately reflect cardiovascular risk. This review explores the biological, clinical, and genetic foundations of non-HDL-C and Apo B as critical tools for risk stratification and therapeutic targeting. It highlights discordance analysis, inflammatory mechanisms in atherogenesis, the influence of metabolic syndromes, and their utility in specific populations, including those with chronic kidney disease and children with familial hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, the role of lipoprotein (a), glycation in diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia are examined as contributors to residual risk. Clinical trials and genetic studies support Apo B and non-HDL-C as more robust predictors of cardiovascular events than LDL-C. Current guidelines increasingly endorse these markers as secondary or even preferred targets in complex lipid disorders. The incorporation of Apo B and non-HDL-C into routine clinical practice, especially for patients with residual risk, represents a paradigm shift toward personalized cardiovascular prevention. The review concludes with recommendations for guideline integration, emerging therapies, and future directions in biomarker-driven cardiovascular risk management.",

        "abstract": "Acute heart failure (AHF) is a major cause of hospitalizations, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems. Despite advancements in management, the rate of poor outcomes remains high globally, emphasizing the need for timely interventions. This study aimed to identify early admission-based factors predictive of poor outcomes in hospitalized AHF patients, in order to contribute to early risk stratification and optimize patient care. This retrospective single-center study analyzed routine data of adult patients hospitalized for AHF at a public university teaching hospital in Switzerland. Outcomes included in-hospital death, intensive care (ICU) treatment, and length of hospital stay (LOHS). Potential predictors were limited to routine parameters, readily available at admission. Missing predictor data was imputed and predictors were identified by means of multivariable regression analysis. Data of 638 patients (median age 84 years, range 45-101 years, 50% female) were included in the study. In-hospital mortality was 7.1%, ICU admission rate 3.8%, and median LOHS was 8 days (IQR 5-12). Systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg (Odds ratio (OR) 3.8, <i>p</i> = 0.009), peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 90% or oxygen supplementation (OR 5.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and peripheral edema (OR 2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.044) at hospital admission were identified as predictors of in-hospital death. Furthermore, a stroke or transient ischemic attack in the patient's history (OR 3.2, <i>p</i> = 0.023) was associated with in-hospital death. ICU admission was associated with oxygen saturation ≤ 90% or oxygen supplementation (OR 22.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Factors linked to longer LOHS included oxygen saturation ≤ 90% or oxygen supplementation (IRR 1.2, <i>p</i> < 0.001), recent weight gain (IRR 1.1, <i>p</i> = 0.028), and concomitant chronic kidney disease (IRR 1.2, <i>p</i> < 0.001). This study validated established predictors of AHF outcomes in a Swiss cohort, highlighting the predictive value of poor perfusion status, fluid overload, and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease. The identified predictors imply potential for developing tools to improve rapid treatment decisions. Future research should focus on the prospective external validation of the identified predictors and the design and validation of risk scores, incorporating these parameters to optimize early interventions and reduce adverse outcomes in AHF.",

        "title": "Fracture Risk in Chronic Kidney Disease: Addressing an Overlooked Complication.",
        "abstract": "Fracture risk is a serious yet underrecognized complication among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in those with stages G3-G5D. The overlap between CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) and osteoporosis leads to complex bone changes that increase the likelihood of fragility fractures. Studies show that 18% to 32% of CKD patients also have osteoporosis, and these individuals are more than 2.5 times as likely to suffer from fractures compared to those without CKD. In the advanced stages of the disease, fracture risk is up to four times higher than in the general population, with the femur, forearm, and humerus being the most commonly affected sites. Hip fractures are of particular concern as they are linked to longer hospital stays and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, dialysis patients who experience hip fractures have a mortality rate 2.4 times higher than those in the general population with similar fractures. This increased risk underscores the need for proactive bone health maintenance in CKD patients to prevent fractures and related complications. This review explores the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic challenges, and treatment options related to bone fragility in CKD. Diagnostic tools, such as bone mineral density (BMD) assessments, the trabecular bone score (TBS), and biochemical markers, remain underused, especially in advanced CKD stages. Recent treatment strategies emphasize a multidisciplinary, stage-specific approach, incorporating calcium and vitamin D supplements, anti-resorptive agents like denosumab, and anabolic therapies such as teriparatide and romosozumab. Effective management needs to be tailored to the patient's bone turnover status and stage of CKD. Despite progress in understanding bone fragility in CKD, significant gaps remain in both diagnosis and treatment. Personalized care, guided by updated KDIGO recommendations and based on an interdisciplinary approach, is essential to reduce fracture risk and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population. Further research is needed to validate risk assessment tools and refine therapeutic protocols.",

We aim to show NSAIDs can be safely administered to arthroplasty patients with a pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> without causing a permanent reduction in post-operative eGFR and, in doing so, minimise opioid use. We prospectively collected data from patients with a pre-operative eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> undergoing arthroplasty between January 2018 and June 2023 at St John of God Ballarat Hospital, Australia. Baseline eGFR was obtained pre-operatively, and on at least 1 of days 1, 2, 10, or a follow-up review appointment of at least 4 weeks. Patients received tailored dosing of perioperative NSAIDs corresponding to pre-operative eGFR. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined using the RIFLE criteria. We identified 221 patients. Median baseline eGFR was 50 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and median eGFR recovery at latest follow-up was 109% of baseline eGFR. 28% of the cohort had a clinically significant reduction in eGFR on day 1 post-operatively, and by latest follow-up, this subgroup had a median recovery of 106% of baseline eGFR. At the 2-week follow-up, there were no cases of AKI, and by latest follow-up, no patients had a clinically significant reduction of baseline eGFR. Perioperative NSAIDs in renally impaired patients undergoing arthroplasty surgery can be safely given using an adjusted dose protocol based on pre-operative renal function. Future studies investigating the circumspect use of NSAIDs for pain management during arthroplasty are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Existing research has revealed that various factors, including environmental pollutants, can affect renal function. This study aims to explore the association between various synthetic Endocrine Disruptors(EDs), which are widely present in the environment, and the renal function of middle-aged and older adult populations. Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2015 to 2018, a total of 1,199 participants, with a median age of 57 years, who had CKD or at least one CKD complication (such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperuricemia), were included. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on the relationship between 28 synthetic EDs (including perfluoro/polyfluoroalkyl compounds, phosphorus-containing pesticides, and plasticizers) and renal function. Serum concentrations of synthetic EDs were determined using mass spectrometry. Renal function was assessed through urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR) measurements. The quantile regression models were employed to explore the association between synthetic EDs and renal function. The grouped regression models were used to investigate the differential associations of synthetic EDs with non-CKD and CKD populations. In this study, N-perfluorooctanoic acid, MECP phthalate, and Diethylthiophosphate were found to exert damaging effects on renal function. N-perfluorooctanoic acid and MECP phthalate were observed to exhibit differential associations with non-CKD and CKD populations. There was a significant difference in the effect of N-perfluorooctanoic acid between the non-CKD and CKD groups. N-perfluorooctanoic acid was not associated with renal function impairment in the non-CKD group, whereas it exhibited a significant adverse association in the CKD group. There was a significant difference in the effect of MECP phthalate between the non-CKD and CKD groups. MECP phthalate was associated with renal function impairment in the non-CKD group, but not in the CKD group. This study elucidates the associations and differences of synthetic EDs with renal function. Based on the findings, enhanced monitoring and health education regarding environmental exposure to synthetic EDs such as N-perfluorooctanoic acid, MECP phthalate, and Diethylthiophosphate can be implemented to reduce public exposure risks.",

        "abstract": "Managing osteoporosis (OP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents significant challenges due to altered bone metabolism. Given the lack of robust clinical trial data and a notable knowledge gap exists among nephrologists regarding an optimal management in this population, an expert consensus is crucial for developing tailored management strategies. This study aimed to gather an expert opinion to bridge this gap and establish consensus recommendations on the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in CKD patients. A panel of 13 Indian and 1 international experts, including nephrologists and endocrinologists, participated in a structured survey and discussion process. Thirteen Indian experts provided their opinion on key clinical issues, including screening, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for osteoporosis in CKD. Consensus was achieved in a single round of voting, and recommendations were formulated based on the level of agreement among the panelists. The expert panel reached a strong consensus (80-100% agreement) on several critical recommendations. It was agreed that osteoporosis in CKD is often asymptomatic, with fragility fractures being less common, and thus, early screening using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is essential. The panel emphasized the importance of evaluating bone turnover status using serum biomarkers such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) to guide treatment decisions. Tailored treatment strategies were recommended, with a judicious use of bisphosphonates and denosumab, depending on the patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and bone turnover state. The management of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) was deemed necessary before addressing CKD-induced osteoporosis. This expert consensus provides critical insights and guidance for the management of osteoporosis in CKD. The recommendations emphasize individualized treatment approaches, the importance of early screening, and the integration of multidisciplinary care. These findings aim to fill existing knowledge gaps and improve clinical outcomes for CKD patients with osteoporosis.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcomes of spinal surgery in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those undergoing dialysis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager software, utilizing mean differences (MD), odds ratios (OR), and random effects models to account for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary outcomes were operative time, estimated blood loss, need for blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, and the incidence of complications, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), surgical site infection (SSI), reoperation, and in-hospital mortality. Twelve studies involving over 5 million patients were included, comparing outcomes in CKD and dialysis patients undergoing spinal surgery to those without CKD or dialysis, respectively. CKD patients experienced a significantly shorter operative time (MD, -12.63 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], -14.49 to -10.78) and longer hospital stays (MD, 1.51 days; 95% CI, 1.28-1.74), with moderate heterogeneity (I2=37%).

By determining high-risk groups and key anxiety triggers, the research seeks to provide insights for improving pre-procedural communication and patient preparation. A total of 1242 patients aged between 18 and 90 years were included in the study. In this cross-sectional and observational study, the anxiety levels of the patients were measured using data collected through face-to-face interviews and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants' demographic information, medical history and previous endoscopy experiences were recorded. Among the participants, 52.7% (n = 654) reported anxiety related to the procedure. Women (n = 645) exhibited higher anxiety levels than men (STAI-I score: 43.28 ± 13.06 vs. 41.52 ± 12.93, p = 0.017). Chronic conditions, such as COPD (mean STAI-I score: 52.53 ± 9.39, p < 0.001), cardiac disorders (49.68 ± 11.58, p = 0.014), and chronic kidney disease (55.50 ± 10.42, p = 0.004), were associated with significantly elevated anxiety levels. Additionally, patients with depression (50.86 ± 9.19, p < 0.001) and panic disorder (51.12 ± 5.99, p < 0.001) exhibited higher anxiety. Prior experience with endoscopy did not significantly reduce anxiety, with 40% (n = 497) having undergone the procedure before. Notably, 46.7% (n = 580) of participants reported prior knowledge of the procedure, but this did not correspond with significantly lower anxiety levels. Anxiety before endoscopic procedures was observed to be common among patients and may directly affect the quality of the procedure. High rates of anxiety in women and individuals with chronic diseases are consistent with the literature. Accurate and comprehensive information of patients prior to the procedure appears to be critical in reducing anxiety levels.",

        "abstract": "Congenital lower urinary tract obstruction due to posterior urethral valves (PUV) often results in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal replacement therapy (RRT). The Posterior Urethral Valve Risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (PURK) score, a validated prognostic tool, uses clinical variables at presentation to predict development of CKD stage 3 or higher. However, its role in predicting progression to RRT remains unexplored. This study evaluates the utility of the PURK score for RRT risk stratification internationally, aiming to facilitate early counseling and management for affected families. Patients with posterior urethral valves (PUV) presenting before age 1 were analyzed from internal and external databases (9 institutions), excluding early RRT events (<14 days). PURK scores were calculated. ROC curves assessed predictive accuracy and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis stratified risk groups. External validation involved data from eight international centers. Internal validation from 183 PUV patients at a single center, with a median follow-up of 8.1 years, was analyzed. This showed significant differences in PURK score distribution between patients who progressed to RRT (15.1 %) and those who did not. Kaplan-Meier curves identified low- (0-1, 0 %), intermediate- (2-3, 9.6 %), and high-risk groups (≥4, 37.5 %) for RRT progression. AUROC values demonstrated good predictive ability for 1-, 5-, and 10-year RRT events (0.798-0.839). External validation of 265 patients confirmed these findings, with excellent AUROC values for 1-, 5-, and 10-year RRT events (0.868-0.885) and consistent survival stratification. We identified clear risk groups for progression to RRT using survival analysis, with those with high PURK score being much more likely to progress to RRT compared to lower scores. Being able to prognosticate patients into different risk groups is important as it can guide frequency of follow up and early interventions including alpha-blockers, anticholinergics, or clean intermittent catheterization for children with higher risk profiles. The PURK score is a reliable tool for early prediction and risk stratification of progression to RRT in PUV patients.",

        "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to kidney dysfunction through mechanisms involving glomerular, tubular, and vascular injuries. Although hyperuricemia has traditionally been classified into overproduction and underexcretion types, recent evidence highlights the importance of intrarenal urate handling, particularly tubular reabsorption, in the pathogenesis of CKD. In this review, we revisit the physiology of renal urate transport and summarize the clinical evidence that links hyperuricemia to CKD progression. We also summarize the current evidence regarding urate-lowering therapies, mainly focusing on novel selective urate reabsorption inhibitors (SURIs) and kidney outcomes. Based on emerging data, we propose a refined classification of hyperuricemia in CKD that stratifies patients into glomerular under-filtration and tubular over-reabsorption subtypes using a novel index that integrates both glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption. This new classification may better guide individualized treatment strategies for CKD patients with hyperuricemia.",

        "abstract": "Although pesticide application is indispensable for agricultural productivity, improper use can pose significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations. This study investigated the effects of pesticide exposure on metabolic pathways and disease progression among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This longitudinal study enrolled 89 CKD patients. A total of 71 pesticides, including 9 carbamate pesticides, were detected in the urine samples. Our findings indicated that higher concentrations of carbamates, possibly from the diet, may significant be associated with oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial energy metabolism in CKD patients. Integrating machine learning approach identified l-glutamine (L-Glu), 3-chlorotyrosine, and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine as potential biomarkers of pesticide exposure, with an area under the curve of >0.903 based on machine learning- a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Both CKD and pesticide exposure were associated with abnormalities in amino acid and energy metabolism. Key metabolites such as L-cysteine, Acetyl-CoA, L-Glu, and L-histidine were identified as endogenous markers capable of predicting changes in both renal dysfunction and pesticide exposure among CKD patients. Detecting exposure-related metabolic alterations through metabolomics enables early identification and aids in the understanding and potential prevention of kidney disease progression. This study further can explore the clinical applicability and improve predictive value of these biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular problems are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among renal transplant and hemodialysis patients. This study evaluates the preoperative risk factors and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing heart surgery. A total of 83 patients (47 post-renal transplant recipients and 36 on hemodialysis) who underwent cardiac surgery and percutaneous coronary artery procedures at Dr. Siyami Ersek Heart Hospital between 2015 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed using hospital electronic records without selection bias. Demographic information, such as age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index, cardiac surgery type, and preoperative laboratory findings were recorded. Renal transplant recipients and hemodialysis patients undergoing heart surgery showed no significant differences in age, sex, or comorbidities (P > 0.05). Both groups had a high percentage of patients with elevated fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein levels. Additionally, body mass index and the triglyceride-glucose index were elevated, indicating insulin resistance. Renal transplant recipients with low preoperative glomerular filtration rate and hemoglobin levels < 10 g/dL had a higher risk of developing acute kidney injury. Four patients (9%) experienced graft loss after acute kidney injury, requiring hemodialysis. Mortality rates did not differ significantly between the groups (P > 0.56). Cardiovascular surgery can be safely performed in both renal transplant recipients with functional allografts and end-stage kidney disease patients on hemodialysis. Identifying and managing risk factors in these patients, who frequently experience cardiovascular complications, will lead to better outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Current guidelines lack sex-specific thresholds for assessing secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) severity and right ventricular (RV) and tricuspid annulus (TA) remodeling. We aimed to determine whether risk-based cutoffs for these parameters differ between men and women with STR. We included 554 patients (74±13 years, 51% women) with moderate or severe STR. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization (HHF). Women were older (p<0.001) and had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.008) and atrial-STR (p<0.001), whereas men more frequently had coronary artery disease (p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (p=0.005), and mitral regurgitation (p<0.001). Women exhibited smaller RV and TA dimensions and higher RV ejection fraction (RVEF) (p<0.001). Over a median follow-up of 19 (8-27) months, 230 patients reached the composite endpoint. Event-free survival at two-years was comparable between sexes (p=0.183), even after inverse-propensity weighting (p=0.342). Sex-specific thresholds for STR severity were lower in women for effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) (0.36cm² vs. 0.43cm²) and regurgitant volume (RegVol) (31mL vs. 35mL) but higher for regurgitant fraction (46% vs. 39%). Women also exhibited comparable risk at lower RV end-diastolic (81mL/m² vs. 96mL/m²) and end-systolic volumes (37mL/m² vs. 49mL/m²), higher RVEF (49% vs. 41%), and smaller TA diameter (19mm/m² vs. 22mm/m²). In STR, women face a similar risk at lower EROAs and RegVols, along with smaller RV volumes, higher RVEF, and reduced TA dimensions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating sex-specific thresholds into clinical decision-making when assessing STR severity and right heart remodeling.",

        "abstract": "End-stage heart failure remains a major global health challenge with high mortality. While heart transplantation is the gold-standard treatment, the scarcity of donor hearts necessitates alternative therapies. Left ventricular assist devices effectively support patients with end-stage left heart failure, but no mature biventricular assist devices (BiVAD) currently exist for those with biventricular failure. To address this gap, we developed the DuoCor BiVAD, a novel, integrated, magnetically levitated miniaturized biventricular assist system. This study reports the results of animal experiments and short-term clinical outcomes focusing on the DuoCor BiVAD. Animal experiments were conducted on three healthy adult male Chinese Merino sheep, with the endpoint being 2 months after device implantation, followed by retrieval and evaluation. Clinical data were collected from 8 patients who underwent DuoCor BiVAD implantation at ** Hospital between July 2024 and December 2024, with a median follow-up period of 6 months. During this period, device parameters, changes in patient heart function, and the occurrence of device-related adverse events (such as infection, thrombosis, and bleeding) were monitored. All animal implants achieved technical success (4.0 ± 0.7 h procedure time) with sustained 60-day hemodynamic stability and absence of device malfunction, thrombosis, or infection. In the clinical study, the median operative time was 5.1 hours, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 35 days. There were no in-hospital mortalities or device-related infections, and all patients were discharged home with DuoCor BiVAD support. During the 6-month postoperative follow-up period, one 81-year-old patient succumbed to frailty and COVID-19 infection two weeks post-discharge. The remaining seven patients survived with ongoing DuoCor BiVAD support, with no incidents of hemolysis, bleeding, device-related infection, or chronic renal insufficiency. This cohort includes one patient who developed right ventricular assist device thrombosis at 2 months post-implantation. Evaluation confirmed recovery of right ventricular function after the acute postoperative phase, prompting to discontinuation of right pump support. This patient subsequently maintained hemodynamic stability with left ventricular assist device support and experienced no further adverse events throughout follow-up. As a feasibility validation study of the first artificial biventricular assist device, DuoCor BiVAD demonstrated acceptable safety profiles during the short-term observation period. Although preliminary clinical outcomes were promising, these findings warrant cautious interpretation due to study size limitations and restricted follow-up duration. Furthermore, the device's integrated lightweight design and differential ventricular support technology confer advantages over existing solutions. Further validation through prospective multicenter cohort studies remains essential to establish long-term safety and efficacy profiles.",

        "abstract": "Diverticulosis is defined by the presence of multiple outpouchings (diverticula) originating from the intestinal lumen. Diverticulitis is defined as inflammation of these diverticula. The annual incidence of diverticulitis in the US is approximately 180 per 100 000 people, resulting in approximately 200 000 hospital admissions annually and an estimated health care expenditure of more than $6.3 billion/year. Risk factors for diverticular disease include age older than 65 years, genetic factors such as variant in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 (TNFSFI5) gene; connective tissue diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, Marfan syndrome, or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; body mass index 30 or greater; use of opioids, steroids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; hypertension; and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with diverticulosis will develop acute diverticulitis in their lifetime, which typically presents as left lower quadrant pain associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, and leukocytosis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan is the recommended diagnostic test and has a sensitivity of 98% to 99% and specificity of 99% to 100%. Approximately 85% of people with acute diverticulitis have uncomplicated diverticulitis (absence of abscess, colon strictures, colon perforation, or fistula formation). Management of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis consists of observation with pain management (typically acetaminophen) and dietary modification with a clear liquid diet. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with systemic symptoms such as persistent fever or chills, those with increasing leukocytosis, those older than 80 years, those who are pregnant, those who are immunocompromised (receiving chemotherapy, or high-dose steroids, or have received an organ transplant), and those with chronic medical conditions (such as cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or poorly controlled diabetes). First-line antibiotics consist of oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefalexin with metronidazole. For patients who cannot tolerate oral intake, intravenous antibiotic therapy (ie, cefuroxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or ampicillin/sulbactam) is appropriate. Complicated diverticulitis is managed with intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam and additional invasive management as indicated (ie, percutaneous drainage of associated intra-abdominal abscess or colon resection). Patients with generalized peritonitis should undergo emergent laparotomy with colonic resection. Postoperative mortality for diverticulitis managed electively or emergently is 0.5% for elective colon resection and 10.6% for emergent colon resection. In the US, diverticulitis affects approximately 180 per 100 000 people annually. For uncomplicated diverticulitis, first-line therapy is observation and pain control, and antibiotics should be initiated for patients with persistent fevers, increasing leukocytosis, sepsis or septic shock, advanced age, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and certain chronic medical conditions. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis includes intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam, and, if indicated, percutaneous drainage of abscess or resection of diseased segment of colon.",

While diagnostic criteria have become standardized, predictors of systemic complications remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with the development of systemic complications following operative FRI management. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a single Level I trauma center from 2013 to 2021. Adult patients with postoperative FRI requiring hospitalization and surgical treatment were included. Patients required either six months of follow-up or development of a systemic complication before that point. Systemic complications included cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), acute kidney injury (AKI), sepsis, and mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, injury characteristics, lab values, and operative details were compared between patients with and without complications. A total of 281 patients with FRI were included, with 70 (24.9%) experiencing systemic complications. The mean age of patients with complications was significantly higher (51.7 years) compared to those without (43.8 years, p < 0.001). Systemic complications included sepsis (11.7%), AKI (8.2%), DVT/PE (5.0%), and mortality (2.5%).

No significant differences were observed in fracture characteristics, operative details, or preoperative laboratory values (white blood cell [WBC] count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], albumin, prealbumin) between the groups. Multivariate analysis identified higher CCI as an independent risk factor for systemic complications (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.31-2.57; p = 0.001). Patient characteristics such as age, diabetes, CVD, COPD, CVA, CKD, and CCI differed significantly in patients with FRI who experienced systemic complications from those without.

Hyperkalemia frequently occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can become life-threatening when severe, necessitating prompt treatment regardless of its underlying cause. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) are a recognized risk factor for hyperkalemia in CKD; however, discontinuing RASi in response to elevated potassium levels may adversely affect patient outcomes. Although there are no formal criteria distinguishing acute from chronic hyperkalemia, symptoms presentation and potassium levels offer a practical guide for clinical management.

Heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) share similar cardiovascular risk factors and have a bi-directional relationship. A comprehensive approach including early screening of HF patients for CKD as well as management involving the nephrologist and cardiologist will most definitely reduce morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of and correlates for Type 2 CRS among HF patients in JUTH, Jos-Nigeria. A hospital-based cross-sectional descriptive study carried out in JUTH involving 120 patients with chronic HF recruited consecutively. History, physical examination and laboratory investigations including urinalysis using albustix were performed on all subjects. CKD was determined using estimated glomerular function rate (eGFR) and persistent albuminuria. The data were analyzed using Epi Info (CDC, Atlanta GA) and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The mean age of the participants was 52.00 ± 11.44 years, majority of whom were females consisting of 58.3%. The prevalence of CRS was 37.5%. Majoity (66.7%) of the patients had mild CRS, while 26.7% had moderate CRS, and only 6.7% had the severe CRS. The predictors of CRS were diabetes (OR=6.230; CI=2.094-19.093), New York heart Association (NYHA) grading I (OR=0.017; CI=0.002-0.142) and II (OR=0.089; CI=0.016-0.483), raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) (OR=7.099; CI=2.671-18.865), loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound (P2) (OR=3.769; CI=1.726-8.232), systolic dysfunction (EF<45%) (OR=3.316; CI=1.487-7.395), anaemia (OR=5.091; CI=1.657-15.640), albuminuria (OR:0.014, CI=0.004-0.052), rural/suburban dwelling (OR=2.875; CI=1.335-6.192) and increased cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) (OR=3.237; CI=1.019-10.278).

This paper reviews recent data on the mechanisms and pathways that integrate gut-brain-kidney signaling and communication, advances in our understanding of this axis, and potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and interventions for CKD. Literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase using a combination of the keywords gut microbiota, gut microbiome, gut-brain axis, gut-kidney axis, gut-brain-kidney axis, chronic kidney disease, dysbiosis, therapy, metabolites, and neuroinflammation.\" Relevant studies were selected and synthesized in this narrative review. Gut dysbiosis, characterized by microbial composition and function alterations, contributes to systemic inflammation and metabolic imbalances, exacerbating CKD progression. Uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, derived from microbial metabolism, impair kidney function and disrupt neurocognitive health via oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, highlighting the interconnectedness of these systems. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and metabolomics have elucidated mechanisms linking gut microbiota and associated metabolites to kidney and brain health, revealing the role of microbial diversity and metabolite profiles in disease outcomes. Studies demonstrate that probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions targeting the gut microbiota can modulate systemic inflammation and reduce uremic toxin levels, offering therapeutic potential.

While pharmacological treatments are commonly used to manage these symptoms, non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise, have gained attention for their potential to alleviate both physical and psychological symptoms without additional medication-related side effects. Compared to other strategies that often target a limited range of symptoms-such as meditation for depression or music therapy for anxiety-exercise offers broader benefits, making it particularly promising for patients receiving HD. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise intervention in reducing the symptom burden among patients receiving HD in Hail City, Saudi Arabia. A quasi-experimental pre-post intervention design was employed, involving (n = 72) HD patients recruited through convenience sampling from King Salman Specialist Hospital and King Khalid Hospital. Participants engaged in a structured exercise program for 12 weeks, with sessions conducted three times per week for 30 min. Symptom severity was assessed using the Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI) before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests, with a significance level set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. A total of 72 HD patients participated in the study. The exercise intervention led to a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom severity scores, decreasing from 105.94 ± 9.77 pre-intervention to 102.50 ± 9.61 post-intervention (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Significant improvements were noted in multiple symptoms, including constipation (<i>p</i> = 0.002), decreased appetite (p < 0.001), restless legs (<i>p</i> = 0.001), fatigue (<i>p</i> < 0.001), joint pain (<i>p</i> = 0.045), difficulty concentrating (<i>p</i> = 0.045), and several emotional symptoms such as worrying (<i>p</i> = 0.024), nervousness (<i>p</i> = 0.002), trouble sleeping (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and feelings of sadness (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Sociodemographic factors, including younger age, female gender, shorter dialysis duration, and higher comorbidity burden, were significantly associated with greater baseline symptom severity. The findings demonstrate that a structured exercise program is an effective non-pharmacological intervention for reducing symptom burden among HD patients. These results support incorporating exercise into routine HD care to enhance patient well-being. Future initiatives should focus on integrating supervised, accessible exercise programs into dialysis centers to maximize adherence and therapeutic benefit.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global public health issue, with a substantial population in China. Influenced by traditional Chinese medicine that links kidney health to sexual vitality, people with CKD in China face unique societal stigmatization. This study aimed to explore the stigmatization experiences of individuals with CKD in China and their corresponding coping strategies. Employing a focused ethnographic approach, this research utilized participant observation within three WeChat groups and conducted offline semi-structured interviews with 30 individuals. The analysis of interviews and field transcripts reveals that people with CKD in China adopt a dualistic coping strategy metaphorically described as \"huddling for warmth\": they externally conceal their condition to avoid social stigma while internally cultivating a strong communal identity through online and offline interactions. Despite the prevalent stigma, these individuals demonstrate remarkable resilience and agency through their proactive coping mechanisms. This study highlights the urgent need for the Chinese government, medical institutions, and the public to address this deep-rooted stigma and foster a more inclusive and supportive environment to enhance the well-being of people living with CKD.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on oncological outcomes in patients with upper tract urothelial cancer (UTUC) undergoing radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) in Taiwan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Taiwan UTUC Collaboration database. 1590 patients who underwent RNU for UTUC were included in the analysis. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: those with adequate renal function and those with preoperative CKD. Overlap weighting was employed to address potential biases and baseline imbalances between the groups. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to analyze overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). Preoperative CKD was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (HR, 1.372; 95% CI, 1.060-1.775; P = .016) compared to patients with adequate renal function. However, no significant association was observed between CKD and CSS or DFS. Further analysis revealed that patients with advanced CKD had a higher risk of UTUC-related death due to competing risks of non-UTUC-related mortality. Preoperative CKD in UTUC patients undergoing RNU emerged as the sole risk factor for an inferior OS, without impacting CSS and DFS.",
