        "title": "Prevalence and Associated Factors of Prediabetes and Diabetes in Rural and Peri-Urban Bangladesh: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Background and objectives The global burden of prediabetes and diabetes is rising rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, where lifestyle and nutritional transitions are accelerating. Economically disadvantaged rural populations often lack awareness and access to care, making them highly vulnerable. Measuring the prevalence and identifying associated factors is essential for guiding public health strategies and resource allocation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi community to inform targeted prevention and control strategies. Methodology We recruited 891 adults for this cross-sectional study in January-June 2020 through random sampling from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System in Bangladesh, ensuring at least five years of residency. Trained Community Health Workers collected sociodemographic data using a semi-structured questionnaire and performed physical examination and anthropometric measurements. We used fasting blood sugar to screen patients for prediabetes and diabetes, and measured serum creatinine and urine albumin to creatinine ratio to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also collected blood samples to measure serum albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood and urine samples were tested in an accredited laboratory. Results Prevalence of prediabetes was 38% (n=343), and diabetes was 17% (n=151). Age-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 5%, 12% and 22%, and of diabetes were 1%, 3% and 13%, for the age groups of 18-30, 31-45, and ≥46 years, respectively. Sex-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 22% and 17%, and diabetes were 9% and 8%, for female and male participants, respectively. In multiple multinomial logistic regression, for prediabetes, significant risk factor was age ≥31 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.84, 95%CI 1.64-4.92), and protective factors were smokeless tobacco use (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.94) and hypoalbuminemia (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.24-0.99), and for diabetes, significant risk factors were age ≥31 years (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 1.37-11.95), abdominal obesity (aOR 2.80, 95%CI 1.49-5.30), CKD (aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.70-4.62), hypercholesterolemia (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.17-3.30) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.44-3.79), and protective factors were being female (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.066-0.68), and smokeless tobacco user (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.63). Conclusion This study reveals a high burden of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi population. The findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen community-based screening and targeted prevention strategies to address the growing diabetes burden in underserved areas.",

        "abstract": "Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan. UPF consumption varied across South Asia by sociodemographic factors including age, gender, and education. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial when designing interventions aimed at reducing UPF consumption. Our findings of regional variations in the types of UPFs consumed provide valuable insights for targeted interventions. The South Asia Biobank is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",

        "title": "The Cultural Tapestry of Tobacco Use in India: A Narrative Review.",
        "abstract": "In India, both smoking and nonsmoking forms of tobacco are deeply ingrained in cultural and regional customs. Being the largest producer and consumer of tobacco, India witnesses a wide variety of cigarettes, bidis, hookah, chilam, ghutka, pan masala, khaini, and betel quid with tobacco. The consumption of these products is based on sociocultural notions with variations across education, gender, and geography. Historically, smoking is linked with masculinity and authority, especially in rural areas. At the same time, female tobacco use is prevalent in neighboring countries like Bangladesh despite being stigmatized in Indian society. There, women cite oral health benefits and enhanced concentration as justification for consumption. The multifactorial behavior of tobacco consumption is influenced by social and cultural norms and practices. Hookah, cigars, and shisha often symbolize status in social gatherings. In the face of growing knowledge and awareness of its health hazards, strong association with oral precancerous lesions such as oral submucous fibrosis, erythroplakia, and leukoplakia, tobacco remains dangerously addictive and tough to quit. Significant geographic clustering was observed in different states and union territories of India, showing regional influences. Public health initiatives in India should be culturally tailored and area-specific, owing to the strong tobacco habits and cultural underpinnings. Targeted policy modifications that are cognizant of local customs and habits may boost the impact and efficacy of tobacco control programs and substantially lower the nationwide tobacco-related health burdens.",

        "abstract": "The high burden of blood pressure-related cardiovascular diseases in Bangladesh is potentially caused by excessive dietary sodium and insufficient potassium intake. Our objective is to estimate dietary salt and potassium intake among Bangladesh rural and urban adults from urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. We conducted a cross-sectional study between December 2017 and June 2018, including participants aged 30-59 years from three urban and three rural sites in Bangladesh. Data included urinary excretion of sodium and potassium estimated from one 24-hr urine collection and blood pressure measurements. Among 840 enrolled participants, complete data was available in 509 individuals. Mean age was 43.0 (SD ±7.9) years; 20.9% had hypertension, 50.9% were women, and 50.9% resided in urban areas. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 118.6 (SD ± 16.6) mmHg and 76.3 (SD ± 11.3) mmHg, respectively. Overall, the mean urinary sodium excretion was 3.9 g/day (95% CI = 3.8 to 4.0), corresponding to a mean salt intake of 9.7 g/day (95% CI = 9.4-10.1). Mean urinary potassium excretion was 1.4 g/day (95% CI = 1.3-1.4), corresponding to an estimated mean dietary potassium intake of 2.0 g/day. Men and urban residents had slightly but non-significantly higher sodium and potassium excretion than women and rural residents. In Bangladesh, salt intake exceeded WHO's recommended <5g/day limit, while potassium intake was substantially lower than the recommended intake of ≥ 3.5g/day for adults. Promoting low-sodium and potassium-rich diets through nationwide campaigns and policies, including advocating for accessible low-sodium and potassium-enriched salt substitutes, is recommended to mitigate cardiovascular disease risks.",

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

        "title": "Risk factors of under-five mortality in Tanzania: insights from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2022.",
        "abstract": "Under-five mortality (U5M) is a key indicator and major concern of population health globally, which reflects the quality of maternal and childcare facilities and health services. Despite the significant decline globally, the challenge remains, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, although Tanzania, a lower-middle-income country, is showing notable improvements, yet still needs attention to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Therefore, this study aims to explore the socioeconomic, maternal, child and environmental risk factors of U5M in Tanzania. This study is based on the secondary data extracted from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2022. The data consisting of 10 884 children were analysed through bivariate analysis, spatial analysis and a multilevel logistic regression model. It is observed that U5M was more prevalent in rural areas (adjusted OR (AOR): 1.878, 95% CI: 1.877 to 1.878). Findings also revealed that households that use improved drinking water (AOR: 0.921, 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.921) and are exposed to media (AOR: 0.945, 95% CI: 0.945 to 0.945) have lower odds for U5M. Multiple births (AOR: 5.518, 95% CI: 5.517 to 5.52) increased the odds of U5M, while postnatal care (AOR: 1.878, 95% CI: 1.877 to 1.878) and wealth index (poorer-AOR: 1.908, 95% CI: 1.908 to 1.909; middle-AOR: 1.533, 95% CI: 1.533 to 1.534; richer-AOR: 1.706, 95% CI: 1.705 to 1.706; richest-AOR: 2.950, 95% CI: 2.949 to 2.951) revealed counterintuitive results. It also revealed that minimum dietary diversity (AOR: 0.057, 95% CI: 0.057 to 0.057) reduces the chances of U5M, and the odds of mortality increase with child age. The study highlights the spatial variability and risk factors of U5M in Tanzania. Therefore, it is necessary to address the identified determinants for reducing U5M in Tanzania to achieve the targeted interventions by policymakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve child survival rates and meet the SDGs by 2030.",

        "abstract": "Contraception involves the deliberate prevention of conception through various methods, including mechanical devices, medications, behavioral strategies, or surgical techniques. This study aims to assess the socioeconomic and demographic determinants influencing the adoption of modern contraceptive methods among women. A cross-sectional study design was employed, using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-2018. Bivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with contraceptive use, followed by binary logistic regression to evaluate the influence of key socioeconomic and demographic factors. The study found that ~66.70% of respondents use modern contraceptive methods, predominantly those from urban areas with higher education levels. Conversely, 33.30% of respondents do not use modern contraceptives. Significant determinants of contraceptive use include division, place of residence, education level, husband's education, wealth index, religion, age at first birth, and husband's occupation. Notably, women with higher education are 1.644 times more likely to use modern contraceptives compared to those without education. Socioeconomic disparities influence contraceptive use, necessitating targeted policies to improve access, particularly in rural and underprivileged communities. Strengthening educational programs and reproductive health services can enhance informed family planning decisions.",

        "abstract": "In 2021, over 1.5 million adolescents (aged 10-19 years) and young adults (aged 20-24 years) died globally, approximately 4500 deaths daily. However, research on causes and factors influencing deaths among adolescents and young adults in Bangladesh is limited. We aimed to address this gap by identifying the leading causes of mortality and the factors affecting adolescent and young adult deaths. We conducted two cross-sectional, population-based surveys in urban Dhaka (December 2022) and rural Sitakunda (May 2023), covering 53 680 households and 250 249 individuals, with 72 530 aged 10-24 years. Between 2018-22, 163 deaths in this age group were recorded. We conducted verbal autopsies using the World Health Organization tool and assigned causes of death using the InSilicoVA algorithm. With descriptive statistics, we reported cause-specific mortality and utilised Cox proportional hazards models to estimate associations with background characteristics. Road traffic accidents were the primary cause of death, accounting for 10% (n = 17) among adolescents and 10% (n = 16) among young adults, followed by respiratory diseases (14% in adolescents and 3% in young adults). Older adolescents (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-3.0) and young adults (AHR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-1.4) had a higher risk of death compared to early adolescents. Individuals with high wealth status had a lower risk of death (AHR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3-0.8) compared to those with low wealth status. Adolescents and young adults with no education had a higher likelihood of dying compared to those with education (AHR = 5.6; 95% CI = 3.7-8.2). To prevent untimely mortality among adolescents and young adults, efforts should prioritise leading causes such as road traffic accidents and respiratory diseases, and address vulnerabilities among rural residents, the uneducated, and those with low socioeconomic status. We recommend strengthening existing health programs for adolescents and young adults to reduce preventable deaths.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining an appropriate gap between childbirths is essential for promoting the health of both the mother and the child. This practice lowers the risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Inadequate birth spacing is a multifaceted issue linked to increase infant mortality and has the potential to impact the health and demographic landscape of the nation. This study aims to assess the prevalence of short birth spacing (SBS) in association with demographic and socio-economic factors in India with special reference to maternal and child health. This study investigated SBS in India using a cross-sectional design and data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The analysis included data from 636,699 households, encompassing 724,115 women and 139,660 birth intervals. The primary outcome was SBS, and secondary outcomes included maternal undernutrition, full antenatal care (ANC), low birth weight (LBW), infant mortality, and child mortality. The analysis incorporated demographic and socio-economic variables as explanatory factors for SBS. Data analysis was conducted after checking its normality. The data characteristics were summarised and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In India, SBS is more prevalent (50.8%) with a median of 32 months. Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have shortest spacing (27 months), while Lakshadweep has longest (63.9 months). The Central zone has highest SBS prevalence (53.8%), especially in rural areas (55.9%). SBS is significantly associated with lack of maternal education, younger maternal age, unwanted pregnancies, larger families, and poor wealth index. Additionally, it is found that the explanatory variables have a significant impact on SBS, with area under the curve (AUC) covering 68% to 71% (p < 0.001). Furthermore, SBS has a detrimental effect on maternal and child health as secondary outcomes. This study emphasizes the substantial influence of socio-demographic factors on the practice of SBS. It is crucial to provide educational programs for mothers that focus on the importance of birth spacing and using family planning services. The study highlights the need to implement economic development initiatives within families to address the factors contributing to inadequate birth spacing. These measures enhance maternal and child health and align with the SDGs in India.",

        "abstract": "Despite the significance of internal migration as an important social determinant of health that could potentially affect the utilization of maternal healthcare services, the magnitude of this relationship by different migration streams is yet to be fully explored in Bangladesh. This study using Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data, 2017-18 examined the effects of different migration streams on maternal healthcare service utilization, particularly four or more antenatal care (≥4 ANC) visits and institutional delivery (ID) care services. The analysis identified significant variations in using antenatal and institutional delivery care services between migrants and non-migrants. The rural non-migrants were found to be the most disadvantaged group, particularly when different forms of migration streams were considered. For instance, after adjusting for covariates, urban to urban migrants (≥4 ANC = 1.866, <i>p</i> < 0.01; ID = 2.247, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and urban to rural migrants (≥ 4 ANC = 1.24, <i>p</i> > 0.05; ID = 1.689, <i>p</i> < 0.05) were more likely to utilize both types of maternal healthcare services than rural non-migrants. However, migrants of all streams were less likely to use any type of maternal healthcare services when compared against the urban non-migrants. Addressing the effects of migration in designing and implementing maternal healthcare service delivery programs may address the needs and challenges faced by migrants.",

Materials and methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2024 to February 2025 among 217 injured survivors (mean age: 26.0 ± 9.7 years; 97.2% male). Participants were assessed via face-to-face interviews using validated tools: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (cutoff: ≥10 for depression) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) (cutoff: ≥33 for PTSD). Univariate logistic regression was performed to analyze sociodemographic and clinical associations. Results Depression and PTSD were alarmingly high: 82.5% met the threshold for depression (PHQ-9 mean: 14.7 ± 5.6) and 64.1% for PTSD (PCL-5 mean: 37.6 ± 16.1). Urban survivors had significantly lower odds of depression (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-1.00) and PTSD (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.29-0.92) than rural counterparts. Strikingly, 99.3% of PTSD cases had comorbid depression, with strong symptom correlation (r = 0.772, p < 0.001). No other sociodemographic factors (age, sex, education, occupation, and socioeconomic status) or violence type showed significant associations. Conclusions The revolution's survivors exhibited extreme mental health burdens, underscoring an urgent need for trauma-integrated care, especially in rural areas.",

        "title": "Musculoskeletal Disorders in Elderly Patients With Diabetes Mellitus in a Rural Community of Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Background Among the elderly population of Bangladesh, diabetes mellitus (DM) is highly prevalent. DM has a strong relationship with musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders responsible for chronic pain, disability, and morbidity. Nevertheless, MSK disorder data of elderly diabetics are scarce in the literature, particularly in rural setups. The objective of this study was to evaluate the status of MSK disorders and their associated factors among elderly diabetic people living in rural Bangladesh. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we included participants with diabetes over 60 years from six rural villages in Muksudpur Union, Bangladesh. The details of the study, including data collection using the Community-Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire, followed clinical examination. Disability was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and associated factors were analyzed statistically. Results A total of 234 older adults with diabetes were included from six villages of rural Muksudpur Union, Bangladesh, and were recruited. They were also subjected to clinical examinations after completing the COPCORD questionnaire. Disability was measured by the HAQ and analyzed by stepwise multiple linear regression. A total of 234 persons participated, yielding 179 (76.5%) with MSK pain, of whom 144 (61.5%) were women and 90 (38.5%) men. The lower back (50 (28.6%)), knee (38 (21.7%)), and foot (23 (13.1%)) were the most reported pain sites. MSK disorders were also significantly associated with obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and uncontrolled diabetes. Functional disability was remarkable; 130 (55.5%) of participants were moderately disabled; 71 (30.3%), mildly disabled; and 33 (14.1%), severely disabled. Conclusion This study highlighted the high burden of MSK pain among elderly diabetics in rural Bangladesh, with women, obesity, and poor glycemic control as significant predictors. This finding emphasizes the need for early screening and weight control and for integrated healthcare strategies to ameliorate mobility and life quality in this susceptible population.",

        "title": "Comparative Analysis of the Quality of Life Among Men With Premature Ejaculation and Erectile Dysfunction at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are among the most prevalent sexual disorders in men, significantly impairing quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to assess and compare QoL among patients with PE and ED. A cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted where participants aged ≥18 years with complaints of either PE or ED were included, while those with both conditions were excluded. PE, ED, and QoL, along with depression, were assessed using validated tools. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables (e.g., QoL domain scores) were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Differences in QoL domain scores between patients with PE and ED were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. An independent samples t-test was used for the unadjusted analysis to compare mean differences in World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) domain scores between the PE and ED groups. For the adjusted analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed, controlling for potential confounders including depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), physical illness, smoking status, physical activity, and education level. Among the 245 participants, 140 (57.1%) presented with PE and 105 (42.9%) with ED. Based on diagnostic tools, 87.1% of PE cases were confirmed using the Bengali-validated Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), and 95.2% of ED cases were confirmed using the IIEF-6. Both groups scored highest in the physical domain and lowest in the social domain of WHOQOL-BREF, with PE generally showing better scores. Depression was prevalent in both groups, affecting 72.9% of PE and 65% of ED participants, with severe depression slightly more common in ED (7%). Physical illnesses like hypertension and diabetes were more frequent in ED patients. Education level, active lifestyle, smoking status, and living place (urban vs. rural) were significantly linked to the environmental and psychological domains (p = 0.028, p = 0.008, p = 0.013, p = 0.030). A history of physical illness significantly impacted the physical domain (p = 0.032). Statistical analyses revealed that PE participants had significantly better physical and psychological QoL scores than ED participants, both before and after adjusting for confounders such as depression severity (PHQ-9), physical illness, smoking status, physical activity, and education level.  This study highlights that men with PE report significantly better physical and psychological QoL compared to those with ED, even after adjusting for key confounding factors. Depression and physical illnesses were more prevalent among ED patients, negatively influencing their QoL. Sociodemographic and lifestyle variables also played a notable role in shaping QoL outcomes. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing both sexual dysfunction and associated psychosocial factors.",

        "title": "Growth monitoring and promotion program services utilization patterns between home-based and facility-based delivery methods: A comparative analysis.",
        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, utilization of government health facility-based growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services is notably low, prompting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to collaborate with the government to enhance GMP service utilization through home-based delivery. Despite this, there is limited information available on home-based GMP service utilization. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of GMP services between home-based and facility-based programs and identifying key factors and barriers to caregiver engagement with GMP services in rural Bangladesh. A descriptive mixed-method study was conducted across six sub-districts from August to December 2019. Three sub-districts with home-based GMP services provided by NGOs were compared with three neighboring sub-districts offering government facility-based GMP services. A total of 3038 randomly selected mothers and children under one year old were included in the quantitative part of the study. Quantitative surveys include information on household socio-demographic information, GMP service components, knowledge, utilization, barriers, and qualitative approaches were used for data collection on caregivers and service providers perspectives on GMP services. Descriptive statistics were conducted for sociodemographic characteristics, caregivers' knowledge, perception and barriers to utilization of GMP services. Student's t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare quantitative and qualitative variables between both GMP arms. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare GMP knowledge. Simple logistic regression identified GMP service use levels and related barriers. Multiple logistic regression was employed to determine statistically significant associations between GMP utilization and independent variables such as caregivers who heard about GMP or GMP cards, were members of an NGO, and lacked interest in GMP services at p-value <0.05 and adjusted risk ratio (ARR) values. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was performed. Results were triangulated across sources. Children's average age was 9.8 months, with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio in both groups (home-based vs. facility-based: 51.9% vs. 50.0%). Home-based GMP services exhibited higher utilization rates, with more children receiving weight and length measurements and caregivers receiving counseling than facility-based services (40% vs. 0% utilization, respectively). Caregivers' utilization of GMP services in home-based areas was positively influenced by their knowledge of GMP or GMP cards (Adjusted risk ratio, ARR: 37.4) and their involvement with an NGO, association, or health program (ARR: 1.3). Caregivers in home-based GMP areas relied on NGO staff for service delivery, while those in facility-based areas reported no outreach from government health workers and lacked access to GMP cards due to supply issues. Across both areas, low awareness of GMP services and the absence of incentives contributed to limited utilization. GMP service utilization remains low in rural Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Home-based GMP service utilization was 40% but none of the caregivers utilized facility-based GMP services. Higher utilization in home-based areas was linked to caregiver awareness, access to GMP cards, and NGO involvement, while key barriers included lack of government outreach, supply gaps, and absence of incentives. To improve GMP coverage, government programs should enhance community level outreach, ensure consistent supply of growth cards, and consider integrating small incentives to motivate caregivers.",

These disparities hinder progress toward equitable health care access and quality outcomes. To evaluate the availability and quality of health care workforce and service coverage for children younger than 5 years in public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to identify gaps in infrastructure, workforce distribution, and adherence to pediatric care standards. This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 13, 2023, to May 24, 2024. Data collection included facility assessments, structured questionnaires, and direct observations using World Health Organization (WHO)-adapted tools. The study covered both private and public hospitals across 6 subdistricts in Bangladesh, representing a mix of urban and rural populations. Senior hospital staff and administrators were surveyed. Inclusion criteria were general inpatient and outpatient pediatric care delivered in hospitals. Diagnostic centers and specialized facilities were excluded. Availability of pediatric infrastructure, workforce, essential medications, and adherence to clinical guidelines assessed against WHO standards. The primary outcomes included the presence of pediatric-specific departments, neonatal care facilities, and trained personnel and adherence to WHO care standards. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests to highlight disparities. The study sample included 102 private and 7 public hospitals. A significantly higher proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals had pediatric inpatient departments (100% vs 39.2%), newborn wards (100% vs 12.8%), and trained nurses (100% vs 32.4%). Only private hospitals in the sample had neonatal intensive care units (6.9% vs 0%). Pediatricians were available for extended consultations at a greater proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals (71.4% vs 26.5%). These findings show substantial disparities in the availability of pediatric health care services between public and private hospitals in Bangladesh. Addressing these disparities through workforce investment and infrastructure improvements is crucial for equitable child health care and better health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Floods exacerbate the vulnerability of rural communities with limited resources, while their impacts extend to nearby urban centres through interconnected socio-economic and infrastructural systems. Understanding these vulnerabilities is critical for mitigating disaster risks. Previous studies often overlooked the essential connections between rural and urban regions. This research examines how rural-urban connections change following a flood event, what factors influence these interactions, and how they contribute to the vulnerability of rural areas after a flood in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The study employed convenience and snowball sampling techniques to select 35 respondents with relevant disaster management and recovery expertise. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and personal observations to ensure a diverse range of participants' responses. The thematic data analysis method was chosen to highlight the significance of participants' experiences. The study findings revealed that the rural population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province heavily depends on nearby cities for essential resources and services (food, healthcare, and employment opportunities) significantly when local resources are depleted due to flooding. Floods caused serious repercussions to the rural-urban linkages through people (e.g., human mobility patterns, evacuation and displacement, and migration), information (early warning signals, post-disaster information support, financial aid coordination and technical assistance for reconstruction, health and sanitation management, logistics and supply chain restoration), Finance (resources inflow, and insurance coverage), and goods and relief services (urban areas as coordination hubs for disaster response, service delivery and specialized support systems, long-term recovery and resilience building, and economic interdependence and systemic vulnerabilities). However, this dependence diminishes when villages become self-reliant in accessing information, credit, goods, and market services. Rural areas are more vulnerable due to their weaker infrastructure, limited institutional capacity, and dependence on natural resources. In contrast, urban areas encounter challenges such as overcrowding, resource allocation, and maintaining service continuity when accommodating displaced populations. This study also identifies the primary attributes, including social (demography-population size, age, gender, health status, education, and social networks), economic (income levels and rural-urban connectivity, occupational sector and interaction patterns, income inequality and migration dynamics, occupation-specific vulnerability profiles), Institutional (strengthening rural-urban resilience to floods, local governance and flood risk management initiatives, enhancing emergency response and community preparedness, institutional coordination and disaster risk reduction strategies, leveraging technology and early warning systems) and environmental dimensions (river bodies, soil quality, erosion level, and water availability) which also affected the influence of rural-urban connections and their vulnerability to flood events across the selected districts. The current study findings offer important insights for policymakers to create integrated flood risk management strategies that strengthen rural infrastructure, improve early warning systems, and expand financial inclusion, stressing the significance of coordinated rural-urban disaster planning to direct displacement, guarantee fair resource allocation, and foster long-lasting resilience.",

        "abstract": "Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents the third most common stroke type with unique etiologies, risk factors, diagnostics, and treatments. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood development (ECD) in low to middle-income nations has been a pressing concern for the last two to three decades. It is estimated that approximately 250 million children under the age of five are not reaching their full developmental potential due to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and insufficient home stimulation. It is estimated that in Bangladesh, 44% of the children under 5 years live in poverty and 31% are stunted, and both factors are risks for poor childhood development. We aim to develop a sustainable, scaled ECD programme using an evidence-based curriculum of psychosocial stimulation for disadvantaged Bangladeshi children. Approximately 10,000 malnourished children aged 6-24 months will be identified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 13.5 cm, assessed by government health staff in over 500 community clinics (CCs) in 21 sub-districts of Hobiganj, Brahmanbaria, Laxmipur and Narsingdi districts. The children and their mothers will participate in the psychosocial stimulation programme that will be delivered fortnightly for one year to small groups at the CCs by health workers. We will train approximately 1,500 health staff in rural CCs to deliver the ECD sessions. We will follow a cascade training model to train personnel at all levels of the primary health care system. A subsample will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 48 CCs (24 intervention and 24 control). From each CC, 10 children aged 6-24 months will be tested before and after the programme. The primary outcome is children's cognitive development and we will also measure language composite scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Secondary outcomes are children's growth, maternal knowledge and depressive symptoms, and stimulation in the home. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention effects. There are no existing ECD services for the children under three years delivered by the health care system in Bangladesh. This study will help policy makers to consider incorporating ECD activities into the treatment of malnourished children in rural CCs, under the government's primary health care system, thereby developing a sustainable structure for improving disadvantaged children's development. The findings will also provide information to facilitate scaling ECD in the primary health care systems in other low and middle-income countries.

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is indispensable for supervising and enhancing the health of both the mother and the baby during pregnancy. It helps to reduce the risks of complications and ensures better pregnancy outcomes. This study investigates the aspects that influence antenatal care (ANC) visits in Bangladesh, focusing on sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. The study used nationally representative data from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted for bivariate analysis. The Boruta algorithm was utilized for variable selection. After employing various regression models, including Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial Regression, Zero-inflated Poisson Regression, and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB), we evaluated their performance and selected Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression (ZINB) for parameter estimation and interpretation. Our results reveal that less than 50% of women meet the WHO-recommended minimum of four ANC visits. Rural women were 12% less likely than urban women to receive antenatal care (ANC) visits, indicating an urban-rural discrepancy. Women with secondary and higher education levels were significantly more likely to have frequent visits, with incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.18-1.51), respectively. Similarly, women from households with rich wealth status (IRR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21) and those exposed to media coverage (IRR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.14-1.25) were more likely to attend frequent ANC visits. Conversely, women with higher birth order (IRR: 0.95 & 0.84, 95% CI: 0.90-1.00 & 0.76-0.92), unintentional pregnancy (IRR: 0.91 & 0.83, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96 & 0.77-0.91) were less likely to have ANC visits. This study underscores a critical gap in ANC access, particularly among rural women, which poses challenges to achieving national and global maternal health targets.

        "abstract": "Backyard poultry farming is common in rural areas worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where approximately 80 % of rural households are involved. Effective biosecurity assessments are essential to prevent diseases and therefore, this study aimed to develop a risk-based weighted scoring system to evaluate biosecurity levels in backyard poultry households in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as to describe its use in Bangladesh. A questionnaire was drafted with input from backyard poultry experts, followed by weights were attributed to the answers to obtain a weighted and risk-based questionnaire where scores represent the level of biosecurity measures. A score of 0 indicates absence of biosecurity measures, while 100 implies optimal biosecurity. The questionnaire was pretested with 20 households in Savar, Dhaka. Subsequently, 384 households were randomly selected from six districts in Bangladesh, based on the poultry population and consistent backyard poultry rearing. The scoring system is freely available online at https://biocheckgent.com/en/. External biosecurity (50 questions) was assessed in the following subcategories: purchase of eggs or day-old chicks, purchase of laying hens, depopulation and transport of poultry and poultry products, feed and water supply, visitors and farm personnel, manure and carcass removal, infrastructure and biological vectors of the farm, location of the farm. Internal biosecurity (13 questions) was subdivided in disease management and cleaning and disinfection. The average biosecurity scores for the external and internal categories were 30.3 % and 32.4 %, respectively. The two highest mean external biosecurity scores were obtained for depopulation and transport of poultry and poultry products (mean= 56.0 %) and manure and carcass removal (mean = 37.5 %) while the lowest means score was obtained for the category visitors and farm workers (mean = 12.4 %). In the internal biosecurity category, cleaning and disinfection had the highest mean score (34.1 %). Besides backyard production, small-scale commercial broiler production was present in 7 % of the visited households and the biosecurity score in these households was on average higher compared to those without commercial farming. This study reveals sub-optimal levels of biosecurity among backyard poultry in Bangladesh, as evaluated through the Biocheck.UGent scoring tool which has shown to be valuable for addressing biosecurity challenges in backyard production in low- and middle-income countries. The observed biosecurity gaps expose the poultry system to considerable risks of introduction and spread of infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "Wars have devastating effects on all the components of the One Health approach: humans, animals, and ecosystems. Wars and the resulting migratory waves massively disrupt normal animal health services and surveillance. Among other consequences, they adversely impact the early detection, prevention, and control of animal diseases. Uncontrolled movement of animals or their undisposed carcasses, the destruction of wildlife habitats, and the increased interface between humans, wildlife, and domestic animals contribute to uncontrolled transmission and spread of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. In the last millennium, zoonotic diseases such as the \"Black Death\" were triggered by devastating wars and led to the deaths of a large fraction of the human population. However, also recent and ongoing wars carry the risk of an uncontrollable increase in zoonotic diseases. The most significant zoonotic diseases reported during the recent wars are African swine fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, rabies, leptospirosis, and brucellosis, as well as foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases. Indeed, alarming rates of infections by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens such as <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> go along with wars, as seen in the current Ukraine-Russia conflict. Considering human migration, foodborne and waterborne zoonotic diseases are key health threats for refugees due to the consumption of unsafe food, lack of safe water, and disruption of the water supply and sanitation system. This review summarizes the potential factors and some data associated with the increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence and transmission during recent and ongoing conflicts.",

        "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health disorders among adolescents worldwide, including Bangladesh. However, mental health disorders are often overlooked in developing countries like Bangladesh. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety, as well as the socio-demographic factors that contribute to these conditions, among late adolescents aged 15-21 in Mymensingh division, Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 adolescents aged 15-21 in the Mymensingh division of Bangladesh. The study used a structured questionnaire to collect sociodemographic and lifestyle-related information from the respondents. The questionnaire included PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales to assess depression and anxiety among the respondents. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and ordinal logistic regression were performed as statistical analyses of this study. The overall prevalence of depression was 47.8% (33.5% moderate, 10.5% moderately severe, and 3.8% severe depression), and anxiety 32.8% (31% moderate and 1.8% severe anxiety). Across most of the socio-demographic and lifestyle-related factors, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among adolescent boys. Individuals aged 19-21 are most likely to experience depression and anxiety. The study found that unmarried adolescents, mobile phone users, rural adolescents, and those whose parents had no formal education were more likely to experience moderate to severe depression and anxiety than their counterparts. The ordinal logistic regression revealed that adolescents whose fathers had no formal education were 2.77 times more likely to experience depression (95% CI = 1.21-6.35, p < 0.05). Besides depression was more likely to be associated with those who were businessmen (OR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.02-3.72, p < 0.05), and day laborers (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.20-0.82, p < 0.05) and living with anxiety (OR = 0.05; 95% CI = 0.01-0.24, p <.000). Anxiety is prevalent among adolescents who had no formal education (OR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.75, p < 0.05), no family savings (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.78, p < 0.05) and depression (OR = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.01-0.22, p < 0.05). The findings of this study emphasize the importance of screening individuals for depressive and anxiety disorder symptoms to reduce the prevalence of mental health disorders among adolescents. In addition to screening, policymakers should incorporate policies to increase access to mental health services and promote mental health education for parents and the community.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this study is to understand the impact of internal migration (rural-to-urban) on the mental health of female garment workers in Bangladesh with reference to the psychological trauma of rural-to-urban migration. In detail, thirteen female migrant workers aged between 18 and 50 who moved within the past five years for job purposes in the garment industry were interviewed using a qualitative phenomenological approach. Based on the study, we find that work-related anxiety, working too long, bad working conditions, social isolation and separation from family lead to emotional stresses. On the other hand, it also underscores the fact that migration can offer economic opportunities, financial independence and empowerment which may increase self-esteem and give a sense of achievement. Our findings indicate that migration's mental health effect is dual, positive and negative, depending on the individual experience. It highlights the urgency to develop targeted interventions to improve psychological dimensions of mental health services for this group, bring about workplace improvements, and create supportive systems within which female migrants can be supported to overcome their psychological challenges. There is still more to do in future research to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions intended to improve the wellbeing of migrant workers as well as the longitudinal effects of migration on mental health.",

Initiated in 1998, CCs aim to provide accessible healthcare services to remote households, particularly focusing on women and children. Using cluster-level data on healthcare provider availability alongside individual-level data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) for 2011, 2014, and 2017-18, the respective sample sizes are 17842, 17886, and 20127 ever-married women, the study offers robust estimates that address endogeneity concerns present in individual-level analyses. Lagged health indicators are utilized to consider contextual factors influencing CC establishment in specific regions. Results indicate positive associations between CC presence and various healthcare-seeking behaviors, such as increased contraceptive use, higher attendance at antenatal care visits, and improved treatment-seeking for children's illnesses. Notably, rural-urban disparities in healthcare-seeking behavior highlight existing access inequalities. To mitigate this divide, the study recommends expanding CCs nationwide, demonstrating that low-cost healthcare interventions can enhance healthcare-seeking behaviors and suggest potential scalability in similar contexts.",

        "title": "Comparative study on the factors influencing pre-eclampsia symptoms at different pregnancy stages in Bangladeshi women: urban vs. rural perspectives.",
        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, pre-eclampsia poses a significant concern, evident in the low attendance (37%) for antenatal care (ANC). Despite efforts to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, the latest Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey (BMMS-2016) indicates limited progress. Access to essential maternal and newborn health services, including ANC, remains constrained, highlighting the challenge of translating service coverage into improved outcomes. A research gap on pre-eclampsia symptoms such as severe headache, blurred vision, high blood pressure, and oedema emphasizes the need for targeted interventions for these symptoms early so that we can reduce the prevalence of pre-eclampsia and therefore maternal mortality in Bangladesh. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the risk factors for three stages of pre-eclampsia among Bangladeshi women living in urban and rural areas. The study utilized BMMS-2016 data, employing statistical analyses, including binary logistic regression, to identify associations. It assessed four pre-eclampsia symptoms prevalence across pregnancy stages, considering factors like maternal age, stillborn births, residency, ANC, healthcare facility delivery, education, and children. Logistic regression highlights key associations with pre-eclampsia symptoms. Urban mothers aged 36 + face the highest risk during delivery (AOR = 2) and the lowest in rural areas after delivery (AOR = 1.43). Two or more stillborn births increase the risk in urban delivery by 97%. Complete ANC raises odds, notably in urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.5) and rural post-delivery (AOR = 1.16). Skilled ANC providers elevate risks during all stages, with the highest in urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.54) and lowest after rural delivery (AOR = 1.28). Unskilled ANC associates with symptoms only during pregnancy. Healthcare facility delivery increases odds at all stages, particularly in rural delivery (AOR = 1.74) and urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.26). Multifetal gestation raises urban delivery risk (AOR = 2.11). Rural areas show higher chances during both pregnancy and delivery. Higher education in rural pregnancy and 2 to 3 birth order in urban delivery reduce odds of pre-eclampsia symptoms. Addressing pre-eclampsia symptoms in Bangladesh, especially among urban women, is urgent. Identified risk factors necessitate targeted interventions to enhance ANC and overall maternal health. Advocating findings to policymakers is crucial for effective policies, reducing pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, contributing to lower maternal mortality.",

        "abstract": "This study presents results of a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of two parenting interventions (group-based and pairs) integrated into primary health care centers in rural Bangladesh. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for two trials of parenting interventions aiming to support child development through play and interactions. Eligible participants for both trials were underweight children aged 5-24 months. Participants in the control arms in both trials received standard health services. Intervention costs were estimated rom the provider perspective over the time horizon of each study (21 months for the group-based intervention; 24 months for the pair-based intervention). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were estimated for all primary child development outcomes and presented in terms of cost per standard deviation improvements in the outcomes. A series of cost scenario analyses were conducted to assess the effect of changing cost assumptions on the cost and cost-effectiveness results. All results are presented in 2022 USD. The studies were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02208531). Total provider costs in the within-trial analysis were US$ 67,668 for the group-based intervention and US$ 117,028 for the pair intervention. Estimated cost per child covered by the interventions was US$ 156 for the group intervention and US$ 136 for the pair intervention, reflecting likely economies of scale in delivery of the pair intervention. An additional US$ 100 expenditure on the group intervention is estimated to lead to a 0.55 SD improvement in cognition, 0.44 SD in language development and 0.33 SD in motor development. For the pair intervention, the corresponding estimates are improvements of 0.95 SD, 0.81 SD, and 0.88 SD, respectively. Under potential scale up scenarios, the economic cost per child could reduce substantially to US$ 61 and US$ 77 for group and pair interventions, respectively. The findings indicates that cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness results for both interventions are comparable with the results from limited similar interventions in LMICs. However, implementation costs of the interventions will be substantially lower at scale due to lower monitoring costs, economies of scale, and full integration into the public health system.

        "abstract": "Acute Malnutrition affects 45 million children under five globally, with Bangladesh contributing more than 1.7 million cases. While community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines in Bangladesh exist, they primarily emphasise nutritional counselling and face challenges in coverage and implementations. It is important to understand barriers to CMAM uptake and implementation. This study aims to explore the perceptions of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences among parents, healthcare providers, and policymakers, alongside parents' care-seeking behaviours for under-five children with acute malnutrition. Conducted in areas with and without CMAM programs, the research follows a phenomenological design with thematic analysis of focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Thirty FGDs with parents, 28 KIIs with healthcare providers, and 16 KIIs with policymakers were conducted. Identified causes of acute malnutrition included infections, diseases, lack of awareness about nutritious foods, supernatural beliefs, poverty, and inadequate care and feeding practices. Consequences included stunted growth, impaired mental development, and increased illness risk. Although parents acknowledged the urgency of treating acute malnutrition, they sought care at healthcare facilities regardless of illness. Factors influencing care-seeking behaviour were inability in problem prioritisation, transportation cost and availability, healthcare access, wage loss, and out-of-pocket expenses. Despite awareness of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences, parental care-seeking remains limited. The study recommends integrating acute malnutrition guidelines with communicable disease programs, implementing targeted social and behavioural change programs, addressing superstitions, fostering collaboration with traditional healers strengthening social safety nets, and empowering women in healthcare decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Access to early intervention and rehabilitation services among children with cerebral palsy (CP) remains limited in Bangladesh, which demands an innovative and sustainable service delivery model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Sustainable Model of Early Intervention and Telerehabilitation for Children With CP (SMART-CP) model compared with usual care in improving access to and utilization of early diagnosis, early intervention, and rehabilitation services in rural Bangladesh. This was a 2-arm cluster randomized clinical trial, with 8 clusters (ie, subdistricts) randomly allocated to the intervention (SMART-CP model) or control arm. The setting was in Sirajganj, Bangladesh, and included children with CP 18 years or younger. Outcomes were measured at 0 and 12 months, and an intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to May 2024. The SMART-CP model comprised (1) a rural referral network involving key informants and caregiver peer groups (called mPower or mothers' power), (2) subdistrict level SMART-CP centers, and (3) telerehabilitation services. Children in the intervention arm received weekly goal-directed therapy, mPower group meetings every 2 weeks, and monthly telerehabilitation sessions. The primary outcome was whether a child with CP accessed any form of rehabilitation services, with secondary outcomes analyzed as hypothesis generating. Overall, 968 children with CP (mean [SD] age, 7.9 [4.9] years; 581 male [60.0%]) were enrolled, with 500 in the intervention arm and 468 in the control arm. Between baseline and endline, rehabilitation services uptake significantly increased in the intervention arm (70.2% [351 of 500] vs 99.4% [497 of 500]), compared with the control arm (63.9% [299 of 468] vs 68.2% [319 of 468]; P <.001). Children in the intervention arm were 1.5 times more likely to access rehabilitation than the control arm. Secondary analyses suggested that the intervention arm also facilitated early CP diagnosis (mean [SD] diagnosis time, 2.0 [2.0] years vs 3.8 [3.3] years; Cohen d = -0.7) and initiation of rehabilitation (mean [SD] rehabilitation time, 1.8 [1.8] years vs 3.6 [2.4] years; Cohen d = -0.9). Additionally, higher therapy session counts (mean [SD] session counts, 23.4 [31.7] vs 4.3 [20.8]; Cohen d = 0.7), increased assistive device utilization (20.8% [104 of 500] vs 3.0% [14 of 468]; risk ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.86; P < .001), and lower out-of-pocket expenditure per month (mean [SD] expenditure, $1.5 [$1.6] vs $2.9 [$5.1]; Cohen d = -0.4) were found in the intervention arm. No significant difference in clinical outcomes and mortality rates was observed between the intervention and control groups. Results of this cluster randomized clinical trial reveal that the SMART-CP model improved access to and utilization of early diagnosis and intervention services for children with CP in rural Bangladesh. This model holds promise for global scalability. ANZCTR Trial Identifier: ACTRN12622000396729.",

Data were acquired from two rounds of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), Bangladesh conducted in 2012-13 and 2019. <i>Subjects:</i> The analysis included 43 946 (2012-13: 20 885; 2019: 23 061) under-5 children. Binomial proportion test, slope index of inequality and multinomial logistic regression models were used for analysis. The prevalence of CFM was 27·45 % and 18·56 % in 2012-13 and 2019, respectively. A significant decrease in the prevalence of CFM was seen across the surveys (<i>P</i>-value < 0·001). Children from urban residence ((2012-13:aOR = 0·70, 95 % CI: 0·64, 0·77); (2019:aOR = 0·71, 95 % CI: 0·65, 0·78), higher maternal education ((2012-13:aOR = 0·28, 95 % CI: 0·24, 0·32); (2019:aOR = 0·28, 95 % CI: 0·24, 0·32), larger size at birth ((2012-13:aOR = 0·62, 95 % CI: 0·52, 0·73); (2019:aOR: 0·60, 95 % CI: 0·50, 0·73) and richest wealth quintile ((2012-13:aOR = 0·25, 95 % CI: 0·22, 0·28); (2019:aOR: 0·30, 95 % CI: 0·27, 0·34)) had lower odds of suffering from CFM compared with their counterparts. Children from poorer quintiles were more influenced by CFM than richer quintiles (Coef.:-0·175, 95 % CI: -0·192, -0·157, <i>P</i>-value < 0·001). Higher percentage of CFM was observed among rich families in 2019 compared with 2012-13 (24·50 % and 20·15 %, respectively; <i>P</i>-value < 0·001). The findings of this study should help the researchers and policymakers to understand CFM more clearly and plan prospective studies to explore CFM outcomes. Targeted interventional approaches are needed among parents of rural communities to control the burden of CFM.",

However, few contextual data are available at the village level in rural South and Southeast Asia. This study addressed the gap by profiling representative villages across seven sites in Thailand (n=3), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Key informant surveys supplemented by other information sources were used to collect data from 687 villages on four key indicators (literacy rate, and percentages of attended deliveries, fully immunised children and latrine coverage), as well as access to various services. Data were analysed descriptively. Sites varied considerably. Five were highly diverse ethno-culturally and linguistically, and all relied on primary health centres and village health/malaria workers as the main providers of primary healthcare. These were generally bypassed by severely ill patients for urban first-level referral hospitals and private sector facilities. While >75% of villages were near primary schools, educational attainment was generally low. Over 70% of villages at each site had mobile phone coverage and availability of electricity was high (≥65% at all sites bar Myanmar). These results illustrate the similarities and differences of villages in this region that must be considered in public health research and policymaking.",

        "abstract": "This narrative review delves into the transformative role of telemedicine in the realm of surgical decision-making. Telemedicine, a significant innovation in healthcare services, leverages electronic information and communication technologies to provide healthcare services when distance separates the participants. It addresses the challenges of increased healthcare demands, an aging population, and budget constraints. Telemedicine technologies are employed for pre- and postoperative consultations, monitoring, and international surgical teleconferencing and education. They enhance healthcare access, particularly in remote areas, and facilitate knowledge sharing among healthcare professionals. The review also provides a historical context and discusses the technological advancements in telemedicine, including the rise of digital health technologies and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in healthcare. It delves into the details of telemedicine technologies such as telesurgery, telerobotics, telepathology, teleimaging, remote patient monitoring, and virtual and augmented reality. Despite the numerous benefits, the implementation of telemedicine is often hindered by various complex and diverse ethical and legal concerns, including privacy and data security. The review highlights the need for further evidence on health outcomes and cost savings, bridging the digital divide, and enacting policies to support telemedicine reimbursement. It also emphasizes the need for incorporating telemedicine modules in medical education. It recommends that policy-making bodies consider utilizing telemedicine to address healthcare coverage gaps, particularly in rural areas.",

Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the factors that influence the decision-making of young females when it comes to seeking healthcare services in low or lower-middle-income countries. We examined healthcare usage among female youth across eight countries. We used data from the DHS and employed regression and Chi2 tests for our analysis. Our focus was on females aged 15 to 24 and their visits to healthcare facilities. To ensure the validity of our findings, we used weighted sampling to represent the population. We had a total sample of 51,298 female youth groups between the ages of 15 and 24 who participated in our study. When it comes to the demographics of the participants, most of those in the 15-19 age group were from Burkina Faso (54.26%), while most of those in the 20-24 age group were from Ghana (50.19%). The impact of education varied across countries; primary education led to increased healthcare utilization in Kenya, Tanzania, and Cambodia, but unexpected trends were observed in Burkina Faso. Education significantly influences healthcare utilization, positively impacting both primary and secondary education. Rural residents face challenges accessing timely healthcare. Geographical challenges, like diseases and limited accessibility, contribute to varied healthcare usage in Kenya and the Philippines. Addressing infrastructure issues is critical, emphasizing education and promoting transparency to enhance healthcare equity.",

Informal providers, particularly village doctors, fill this void by being a first point of care and a bridge to the formal health care system. This study explores formally trained physicians' perspectives on village doctors' role in the health care system. This qualitative study was conducted in southeast Bangladesh and included 12 individual in-depth interviews with physicians. Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis, focusing on both the contributions and shortcomings of village doctors. Three themes emerged for positive contributions of village doctors: 1) provision of essential services and resources in isolated areas, 2) enhanced accessibility and familiarity with the community, and 3) active involvement in public health education. Five themes emerged related to the shortcomings and negative impacts of village doctors: 1) insufficient education and training, 2) use of inappropriate treatments, 3) inappropriate referrals, 4) misuse and overuse of antibiotics, and 5) prioritization of financial gain. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between formal and informal health care providers, emphasizing both the contributions and shortcomings of village doctors in rural health care settings.",

This study aimed to estimate the incidence, healthcare-seeking behavior, and barriers associated with seeking care for children suffering from severe pneumonia in rural Bangladesh. A prospective study was conducted in two districts at 81 randomly selected villages in rural Bangladesh. We collected data on 12,303 under-five children between 1st June 2018 to October 2019. Among surveyed children, a total of 154 severe pneumonia cases were recorded, resulting in an overall incidence of 1.3%. When seeking healthcare for their children, most (44.2%) mothers/caregivers availed the health care services from nearby pharmacies or local healthcare providers, followed by Health and Family Welfare Centre (37.0%), private clinics (23.4%), district hospitals (23.4%) health complexes (22.1%). Only 2% sought care at community clinics. Approximately 25% (n=38) of caregivers reported barriers to accessing healthcare. Among those who reported barriers, 39.5% cited an inability to find transportation as the main issue, followed by 26.3% who mentioned high cost of treatment, 10.5% who faced natural calamities including floods, and 2.6% who encountered political instability including strike. The incidence of severe pneumonia was below 2% in our rural areas of Bangladesh. Pharmacies and local healthcare providers were the most commonly used sources for care-seeking. Notable barriers to care-seeking included the lack of available transportation and the high cost of treatment.",

This was a matched case-control study in Shahjadpur, northern Sirajganj, Bangladesh. Children aged younger than 18 years with disabilities (i.e. those with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury, amputation, club foot, cleft lip or palate, trauma or burn-related injury or impairment, congenital deformity, genetic condition, and visual, hearing, and speech impairments) and age-, sex-, and location-matched children without disabilities (i.e. controls) were recruited. Cases were identified using the key informant method. Household poverty likelihood and socioeconomic status (SES) were assessed using a validated poverty scorecard. Descriptive and inferential analyses were completed. Between October 2017 and February 2018, 1274 cases and 1303 controls were recruited (median age at assessment 9 years 10 months [interquartile range 6 years 0 months-13 years 7 months] and 9 years 10 months [5 years 8 months-12 years 0 months] respectively). The household poverty likelihood was 7% higher among cases than controls (p < 0.001). Parental employment, family income, and school enrolment rate were significantly lower among cases than controls especially in the families with low SES. Both underweight and stunting were significantly higher among cases than controls (p < 0.001 for both). Receipt of rehabilitation services and health-care seeking from formal sectors were significantly lower among cases from families with low SES than high SES (60% vs. 71%, p = 0.03; 10% vs. 33%, p < 0.001 respectively). Our findings are crucial to develop interventions and reduce the inequalities between children with and without disabilities in low-resource settings such as Bangladesh as highlighted in the global agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals.",

We aimed to estimate the catastrophic expenditure during hospitalisation for children with acute illness. This was a prespecified cross-sectional substudy nested within two prospective studies. Participants were recruited and interviewed from three rural and three urban hospitals in Kenya and Uganda. A costing questionnaire was administered to the caregivers of 731 children hospitalised for acute illness to evaluate direct and indirect costs incurred by caregivers and families. Costs incurred were compared for families with children both with and without complicated severe malnutrition (CSM). Catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure exceeding 10% and 25% of monthly income was assessed. The median (IQR) total cost during hospitalisation per child was US$47 (US$24-US$84), with higher costs for children with CSM, especially during hospitalisation (US$56 (US$26-US$99) vs US$36 (US$20-US$65); p<0.001). During hospitalisation, bed charges followed by food were the main cost drivers. Caregivers reported losing a median of 7 (4-11) days of productive time during a child's hospitalisation with a mean loss of income of US$10 (SD US$25.6, median US$0 (US$0-US$10)). 92% and 74% of households experienced catastrophic expenditure at thresholds of 10% and 25% of monthly income, respectively. Caregivers reported borrowing, selling property and withdrawing other children from school to cope with costs. Despite intentions of free healthcare services for under 5, families of acutely ill children very commonly faced catastrophic expenditure, especially for children with CSM. Interventions aimed at supporting financial protection, reducing additional healthcare costs, and lowering health service charges may help prevent catastrophic expenditures.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has been experiencing a rapid demographic shift from the younger population to older adults, with the older adults facing significant challenges due to the absence of residential and formal home care models. This perspective aimed to evaluate the status of residential and formal home care models and propose potential strategies to improve elderly care in Bangladesh. This perspective utilized a narrative review approach to search existing literature on elderly care in Bangladesh on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The perspective reviewed and presented the status of elderly care and identified gaps in residential and formal home care infrastructure by analyzing existing literature. In Bangladesh, there was no evidence found that any authority had ever initiated or evaluated residential and formal home care programs, showing systematic neglect that resulted in the suffering of older adults. The collapse of the traditional informal family care model, fueled by urban migration and shifting socioeconomic dynamics, has further isolated older adults, leaving them with considerable unmet care needs. The issue is being worsened by a high prevalence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, as well as the collective inability to meet the growing demand for elderly care. Furthermore, limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, emphasized the urgent need for comprehensive elderly care models in Bangladesh. The proposed strategies involve developing residential care facilities, probably on a small scale, and integrating formal home care services in Bangladesh. However, conducting preliminary investigations is essential, including investigating the model to be implemented, training caregivers, and establishing financial support programs and regulatory frameworks. Thus, the government and private sector organizations should collaborate to address these challenges of older adults in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Improving access to institutional delivery is crucial for reducing maternal and newborn mortality. However, government efforts to enhance maternal healthcare in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Bangladesh mostly contribute to a significant increase in antenatal care (ANC) uptake, while institutional delivery rates remains low, with notable urban-rural differences. We, therefore, explored the association of the place, timing, and quality of ANC with the uptake of institutional delivery services, as well as explored the urban-rural differences in these associations. The study analysed data of 3,549 mothers, extracted from the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). The outcome variable was the utilisation of institutional delivery (yes, no). The timing, location and quality of ANC were considered as the key exposure variables. A multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression model was employed to explore associations between the outcome and the exposures. Additionally, an urban-rural differential analysis was conducted to assess the urban-rural differences in the association between exposure and outcome variables. We observed a noticeable difference in institutional delivery rates between urban (76.3%) and rural areas (60.5%), with an overall rate of 64.7%. Women who accessed ANC in the 2nd or 3rd trimester were less likely to have an institutional delivery (aPR: 0.92 and 0.74) compared to those who initiated ANC in the 1st trimester. Receiving ANC at home significantly decreased the likelihood of institutional delivery (aPR: 0.74), while ANC from private or public facilities showed no significant association. Additionally, having at least one ANC visit from a medically trained provider (MTP) significantly increased the likelihood of institutional delivery (aPR: 1.83). Receiving quality ANC services also found increasing the likelihood of institutional delivery (aPR: 1.21), with these effects being more pronounced among rural women. The urban-rural differential analysis revealed no significant variation in the determinants of institutional delivery, except for the timing of ANC initiation. Urban-rural differences in institutional delivery rates are evident, with early ANC initiation, home-based ANC, and visits with MTPs being associated with higher institutional delivery rates. Initiation of ANC was the only determinant showing significant urban-rural variation, with notable differences in effect size for all other determinants. Therefore, to increase institutional delivery rates, particularly in rural areas, focusing on early initiation of ANC visits is important. In addition, improving the access to quality ANC services in the rural healthcare facilities is particularly crucial to increase the institutional delivery rates.",

However, there have been efforts to improve WASH between 2014 and 2018. The study aimed to investigate changes in WASH facilities and practices in Bangladeshi schools from 2014 to 2018. We analyzed pooled data from Bangladesh National Hygiene Survey 2014 and 2018. We performed descriptive analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) to analyze the changes over the four years time period. Results showed that basic drinking water services increased from 78% in 2014 to 90% in 2018. Schools showed a significant increase in basic sanitation services from 19% in 2014 to 52% in 2018. We discovered that students' access to water and soap increased from 2014 to 2018, from 21% to 35%. In the GEE model, we found that change in time, non govt urban schools were associated factors with improved basic drinking water services. For basic sanitation services, changes in time, school type and area type were significantly associated higher services. And for basic hygiene services, the associated factors were: schools having hygiene promotion visits, and availability of hygiene brigades at schools managed by students. WASH services in Bangladeshi schools have improved significantly, yet disparities exist, particularly in government and rural schools. Although students' knowledge improved, their practices still need improvements through training on proper WASH practices.",

We evaluated the impact of a food hygiene intervention on complementary food contamination in Bangladesh. A 3-year homestead food production intervention was complemented by an 8-month behavior change module to improve household food hygiene practices and evaluated in a cluster-randomized controlled trial, including a dedicated study measuring outcomes along the hygiene pathway to intestinal health. We used multilevel regression to assess the intervention's impact on microbial food contamination as well as food hygiene knowledge (n = 518) and reported practices (n = 531) among mothers of children 6-23 months of age. Complementary food samples were collected from 342 households with children 6-18 months of age and tested for Escherichia coli. Overall, 46% of food samples were contaminated with E. coli (43% intervention, 51% control), and there was no evidence that the intervention reduced food contamination (odds ratio: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.35-1.21). A higher proportion of intervention mothers could name all key food hygiene practices (23% intervention versus 1% control), had access to a basic handwashing station near the kitchen (24% versus 14%), reported washing hands before food preparation and child feeding (21% versus 8%), reported washing and storing feeding utensils safely (61% versus 49%), and reported preparing food fresh or reheating stored food (88% versus 79%) compared with control mothers. The intervention thus improved knowledge and reported food hygiene practices among mothers, but this improvement did not result in a substantial reduction of complementary food contamination.",

The percentage of health facilities performing all seven basic signal functions declined slightly from 13% in 2014 to 11% in 2017. The decline was largely noticed in Maternal and Child Welfare Centers, Upazila Health Complexes, and Union Subcenter/Rural Dispensaries, as well as in all divisions except Rangpur. No remarkable changes in overall readiness of health facilities across location, division and facility type were observed between 2014 and 2017.

The assessment followed a mixed-method design with household survey of 1,166 pregnant women, mothers of children under-6 months and 6-23 months, and observations of 965 service delivery points along with qualitative study. A higher proportion of children received growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services through expanded program on immunization (EPI) sessions, with better compliance to service delivery protocol in intervention areas compared with controls. Maternal nutrition services of gestational weight gain monitoring and distribution of supplements were better available in intervention areas. However, minimum dietary diversity among pregnant women (69% intervention, 72% control), early initiation of breastfeeding (55% intervention, 51% control), and complementary feeding practices were comparable in intervention and control areas. Nutrition services were successfully integrated in supervision which earlier covered EPI and family planning. The local government contributed to strengthening nutrition services but at a small scale. There is potential to scale-up GMP services through EPI and merging antenatal clinics with GMP and EPI such that all maternal and childcare services are available at the same place and same time. A coordinated investment and oversight from multiple national government departments is needed. At district and sub-district levels, scale-up requires joint annual planning of nutrition and EPI services, strengthened management of nutrition services, bridging health worker vacancies, introducing volunteers in sites with high EPI case load, capacity building, and supportive supervision. Replacement of multiple health and nutrition records with a single mother and child health and nutrition card is also feasible. However, behavior change interventions through home visits and courtyard meetings need more testing before recommending scale-up.",

        "abstract": "With the pandemic reshaping healthcare delivery, telemedicine has emerged as a vital solution for overcoming access barriers, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Hence, this study explores the key drivers behind the sustained use of telemedicine services in low-income countries during the post-pandemic period. Using a quantitative research approach and purposive sampling technique, 273 valid responses were gathered from participants in Bangladesh. A comparative analysis utilizing partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were conducted to ensure greater accuracy. The PLS-SEM analysis revealed that expectation confirmation and perceived ease of use positively influence satisfaction. Similarly, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use directly impact Attitude toward telemedicine services. However, perceived usefulness and perceived security were not significantly associated with satisfaction and attitude toward telemedicine services, respectively. The findings highlight that user satisfaction drives continuance use intention for telemedicine services, but only when it also cultivates a positive attitude toward telemedicine services. While the PLS-SEM findings indicate that perceived usefulness has no significant relationship with satisfaction and perceived security is not significantly associated with attitude toward telemedicine services, the fsQCA results offer a different perspective. fsQCA reveals that perceived usefulness retains a significant association with satisfaction and that perceived security, regardless of whether its effect is high or low, is equally effective in contributing to the intention for continuous telemedicine use. These findings underscore fsQCA's ability to provide deeper insights into the complex causal relationships among the antecedents. The findings provide valuable insights for hospitals, doctors and telemedicine providers on retaining existing users. Additionally, governments can leverage this information to address healthcare disparities between urban and rural areas. The study also identifies strategies to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of healthcare services. This study advances telemedicine research by employing the extended technology continuance theory (ETCT) alongside a hybrid analytical approach that integrates PLS-SEM and fsQCA. It highlights that telemedicine organizations can boost patient confidence and encourage continued use by enhancing satisfaction and cultivating a positive user attitude. The innovative use of ETCT and the combined methodologies provide a comprehensive analysis, offering actionable strategies to retain telemedicine users in low-income countries during the post-pandemic period.",

        "abstract": "Oral zinc is a proven effective treatment for diarrheal illness, and long-term monitoring is key to evaluating the success of efforts to scale up zinc treatment. We examine zinc coverage for diarrheal illness in Bangladesh since the conclusion of the Scaling Up Zinc for Young Children (SUZY) project in 2008 and provide an overview of other countries' zinc scale-up programs to compare the long-term effectiveness of SUZY. We used data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys from 2005-2022 to examine the proportion of children under five receiving zinc treatment for diarrheal illness and evaluate disparities in zinc coverage by urbanicity and wealth quintile. We used a qualitative framework synthesis to compare the SUZY project with national or large-scale zinc scale-up programs in other low- and middle-income countries (Ghana, India, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Uganda). This method for synthesizing qualitative and quantitative data was used to break down components of the SUZY project and other national or large-scale zinc scale-up programs. In Bangladesh, zinc coverage has continued to increase since the conclusion of the SUZY project, disparities in coverage between urban and rural areas and across wealth quintiles have been resolved, and the prevalence of diarrheal illness has decreased from 10·8% in 2007 to 4·8% in 2022. The countries with the highest zinc coverage (Bangladesh, Kenya, Uganda) had national rather than regional scale-up campaigns. Our findings demonstrate the long-term success of the SUZY project and provide insights into best practices for impactful zinc scale-up programs including significant pre-launch implementation research addressing key knowledge gaps and partnering with research organizations. Long-term monitoring of scale-up campaigns is important to determine if these interventions can become socially embedded and self-sustaining, improving health outcomes in the long run.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to assess self-reported health complaints and healthcare-seeking behaviours in a rural population of Bangladesh. These factors are crucial for understanding health challenges and designing effective healthcare services in rural areas. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to October 2021. Four randomly selected administrative districts/regions of Bangladesh. A total of 1645 rural participants aged 18 years and older. The study assessed the prevalence of self-reported health complaints and healthcare-seeking behaviours. Among the participants, 66% (1084 out of 1645) reported experiencing health complaints, with 80% seeking care and 20% either not seeking care or opting for self-care. Multivariable analysis revealed that participants with formal occupations (adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.609; 95% CI 0.396 to 0.938; p=0.025), those from the second (aOR=1.742; 95% CI 1.014 to 2.991; p=0.044) and fifth quintiles (aOR=1.210; 95% CI 0.726 to 2.019; p=0.465), with non-communicable disease (NCD) related complaints (aOR=5.299; 95% CI 3.673 to 7.643; p <0.001), and those living more than 5 km from healthcare facilities (aOR=1.725; 95% CI 1.040 to 2.861; p=0.034), were more likely to seek healthcare. Additionally, participants in the wealthiest quintile (aOR=1.963; 95% CI 1.080 to 3.569; p=0.027), those with non-NCD complaints (aOR=5.299; 95% CI 3.673 to 7.643; p<0.001) and those living further than 5 km (aOR=4.615; 95% CI 3.121 to 6.824; p<0.001), were more likely to seek care from skilled providers or healthcare facilities. A high prevalence of self-reported health complaints, particularly related to NCDs, was observed. Despite this, many participants did not seek healthcare, indicating the need to address barriers to healthcare access and improve health-seeking behaviours in rural Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has made significant progress across various sectors, including healthcare. However, noticeable disparities persist in the healthcare sector, particularly in maternal healthcare between urban and rural areas. Despite substantial advancements in maternal healthcare services (MHCS), such as Antenatal care (ANC), Facility-Based Delivery (FBD), and Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA), utilization depends on various socioeconomic factors. This study aims to assess the impact of different factors and describe the urban-rural inequalities in maternal healthcare service utilization. This study's analysis is based on data extracted from the 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), following STROBE guidelines. Descriptive statistics provide an overview of the factors, and multiple logistic regression analysis identifies important factors in MHCS. Additionally, the Wagstaff decomposition method measures the concentration index, elasticity, contribution, and percentage contributions of different factors. According to -BDHS 2017-18, this study found a 51.84 % utilization of ANC visits. Women with \"Higher Education\" had odds ratios of 3.04, 3.05, and 3.12 for ANC, FBD, and SBA, respectively, compared to the \"No Education\" group. Similarly, women with partners having \"Higher Education\" exhibited odds ratios of 3.04, 3.05, and 3.12 for ANC, FBD, and SBA, respectively. Rich families had odds ratios of 1.91, 2.42, and 2.5 compared to the \"poor\" group for ANC, FBD, and SBA, respectively. Mother's education contributed 28.62 %, 30.3 %, and 30.47 % for ANC, FBD, and SBA, respectively. The household wealth index contributed 26.16 %, 38.49 %, and 40.3 % for ANC, FBD, and SBA, respectively of the urban-rural difference. Maternal healthcare services utilization shows a significant disparity, with rural areas reporting much lower rates compared to urban areas. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), this study's findings can help policymakers ensure equitable access to quality care for all women, irrespective of their socioeconomic background or geographical location.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents the most comprehensive and large-scale global study to date on how higher education students perceived the use of ChatGPT in early 2024. With a sample of 23,218 students from 109 countries and territories, the study reveals that students primarily used ChatGPT for brainstorming, summarizing texts, and finding research articles, with a few using it for professional and creative writing. They found it useful for simplifying complex information and summarizing content, but less reliable for providing information and supporting classroom learning, though some considered its information clearer than that from peers and teachers. Moreover, students agreed on the need for AI regulations at all levels due to concerns about ChatGPT promoting cheating, plagiarism, and social isolation. However, they believed ChatGPT could potentially enhance their access to knowledge and improve their learning experience, study efficiency, and chances of achieving good grades. While ChatGPT was perceived as effective in potentially improving AI literacy, digital communication, and content creation skills, it was less useful for interpersonal communication, decision-making, numeracy, native language proficiency, and the development of critical thinking skills. Students also felt that ChatGPT would boost demand for AI-related skills and facilitate remote work without significantly impacting unemployment. Emotionally, students mostly felt positive using ChatGPT, with curiosity and calmness being the most common emotions. Further examinations reveal variations in students' perceptions across different socio-demographic and geographic factors, with key factors influencing students' use of ChatGPT also being identified. Higher education institutions' managers and teachers may benefit from these findings while formulating the curricula and instructions/regulations for ChatGPT use, as well as when designing the teaching methods and assessment tools. Moreover, policymakers may also consider the findings when formulating strategies for secondary and higher education system development, especially in light of changing labor market needs and related digital skills development.",

        "abstract": "Utilization of maternal health care services, specifically, antenatal care services from skilled health providers have been given utmost priority in low- and middle-income countries over years with a view of mitigating complications during pregnancy as well as safeguarding the health and survival of both mother and newborn. However, there is a general tendency of pregnant mothers in Bangladesh of receiving skilled antenatal care (SANC) service once, or even never which refrains us to ensure World Health Organization (WHO) recommended eight plus SANC visits, additionally, to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number three. The study aims at assessing how the average number of SANC visits taken by the reproductive women in Bangladesh changes over the time in rural and urban areas together with finding out the potential demographic and socio-economic factors associated with SANC visits by addressing possible accumulation of zero and one counts in SANC visits. In this study, data have been retrieved from last four waves of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys ranging from 2011 to 2022 and later combined together to form a pooled dataset. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test has been performed for exploring unadjusted association of covariates with the response and Mann-Whitney U test has been conducted for multiple comparison in case of significant association for a covariate having more than two categories. For checking the existence of concurrent inflation at zero and one in the pooled dataset, partial score test has been performed. Based on the results of score test, Zero and One Inflated Poisson regression model has been fitted to the pooled dataset, where an interaction term between area of residence and survey year has been considered for trend analysis. The study highlights that the rate of mean SANC visits is rapidly rising with time among pregnant women not only from the urban areas but also from the rural areas of Bangladesh. However, the rate of change in uptaking the SANC visits is higher in rural area compared to urban area. It was observed that for a given survey year, the rate of mean SANC visits was higher among women from urban areas compared to that among women from rural areas of Bangladesh. This study provides the evidence of 17.2% extra zero counts and 1.1% extra one counts in the pooled dataset. The study results depict that inequity in SANC services based on area of residence prevails in Bangladesh. However, the gap in the rate of mean SANC visits in rural areas compared to urban areas has gradually reduced over time. Based on the results, the study comes up with some recommendations to facilitate the policy makers in improvising strategies and ensuring sustainable rise in SANC counts as well as WHO recommended positive pregnancy experience in the country to meet SDGs.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has experienced a rapid epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in recent decades. There is, however, limited evidence about multidimensional determinants of NCDs in this population. The BangladEsh Longitudinal Investigation of Emerging Vascular and nonvascular Events (BELIEVE) study is a household-based prospective cohort study established to investigate biological, behavioural, environmental and broader determinants of NCDs. Between January 2016 and March 2020, 73 883 participants (aged 11 years or older) were recruited from 30 817 households across urban, urban-poor ('slum') and rural settings in Bangladesh. A structured questionnaire was administered by trained personnel recording participants' demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural, medical, environmental and other factors. Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded for each participant. Biological specimens were collected and aliquoted for long-term storage and analysis. Of the 73 883 study participants (mean [SD] baseline age: 39 [15] years), 43 470 (59%) were females, and 38 848 (52%) had no or only primary-level education. Focusing only on the 65 822 adult participants aged 20-79 years at baseline, 15 411 (23%) reported being diagnosed with hypertension; 10 578 (16%) with type 2 diabetes and 7624 (12%) with hypercholesterolaemia. Age and sex-standardised prevalences of these conditions were much higher in urban than slum and rural settings. Overall, the mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 25 (5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with 10 442 (16%) participants aged 20-79, classified as obese (ie, BMI≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Mean BMI was also higher in urban than slum and rural areas. The collection of information during the baseline visit was completed in 2020. Regular longitudinal follow-up is ongoing for ascertainment and adjudication of a range of fatal and non-fatal health outcomes among participants. This cohort will provide a powerful resource to investigate multidimensional determinants of incident NCDs across diverse settings in Bangladesh, helping to advance scientific discovery and public health action in an archetypal low-middle-income country with pressing public health needs.",

This study applied a qualitative approach among persons with diabetes who attended diabetic foot clinics from August to September 2021. Participants were selected through purposive sampling and included any self-identified Fijian aged 18 years and over who had type 2 diabetes with a minimum diagnosis duration of 6 months and no experience of an amputation. Data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews, and the content of interviews was transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis to generate themes and subthemes outlined in the study. The study included 30 participants. Three major themes were identified. The first was patient perceptions of diabetic foot complications, which showed that there was very limited patient knowledge of how diabetes caused foot complications. The second was practising foot care, which reflected that commonly practised recommendations were associated with daily activities like washing the feet. Third was patient perceptions of footcare services, whereby the majority were generally happy with the footcare services available to them. The study results indicated that patients lacked sufficient knowledge about the symptoms and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and healthy practices related to food complications. More effort needs to be invested into diabetes and footcare knowledge and practices for patients at the Sigatoka Hospital. This will help guide patients to make life-altering decisions that can help reduce the rate of diabetes related lower limb amputations, which are easily preventable.",

Nutrition interventions for women are delivered through maternal health services such as antenatal care and institutional deliveries, but whether they reach and protect the disadvantaged against malnutrition is not well documented. To assess the similarities in socioeconomic disparities and inequalities in the nutritional status and health care of women. We analyzed nationally representative data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, and Nigeria to calculate Erreygers index. This index measures the inequality in outcomes across socioeconomic spectrums. We investigated inequalities in low and high body mass index (BMI), anaemia, iron and folic acid supplementation, four or more antenatal care visits, institutional deliveries, and access to health services. Anaemia (-0.068 to -0.123), low BMI (-0.088 to -0.139), perceived distance to health services (-0.219 to -0.406), and needing permission to visit health facilities (-0.062 to -0.147) were concentrated among the less well-off, as shown by negative values. Iron and folic acid supplementation (0.043 to 0.230), antenatal care visits (0.260 to 0.495), and institutional deliveries (0.168 to 0.573) favored the better-off, as shown by positive values. Inequalities in urban vs. rural areas differed by indicator and country. Nutritional status and health care inequalities among women followed patterns of socioeconomic disparities. Inequalities in nutritional status favored the better-off and educated women, and inequalities favoring the better-off were even greater for health care across countries.",

Herein, we present Japan's experience in training medical coordinators to combat NCDs, with a focus on hepatitis, early-onset dementia, and children with medical complexity. Coordinators play an important role in bridging the gap between patients and healthcare services. We examined the training and roles of the coordinators. In the Japanese model, medical coordinators, including both medical and non-medical personnel, have successfully strengthened the delivery of healthcare services for specific diseases. However, challenges persist, including the uneven distribution of coordinators, inconsistencies in training programs, the program's relatively recent establishment, and limited awareness of coordinators' roles and activities. Training medical coordinators can strengthen comprehensive patient support in managing NCDs. Despite its limitations, this model provides valuable insights for developing interventional strategies in other Asian countries facing similar medical human resource shortages.

        "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) affects a substantial number of children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh. Maternal health literacy is critical to the health and well-being of children with CP, particularly in low-resource settings. In this study, we sought to assess how the mPower (mother's power) community-based intervention impacted mothers' CP-specific knowledge, as well as their utilization of rehabilitation services in rural Bangladesh. This quasi-experimental study was conducted with a group of mothers of children with CP, formed through the ongoing initiatives of the Bangladesh CP Register in rural Bangladesh. A pre-post-intervention comparison method was used to assess the outcomes of the intervention. Mothers who participated in over two-thirds of the mPower sessions demonstrated a significant increase in CP-related knowledge (75.5% vs. 63.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.04). Additionally, mothers who attended two-thirds of the mPower sessions utilized rehabilitation services more often compared to those who attended fewer sessions (55.3% vs. 22.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The mPower intervention successfully improved health literacy and likely increased rehabilitation service utilization among mothers of children with CP in rural Bangladesh.",

This study aims to determine the knowledge and practices of the rural population in two subdistricts of Bangladesh regarding snakebite prevention and first aid measures. This cross-sectional survey is part of an intervention study that was carried out in 250 randomly selected primary sampling units of Shibganj in the Chapainawabganj district and Kalapara in the Patuakhali district of Bangladesh. We enrolled a total of 2954 participants. The practice and knowledge were regarded adequate when the score exceeded 50%. We conducted a binomial logistic regression to identify the factors associated with inadequate knowledge and practice. The community's knowledge (15.9%) and practice (14.5%) regarding snakebite prevention was insufficient. More than 77% and 45.4% of respondents believed that applying a tourniquet above the bite site and seeking a traditional healer after a snakebite were effective first aid measures. Poor knowledge was more likely to occur in farming, fishing, homemaker groups and those with lower incomes (11 000-24 000 Bangladeshi taka). Negative practices were associated with females and high family income. This study highlights the necessity of community intervention, with a focus on appropriate first aid and prevention measures through widespread education.",

        "abstract": "High-risk fertility behaviors (HRFB), including short birth intervals, early or late childbearing age, and high parity, are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Understanding the importance of socioeconomic disparity in HRFB and the factors influencing this disparity is essential to improve maternal and child survival, Accordingly, this study investigated socioeconomic inequalities in HRFB over time and its contributing factors. We included a total weighted sample of 11,163 and 5,527 women aged 15 to 49 years from the 2005 and 2019 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys, respectively. Erreygers Concentration index (ECI) and curve, along with Erreygers normalized decomposition analysis, were used to examine socioeconomic-related inequalities in HFRB and identify contributing factors to these inequalities. The study showed that the concentration curve for HFRB remained above the equality line over time, indicating a disproportionate concentration among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. In 2005, the pro-poor ECI was -0.0682; in 2019, it was -0.2634, indicating that pro-poor inequality has widened. Educational status (10% in 2005 and 28% in 2019), place of birth (7% in 2005 and 28% in 2019), religion (16% in 2005 and 4% in 2019), and region (9% in 2005 and 3% in 2019) contributed to the observed pro-poor inequality. In 2019, contraceptive use (12%) and wealth index (15%) emerged as additional factors explaining HRFB inequality. Our findings revealed the disproportional concentration of HRFB among socioeconomically disadvantaged women in Ethiopia, with a widening disparity between 2005 and 2019. Future interventions to address the effect of socioeconomic disadvantage on HRFB should prioritize women with low or no formal education, those who give birth at home, and those who do not use contraceptives.",

        "abstract": "Women in rural Bangladesh encounter significant barriers to seeking mental healthcare, primarily due to stigmatization rooted in a lack of knowledge about mental health. To address this issue, community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been identified as a promising approach. CBPR involves the active collaboration of community members and stakeholders in the research process to tackle pressing community issues. This study examines the application of CBPR to enhance mental health awareness and education among women. The program described in this study leverages local technology centers and community health workers to boost participation in improving access to equitable mental healthcare and increasing health literacy. Implemented across three rural districts in Bangladesh, the program began with a needs assessment survey to evaluate participants' knowledge, experiences, and stigmatization of psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, suicide, and postpartum depression. This survey assessed baseline knowledge, personal experiences, and the perceived impact of mental wellness as a community issue. Additionally, five focus group discussions were conducted at local tech hubs with trained community health workers to explore participants' perceptions and attitudes toward mental health. These discussions highlighted the role of medical misinformation, the shortage of professionals, and other factors contributing to mental health stigmatization. The study's second phase would focus on developing digital medical content for screening at tech hubs, followed by live Q&A sessions with Bangladeshi health experts. This initiative aims to familiarize women with user-friendly telehealth services, fostering healthcare literacy and improving well-being in rural Bangladesh.",

This observational study aims to understand rural-urban differences in telehealth utilization during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual-level data from the National Health Interview Survey 2020-2021 (age ≥18) were analyzed for this study. The Propensity Score Matching method with multivariable Ordinary Least Square was used to analyze 2 outcome variables-(1) having a medical appointment by video or phone in the past 12 months and (2) having a virtual one for reasons related to the pandemic. Event study models were analyzed to understand the trend of telehealth utilization throughout 6 quarters of the pandemic. Subgroup analysis by health insurance, age, sex, race, citizenship, and disability status was performed to identify underlying disparities between rural and urban residents. Analysis reveals that rural respondents (N = 6,984) were 8.7 percentage points (P<.001) less likely than urban respondents (N = 40,207) to have a medical appointment by video or phone. Rural residents were 8.1 percentage points (P<.001) less likely to have had a virtual medical appointment because of reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic than urban users. The event study showed that rural-urban telehealth utilization disparities persisted throughout the pandemic. Subgroup analysis revealed significant rural-urban disparities in telehealth utilization by demographic characteristics. Results demonstrate that rural residents were less likely than urban residents to utilize telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting concerns about access to care for rural residents.",

We aim to investigate the missed opportunities in generating ECP awareness through ANC and FWA visit programs; and assess the missed opportunities and sociodemographic discrimination in receiving family planning (FP) counseling during ANC. We used data from the nationwide Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18. Sample includes 5012 reproductive-aged women who gave live birth in the last 3 years preceding the survey. We used mixed-effect multiple logistic regression considering women nested within clusters to conclude. Nationally, 79% of women who gave live birth in the last 3 years preceding the survey were unaware of ECP. The estimated missed opportunities in generating ECP awareness was 59.5% in ANC, 0.9% in FWA visits, and 12.3% in both ANC and FWA visits. While FWA visit was not associated with ECP awareness, receiving FP counseling during ANC was significantly associated. About 88.4% of women remained unexposed to FP counseling through ANC during their last pregnancy. Missed opportunities in FP counseling during ANC was 80.4% of which 72% points were from qualified providers. The odds of missed opportunities was not associated with provider type, rather significantly increased among women with low education, lower parity, and poor socioeconomic status. This study highlights the fragile status of FP counseling during ANC and FWA visits in generating ECP awareness. A prominent provider bias is excluding women of the disadvantageous sociodemographic group from receiving FP counseling.",

        "abstract": "The capacity to anticipate future health issues is important for both policy makers and practitioners in the USA, as such insights can facilitate effective planning, investment, and implementation strategies. Forecasting trends in disease and injury burden is not only crucial for policy makers but also garners substantial interest from the general populace and leads to a better-informed public. Through the integration of new data sources, the refinement of methodologies, and the inclusion of additional causes, we have improved our previous forecasting efforts within the scope of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce forecasts at the state and national levels for the USA under various possible scenarios. We developed a comprehensive framework for forecasting life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 359 causes of disease and injury burden from 2022 to 2050 for the USA and all 50 states and Washington, DC. Using the GBD 2021 Future Health Scenarios modelling framework, we forecasted drivers of disease, demographic drivers, risk factors, temperature and particulate matter, mortality and years of life lost (YLL), population, and non-fatal burden. In addition to a reference scenario (representing the most probable future trajectory), we explored various future scenarios and their potential impacts over the next several decades on human health. These alternative scenarios comprised four risk elimination scenarios (including safer environment, improved behavioural and metabolic risks, improved childhood nutrition and vaccination, and a combined scenario) and three USA-specific scenarios based on risk exposure or attributable burden in the best-performing US states (improved high adult BMI and high fasting plasma glucose [FPG], improved smoking, and improved drug use [encompassing opioids, cocaine, amphetamine, and others]). Life expectancy in the USA is projected to increase from 78·3 years (95% uncertainty interval 78·1-78·5) in 2022 to 79·9 years (79·5-80·2) in 2035, and to 80·4 years (79·8-81·0) in 2050 for all sexes combined. This increase is forecasted to be modest compared with that in other countries around the world, resulting in the USA declining in global rank over the 2022-50 forecasted period among the 204 countries and territories in GBD, from 49th to 66th. There is projected to be a decline in female life expectancy in West Virginia between 1990 and 2050, and little change in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Additionally, after 2023, we projected almost no change in female life expectancy in many states, notably in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Maine, and Wisconsin. Female HALE is projected to decline between 1990 and 2050 in 20 states and to remain unchanged in three others. Drug use disorders and low back pain are projected to be the leading Level 3 causes of age-standardised DALYs in 2050. The age-standardised DALY rate due to drug use disorders is projected to increase considerably between 2022 and 2050 (19·5% [6·9-34·1]). Our combined risk elimination scenario shows that the USA could gain 3·8 additional years (3·6-4·0) of life expectancy and 4·1 additional years (3·9-4·3) of HALE in 2050 versus the reference scenario. Using our USA-specific scenarios, we forecasted that the USA could gain 0·4 additional years (0·3-0·6) of life expectancy and 0·6 additional years (0·5-0·8) of HALE in 2050 under the improved drug use scenario relative to the reference scenario. Life expectancy and HALE are likewise projected to be 0·4-0·5 years higher in 2050 under the improved adult BMI and FPG and improved smoking scenarios compared with the reference scenario. However, the increases in these scenarios would not substantially improve the USA's global ranking in 2050 (from 66th of 204 in life expectancy in the reference scenario to 63rd-64th in each of the three USA-specific scenarios), indicating that the USA's best-performing states are still lagging behind other countries in their rank throughout the forecasted period. Regardless, an estimated 12·4 million (11·3-13·5) deaths could be averted between 2022 and 2050 if the USA were to follow the combined scenario trajectory rather than the reference scenario. There would also be 1·4 million (0·7-2·2) fewer deaths over the 28-year forecasted period with improved adult BMI and FPG, 2·1 million (1·3-2·9) fewer deaths with improved exposure to smoking, and 1·2 million (0·9-1·5) fewer deaths with lower rates of drug use deaths. Our findings highlight the alarming trajectory of health challenges in the USA, which, if left unaddressed, could lead to a reversal of the health progress made over the past three decades for some US states and a decline in global health standing for all states. The evidence from our alternative scenarios along with other published studies suggests that through collaborative, evidence-based strategies, there are opportunities to change the trajectory of health outcomes in the USA, such as by investing in scientific innovation, health-care access, preventive health care, risk exposure reduction, and education. Our forecasts clearly show that the time to act is now, as the future of the country's health and wellbeing-as well as its prosperity and leadership position in science and innovation-are at stake.

Using data from the third iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA), we aimed to systematically identify sub-national geographic or population clusters with high prevalence of CKD. The ISN-GKHA survey was conducted from July to September 2022, and included questions regarding whether a regional CKD hotspot existed in the respondents' country and possible contributors. A CKD hotspot was defined as a population cluster with a high risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant, or people dying from kidney failure. Overall, 46 out of 162 responding countries reported subnational hotspots for CKD within their country. Hotspots were reported across all regions, except for the Middle East. Latin America had the highest percentage (12 of 21, 57%) of countries reporting a regional CKD hotspot followed by the regions of North and East Asia, and Western Europe. Adults aged 18 to 44 years and rural populations were most commonly identified as the primary groups affected. Clinical factors were most commonly identified as contributors to CKD (hypertension in 74% and diabetes in 72%), followed by cultural (e.g., diet and herbal medications in 67%), and environmental (e.g., polluted water in 43%) factors. Latin American countries more commonly reported climate, cultural, and environmental factors as contributors compared to other regions. Across the world, there are a number of subnational regions where in-country experts identify a disproportionately higher burden of CKD, commonly occurring among younger age groups with clinical, cultural, and environmental contributors specific to these geographic regions. In-depth studies, starting with systematic epidemiology efforts, are needed to investigate the aetiopathogenesis of these CKD hotspots around the world so that tailored interventions can be offered.",

Outcome measures were grouped into five thematic families. The primary outcome families were school hygiene practice & maintenance, school-aggregated child handwashing and school-aggregated child dentalcare. Utilising the difference-in-differences estimator with seemingly unrelated regression, we estimated the average treatment effect for each family of multiple outcomes. The intervention spillover effect to neighbouring schools along with the time-period effect were also evaluated. The project's cost-effectiveness was additionally assessed. Our findings revealed that SBHE had a positive impact on primary outcomes related to healthy practices and behavioural changes, resulting in a 0.32SD improvement in school hygiene practices and maintenance (p < 0.001), a 0.47SD increase in child handwashing (p < 0.001), and a 0.43SD enhancement in child dentalcare (p < 0.01). Despite its imperfect implementation, the provision of soap itself showed no significant effect. Furthermore, significant spillover effects of healthy practices were observed in neighbouring non-treatment schools. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that our SBHE program was cost-effective. Our study provides compelling evidence of the positive impact of SBHE on school hygiene and child health practices in rural Bangladesh, with notable spillover effects. The cost-effectiveness analysis underscores the value of SBHE, affirming its potential as an effective intervention method in improving school health and hygiene practices in primary schools and beyond.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to explore the burden of disasters and adverse health outcomes during and following disasters in Bangladesh. We analyzed 6 788 947 respondents' data from a cross-sectional and nationally representative 2021 Bangladesh Disaster-related Statistics (BDRS). The key explanatory variables were the types of disasters respondents faced, while the outcome variables were the disease burden during and following disasters. Descriptive statistics were used to determine disease burden. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model assessed the association between disease burden and disaster types, along with socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. Nearly 50% of respondents experienced diseases during disasters, rising to 53.4% afterward. Fever, cough and diarrhea were prevalent during and after disasters, with increases in skin diseases, malnutrition, and asthma post-disaster. Vulnerable groups, such as children aged 0-4, hijra individuals, those with lower education, people with disabilities, and rural residents, especially in Chattogram, Rangpur, and Sylhet divisions, were most affected. Floods, cyclones, thunderstorms, and hailstorms significantly increased disease likelihood during and after disasters. The study underscores the complex relationship between disasters and health outcomes in Bangladesh, stressing the need for targeted public health interventions, improved health care infrastructure, and evidence-based policies to mitigate disaster-related health risks.",

        "abstract": "Anemia is a major public health concern; however, research on anemia and its contributing variables is scarce. To address the gap, we investigated the prevalence and associated factors of anemia in school-aged adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study in two secondary schools at Chandpur, Bangladesh, from January to April 2022. We randomly selected 422 adolescent girls based on prevalence rates from existing research to ensure reliable estimates and a robust study representation. We performed interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire after receiving ethical permission and written informed consent. In addition, physical examination and anthropometric measurements were done, followed by blood testing to identify anemia. Blood hemoglobin was measured using a spectrophotometric method, and quality control was ensured by validated results with control samples. Univariate with multiple logistic regression was employed for analysis to find the association between anemia and all other variables that were adjusted to control the potential effect of confounding variables. The overall prevalence of anemia was 37.7% (mild- 33.8% and moderate- 3.9%). In the univariate analysis having a working mother (OR 3.84; 95% CI 1.31-11.26), undernutrition (OR 2.40; 95% CI 1.27-4.52), and irregular lunch consumption (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.00-4.60) were associated with anemia. Conversely, being a user of a slab latrine (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40-0.93) and not weekly consumption of pure milk (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.41-0.92) were negatively associated with anemia. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, associated factors for prevalent anemia were working mother [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.65; 95% CI 1.97-29.50], slab latrine user (aOR 0.46; 95% CI 0.26-0.79), and irregular lunch consumption (aOR 2.92; 95% CI 1.21-7.03). The prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh remains high with undernutrition. Anemia is associated with working mothers, slab latrine users, and irregular lunch consumers within the studied population.' Thus, policymakers may promote school-based nutritional education and lunch programs with iron supplementation and improve sanitary facilities.",

        "abstract": "The government of Bangladesh has initiated Adolescent Friendly Health Services (AFHS) at health facilities to improve access of adolescents to quality health care. This study aimed to document the AFHS program experiences and interventions implemented in four districts of Bangladesh. The study adopted review of literature, relevant project documents, research reports and analysis of secondary data on AFHS. The secondary data was extracted from the government District Health Information System (DHIS-2) and the HMIS (Health Management Information System) of Family planning department of the four study districts in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2019. Introduction of the AFHS program in Government health facilities had a positive impact on raising awareness among the community. It increased the proportion of adolescents receiving health services (from 6% in the pre-intervention period to 86% in the post-intervention period). The involvement of school authorities in disseminating AFHS program activities resulted in a 68.51% rise in adolescent referrals from schools. Publicity of the program and privacy of the service recipients are considered as enabling factors for the acceptance of AFHS. However, training of the service providers on comprehensive adolescent healthcare packages and expanding logistics support to the health facilities are needed for improvement of the overall service. The government of Bangladesh is committed to implementing adolescent friendly services, evident by adoption of national level strategy and guidelines through government health system, using existing resources with an additional financial support from development partners. The IEC (Information, Education and Communication) materials on AFHS, developed by different organizations were used for awareness program on AFHS. The healthcare providers were oriented/trained on AFHS, mental health, nutrition and counseling skills. Multi-sectoral collaboration at all levels: national to local level (schools, communities, adolescents club) were adopted for sustainability of this initiative.",

        "abstract": "Geographically remote areas in lower-middle-income countries like Bangladesh experienced significant Maternal and Child Health (MCH) care shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. These shortages were exacerbated by preexisting inadequate public health infrastructure and using existing health resources for pandemic management. The objective of this study was to assess the status of access to and utilization of maternal and child healthcare services among rural people during the outbreak of COVID-19. A community-based descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study was carried out from May to August 2020 among the rural people of the four districts of northern Bangladesh. A total of 639 women were included in the study with a sample random sampling technique, and multistage random sampling techniques were applied to select the study area. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. SPSS Version 22 was used for the statistical analysis. The mean age of the respondents was 34.3 years with an SD ± 10 years. 37.7% of respondents belonged to the 21-30 year age group followed by the 31-40 years age group (34.9 %). Of the total 639 respondents, 59.5% were female. There were significant associations and moderate positive correlations between educational qualification, occupational status, and age group of the respondents (<i>p</i>=0.001). Most of the respondents (67.6%) indicated that they experienced health problems during COVID-19 with 70.6% of them specifically mentioning MCH-related problems. Out of them, only 33.1% mentioned they could access and utilize MCH services, whereas 66.9% of them could not access MCH Services. Major barriers to utilizing MCH services were the COVID-19 lockdown, lack of transport facilities, fear of being infected, shutdown of healthcare facilities, and unavailability of healthcare professionals. The differences in health facility usage before and during COVID-19 are statistically significant with p = < 0.001. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to and utilization of MCH services was significantly hampered, particularly in Bangladesh's remote and rural regions during the strict lockdown times. The identified barriers were the COVID-19 lockdown, lack of transport facilities, fear of being infected, shutdown of healthcare facilities, and unavailability of healthcare professionals. Building strengthened health systems, capacity building of informal healthcare providers, backup plans, and alternate service delivery models are necessary to ensure access to maternity and child health. For future pandemics and natural disaster situations, the 'concerned officials should strategically have backup plans and alternative service delivery models to strengthen the health system. And, there should be collaborative efforts among the countries to support each other to address the crisis situations.",

        "abstract": "Perinatal mental disorders of women have an impact on their pregnancy and their child's brain development across low and middle-income countries. However, to address this issue, there are no specific guidelines for community-level service providers in Bangladesh. Therefore, we aimed to develop a community-based mental healthcare (CBMHC) service package and test its effectiveness in reducing depression, anxiety, and stress among mothers during the perinatal period. A cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) was applied to test the CBMHC package in 2017 and 2018. It was provided to one group of mothers along with routine maternal care while another group received only routine maternal care. Paired sample t-test was applied to assess mean changes at baseline and endline in the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and EuroQol-5 Dimension and 3 Level (EQ5D3L) scales. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess the relationship between the DASS-21 score and EQ5D3L. 1215 participants were enrolled, including 605 in the intervention group and 610 in the control group. Measures of depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly decreased in both groups. Reduction in the levels of stress, as measured by changes in the stress score, were significantly greater in the intervention than in the control group (diff: 1.2, 95 % CI: 0.1, 2.2). The EQ5D3L index improved significantly, 0.02 units more at endline in the intervention group than in the control group (diff: 0.02, 95 % CI: 0.007, 0.03). The levels of mobility, usual activities, pain or discomfort, depression, and anxiety improved by 1.4 %, 7.6 %, 4.4 %, 2.6 %, and 0.4 % more, respectively, in the intervention group compared to the control groups. These improvements were statistically significant. The DASS-21 score was negatively and significantly correlated with both the EQ-5D3L index and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for the intervention group as well as for the usual care group, indicating that EQ5D3L improved when common mental disorders decreased. Although the improvements were modest, a CBMHC service package was effective in reducing perinatal levels of stress among Bangladeshi rural women. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03678415.",

        "abstract": "Malaria poses a serious issue for pregnant women in African regions. It is crucial to comprehend the various factors that impact receiving IPTp during ANC checkups. These are important for the well-being of both pregnant mothers and their unborn children. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the determinants of IPTp coverage among women in Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, and Nigeria. This cross-sectional study utilized secondary data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) across Cameroon, Guinea, Mali, and Nigeria, focusing on women who received IPTp during pregnancy with IPTp categorized dichotomously as \"Yes\" for ANC visits and \"No\" for other visits. Chi-squared tests were used to assess associations, and binary logistic regression was conducted to calculate adjusted odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values. Results were summarized in tables. We found IPTp coverage during ANC visits was highest in Cameroon (98.6%), followed by Guinea (97.7%), Mali (97.1%), and lowest in Nigeria (95.5%). In Guinea, rural women were less likely to receive IPTp than urban women (AOR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07-0.41, p<0.001). In Mali, women who received 3 or more doses were less likely to receive IPTp at ANC (AOR: 0.48, p<0.01). In Nigeria, personal transport increased IPTp uptake (AOR: 1.88, p<0.01). In Cameroon, malaria prevention messages improved IPTp coverage (AOR: 3.12, p<0.05). This study highlights significant disparities in IPTp uptake, with rural Mali and Guinea facing lower coverage. In Nigeria, personal transport improved IPTp uptake. Targeted interventions are needed to improve ANC services and ensure equitable IPTp access across the study regions.",

        "abstract": "An Android platform-based customised app and web-linked system was developed to aid in implementing selected nutrition interventions by community health workers (CHWs) in a community-based cluster randomised trial (c-RCT) in rural Bangladesh. Here, we describe the architecture of the intervention delivery system, and explore feasibility of employing mHealth as CHWs' job aid, employing a mixed-method study design covering 17 visits per mother-child dyad. We analysed CHWs' real-time visit information from monitoring and documentation data, and CHWs' qualitative interviews to explore the advantages and barriers of using mHealth as a job aid. Intervention coverage was high across the arms (>90%), except around the narrow perinatal period (51%) due to mothers' cultural practice of moving to their parents' homes and/or hospitals for childbirth. CHWs mentioned technical and functional advantages of the job aid including device portability, easy navigability of content, pictorial demonstration that improved communication, easy information entry, and automated daily scheduling of tasks. Technical challenges included charging tablets, especially in power cut-prone areas, deteriorated battery capacity over continuous device usage, unstable internet network in unsupportive weather conditions, and device safety. Nevertheless, onsite supervision and monitoring by expert supervisors remained important to ensure intervention quality. With appropriate training and supervision, CHWs utilised the tablet-based app proficiently, attaining high coverage of long-term visits. mHealth was thus useful for designing, planning, scheduling, and delivering nutrition interventions through CHWs, and for monitoring and supervision by supervisors. Therefore, this application and job aid can be adopted or replicated into the currently developing national health systems platform for improving coverage and quality of preventive maternal and child nutrition services. In addition, continuous supportive supervision by skilled supervisors must be accompanied to ensure CHWs' task quality. Finally, future studies should rigorously assess undesirable health and environmental effects of mHealth before and after mainstreaming, effective interventions addressing device-induced health hazards should be designed and scaled up, and effective e-waste management must be ensured.",

        "abstract": "Among 13 endemic districts, the Chittagong Hill Tracts bear more than 90% of Bangladesh's malaria burden. Despite the private sector's prominence in rural healthcare, its role in malaria management remains underutilized. This study aimed to strategize leveraging the for-profit private sector, such as diagnostic and treatment centers, to bolster national malaria surveillance and control, advancing Bangladesh toward malaria elimination by 2030. This mixed-method study commenced with a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey followed by selected focused group discussions (FGDs) among the participants. Three FGDs were held with the for-profit service providers so that further insights and qualitative viewpoints of them can be utilized in situation analysis. Based on the endemicity and strategic priorities, a comprehensive mapping of private for-profit facilities from the regions comprising 15 sub-districts across 8 chosen districts (7 malaria endemic districts and the rest non-endemic districts) was created. For the non-endemic zone, the sub-districts were selected based on their proximity to an area with high malaria transmission. Among the 104 representative participants, majority were male (n = 92, 88.5%), had a diploma in their respective fields (n = 53, 51%) and were involved either in laboratory work (n = 49, 47.1%) or as owners/managers of health centers (n = 41, 39.4%). The selected health facilities were close to the corresponding Upazila Health Complexes (mean distance 2.8 km), but were distantly located from the designated district hospitals (mean distance 48.9 km). The main sources of RDT kits (62.3%) and anti-malarial drugs (63.2%) were local wholesale markets. A large share of the corresponding facilities neither provided malaria treatment services (81.7%) nor worked with the NMEP (93.3%). This study highlights challenges and recommendations for engaging private for-profit health facilities in Bangladesh's malaria elimination efforts. The identified challenges include low-quality RDTs, staff shortages, and inadequate capacity building. Recommendations emphasize effective training, stakeholder interaction, and enhanced oversight for successful malaria control efforts.",

To assess the attributable burden of injury risk factors, the data of interest on data sources were retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and analyzed. Cause-specific death from injuries was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble model in the GBD 2019. The burden attributable to each injury risk factor was incorporated in the population attributable fraction to estimate the total attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years. The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) was used to evaluate countries' developmental status. Globally, there were 713.9 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 663.8 to 766.9) injuries incidence and 4.3 million (UI: 3.9 to 4.6) deaths caused by injuries in 2019. There was an inverse relationship between age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rate and SDI quintiles in 2019. Overall, low bone mineral density was the leading risk factor of injury deaths in 2019, with a contribution of 10.5% (UI: 9.0 to 11.6) of total injuries and age-standardized deaths, followed by occupational risks (7.0% [UI: 6.3-7.9]) and alcohol use (6.8% [UI: 5.2 to 8.5]). Various risks were responsible for the imposed burden of injuries. This study highlighted the small but persistent share of injuries in the global burden of diseases and injuries to provide beneficial data to produce proper policies to reach an effective global injury prevention plan.",

        "title": "Excess mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh - evidence from a rural survey.",
        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a profound impact worldwide. In Bangladesh, the official number of deaths for COVID-19 was around 29 000. However, many countries including Bangladesh experienced substantial underreporting of COVID-19 deaths due to lack of complete national civil registration system. This study aims to estimate excess mortality in 2020, identify risk factors, and determine leading causes of death in Bangladesh. In February 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional household survey in Sitakunda, a subdistrict of Chattogram, identifying deaths from January 2018 to December 2020. Excess mortality was quantified using the p-score and incidence rate ratio (IRR) utilising Poisson segmented regression. We employed the InterVA-5 algorithm to attribute causes of death. Proportional distribution and cause-specific mortality rates (CSMR) per 100 000 individuals were compared between pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Among 1748 deaths from 25 669 households, we found 1.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-1.4) times excess mortality in 2020 compared to 2018-2019. Leading causes of death in 2020 included cardiac disease (CSMR = 121.0, CI = 115.8-127.3), stroke (CSMR = 108.0, CI = 102.6-114.0), and acute respiratory infection (CSMR = 61.0, CI = 55.1-66.5), all displaying significantly higher mortality rates than in previous years. Older age (IRR = 1.6), less education (IRR = 1.8), and lower socio-economic groups (IRR = 2.1) had higher mortality rates in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic years. Our study suggests high rural excess mortality during COVID-19 including cardiac disease, stroke and acute respiratory infection as the leading causes of deaths. We require targeted strategies to identify high-risk patients with comorbidity and social vulnerabilities that contribute to mortality to guide the preparedness strategy for future pandemics.",

This study aimed to identify the prevalence and clustering of NCDs risk factors among Bangladeshi men and women aged 20-59 years using nationally representative data. This study was conducted in 82 rural, nonslum urban, and slum clusters across all eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh using multistage cluster sampling. A total of 4917 men and 4905 women aged 20-59 years were included in the study. Descriptive analyses were performed to report the prevalence and distribution of behavioral and clinical risk factors. Multivariable binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with the coexistence of three or more NCD risk factors. The prevalence of tobacco use (any form), insufficient physical activity, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, overweight and obesity, and central obesity were 38.3%, 13.6%, 87.1%, 42.3%, and 36.0%, respectively. Furthermore, 21.9% and 4.9% participants had hypertension and self-reported diabetes, respectively. Regarding the clustering of risk factors, 37.1% men and 50.8% women had at least three NCD risk factors. Only 3.0% men and 1.8% women reported no NCD risk factors. Age, place of residence, education, and wealth status were associated with the presence of at least three risk factors for both sexes. Since a large proportion of Bangladeshi 20-59 years old population had multiple risk factors, population-based programs with multisectoral approaches are essential to reduce NCDs among Bangladeshi women and men.",

However, little is known about the sociocultural barriers and enablers to accessing and using PHC and MHC services among rural Bangladeshi women. This qualitative study aimed to identify sociocultural barriers and enablers to accessing and using PHC and MHC services among Bangladeshi rural women by using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). This exploratory qualitative study used focus groups and interviews to collect data from women (28), their husbands (8) and healthcare providers (18). Data were analysed using Framework approach underpinned by the TDF. Four main themes emerged from data analysis, of which key barriers were summarised in three themes: (i) family barriers including lack of family reinforcement, (ii) social barriers including gender of healthcare providers, and (iii) cultural barriers including superstition to access and use of healthcare services. The remaining theme, sociocultural support, included information about key enablers, such as family support, neighbourhood connection and media influence. Several key behavioural constructs that aligned with the TDF need to be targeted when developing an intervention to promote access and use of PHC and MHC services.",

        "title": "Forecasting the effects of smoking prevalence scenarios on years of life lost and life expectancy from 2022 to 2050: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
        "abstract": "Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies. In this analysis, we use the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Future Health Scenarios platform to forecast the effects of three smoking prevalence scenarios on all-cause and cause-specific YLLs and life expectancy at birth until 2050. YLLs were computed for each scenario using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 reference life table and forecasts of cause-specific mortality under each scenario. The reference scenario forecasts what could occur if past smoking prevalence and other risk factor trends continue, the Tobacco Smoking Elimination as of 2023 (Elimination-2023) scenario quantifies the maximum potential future health benefits from assuming zero percent smoking prevalence from 2023 onwards, whereas the Tobacco Smoking Elimination by 2050 (Elimination-2050) scenario provides estimates for countries considering policies to steadily reduce smoking prevalence to 5%. Together, these scenarios underscore the magnitude of health benefits that could be reached by 2050 if countries take decisive action to eliminate smoking. The 95% uncertainty interval (UI) of estimates is based on the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile of draws that were carried through the multistage computational framework. Global age-standardised smoking prevalence was estimated to be 28·5% (95% UI 27·9-29·1) among males and 5·96% (5·76-6·21) among females in 2022. In the reference scenario, smoking prevalence declined by 25·9% (25·2-26·6) among males, and 30·0% (26·1-32·1) among females from 2022 to 2050. Under this scenario, we forecast a cumulative 29·3 billion (95% UI 26·8-32·4) overall YLLs among males and 22·2 billion (20·1-24·6) YLLs among females over this period. Life expectancy at birth under this scenario would increase from 73·6 years (95% UI 72·8-74·4) in 2022 to 78·3 years (75·9-80·3) in 2050. Under our Elimination-2023 scenario, we forecast 2·04 billion (95% UI 1·90-2·21) fewer cumulative YLLs by 2050 compared with the reference scenario, and life expectancy at birth would increase to 77·6 years (95% UI 75·1-79·6) among males and 81·0 years (78·5-83·1) among females. Under our Elimination-2050 scenario, we forecast 735 million (675-808) and 141 million (131-154) cumulative YLLs would be avoided among males and females, respectively. Life expectancy in 2050 would increase to 77·1 years (95% UI 74·6-79·0) among males and 80·8 years (78·3-82·9) among females. Existing tobacco policies must be maintained if smoking prevalence is to continue to decline as forecast by the reference scenario. In addition, substantial smoking-attributable burden can be avoided by accelerating the pace of smoking elimination. Implementation of new tobacco control policies are crucial in avoiding additional smoking-attributable burden in the coming decades and to ensure that the gains won over the past three decades are not lost.

        "abstract": "Evidence-based decision-making is essential to improve public health benefits and resources, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but the mechanisms of its implementation remain less straightforward. The availability of high-quality, reliable, and sufficient data in LMICs can be challenging due to issues such as a lack of human resource capacity and weak digital infrastructure, among others. Health information systems (HISs) have been critical for aggregating and integrating health-related data from different sources to support evidence-based decision-making. Nutrition information systems (NISs), which are nutrition-focused HISs, collect and report on nutrition-related indicators to improve issues related to malnutrition and food security-and can assist in improving populations' nutritional statuses and the integration of nutrition programming into routine health services. Data visualization tools (DVTs) such as dashboards have been recommended to support evidence-based decision-making, leveraging data from HISs or NISs. The use of such DVTs to support decision-making has largely been unexplored within LMIC contexts. In Bangladesh, the Mukto dashboard was developed to display and visualize nutrition-related performance indicators at the national and subnational levels. However, despite this effort, the current use of nutrition data to guide priorities and decisions remains relatively nascent and underused. The goal of this study is to better understand how Bangladesh's NIS, including the Mukto dashboard, has been used and areas for improvement to facilitate its use for evidence-based decision-making toward ameliorating nutrition-related service delivery and the health status of communities in Bangladesh. Primary data collection was conducted through qualitative semistructured interviews with key policy-level stakeholders (n=24). Key informants were identified through purposive sampling and were asked questions about the experiences and challenges with the NIS and related nutrition dashboards. Main themes such as trust, data usability, personal power, and data use for decision-making emerged from the data. Trust in both data collection and quality was lacking among many stakeholders. Poor data usability stemmed from unstandardized indicators, irregular data collection, and differences between rural and urban data. Insufficient personal power and staff training coupled with infrastructural challenges can negatively affect data at the input stage. While stakeholders understood and expressed the importance of evidence-based decision-making, ultimately, they noted that the data were not being used to their maximum potential. Leveraging DVTs can improve the use of data for evidence-based decision-making, but decision makers must trust that the data are believable, credible, timely, and responsive. The results support the significance of a tailored data ecosystem, which has not reached its full potential in Bangladesh. Recommendations to reach this potential include ensuring a clear intended user base and accountable stakeholders are present. Systems should also have the capacity to ensure data credibility and support ongoing personal power requirements.",

To report the proportion of 3- and 4-year-old children who met the World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep across 33 countries. Pooled analysis of data from 14 cross-sectional studies (July 2008 to September 2022) identified through systematic reviews and personal networks. Thirty-three countries of varying income levels across 6 geographical regions. Each study site needed to have at least 40 children aged 3.0 to 4.9 years with valid accelerometry and parent-/caregiver-reported screen time and sleep duration data. Data were analyzed from October 2022 to February 2023. Time spent in physical activity was assessed by reanalyzing accelerometry data using a harmonized data-processing protocol. Screen time and sleep duration were proxy reported by parents or caregivers. The proportion of children who met the World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity (≥180 min/d of total physical activity and ≥60 min/d of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity), screen time (≤1 h/d), and sleep duration (10-13 h/d) was estimated across countries and by World Bank income group and geographical region using meta-analysis. Of the 7017 children (mean [SD] age, 4.1 [0.5] years; 3585 [51.1%] boys and 3432 [48.9%] girls) in this pooled analysis, 14.3% (95% CI, 9.7-20.7) met the overall guidelines for physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration. There was no clear pattern according to income group: the proportion meeting the guidelines was 16.6% (95% CI, 10.4-25.3) in low- and lower-middle-income countries, 11.9% (95% CI, 5.9-22.5) in upper-middle-income countries, and 14.4% (95% CI, 9.6-21.1) in high-income countries. The region with the highest proportion meeting the guidelines was Africa (23.9%; 95% CI, 11.6-43.0), while the lowest proportion was in North and South America (7.7%; 95% CI, 3.6-15.8). Most 3- and 4-year-old children in this pooled analysis did not meet the current World Health Organization guidelines for physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Priority must be given to understanding factors that influence these behaviors in this age group and to implementing contextually appropriate programs and policies proven to be effective in promoting healthy levels of movement behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

        "abstract": "Informally trained health care providers, such as village doctors in Bangladesh, are crucial in providing health care services to the rural poor in low- and middle-income countries. Despite being one of the primary vendors of antibiotics in rural Bangladesh, village doctors often have limited knowledge about appropriate antibiotic use, leading to varied and potentially inappropriate dispensing and treatment practices. In this study, we aimed to identify, map, and survey village doctors in the Sitakunda subdistrict of Bangladesh to understand their distribution, practice characteristics, clinical behaviours, access to technologies, and use of these technologies for clinical decision-making. Using a 'snowball' sampling method, we identified and mapped 411 village doctors, with 371 agreeing to complete a structured survey. The median distance between a residential household and the closest village doctor practice was 0.37 km, and over half of the practices (51.2%) were within 100 m of the major highway. Village doctors were predominately male (98.7%), with a median age of 39. After completing village doctor training, 39.4% had completed an internship, with a median of 15 years of practice experience. Village doctors reported seeing a median of 84 patients per week, including a median of five paediatric diarrhoea cases per week. They stocked a range of antibiotics, with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole being the most prescribed for diarrhoea. Most had access to phones with an internet connection and used online resources for clinical decision-making and guidance. The findings provide insights into the characteristics and practices of village doctors and point to the potential for internet and phone-based interventions to improve patient care and reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in this health care provider group.",

        "title": "Suicidal behaviors among high school graduates with preexisting mental health problems: A machine learning and GIS-based study.",
        "abstract": "Suicidal behavior among adolescents with mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety, is a critical issue. This study explores the prevalence and predictors of past-year suicidal behaviors among Bangladeshi high school graduates, employing both traditional statistical and machine learning methods. To investigate the prevalence and predictors of past-year suicidal behaviors among high school graduates with mental health disorders, evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting these behaviors, and identify geographical disparities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1,242 high school graduates (54.1% female) in June 2023, collecting data on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health status, sleep patterns, and digital addiction. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, while machine learning and GIS analyses were conducted with Python and ArcMap 10.8, respectively. Among the participants, 29.9% reported suicidal ideation, 15.3% had suicide plans, and 5.4% attempted suicide in the past year. Significant predictors included rural residence, sleep duration, comorbid depression and anxiety, and digital addiction. Machine learning analyses revealed that permanent residence was the most significant predictor of suicidal behavior, while digital addiction had the least impact. Among the models used, the CatBoost model achieved the highest accuracy (69.42% for ideation, 87.05% for planning, and 94.77% for attempts) and demonstrated superior predictive performance. Geographical analysis showed higher rates of suicidal behaviors in specific districts, though overall disparities were not statistically significant. Enhancing mental health services in rural areas, addressing sleep issues, and implementing digital health and community awareness programs are crucial for reducing suicidal behavior. Future longitudinal research is needed to better understand these factors and develop more effective prevention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Small ruminants require vaccines to prevent and manage diseases. Unfortunately, no studies have been conducted in Bangladesh to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of small ruminant farmers (SRF) regarding vaccine use against infectious diseases, affecting the success of vaccination campaigns. The present study aims to assess SRF's KAP regarding vaccines, revealing gaps and barriers to efficient vaccination. Two hundred and twenty-eight SRF in northern Bangladesh were surveyed in a cross-sectional study. Data were collected from random participants through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. KAP levels were categorized as \"good\" or \"poor\" and \"positive\" or \"negative\" using a scoring method with a 60% cutoff. The analysis comprised the utilization of descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression models. Results showed that most participants were female (60.5%), aged 31-40 (34.2%), with secondary education (28.1%), and vaccination training (22.8%). While 75% knew about vaccines, only 37.3% understood their role in preventing infectious diseases, and 63.6% in reducing antibiotic use 68.4% of farmers were aware of negative drawbacks, and 61.8% reported vaccinating their herds. About 42.1% of the farmers had good knowledge, 52.6% had a positive attitude, and 22.8% followed good practices. Female farmers with graduate degrees and 6-10 years of goat farming experience, but not those with vaccination training, demonstrated stronger knowledge. Female farmers with a graduate degree and 6-10 years of goat farming experience displayed positive attitudes. Female goat farmers from Thakurgaon had a higher likelihood of following good vaccination practices than those with vaccination training. The study unearths disparities in KAP scores among farmers. To effectively address KAP gaps concerning vaccine usage and prevent potential infectious diseases, it is essential to design focused educational and training programs. About 52.6% of SRF hold a positive view toward vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Objective The health-seeking behavior (HSB) of patients during an outbreak is crucial in mitigating the spread of disease. Poor HSB can increase mortality and make contact tracing more difficult. In this study, we aimed to examine the status of HSB among Bangladeshi educated individuals during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic when infection was spreading quickly, and social distancing measures were tightened across the country. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey online among Bangladeshi individuals using a virtual snowball sampling method to capture suspected COVID-19 patients who did not undergo COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed with statistical significance defined as p<0.05. Results The study consisted of 390 participants with 44.9% having a bachelor's degree, followed by 25.9% with a master's or PhD degree. Commonly reported symptoms among the participants included fever (77.7%), cough (50.5%), headache (46.2%), body pain (36.4%), sore throat (35.6%), anosmia (31.3%), anorexia (13.8%), diarrhea (11.4%), and dyspnea (11.3%). The most common reasons for not taking the COVID-19 test were limited testing facilities (48%), the risk of infection from the test center (46%), fear of social stigma (19%), considering COVID-19 infection as innocuous (18%), and fear of forced quarantine (5%). In regression analysis, participants who lived in rural areas were found to be 2.5 times more likely to buy medications from nearby pharmacies. Males were more likely to self-medicate, with male participants being 3.2 times more likely than female participants to consider COVID-19 infection as harmless (AOR: 3.2, CI: 1.28-7.98). Smokers were more likely to seek help from government hotlines and to use drugs at home. Respondents with higher monthly income were less likely to fear forced quarantine (AOR: 0.27, CI: 0.4-2.02) but more likely to consider the risk of infection at the test center (AOR: 1.75, CI: 0.88-3.49). Conclusion Our study highlights that non-compliance with public health guidelines by educated people during an epidemic indicates a general lack of health literacy and distrust in the healthcare system. Along with improved infrastructure, efforts to enhance public health risk communication and health literacy are necessary to rebuild public trust in the healthcare service.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Salinity intrusion is the most common global concern along coastlines, but it can happen inland also. The lack of freshwater is the primary issue affecting the coastal areas. Many health problems are prevalent among the inhabitants due to their frequent use of salted water. The health of women living along the coastline is getting progressively compromised due to salinity intrusion. Objectives The study aims to determine menstrual health practices and other health problems faced by women in the coastal region of Bangladesh. Methods The study was conducted using a survey research design from May 2023 to October 2023 on rural women aged 18 to 45 years, who lived in the Bangladeshi village of Koyra Upazila in the Khulna district. The sample size of the study was 101. Open- and closed-ended questions from a planned interview schedule were used to gather primary data. Additional information from appropriate sources, e.g., newspapers, publications, and books, was utilized to enhance the comprehensiveness of statistical analysis and support rationality. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Results Menstrual hygiene practices showed a higher prevalence of using fabric rags and reusing them after rinsing them in salt water (72.3%) than sanitary pads (25.7%). It was observed that the risk of diarrhea among tubewell water and rainwater users was significantly lowered by 0.25 times (95% CI = 0.06, 0.99; p = 0.049) and 0.06 times (95% CI = 0.01, 0.43; p = 0.005), respectively, compared to pond water users. Conclusion Salinity has a significant impact on the livelihoods and health of coastal women. The village women are unaware of the health risks of excessive saline water use. Establishing an adequate supply of freshwater reservoirs for the entire community throughout the year is an alternative for women to use as a source of water for hygiene necessities.",

We assessed the association between selected factors and the readiness index using multinomial logistic regression. We identified a significant gap in the availability and quality of ANC services, only 4.26% of health facilities provide quality ANC services, with rural facilities showing lower readiness compared to urban facilities (RRR:0.13; 95% CI: 0.06-0.31; p < 0.001). Community clinics and private hospitals have a lower likelihood of medium or high readiness compared to public hospitals or clinics. Health facilities with specialized care are more likely to demonstrate readiness for quality ANC services. Policy recommendations include increased healthcare funding, implementation of ANC guidelines, strengthened monitoring and evaluation of health facilities, and heightened community awareness. These measures should improve ANC, overall health outcomes, and public health policies.",

        "abstract": "Short inter-pregnancy or birth interval is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, some emerging evidence questions this association and there are also inconsistencies among the existing findings. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence regarding the effect of short inter-pregnancy or birth intervals on adverse perinatal outcomes in the Asia-Pacific region. A comprehensive search of five databases was conducted targeting studies published between 2000 to 2023. Studies that reported on short inter-pregnancy or birth interval and examined adverse perinatal outcomes, such as low birthweight (LBW) preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal mortality were included and appraised for methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Three reviewers independently screened the studies and performed data extraction. Narrative synthesis and meta-analyses were conducted to summarise the key findings. A total of 41 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. A short-interpregnancy interval was associated with an increased risk of low birthweight (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65; 95%CI:1.39, 1.95), preterm birth (OR = 1.50; 95%CI: 1.35, 1.66), and small for gestational age (OR = 1.24; 95%CI:1.09, 1.41). We also found elevated odds of early neonatal mortality (OR = 1.91; 95%CI: 1.11, 3.29) and neonatal mortality (OR = 1.78; 95%CI: 1.25, 2.55) among women with short birth intervals. This review indicates that both short inter-pregnancy and birth interval increased the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. This underscores the importance of advocating for and implementing strategies to promote optimal pregnancy and birth spacing to reduce the occurrence of adverse perinatal outcomes. Reproductive health policies and programs need to be further strengthened and promote access to comprehensive family planning services and increase awareness about the importance of optimal pregnancy and birth spacing.",

        "abstract": "Maternal health, in terms of pregnancy and childbirth, is an important aspect of women's reproductive health and remains a public health concern in underdeveloped countries of the world. Reproductive health care seeking behavior (RHSB), in both men and women in society, is influenced by a variety of social and environmental factors that needs to be summarized. This review aims to enhance understanding and perception of services in relation to RHSBs in several domains such as antenatal care (ANC), delivery care, postnatal care (PNC), and family planning (FP) services, for married women of reproductive age in Bangladesh. In major databases, for example, Medline, Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest and Google Scholar following keywords, timeline set as 2010 up to December 30, 2022. Articles that included discussion on married women of reproductive age, and their type of care seeking behavior for reproductive health. A systematic literature search was carried out and expected outcome was health care seeking behavior in the aspects of ANC, delivery care, PNC, and FP services. A data extraction form and quality appraisal form were used for data on RHSB of married women of the reproductive age group in Bangladesh and associated factors. A total of 245 articles were retrieved from databases; stepwise screening was done and finally 23 full-text articles were included for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used based on the included articles for narrative synthesis. In the selected articles, 17 (73.91%) were cross-sectional studies and more than half discussed both urban and rural women. Ante- and postnatal visits have proven to have positively influenced overall RHSB, as seen in Bangladesh. Grass root level workers play a major role in upgrading RHSB in women. Many factors limit rural access to mother and child health services including distance of the health facility and cost of the health service. In particular, education level, women's autonomy in family decision making and distance from health service can be considered as factors influencing RHSBs in Bangladesh. Exposure to mass media and TV watching are likely to positively impact RHSB patterns for women in Bangladesh.",

To compare hypertension outcomes in clinics implementing HEARTS versus clinics continuing usual hypertension care in rural Bangladesh. A matched-pair cluster quasi-experimental trial in Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs; primary healthcare facilities) was conducted in rural Bangladesh. A total of 3935 patients (mean age 52.3 years, 70.5% female) with uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure (BP) ≥140/90 mm Hg regardless of treatment history) were enrolled: 1950 patients from 7 HEARTS UHCs and 1985 patients from 7 matched usual care UHCs. The primary outcome was systolic BP at 6 months measured at the patient's home; secondary outcomes were diastolic BP, hypertension control rate (<140/90 mm Hg) and loss to follow-up. Multivariable mixed-effects linear and Poisson models were conducted. Baseline mean systolic BP was 158.4 mm Hg in the intervention group and 158.8 mm Hg in the usual care group. At 6 months, 95.5% of participants completed follow-up. Compared with usual care, the intervention significantly lowered systolic BP (-23.7 mm Hg vs -20.0 mm Hg; net difference -3.7 mm Hg (95% CI -5.1 to -2.2)) and diastolic BP (-10.2 mm Hg vs -8.3 mm Hg; net difference -1.9 mm Hg (95% CI -2.7 to -1.1)) and improved hypertension control (62.0% vs 49.7%, net difference 12.3% (95% CI 9.0 to 16.8)).

In LMICs, an estimated half of all newborns are born at home and few receive screening or treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, leading to 6 million newborns per year who need phototherapy treatment for hyperbilirubinemia but are untreated. Household screening and treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy administered by a trained community health worker (CHW) may increase indicated treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in comparison to the existing care system in Bangladesh. 530 Bangladeshi women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy from the rural community of Sakhipur, Bangladesh will be recruited for a cluster randomized trial and randomized to the intervention arm - home screening and treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - or the comparison arm to receive usual care. In the intervention arm, CHWs will provide mothers with two prenatal visits, visit newborns by 2 days of age and then daily for 3 days to measure transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and monitor for clinical danger signs. Newborns without danger signs but with a TcB above the treatment threshold, but >15 mg/dL will be treated with light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy at home. Newborns with danger signs or TcB ≥15 mg/dL will be referred to a hospital for treatment. Treatment rates for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in each arm will be compared. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of CHW-led home phototherapy to increase neonatal hyperbilirubinemia treatment rates in rural Bangladesh. LMICs are expanding access to postnatal care by using CHWs, and our work will give CHWs a curative treatment option for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

So, we estimated the consumption of SCFS, SS, and SSB among elderly males and females in Bangladesh. We also reported the factors associated with their consumption using data from a nationwide cross-sectional study. We interviewed 2,482 (51.52%) elderly males and 2,335 (48.47%) elderly females for the recall for the past seven days on the intake of SCFS, SS, and SSB from 82 randomly selected clusters from rural, non-slum urban, and slum areas in Bangladesh.

Both elderly males and females from slum and non-slum urban areas consumed more SSB than their rural counterparts. Higher level of television viewing was associated with increased frequency of intake of SCFS, SS, and SSB among elderly males and SSB intake among elderly females. Nutritional status was not associated with the consumption of these foods and drinks among the elderly; however, overweight males consumed SSB less frequently. In Bangladesh, elderly males and females frequently consume unhealthy snacks and drinks. Considering their detrimental effect on health, it is necessary to reduce their consumption through policy and program measures and promote healthier foods and beverages.",

There has been rising burden of childhood and adolescent obesity in most developing countries in recent years. Changes in dietary habits, junk and fast food, physical inactivity and smoking habits increases among adolescent students, which causes obesity and simultaneously increases risk of metabolic diseases. The objective of the study is to determine the correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and lipid profile among adolescent students of Bangladesh. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted among 79 undergraduate healthy adolescent students, aged 10-18 years who were selected through purposive sampling. The study was conducted from July 2022 to June 2023 in urban and rural areas of Dhaka, Narayanganj and Rangpur. Data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Correlation of dyslipidemia and BMI was analyzed by Pearson Coefficient. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 with level of statistical significance at p<0.05. Mean age of the respondents was 14.9±4.5 years. Male and female ratio was 2.16:1. Among respondents, 46.8% had BMI 18.5-23.0 (normal), 31.6% had BMI 23.1-25.0 (overweight) and 21.5% had BMI >25.0 (obese). Prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 34.1%. Overweight and obese respondents had raised total cholesterol (TC) level 209.51±48.6 mg/dl and 218.36±80.0 mg/dl respectively. Mean high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level was 38.91±10.51 mg/dl in overweight and 36.54±10.04 mg/dl in obese. Mean low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 135.23±44.5 mg/dl in overweight and 143.61±56.0 mg/dl in obese. Among obese cases, 94.1% respondents had borderline triglyceride (TG) with mean 164.46±111.0 mg/dl. Among the study respondents, overweight and obesity (higher BMI) tend to have abnormal lipid profile. It is recommended that assessment of BMI should be incorporated into school health programme and those with overweight and obesity should be subjected to routine lipogram in order to apply timely preventive as well as therapeutic measures to save lives.",

This study presents the qualitative results from the Shonjibon Cash and Counselling Trial baseline process evaluation with the aim of exploring the status of women's decision-making at the trial's outset and to facilitate the exploration of any changes in women's empowerment over the course of the trial. Between January and March 2021, we conducted forty-one in-depth interviews with pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. The research team translated, transcribed, coded, and discussed the interviews. We used thematic analysis to examine women's experience and perceptions on household decision-making. The key findings that emerged; women jointly participated in financial decision-making with their husbands; men made the final decision regarding seeking healthcare, and women solely made choices regarding infant and young child feeding. Our findings revealed that women felt that they needed to discuss their plans to go outside the house with their husbands, many perceived a lack of importance in the community towards women's participation in decision-making. This study documents current contextual information on the status of women's involvement in household decision-making and intrahousehold power dynamics at the start of the Shonjibon Cash and Counselling Trial.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has detrimental effects on physical and mental health. Patients with severe mental illness are at higher risk of contracting the virus due to social determinants of health. Vulnerable populations include the elderly, people with pre-existing conditions, and those exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, only a few countries have updated vaccination strategies to prioritize patients with mental illnesses. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether individuals with mental disorders are prioritized in vaccine allocation strategies in different world regions. They are often neglected in policymaking but are highly vulnerable to the threatening complications of COVID-19. A questionnaire was developed to record details regarding COVID-19 vaccination and prioritizations for groups of persons with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs). <i>NCDs</i> were defined according to the WHO as chronic diseases that are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Most countries surveyed (80%) reported healthcare delivery via a nationalized health service. It was found that 82% of the countries had set up advisory groups, but only 26% included a mental health professional. Most frequently, malignancy (68%) was prioritized followed by diabetes type 2 (62%) and type 1 (59%). Only nine countries (26%) prioritized mental health conditions. The spread of the coronavirus has exposed both the strengths and flaws of our healthcare systems. The most vulnerable groups suffered the most and were hit first and faced most challenges. These findings raise awareness that patients with mental illnesses have been overlooked in immunization campaigns. The range of their mortality, morbidity, and quality of life could have widened due to this delay.",

        "title": "Effective multi-sectoral approach for rapid reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality: the exceptional case of Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Bangladesh experienced impressive reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality over the past several decades with annual rates of decline surpassing 4% since 2000. We comprehensively assessed health system and non-health factors that drove Bangladesh's success in mortality reduction. We operationalised a comprehensive conceptual framework and analysed available household surveys for trends and inequalities in mortality, intervention coverage and quality of care. These include 12 household surveys totalling over 1.3 million births in the 15 years preceding the surveys. Literature and desk reviews permitted a reconstruction of policy and programme development and financing since 1990. These were supplemented with key informant interviews to understand implementation decisions and strategies. Bangladesh prioritised early population policies to manage its rapidly growing population through community-based family planning programmes initiated in mid-1970s. These were followed in the 1990s and 2000s by priority to increase access to health facilities leading to rapid increases in facility delivery, intervention coverage and access to emergency obstetric care, with large contribution from private facilities. A decentralised health system organisation, from communities to the central level, openness to private for-profit sector growth, and efficient financing allocation to maternal and newborn health enabled rapid progress. Other critical levers included poverty reduction, women empowerment, rural development, and culture of data generation and use. However, recent empirical data suggest a slowing down of mortality reductions. Bangladesh demonstrated effective multi-sectoral approach and persistent programming, testing and implementation to achieve rapid gains in maternal and neonatal mortality reduction. The slowing down of recent mortality trends suggests that the country will need to revise its strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. As fertility reached replacement level, further gains in maternal and neonatal mortality will require prioritising universal access to quality facility delivery, and addressing inequalities, including reaching the rural poor.",

        "title": "Decision-making process in seeking antenatal care: A cohort study in a poor urban and a typical rural area in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Decision-making in choosing and using maternal health care among different care-seeking options is a complex process influenced by multilevel factors. Existing evidence on maternal health care-seeking behaviour stems primarily from cross-sectional studies with limited information. Therefore, we designed a cohort study to better understand the decision-making process in antenatal care (ANC) seeking. We conducted this mixed-methods study among pregnant women at <27 weeks of gestation in a poor urban area (n = 1320) and a typical rural area of Bangladesh (n = 1239) whom we followed up till eight weeks after delivery. In view of quantitative methods, we interviewed all enrolled women 5-6 times four weeks apart. For the qualitative approach, we conducted 70 case studies in the urban area and 46 in the rural area by interviewing the participants and their close family members. In the urban area, about one-third of the pregnant women (38.4%) sought ANC at non-governmental organisations, and nearly an equal proportion went to public facilities (36.6%). In both the situations, women preferred facilities with one-stop services at a reasonable cost. In contrast, the lack of readiness in public facilities of the rural area pushed women (77.8%) toward private facilities for ANC. The reputation of the facilities, availability of skilled care providers, diagnostic tests, and ultrasonography services therein were the key influencing factors in the participants' decisions to seek ANC services from specific facilities. The availability of one-stop services was a key factor for participants' choosing of a facility for ANC. For the urban setting, there is a need to establish large public facilities with one-stop service provision in different zones, along with supporting non-governmental organisations in poor areas. For the rural setting, there is an urgent need to strengthen ANC service provision in public facilities at the community- and the sub-district level to redirect women from the private to the public sector to ensure low cost, quality services.",

        "abstract": "This scoping review summarises the findings of research conducted on cancer screening in Bangladesh, including the prevalence, awareness, barriers, and evaluation of screening programmes, by performing a comprehensive search of electronic databases and gray literature. 25 studies that met inclusion criteria were included in the final analysis. Most of the studies were about screening for cervical cancer, were quantitative, were cross-sectional, and were conducted in hospital settings. The main challenges to screening uptake were shyness, fear, a lack of knowledge, and an inadequate understanding of the concept of screening. Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) was found to be a simple and cost-efficient way to detect early-stage cervical cancer. However, breast self-examination (BSE) was reported to be insufficient. Education was found to have a positive impact on cancer screening knowledge and practice, but more needs to be done to improve screening rates, such as the utilisation of media, particularly in rural areas. The results of this scoping review highlight Bangladesh's low cancer screening prevalence and uptake and suggest that targeted awareness campaigns and enhanced access to screening services are required to increase cancer screening uptake and reduce the cancer burden in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Diarrhoea is a global health problem. More than a quarter of diarrhoeal deaths occur among children less than five years. Different literatures analyzed presentation and outcomes of less than five diarrhoeal children. The world has made remarkable progress in reducing child mortality. So, older children are growing in number. Our aim was to identify clinical differentials and variations of pathogens among younger (less than five) and older (five to nine years) diarrhoeal children. Data were extracted from the diarrhoeal disease surveillance system (DDSS) of Dhaka Hospital (urban site) and Matlab Hospital (rural site) of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh for the period of January 2012 to December 2021. Out of 28,781 and 12,499 surveillance patients in Dhaka and Matlab Hospital, 614 (2.13%) and 278 (2.22%) children were five to nine-years of age, respectively. Among under five children, 2456 from Dhaka hospital and 1112 from Matlab hospital were selected randomly for analysis (four times of five to nine years age children, 1:4). Vomiting, abdominal pain, and dehydrating diarrhoea were significantly higher in older children in comparison to children of less than five years age (p-value <0.05) after adjusting study site, gender, antibiotic use before hospitalization, diarrhoeal duration < 24 hours, intake of oral rehydration fluid at home, parental education, WASH practice and history of cough. Vibrio. cholerae, Salmonella, and Shigella were the common fecal pathogen observed among older children compared to under five after adjusting for age, gender and study site. Although percentage of admitted diarrhoeal children with five to nine years is less than under five years children but they presented with critical illness with different diarrhoeal pathogens. These observations may help clinicians to formulate better case management strategies for children of five to nine years that may reduce morbidity.",

        "abstract": "Burn injuries pose a significant public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In Bangladesh, burn injuries are prevalent and often result in severe disability or death. However, knowledge regarding the causes of burn injuries, acute burn management, and barriers to seeking burn care in the riverine areas of northern Bangladesh is limited. We conducted a questionnaire-based study in eight subunits and five selected districts in northern Bangladesh to determine the prevalence, causes, and management of burn injuries in these areas. A total of 210 individuals from different households were interviewed, which represented a population of 1020 persons. Among the respondents, 55% reported that at least one member of their household suffered from a burn injury in the past. The most common causes of burn injuries were open fire (41%) and hot fluids (30%). More than 40% of burns were not rinsed with water directly after sustaining the injury. Additionally, almost 30% of respondents did not seek medical care immediately after the injury, with financial constraints being the most commonly cited reason. We found a low rate of adequate cooling and seeking medical care. The need for basic knowledge on prevention and treatment of burn injuries and improved access to affordable health care services in the region is high.",
