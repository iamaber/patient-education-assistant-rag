        "abstract": "Poultry raised with antibiotic prophylaxis are significant reservoirs of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E). Improper disposal of poultry wastes is common in developing countries, increasing the risk of spreading ESBL-E. Previous studies largely focused on ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> in poultry, overlooking other Enterobacterales and dead birds. Between December 2019 and June 2021, this study investigated 220 fecal samples collected from 55 freshly slaughtered and 55 dead birds in urban live bird markets and rural poultry farms in Bangladesh for detection and enumeration of ESBL-E. Overall 68% (<i>n</i> = 150) samples were positive for ESBL-E, with a significantly higher prevalence in urban live-bird markets (88%, <i>n</i> = 97) than rural poultry farms (48%, <i>n</i> = 53; <i>p</i> < 0.01, OR = 7.25, 95% CI: 3.77-14.71) and slightly higher in dead (<i>n</i> = 81, 74%) than live birds (<i>n</i> = 69, 63%). ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> was most common (66%, <i>n</i> = 146), followed by ESBL-producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (10%, <i>n</i> = 22), <i>Raoultella terrigena</i> (3%, <i>n</i> = 7) and <i>Enterobacter</i> spp. (3% <i>n</i> = 6). The abundance of ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> was significantly higher in urban live-bird markets than rural poultry farms (3.9 vs. 2.0 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g; <i>p</i> < 0.001, Cliff's Delta = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.40-0.65) and in dead than live birds (3.4 vs. 2.2 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g; <i>p</i> < 0.01, Cliff's Delta = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08-0.38). The abundance of ESBL-producing <i>K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter</i>, and <i>R. terrigena</i> (1.6-1.8 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g) showed no significant difference between urban live-bird markets and rural poultry farms or between live and dead birds. A higher proportion of ESBL-E from urban live bird markets were resistant to 10 out of 11 antibiotic classes, compared to those from rural poultry farms (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Further, ESBL-E isolates from dead birds showed higher resistance to aminoglycosides, glycylcyclines, and penicillins+β-lactamase inhibitors than isolates from live birds (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Overall, 65% of isolates were resistant to penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and monobactams, while 2% were carbapenem-resistant. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant <i>E. coli</i> was higher in urban live bird markets (86%, <i>n</i> = 95) than rural poultry farms (45%, <i>n</i> = 49; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Among 181 ESBL-E, <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub> (62%, <i>n</i> = 114) was the most prevalent, followed by <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX - M-group</sub> (17%, <i>n</i> = 32) and <i>bla</i> <sub>SHV</sub> (12%, <i>n</i> = 22). The widespread ESBL-E in poultry underscores the urgent need for improved biosecurity and waste management across the poultry supply chain.",

        "title": "<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> lineage and pangenome diversity vary geographically across Bangladesh over 1 year.",
        "abstract": "Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. It remains a major public health challenge worldwide, and particularly in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak. Defining the pool of diversity over finer time-scales is important because the selective pressures that impact <i>V. cholerae</i>, namely antibiotics and phages, are dynamic on these scales. To study the nationwide diversity of <i>V. cholerae</i>, we long-read sequenced 273 <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> genomes from seven hospitals over 1 year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major <i>V. cholerae</i> lineages were identified: three known lineages, BD-1, BD-2a and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, at which point it had replaced BD-2 as the most common lineage in Bangladesh. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already predominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from northern India. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, yet persisted throughout the sampling period. Genes previously associated with antibiotic resistance in <i>V. cholerae</i> isolated from Bangladesh in the prior decade were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-2019, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Our results highlight the diverse nature of the <i>V. cholerae</i> pangenome and geographic structure within a single outbreak season. This diversity provides the raw material for adaptation to antibiotics, phages and other selective pressures.",

        "abstract": "Pet bird rearing has been increasing over the last decade in Bangladesh. These pet bird species suffer from diverse diseases that are treated with different antimicrobials, contributing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the country. The current study aimed to determine the occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli from cloacal samples of pet birds. This study also explored the phenotypic antimicrobial resistance profile of ESBL-E. coli against a range of antibiotics, followed by molecular identification of selected ESBL genes (TEM, SHV, CTX-M) in isolated bacteria. A total of 150 cloacal swab samples of pet birds were purposively collected from the Chattogram metropolitan area of the country. Identification and confirmation of E. coli were performed following microbiological and molecular techniques. All the confirmed E. coli isolates were further screened using the combination disk method for validation of phenotypic ESBL producers. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed for selected antibiotics using the disk diffusion technique followed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The overall detection rate of E. coli from cloacal swabs was 48.7% [n = 73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 40.4-57], and out of 73 confirmed isolates, 32 (43.83%) were ESBL-E. coli. Surprisingly, all the 32 ESBL isolates were multidrug-resistant. All the ESBL isolates were susceptible to meropenem and resistant to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Molecular identification of the ESBL genes showed that TEM was the most prevalent group of target genes. The data generated in this study are the first of its kind and would be beneficial to veterinary practices, aviculturists and pet bird breeders in Bangladesh. The current research suggests that pet birds are a source of MDR ESBL-E. coli, which may pose a potential threat to public health.",

        "abstract": "The rapid rise in antibiotic resistance is a critical global health issue, and few new classes of antibiotics have been discovered since 1990 compared to the antibiotic's golden era between 1950 and 1970. However, developing new antimicrobial compounds faces many challenges, improvements in cultivation methods, genetic engineering, and advanced technologies are opening new paths for discovering and producing effective antibiotics. This study focuses on the fungal microbiome as a promising source of new antibiotics. We explored historical developments and advanced genetic techniques to reveal the potential of fungi in antibiotic production. Although isolating and scaling up fungal antibiotic production presents challenges, innovative approaches like in situ separation during fermentation can effectively address these issues. Our research highlights the importance of understanding fungal communication and metabolite sharing to enhance antibiotic yields and the connection of cutting-edge technologies in accelerating the discovery and optimization of antibiotic-producing fungi. By focusing on these technical aspects and fostering teamwork across various fields, this study aims to overcome current obstacles, and advance the development of antibiotic production technologies.",

        "abstract": "The mortality rate and economic burden of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens are increasingly higher. This frustrating scenario emphasizes the urgent need for developing new antimicrobial drugs. We have previously addressed this problem by studying the antimicrobial activity of two novel iron-halide complexes, Fe(Hampy)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> (iron tetrachloride) and Fe(Hampy)<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>4</sub> (iron tetrabromide). Both compounds showed bactericidal and antibiofilm activities against bacteria with an antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Herein, we used a proteomic approach to investigate the proteomic profile of bacterial cells previously exposed to both iron-halide complexes. For this study, the <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain, BW25113, was used as a model to facilitate the rapid identification of deregulated proteins. Heat map analysis of the common deregulated proteins highlighted that both complexes caused the downregulation of proteins associated with key metabolic pathways, biofilm formation, cell envelope biogenesis and iron ion binding. In addition, a network study suggested that the most influential proteins of the tetrachloride activity were those involved in the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, iron ion homeostasis and carbon/secondary metabolism. This protein-protein interaction analysis also hinted that the main drivers of the tetrabromide activity were proteins involved in translation, ribosomal biogenesis and cell motility. The above results strongly suggested how the presence of different halide ligands could be used to generate compounds with potentially different molecular mechanisms. Importantly, the findings of this study can also be used as a reference to compare with the protein profile of bacteria exposed to future variants of the iron-halide complexes.",

        "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae has long posed a significant challenge in clinical settings worldwide, particularly due to its carbapenemase production and multidrug-resistant (MDR) characteristics. While extensive genomic studies of K. pneumoniae have been conducted globally, research in Asia, particularly South Asia, remains limited. This study aims to address and compare the genomic characteristics of K. pneumoniae isolates from South Asia and Southeast Asia, including virulence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), plasmids, and mobile genetic elements (MGE) profiles, as well as potential transmission dynamics. A total of 463 K. pneumoniae genomes were included from collected samples and public databases. All genomes underwent comprehensive analysis, including pan-genome profiling, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), annotation of virulence factors, AMR genes, plasmids, and MGEs, as well as SNP distance-based analysis to infer transmission dynamics, using established bioinformatic tools. K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited diverse virulence determinants. Hypervirulent isolates were primarily associated with ST23 and ST86, and commonly harbour aerobactin, salmochelin, and rmpA. The majority of isolates were predicted to be MDR, with those from Southeast Asia showing a higher relative abundance of AMR genes associated with the antibiotic classes examined in this study. Among all isolates, the predominant carbapenemase-associated gene was bla<sub>NDM-1</sub>. Col440I_1 was the most prevalent plasmid replicon, although it did not co-occur with any AMR genes. Association between the IncFII_1_pKP9 plasmid replicon and resistance genes sul-5, bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, and bla<sub>TEM</sub> was found. ISSen9 was the dominant MGE, frequently co-occurring with the plasmid replicons IncFIB(K)_1_Kpn3 and IncFII_1_pKP91. Transmission analysis indicated that the highest isolate similarity occurred within MLST and country. However, clustering based on plasmid replicon profiles revealed that some clusters comprised isolates from multiple countries. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the genomic characteristics and transmission patterns of K. pneumoniae in South and Southeast Asia, contributing to our understanding of its virulence and resistance mechanisms. These findings further suggest that plasmid replicons may play a critical role in shaping transmission dynamics and provide valuable insights to inform future AMR surveillance and control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate healthcare utilization and compliance with the WHO treatment guidelines can significantly reduce diarrhea-related childhood mortality and morbidity, while overuse of antibiotics notably increases antibiotic resistance. We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs. 13%; p < 0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility. Our findings warrant that reducing unnecessary antibiotic consumption requires increasing public awareness and strengthening laws on the sale of over-the-counter antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial disease outbreaks continue to threaten finfish aquaculture in southwestern Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses and heightened food security concerns. To address the absence of robust molecular diagnostics and genetic diversity assessment for bacterial pathogens, a comprehensive five-year study (2018-2023) was conducted to evaluate pathogen prevalence, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance, with the goal of informing region-specific management strategies. A total of 340 fish, representing 17 species from 10 districts, were systematically collected from farms, hatcheries, nurseries, and markets. Specimens underwent phenotypic and biochemical characterization, followed by DNA extraction and quantification under stringent quality control protocols. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) utilizing species-specific primers, including the 16S rRNA housekeeping gene, enabled sensitive detection and quantification of bacterial loads. Statistical analyses included one-way ANOVA to compare mean log10 copy numbers and Ct values across districts, fish species, and tissue types, with post hoc t-tests identifying significant differences. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and cluster analyses were employed to assess genetic similarity and diversity among 75 representative isolates. Regression analysis identified nutrient concentration as a significant predictor of bacterial growth (p = 0.0461), with optimal culture conditions determined at 1-2% nutrients, pH 6.5-7, and temperature 25-37°C. High bacterial loads were detected in gill tissues, with Edwardsiella ictaluri (Ct 19.8 ± 2.1) and Aeromonas hydrophila (Ct 21.4 ± 1.9) being most prevalent, and the highest E. ictaluri load (8.5 ± 0.3 log10 copies) observed in Pangasius hypophthalmus from Bagerhat (p < 0.001). The lowest pathogen prevalence was recorded in Magura district. RAPD analysis demonstrated significant genetic similarity among isolates from Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to Tetracycline but susceptibility to Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin. These findings highlight pronounced spatial variation in pathogen prevalence, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance, emphasizing the critical need for integrated molecular diagnostics, targeted surveillance, and sustainable management practices to protect aquaculture health and productivity in Bangladesh.",

Therefore, this study aimed to isolate and characterize the multidrug-resistant E. coli harboring β-lactam resistance genes from raw Sonali chicken meat samples collected from retail poultry shops across six upazilas of the Narsingdi district in Bangladesh. A total of 390 meat swab samples were collected and analyzed between July and December 2023. E. coli was detected in 68.21% of the isolates, with 7.89% classified as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and 92.11% as non-EPEC. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disc diffusion method revealed complete resistance to ampicillin (100%), with high resistance to erythromycin (87.59%) and third-generation cephalosporins. Furthermore, the lowest resistance was observed for amoxicillin-clavulanate (3.01%). ESBL production was identified in 41.73% of the isolates. On the other hand, non-EPEC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of ESBL production (p < 0.05). Genotypic analysis of β-lactamase genes in ESBL-positive isolates demonstrated that blaTEM (63.06%) and blaCTX-M-2a (60.36%) were the most prevalent. Additionally, co-occurrence of multiple β-lactamase genes was observed in 54.95% of isolates, with blaTEM, blaCTX-M-2a, and blaOXA-1 being the most common combination. Furthermore, resistance genes for AmpC (blaCMY, 27.07%) and metallo-β-lactamase (blaNDM-1, 9.02%) were exclusively detected in non-EPEC isolates. Significant positive correlations were observed among β-lactamase genes, highlighting the complexity of resistance mechanisms.

The intrinsic resistance mechanism of this organism, including the blaCVI gene associated with Carbapenem resistance, necessitates careful antibiotic selection. The literature review highlights successful cases, depending largely on timely intervention.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis, posing a critical challenge to healthcare systems, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs), where multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) threaten patient survival. This study offers a unique, real-world perspective on AMR dynamics by analyzing 96 metagenomic samples from three key sources: oropharyngeal and rectal swabs of deceased ICU patients (both postadmission and antemortem), healthcare workers, and high-touch ICU surfaces. Findings revealed the ICU environment as a major AMR reservoir, with oropharyngeal swabs carrying the highest AMR burden. While healthcare staff facilitated MDRO spread, they were not primary sources. Staff microbiomes' MDRO pattern closely resembled environmental samples. Key AMR species included B. fragilis, E. coli, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, with P. aeruginosa persisting on high-touch surfaces. Tetracycline resistance was the most prevalent, with common resistances comprising 36.1% of all detected AMR markers. Staff microbial community exhibited higher resistance to macrolides, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, and cephamycins. A 10-day survival threshold distinguished early (EM) and late mortality (LM) groups. EM patients exhibited unique AMR species in the oropharynx, suggesting respiratory-driven infections, while LM patients showed greater gut-associated resistance. Higher rectal AMR counts correlated with prolonged survival. Notably, four key MDROs (L. monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis, S. haemolyticus, and S. agalactiae) were enriched in sepsis patients, suggesting early risk markers. Fewer new resistances emerged in rectal than oropharyngeal swabs, likely due to antibiotic selection pressure. Vancomycin and levofloxacin, frequently co-administered, exerted stronger selective pressure in the oropharynx, possibly explaining the high MRSA prevalence in patient and environmental samples.",

        "abstract": "Probiotics, particularly strains from the genera Bacillus, Lactobacillus, and Staphylococcus, play a vital role in gut health, immune modulation, and pathogen inhibition. However, environmental stressors during storage often compromise their long-term viability and probiotic functionality. By examining how lyophilization affects the viability and probiotic functionality of certain strains of Bacillus, Lactobacillus, and Staphylococcus, this study sought to understand how storage conditions and protective agents affect bacterial survival and important probiotic characteristics. The bacterial strains were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of native chickens, cultivated in MRS broth, subjected to freeze-drying with different cryoprotectant formulations, and stored at varying temperatures (4°C, -20°C, and -80°C) for up to 12 months. Survival rates, stress resistance under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions, and probiotic functionality were evaluated over time. The results demonstrated that ultra-low temperature storage (-80°C) combined with a formulation of 5% glucose, 5% sucrose, 7% skim milk powder, and 2% glycine provided optimal protection. This combination effectively reduced oxidative and gastrointestinal stress and preserved key probiotic traits, including adhesion potential, antimicrobial activity, and metabolic stability. Conversely, strains stored without cryoprotectants or at higher temperatures exhibited significant viability loss and functional decline. The study highlights the critical role of optimized cryoprotection in maintaining probiotic efficacy during long-term storage. Our findings reinforce the necessity of selecting appropriate excipients and storage conditions to sustain probiotic efficacy, providing valuable insights for the development of stable, high-quality probiotic formulations. Future research should explore strain-specific responses to lyophilization and alternative preservation strategies to improve probiotic stability and performance.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to human and animal health worldwide. Wild rodents and shrews may serve as bioindicators of environmental health. They may serve as a potential source of the transmission of AMR bacterial infections to humans and domestic animals, despite not directly consuming antibiotics. We conducted a cross-sectional study aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with the AMR patterns in Staphylococcus spp. and Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from rodents and shrews. We trapped and collected throat and rectal/urine swab samples from 200 wild rodents (n = 115) and house shrews (n = 85) across different locations in Chattogram, Bangladesh. The collected samples were then evaluated for the isolation of both bacterial organisms using culturing and biochemical properties. We performed culture sensitivity (CS) tests of the isolates using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method for 14 antimicrobials. The overall prevalence of Staphylococcus spp. was 26.5% (95% CI: 0.20-0.33; n = 53), and E. coli was 56% (95% CI: 0.49-0.63; n = 112) in the sampled rodents and Asian house shrews. Staphylococcus spp. isolates were 100% resistant to oxacillin, oxytetracycline, metronidazole, and cefixime. Again, E. coli isolates were 100% resistant to metronidazole followed by ampicillin and cefixime (98.0%), sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim (97.0%), amoxicillin and doxycycline (96.0%), streptomycin (95.0%). Only gentamycin was sensitive against both bacterial isolates. Statistical modeling revealed a higher risk of resistant bacterial infection in rodents from agricultural interfaces compared to other habitats. Rodents and Asian house shrews with poor body condition were more prone to resistant Staphylococcus spp. infection, while rodents were more susceptible to resistant E. coli infection. Our findings indicate a significant prevalence of AMR Staphylococcus spp. and E. coli in urban rodents and house shrews, suggesting their potential role as reservoirs and disseminators of AMR, hence posing a risk to human and animal health.",

        "abstract": "Microbacterium paraoxydans is known for its potential in bioremediation and biotechnological applications, including promoting plant growth. However, research on this bacterium in Bangladesh has been limited and until now no reported complete genome of M. paraoxydans is available from this country. In this study, we have reported the complete genome of M. paraoxydans BHS25, the first case in Bangladesh, isolated from arsenic-contaminated soil in Bogura. Complete genome analysis revealed that BHS25 was closely related to Microbacterium paraoxydans LTR1 from Russia, which itself showed similarity to a strain found at the International Space Station, reported to be resistant to extreme conditions. BHS25 possessed a genome of 3.49 Mb with a GC content of 70.12%, comprising 3,415 protein-coding genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 5 rRNA genes. It carried various heavy metal resistance genes and gene islands, such as arsC, arsB, and acr3 for arsenic detoxification/transformation, as well as czcD and copB for resistance to cadmium, zinc, cobalt, and copper. The arrangement of the arsenic resistance genes showed similarity to that in other reported Microbacterium strains, although pangenome and ANI analyses indicated considerable genetic diversity within the species. Additionally, the presence of vanY within the vanB cluster suggested potential vancomycin resistance. Metabolic pathway analyses revealed that BHS25 was well adapted, with different carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation capabilities. The unique notable anabolic pathways were streptomycin biosynthesis with 14 associated genes, novobiocin biosynthesis and tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis (8 genes each), as well as monobactam biosynthesis, prodigiosin biosynthesis, and penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, suggesting a potential for production of antimicrobials. Furthermore, it showed an auxin biosynthesis pathway for plant growth, further demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This research identified Microbacterium paraoxydans BHS25 as a promising candidate for bioremediation and sustainable environmental management, offering insights into microbial adaptation to challenging environments and potential solutions for pollution encounters.",

This review investigates the mechanisms of biofilm formation on various plastic materials and elucidates how these interactions contribute to antimicrobial resistance and contamination in food systems. It also evaluates preventive and remedial strategies, including the development of alternative packaging materials, advanced cleaning protocols, and detection techniques for monitoring biofilm-microplastic complexes. Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate contamination risks and enhance food safety and security.

        "abstract": "Farm environments serve as reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), spreading resistance genes. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a nosocomial opportunistic pathogen, often acquires resistance through MGEs. This study examined the prevalence, resistance patterns, and factors associated with MGEs in K. pneumoniae isolates, focusing on environmental and management practices. 48 pooled samples were collected from environmental niches in three major districts of Bangladesh including Dhaka, Barisal, and Sylhet and analyzed using standard microbiological techniques and PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed per CLSI (2020) guidelines, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were identified. Genotypic resistance patterns and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including class 1 integrons and plasmids, were detected via PCR. Fisher's exact test evaluated factors associated with MGEs. Overall, 66.66% tested positive for K. pneumoniae. Regarding resistance patterns, the highest resistance was observed to ertapenem (90.6%) and ampicillin (84%), while complete sensitivity was noted to several antibiotics, including amikacin and tigecycline. Among the tested isolates, 53.12% were identified as MDR. Genotypic analysis revealed that bla<sub>CTX-M</sub>, bla<sub>NDM-5,</sub>bla<sub>Oxa-1</sub> and bla<sub>Oxa-48</sub> were the most prevalent. Additionally, the presence of MGEs including class 1 integron and IncQ type plasmid were significantly associated with factors such as poor sanitation, antibiotic misuse, and high cattle density, highlighting critical areas for intervention. This study revealed that MDR K. pneumoniae circulates in food animals' farm environments in Bangladesh, with environmental factors strongly linked to the presence of MGEs. Farm niches, particularly soil, act as key reservoirs of MGEs and resistance genes. Importantly, these also carry serious implications for human health, as resistance genes may transfer to clinical settings, exacerbating the burden of AMR. Strengthening environmental and agricultural policies through a One Health approach is essential to mitigate the public health threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.",

We aimed to evaluate colonization in communities and hospitals across six LMICs for two clinically-important pathogens: extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). Participants in hospitals and communities provided rectal swabs or stool samples for ESCrE and CRE identification. Isolates recovered from selective agars underwent confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) using Vitek<sup>®</sup> 2, MALDI-TOF, and/or disc diffusion testing. ESCrE and CRE were defined based on established breakpoints of phenotypic resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively, to calculate prevalence of colonization.

This study employs metagenomic sequencing to explore the diversity and abundance of ARGs, VFGs, and MGEs in various environmental samples from these farming systems. A total of 384 ARGs were detected, with tetracycline resistance genes such as tetM and tetX being the most abundant, alongside macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Droppings harbored the highest proportion of ARGs (62.2%), whereas sediment served as a reservoir for multi-metal resistance genes. Virulence factors associated with immune modulation, such as pvdL and tssH, and biofilm formation genes like algC were particularly prevalent in sediment and droppings. Among MGEs, plasmids and transposons like Tn6072 and Tn4001 were the most abundant, playing a critical role in horizontal gene transfer. Bacterial genera including Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Escherichia were strongly associated with MGEs, indicating their role in the dissemination of resistance and virulence traits. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in the abundance of ARGs, VFGs, and MGEs across sample types, with sediment and droppings identified as hotspots for gene exchange.

This study characterizes the genomic features, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) mechanisms, and virulence potential of Bacillus cereus MBC, isolated from hospital wastewater in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and advanced bioinformatics, we analyzed the isolate's taxonomy, phylogenetics, functional annotation, and biosynthetic potential. The genome, spanning 5.6 Mb with a GC content of 34.84%, contained 5,881 protein-coding sequences, including 1,424 hypothetical proteins, and 28 genes associated with AMR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close genetic relationship with Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, sharing virulence factors such as hemolysin BL (HBL), non-hemolytic enterotoxin (NHE), and cytotoxin K (CytK), all contributing to its pathogenicity. The ability to form biofilms further enhances the strain's persistence and resistance in hospital environments. AMR profiling identified genes conferring resistance to beta-lactams (e.g., BcI, BcII, BcIII), tetracyclines (tetB(P)), glycopeptides (vanY), and fosfomycin, highlighting the bacterium's capacity to resist a wide array of antibiotics. Functional annotation revealed metabolic pathways involved in iron acquisition and the biosynthesis of siderophores such as petrobactin and bacillibactin, reinforcing the bacterium's adaptability in nutrient-limited environments. Mobile genetic elements, including prophages, CRISPR-Cas systems, and transposable elements, suggest significant horizontal gene transfer (HGT), enhancing genetic plasticity and resistance spread. Pangenomic analysis, involving 125 B. cereus strains, revealed a high degree of genetic diversity and close relationships with strains from clinical, food, and agricultural environments, emphasizing the overlap between clinical and environmental reservoirs of resistance. The strain's isolation from hospital wastewater underscores the complex interplay between environmental contaminants and bacterial evolution, which fosters MDR traits. Our findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced genomic surveillance and wastewater management strategies to mitigate the spread of MDR B. cereus and AMR genes in hospital environments.",

        "abstract": "Infection control in Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients plays a crucial role in improving the survival of patients with CF. Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns in these patient groups in our country are currently lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this observational study was to evaluate the microbiological cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of pediatric CF patients. A total of 50 respiratory samples were prospectively collected from the patients with CF got admitted in the Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Bangladesh from February 2021 to October 2021. Sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs were processed for culture and microbiological testing. Sample collection and evaluation were performed according to the Good Laboratory Practice guidelines (GLP). Informed written consent was ensured before participation. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v26.0. The median age of the children was 30 months (6-120) months, with a male predominance (66.0% vs. 34.0%). Single and two organisms were isolated in 72.0% (n=36) and 12.0% (n=6) of cases, respectively. During the study period, 36.0% of the patients harbored Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.0% harbored Klebsiella pneumoniae and both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were detected in 16.0% of cases. Levofloxacin was found to be the most active antibiotic agent with 100.0% susceptibility. In contrast, nearly all isolates were resistant to amoxicillin, erythromycin and rifampicin. Levofloxacin is the most effective agent to treat CF patients. Active surveillance of the resistance pattern should always continue to be promoted.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge and belief about antibiotic use are important modifiers of antibiotic-associated health practices and, thereby, its resistance. Rural people's knowledge and belief about antibiotic use and their determinants largely remained unexplored in Bangladesh. Hence, this study was aimed. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2016 to March 2017 in Upazila Health Complex, Matlab South, Chandpur, Bangladesh. Adult (≥18 years) residents of the study area coming for health service were approached and a total of 184 participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a pre-tested structured questionnaire including questions on knowledge and belief regarding antibiotic use. Informed verbal consent was taken before inclusion. The principles laid out by World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki were following during all the procedures of this study. Data analysis was done in STATA© Version 16.0. The average age of the participants was 37.45±13.32 years (SD) with a female predominance (61.4%). Of all, 63.0% knew about antibiotics, and out of them 59.5% self-prescribed the drug. Among participants who knew about antibiotics 63.9% (n=73) had good knowledge and 47.8% had appropriate belief. On multivariable logistic regression, higher education (SSC and above) (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.02 - 21.38) and use of the internet and social media (OR 8.27, 95% CI 1.51-45.33) were found to be significant predictors of good knowledge regarding antibiotic use. Moreover, belief regarding antibiotic use showed a significant positive linear association with knowledge (Spearman's rho=0.4797, p<0.001). The study found that nearly one-third of rural people had poor knowledge and more than half had inappropriate belief about antibiotic use among rural people in Bangladesh.

In this study, we screened 102 raw seafood samples, comprising shrimp (n = 42), sea fish (n = 36), and crabs (n = 24), to detect ESBL-EC. E. coli was isolated and identified through culture-based methods, staining procedures, biochemical assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The AMR properties of E. coli isolates were evaluated using the disc diffusion test, while ESBL-EC was identified phenotypically through the double-disc synergy test and confirmed at the genetic level using PCR. PCR analysis revealed that 42.2% (43/102) of the samples were contaminated with E. coli, with sea fish showing the highest (p < 0.05) prevalence (63.9%, 23/36), followed by crabs (37.5%, 9/24) and shrimp (26.2%, 11/42). All the isolates exhibited phenotypic resistance to ampicillin, followed by ceftazidime (95.3%), ciprofloxacin (55.8%), azithromycin (39.5%), cefotaxime (37.2%), and streptomycin (16.3%). Notably, 69.8% (30/43) of E. coli isolates exhibited phenotypically multidrug resistance. Moreover, 18.6% (8/43) of the isolates showed ESBL-producing characteristics, higher in shrimp than in sea fish and crabs. ESBL-related gene, bla<sub>TEM</sub>, was detected in 75% (6/8), bla<sub>SHV</sub> in 87.5% (7/8), and bla<sub>CTX-M</sub> in 50% (4/8) of the ESBL-EC isolates.

        "abstract": "Candida auris, a medically multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen, has recently emerged as the primary one that poses a global public health threat. Although C. auris was first described in Japan, numerous cases of C. auris infections have been reported globally and clustered in four major clades (I, II, III, and IV). In 2019 and 2024, a potential V clade in Iran and VI clade in Bangladesh were described. Nevertheless, limited pathogenicity data of the fifth clade are available compared to the other clades. This study evaluated the pathogenicity of fluconazole-resistant C. auris clade V and the therapeutic efficacy of amphotericin B in an immunocompromised mouse model, with C. albicans serving as a standard pathogen. The infection's advancement was tracked by evaluating mortality rates, fungal burden, and histopathological alterations. The C. auris clade V strain exhibited the highest fungal load in heart and kidney tissues on days 3, 5, 7, and 10, with the lowest load observed in brain tissue. In contrast, mice infected with the C. albicans strain showed the highest fungal load in the spleen on days 3, 5, and 10 and in the heart on the 7th day post-infection. Conversely, the average survival time for mice infected with C. auris was 14 days with drug treatment, demonstrating that AMB treatment significantly improved the survival rate of mice infected with C. auris clade V. This study highlights the differing pathogenic behaviors of C. auris clade V and C. albicans. Although C. albicans exhibits greater virulence in untreated infections, C. auris clade V remains a serious threat, even at lower colony levels. The improved survival rates in infected mice treated with amphotericin B underscore the importance of effective therapeutic interventions. Further research is essential to enhance our understanding of these pathogens and optimize treatment protocols.",

The rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens complicates disease management, resulting reduced milk yield, increased veterinary expenses, compromised animal welfare and potential risk to public health. This study investigated the prevalence and resistance profiles of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species in raw buffalo milk from SCM cases in Bangladesh. A total of 1,540 quarter milk samples from 385 buffaloes were analyzed, revealing SCM prevalence rates of 67.9% (1046/1540; 95% CI: 65.6-70.3) at the quarter level and 80.8% (311/385; 95% CI: 76.5-84.6) at the animal level. Notable regional variations were observed, with Gowainghat showing the highest prevalence (88.1%; 141/160). This study did not identify any biologically plausible risk factors for the occurrence of SCM in buffalo. The Modified Whiteside Test and California Mastitis Test confirmed SCM, with culture and biochemical tests identifying 789 (51.2%) Staphylococcus spp. and 424 (27.5%) Streptococcus spp. isolates. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis indicated that 72.7% (456/627) of Staphylococcus isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, while the predominant Streptococcus species included Streptococcus uberis (32.3%) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (14.9%). Resistance gene detection revealed a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistant genes (ARGs), particularly aac-3(iv) and tetA, across different buffalo quarters and habitats. Antibiogram profiling demonstrated high susceptibility to tetracycline (80.9; 83.1) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (87.4; 81.9), while significant resistance was noted against ampicillin (88.8; 87.1) and nalidixic acid (68.1; 62.1). MDR was observed in 76.4% (479/627) of Staphylococcus spp. and 67.3% (167/248) of Streptococcus spp. isolates, with 10.37% (65/627) and 10.48% (26/248) classified as possible XDR, respectively. These findings explored high antimicrobial resistance level among Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species in subclinical mastitis, highlighting the need for improved management practices and surveillance to mitigate public health risks posed by contaminated milk.",

        "abstract": "Climate change is exacerbating heatwaves, significantly increasing public health risks, including heightened vulnerability to Vibrio vulnificus infections, especially among older adults. While heat stress alone impairs immune regulation and compromises gut integrity, the combined effects of aging and climate-induced heat stress on infectious severity remain insufficiently explored. Using young (12-week-old) and aged (24-month-old) mouse models, we examined how aging and periodic heat stress synergistically influence susceptibility to Vibrio vulnificus by assessing gut microbiome alterations, immune responses, and antibiotic resistance gene dynamics. Heat stress markedly impaired intestinal barrier function, induced significant microbiome shifts, elevated systemic inflammation, and promoted enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes particularly those conferring tetracycline resistance with effects significantly amplified in aged mice. Upon Vibrio vulnificus infection, aged heat-stressed mice demonstrated elevated inflammatory responses, severe intestinal damage, and pronounced immune dysregulation compared to younger counterparts. Gut depletion and probiotic recolonization models further validated microbiota involvement, showing that Roseburia intestinalis significantly reduced heat stress-exacerbated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunosenescence in aged mice. Collectively, this study provides robust experimental evidence highlighting the critical interplay between aging and climate-driven heat stress in intensifying infectious disease severity via microbiome-immune axis disruptions, underscoring the need for microbiota-targeted strategies in climate-vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming a significant global concern. To combat the spread of resistance or reverse multidrug resistance, developing novel antimicrobials and/or resistance modulators is essential. This study aimed to evaluate the synergistic effects of the methanolic extract of <i>Pandanus fascicularis</i> fruits (MEPFF) in combination with azithromycin against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Phytochemical analysis along with the determination of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of MEPFF, was performed using standard procedure. The extract's DPPH free radical scavenging activity was assessed to evaluate its potential antioxidant activity. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of MEPFF against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> were determined, followed by an analysis of the synergistic effect with azithromycin, as well as the activity of azithromycin alone. Subsequently, the drug-likeness, antibacterial activity, and toxicological properties were analyzed using in silico tools. The quantitative investigation found terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins, phenolics, saponins, cardiac glycosides, and alkaloids in MEPFF. The TFC, TPC, and TAC of MEPFF were found at 183 ± 9.54 mg QE, 248.33 ± 11.06 mg GAE, and 95.33 ± 8.33 mg AAE/gm extract. The extract showed significant antioxidant activity in the DPPH experiment, with an IC50 value of 12.13±0.53 µg/ml. Azithromycin and the extract together have far greater antibacterial action against all four bacterial strains. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is 3.67 ± 1.15 to 5.83 ± 0.76 mg/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is 4.33 ± 1.26 to 7.33 ± 1.04 mg/mL. In silico studies revealed that pandamarilactone-1, nonpandamarilactone-B, and thiamine had the best docking energy (-9.9, -8.9, and -8.5 kcal/mol), suggesting most active compounds against MPh-II protein. The extract enhances antibiotic therapy and suggests that the aforesaid synergistic drug-herb combinations may treat MDR bacterial infections.",

        "abstract": "Over-the-counter antibiotic sales in community-pharmacies significantly drive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to inappropriate use and early treatment discontinuation. In Bangladesh, community pharmacies, which dispense 56.6 % of antibiotics without prescriptions, serve as the first health-seeking touchpoint, yet conventional stewardship strategies often overlook these informal providers, heightening AMR risks. This study examines drug-sellers' understanding and practices towards antibiotic dispensing and compares their symptomatic-treatment practices with Bangladesh's Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) to understand the extent of antibiotic misuse. A cross-sectional survey in two urban and two rural areas of Bangladesh involved 120 drug-sellers from 30 randomly selected pharmacies per site. Knowledge was compared between drug-sellers with pharmacy-dispensing training and those without training, and their suggested treatments for two simulated health-symptoms-upper respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal infections-were evaluated against STGs to determine the extent of misuse. Most drug-sellers were aged 41-50 years (35.0 %), with 39.2 % holding a bachelor's degree or higher, and 65.8 % having pharmacy-dispensing training. The overall knowledge score on antibiotic use and AMR was moderate at 60.2 % (5-7 out of 10), with 32.5 % scoring ≤4, indicating poor knowledge; trained drug-sellers scored significantly better (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Over half (57.5 %) were unaware of antibiotic dispensing policies, though most (75.8 %) acknowledged the link between AMR and antibiotic use. For simulated upper respiratory-tract infections, 54.2 % recommended single antibiotic-90.8 % Watch, 9.2 % Access (per WHO-AWaRe classification)-with 66.2 % of these prescriptions deviating from guidelines due to inappropriate selection or dosage. For gastrointestinal infections, 55.8 % recommended single antibiotic (40.3 % Watch, 59.7 % Access), with 82.1 % deviated from the guidelines. Additionally, 26.7 % recommended two antibiotics (51.6 % Watch, 48.4 % Access), all of which were inconsistent with guideline recommendations. For both simulated symptoms, no significant difference was observed in drug sellers' treatment practices based on their knowledge level. This study highlights the need for context-specific policies and regulatory measures in informal healthcare settings. While improving drug-sellers' knowledge is vital for antimicrobial stewardship in LMICs like Bangladesh, it alone is insufficient due to market competition, weak regulation, and patient-driven demand. Thus, curbing inappropriate antibiotic use at the community level requires stronger enforcement and multifaceted, context-tailored interventions-including public awareness, targeted training, and market-responsive strategies.",

Resistant strains showed mutations in genes associated with resistance to albicidin, specifically tsx and merR-family regulator albA. Heterologous expression of AlbA in E. coli and introducing the L120Q AlbA resistance-mediating modification into the genome of a sensitive K. pneumoniae strain conferred PBD and albicidin resistance. Proteomic analysis of the resistant strains showed elevated AlbA protein levels compared to isogenic wild-type strains. Crystallographic studies with the antibiotic binding domain of AlbA show binding of KMR-14-14 to the same groove shown to bind albicidin. Given the parallels between these two structurally unrelated compound classes, AlbA may offer resistance to further antibiotics and should be considered in future antibiotic discovery.",

This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence genes (VGs) profiles of Pseudomonas asiatica strains isolated from milk, faeces, and farm soils of dairy cows diagnosed with clinical mastitis (CM). Forty-five milk and 35 faeces samples from cows with CM, as well as 30 soil samples were collected from 30 small-holding dairy farms in Gazipur district, Bangladesh. P. asiatica was identified using culture-based methods, VITEK-2, and 16S rRNA sequencing. AMR profile was determined using disc diffusion method. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of four MDR P. asiatica isolates was performed for phylogenetic analysis, ARGs and VGs prediction. The overall prevalence of P. asiatica in the investigated dairy farms in this study was 37.27%, with rates of 29.27% in milk, 34.15% in faeces, and 36.59% in soil. All P. asiatica isolates were MDR, exhibiting highest resistance to imipenem, ampicillin, oxacillin, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, azithromycin, tetracycline, and cefoxitin. WGS revealed close phylogenetic ties between P. asiatica isolates (2M1, 2F1, 2F2, 2S1) and global Pseudomonas strains. Each of the four P. asiatica strains harbored 11 ARGs imparting resistance to multiple antibiotics, and 30 VGs linked to motility, alginate/pyoverdine synthesis, and regulatory systems. This study identifies P. asiatica as an emerging MDR mastitis pathogen with significant environmental persistence. These findings highlight for species-specific diagnostics, and tailored antimicrobial strategies to improve mastitis control in dairy farming systems.",

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired neonatal infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is unknown to what extent home-based births, which account for nearly a third of deliveries in Bangladesh, may also result in exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We enrolled mothers who delivered at home and their newborns from a rural community in Bangladesh during April-June, 2022. Within 2-7 days after delivery, we collected vaginal and rectal swabs from mothers and rectal swabs from the newborns. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic culture media selective for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL-PB) and carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB). Demographic and risk factor data were collected via surveys. Birth attendants who facilitated the deliveries were interviewed regarding infection prevention practices. We performed descriptive analyses to identify potential risk factors associated with colonization. Of the 50 mothers enrolled, the median age was 23 years (range 18 to 26). Thirty-eight (76%) mothers had at least one antenatal care visit. Only one mother reported hospitalization during pregnancy, and 4 reported antibiotic use during pregnancy. Following delivery, 47 (94%) mothers were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 37 (74%) were colonized with CRB. Of the newborns, 36 (72%) were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 27 (54%) were colonized with CRB. No associations were found with any perinatal exposures, though all households reported incomes below the international poverty level. Of the 9 birth attendants were able to be interviewed, 7 (78%) reported performing hand hygiene before delivery, and 8 (89%) reported glove use during the delivery. Attendants reported cleaning equipment shared across deliveries with soap and water and using boiled water for delivery (89%, n=8). Women and newborns in this rural population were frequently colonized with both ESBL-PB and CRB following home deliveries.

        "abstract": "Effective cholera outbreak response requires accurate bedside rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) because access to laboratories is often limited. Formative studies suggest cholera diagnostics have multiple vulnerabilities, including antibiotics and predation by bacteriophage ('phage') specific to <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (<i>Vc</i>). We conducted a prospective nationwide study in Bangladesh among over 2000 patients with diarrhoeal disease to characterize how these vulnerabilities impact RDT performance. Assays included culture, qPCR and mass spectrometry. With the current gold standard of culture or qPCR <i>Vc</i> positivity, we found no effect of phage on RDT performance. When the diagnostic criteria were expanded to include phage, there was a small decrease in RDT sensitivity. In contrast, large increases in sensitivity and specificity were observed among patients with moderate and severe dehydration. Using the expanded definition, the odds of RDT positivity decreased among cholera patients with phage exposure. The effect was most robust among patients with severe dehydration. Antibiotic were detected in over 80% of samples by LC-MS/MS which limited testing for effects on RDTs. Applying these findings, we estimated that restricting RDT use to severe patients with no reported antibiotic exposure increases sensitivity by 50% compared to unrestricted use. If phage were a diagnostic proxy for <i>Vc</i>, we estimate RDT would miss an additional 17% of cholera cases. Cholera RDTs have critical limitations that require consideration in global deployments. Inclusion of phage detection in diagnostic criteria may improve case detection which requires further study. The impact of these findings likely extends to other diseases where diagnostics share similar vulnerabilities.",

        "abstract": "This pioneering study in Bangladesh combines phenotypic and genotypic approaches to characterize antibiotic-resistant bacteria in dairy farm wastewater, addressing a critical gap in regional antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research. Dairy farming is integral to global food production, yet the wastewater generated by these operations is a significant source of environmental and public health concerns, particularly in the context of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to isolate and identify antibiotic-resistant bacteria from dairy farm wastewater and evaluate their antibiogram profiles to inform effective management strategies. A total of 60 wastewater samples were collected and subjected to conventional bacterial characterization, followed by molecular detection via PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The study identified <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (35%), <i>Escherichia coli</i> (30%), <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> (16.67%), and <i>Acinetobacter junii</i> (8.33%) as the predominant bacterial species. Sequencing results demonstrated high compatibility with reference sequences, confirming the identities of the isolates. Antibiogram analysis revealed significant resistance patterns: <i>P. aeruginosa</i> exhibited the highest resistance to penicillin (85.71%) and amoxicillin (76.19%), while demonstrating greater sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole<i>. E. coli</i> showed notable resistance to penicillin (88.89%), amoxicillin, and ceftriaxone, while <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>A. junii</i> also demonstrated high levels of resistance to multiple antibiotics. Notably, a substantial proportion of the isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), with MAR indices ranging from 0.37 to 0.75. Moreover, several antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including <i>penA</i>, <i>bla</i> <sub><i>TEM</i></sub> , <i>bla</i> <sub><i>CTX</i>-<i>M</i></sub> , <i>tetA</i>, <i>tetB</i>, <i>tetC</i>, and <i>ermB</i> were detected across the bacterial species, with high prevalence rates in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>A. junii</i>, suggesting the potential for horizontal gene transfer and further spread of resistance.

Among the diverse array of gut bacteria, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila,</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. have emerged as promising candidates for their putative probiotic properties. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative <i>in silico</i> analysis of the genomes of <i>A. muciniphila</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> to decipher their probiotic potential. Utilizing a range of bioinformatics tools, we evaluated various genomic attributes, including functional gene content, metabolic pathways, antimicrobial peptide production, adhesion factors, and stress response elements. These findings revealed distinctive genomic signatures between the two genera. <i>A. muciniphila</i> genomes exhibited a high prevalence of mucin-degrading enzymes, suggesting a specialized adaptation for mucin utilization in the gut environment. Additionally, the presence of specific pathways for short-chain fatty acid production highlighted its potential impact on host health. <i>Lactobacillus</i> genomes, on the other hand, demonstrated a diverse repertoire of functional genes associated with probiotic attributes, including the production of antimicrobial peptides and adhesion factors, indicating potential for host-microbe interactions and immune modulation. Furthermore, this analysis unveiled the genetic basis of stress tolerance in both genera, revealing conserved mechanisms for surviving the dynamic conditions of the gut ecosystem. This study also shed light on the distribution of antibiotic-resistance genes, allowing us to assess safety concerns associated with their potential use as probiotics. Overall, this comparative <i>in silico</i> exploration provides valuable insights into the genomic foundation of <i>A. muciniphila</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> probiotic potential. These findings contribute to the understanding of their respective roles within the gut microbiota and offer a foundation for further experimental investigations.

Among the various risk factors, climate change, increased animal-human contact, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance are some risk factors that may lead to a pandemic because they help in the transmission of zoonotic infections. Here, we have discussed some potential pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that are capable of causing disease X. Finally, we have indicated some necessary measures required for the prevention and management of any future global pandemic. Disease X has already posed a substantial threat to the global health system, warranting urgent attention and action.

Our objective was to understand whether cow cohabitation in homes with soil floors in rural Bangladesh contributed to the presence and diversity of potential pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the home. In 10 randomly selected households in rural Sirajganj District, we sampled floor soil and cow dung, which is commonly used as sealant in soil floors. We extracted DNA and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing to explore potential pathogens and ARGs in each sample type. We detected 7 potential pathogens in soil only, 38 pathogens in cow dung only, and 182 pathogens in both soil and cow dung. Cow dung exhibited modestly higher potential pathogen genus richness compared to soil floors (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <i>P</i> = 0.002). Using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, potential pathogen species community composition differed between floors and cow dung (permutational multivariate analysis of variance, <i>P</i> < 0.001). All soil floor and cow dung samples contained ARGs; detected ARGs confer resistance to antibiotic classes including sulfonamides, rifamycin, aminoglycosides, lincosamides, and tetracycline. Paired floor and cow dung samples shared ARGs against rifamycin and glycopeptides, but otherwise, there was little overlap in resistomes between sample types. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on household soil and domestic animals as potentially important contributors to disease transmission and as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance in low-income country settings.IMPORTANCEIn low-income countries, inadequate housing materials and animal cohabitation can lead to fecal contamination of rural homes. Contaminated soil floors are difficult to clean and may harbor organisms causing illness and antibiotic resistance, especially in young children, who frequently ingest soil. We sequenced soil floor and cow dung samples from households in Sirajganj district, Bangladesh, and identified potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes. We detected 182 potential pathogens in both soil and cow dung; organisms present in both sample types at the highest relative abundances were <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in all samples. In cow dung, the most common genes conferred resistance to the antibiotics lincosamide, rifamycin, cephamycin, tetracycline, and multiple antibiotics. In soil floors, the most common genes conferred resistance to rifamycin, sulfonamides, and multiple antibiotics. Household soil and cow dung may be important reservoirs of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in low-income country settings with high levels of animal cohabitation compared to settings with finished household floors and minimal animal cohabitation.",

This study investigated microbial diversity, antibiotic resistance pathways, and functional potential across various components of poultry ecosystems-cloacal swabs, droppings, feed, hand swabs, soil, and water-in different districts of Bangladesh. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we identified 2,745 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and analyzed microbial richness, community structure, and functional pathways. Alpha diversity metrics revealed that droppings exhibited the highest microbial richness (726 OTUs in Noakhali), while feed samples showed the lowest diversity (211 OTUs). Beta diversity analysis indicated significant differences in microbial composition across sample sources, with PERMANOVA confirming that sample origin accounted for 51.45% of the variability (p < 0.001). Proteobacteria dominated the microbial communities (48.36%), followed by Firmicutes (19.83%) and Cyanobacteria (12.02%). Key genera of concern, such as Enterobacter (26.62% in hand swabs), Acinetobacter (30.87% in cloacal swabs), and Shigella (22.89% in cloacal swabs), were identified, highlighting potential contamination and zoonotic risks. Conversely, beneficial genera like Lactobacillus (36.89% in feed) and Enterococcus (10.78% in droppings) were prevalent, suggesting roles in gut health and nutrient cycling. Functional pathway analysis (KEGG) revealed that carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were highly active in droppings and feed, reflecting nutrient utilization. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathways, such as 23S rRNA-methyltransferase and multidrug efflux pumps, were widespread, with pathogenic genera (Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Shigella, Pseudomonas) showing strong positive correlations with AMR pathways. These findings underscore the influence of environmental factors on microbial diversity and functional potential in poultry farming.

However, they are being led into protracted illness due to poor knowledge and excessive usage of antibiotics. Students risk serious health issues by taking unnecessary antibiotics to recuperate quickly, which increases the nation's health burden. The study stresses the need for stricter restrictions and limiting antibiotic availability and intervention in educational, community and policy settings.",

        "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii, a gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with nosocomial infections, has been relatively unexplored in the environmental context. The present study was conducted in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, with the primary objective of isolating and characterizing A. baumannii in environmental water sources. Surface water samples were collected from various water reservoirs to detect the presence of A. baumannii. Isolates were confirmed as A. baumannii using culture and PCR. Confirmed isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility, antimicrobial resistance genes, and serum resistance. Results revealed that 32% of the water samples tested positive for A. baumannii. In total, 23 A. baumannii isolates were obtained. All isolates showed resistance to Cefepime. Varying degrees of resistance to other antibiotics were observed, and 56% showed resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum. This study underscored the remarkable adaptability of A. baumannii and its ability to flourish in diverse environmental conditions, highlighting public health concerns of increasing antibiotic resistant bacteria. The study concluded that, given the significance of effective infection control and sanitation and waste management measures, understanding the presence and behavior of A. baumannii in the environment is paramount. This study acts as the first report on environmental A. baumannii in Bangladesh and further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and their implications for human health.",

This study investigates the antibacterial properties of methanolic Punica granatum (pomegranate) leaf extract (MPGL) against MDR E. coli and explores its potential as a source of natural inhibitors for the CTX-M-9 beta-lactamase enzyme, a key contributor to antibiotic resistance. The disc diffusion assay revealed that MPGL exhibited significant antibacterial activity, with the highest inhibition zone of 16.67 ± 0.29 mm at 100 µg/disc. Additionally, an in silico approach was employed to identify potential inhibitors from P. granatum phytochemicals. Molecular docking studies demonstrated strong binding affinities of Epicatechin, Kaempferol, and Apigenin to the CTX-M-9 beta-lactamase protein (PDB ID: 1YLY), with binding energies of -6.25, -5.23, and - 5.21 kcal/mol, respectively. These compounds also showed favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in ADMET analysis, indicating their potential as safe and effective therapeutic agents. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed the stability of these compounds in complex with the target protein over a 100 ns trajectory, with Epicatechin showing the most stable interactions. The study highlights the promising antibacterial activity of P. granatum leaf extract and identifies Epicatechin, Kaempferol, and Apigenin as potential lead compounds for developing novel therapies against MDR E. coli. These findings underscore the potential of plant-based compounds in combating antibiotic resistance and provide a foundation for further research into phytopharmaceuticals as alternative treatments for bacterial infections.",

Dairy cattle and farm environments are considered important sources of Enterococcus spp. Here, we detected biofilm-forming Enterococcus faecalis circulating in dairy cattle and farm environments, followed by the detection of their virulence genes, antibiogram phenotype analysis, and genotype characterization. Isolates were cultured and identified by PCR. Ability to biofilm formation was assessed using the Congo red agar test., followed by a disk diffusion test for antibiogram and PCR for virulence and resistance genes detection. Among 150 samples collected from 12 farms, 145 were culture-positive for Enterococci. Among these, 74 were PCR screened, of which 54.05% (40/74, CI 95%: 42.78-64.93) were E. faecalis. About 50% of E. faecalis isolates were strong biofilm formers, 37.5% were intermediate, and 12.5% were weak biofilm formers. In the antibiogram study, 87.5% of isolates were resistant to rifampicin, 75% to erythromycin, 67.5% to vancomycin, and 62.5% to ampicillin. Of the positive isolations of E. faecalis, 80% were positive for the vanA gene, and 50% were positive for the blaTEM resistance gene. Surprisingly, about 70% (28/40) of isolates showed a multidrug resistance phenotype. The Highest levels of multidrug-resistant E. faecalis were present in manure (87.5%) and isolates from Ullapara, Sirajganj. In PCR, 83.33%, 87.50%, 92.67%, 75%, 87.50%, and 58.33% isolates were positive for virulence genes agg, ace, pil, fsrA, fsrB, and gelE. This study marks the first investigation in Bangladesh focused on the molecular identification of biofilm-forming, multidrug-resistant strains of E. faecalis from dairy cattle and farm environments. We recommend implementing a One Health approach with the adoption of effective biosecurity and good farm management to monitor this multi-drug-resistant (MDR) E. faecalis in dairy cattle and farm environments, aiming to effectively tackle the critical challenge of antimicrobial resistance.",

In this study, BiFe<sub>0.5</sub>Cr<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (BFCO) nanoparticles were synthesized <i>via</i> the sol-gel method and investigated as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst for ciprofloxacin (CIP) and levofloxacin (LFX) degradation under solar irradiation. The structural analysis confirmed a single-phase perovskite structure with Cr<sup>3+</sup> incorporation, enhancing charge separation and visible-light absorption. The presence of oxygen vacancies, identified through XPS and Raman spectroscopy, played a crucial role in charge transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Comprehensive electrochemical and photoelectrochemical analyses, including CV, LSV, and EIS, confirmed enhanced charge transport and reduced interfacial resistance under illumination. BFCO, with a bandgap of 1.87 eV, exhibited efficient solar energy utilization, achieving 70.35% CIP and 94% LFX degradation within 240 minutes, following pseudo-first-order kinetics. The activation energy decreased from 33.61 ± 5.88 to 19.69 ± 3.94 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, confirming enhanced catalytic efficiency. An apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 34.9% for LFX further underscored its superior activity. Scavenger studies identified electron (e<sup>-</sup>) and superoxide (˙O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup>) radicals as key ROS driving antibiotic degradation, while oxygen vacancies improved charge separation and ROS formation. Reusability tests confirmed BFCO's stability across multiple cycles, maintaining its structural, morphological, and optical integrity. The degradation mechanism involves solar-induced electron-hole pair generation, charge transfer to oxygen vacancies, and subsequent redox reactions that break down antibiotics into non-toxic byproducts. The synergistic effects of Cr substitution, oxygen vacancies, and mixed-valence states significantly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency, demonstrating BFCO's potential for large-scale environmental remediation.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine differences in susceptibility of exoU and exoS Pseudomonas aeruginosa to multi-purpose disinfecting solutions (MPDS) and antibiotics and their association with disinfectant resistance genes. A total of 16 exoU and 24 exoS P. aeruginosa keratitis isolates were tested for susceptibility against four multipurpose disinfecting solutions (OPTI-FREE PureMoist, Acuvue RevitaLens, Biotrue, and Renu Advanced Formula) using minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations. Antibiotic susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin was determined by MIC. Whole genome sequences from 27 isolates were utilized to identify disinfectant resistance genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and Geneious Prime respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the disinfectant resistance genes qacE, qacEΔ1, and sugE1. Correlation between disinfectant resistance genes and their SNPs with disinfectant and antibiotic MICs was determined by Spearman's Rho. All MPDS were bactericidal at full strength, but upon dilution OPTI-FREE Puremoist and Renu Advanced Formula were the most active against the exoU and exoS groups correspondingly. ExoU showed significantly higher resistance than exoS (p ≤ 0.04) to levofloxacin (37.5 % vs. 8.3 %), gentamicin (43.8 % vs. 0 %), and tobramycin (37.5 % vs. 0 %). The qacEΔ1 and sugE1 genes along with several SNPs in the resistance genes were more common in the exoU group. SNPs in disinfectant resistance genes correlated with MPDS MICs/MBCs, notably mexQ Arg1036His (R ≥ -0.38, p ≤ 0.04), Gly505Asp (R ≥ 0.40, p ≤ 0.04) and opmD Gly269Ser (R ≥ 0.43, p ≤ 0.03). QacEΔ1 and sugE1 were linked to increased MIC (R ≥ 0.54, p < 0.01) and MBC (R ≥ 0.50, p < 0.01) for Renu Advanced Formula. Also, multiple SNPs and qacEΔ1 and sugE1 showed moderate to large positive associations with antibiotic resistance. ExoU strains had distinct MPDS susceptibility patterns, with higher disinfectant resistance genes prevalence and mutations, contributing to MPDS and antibiotics resistance.",

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from broiler chicken meat samples collected from live bird markets (LBMs) and supermarkets (SMs) in the Chattogram Metropolitan Area (CMA), Bangladesh. A total of 430 samples, comprising 215 liver and 215 muscle samples, were collected between October 2020 and February 2021 from nine LBMs and five SMs. Samples were processed and cultured, and E. coli was isolated and identified through phenotypic and molecular techniques, including PCR targeting the uidA and uspA genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion techniques with seven antibiotics from six distinct antimicrobial classes. The study found an overall prevalence of 56.28% (95% CI: 51.56-60.89) for E. coli. The prevalence in LBMs (58.33%) was higher than in SMs (54.80%), with liver samples showing a slightly higher rate of contamination (63.33% in LBMs, 55.20% in SMs) compared to muscle samples. AMR profiling revealed high resistance rates to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (88.84%), tetracycline (86.78%), and ampicillin (82.23%). Conversely, cephalexin (63.64%) and gentamicin (57.02%) had the highest susceptibility rates. A significant proportion (84.71%) of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR), with some isolates resistant to up to six classes of antimicrobial. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index ranged from 0.14 to 1.00, indicating substantial antimicrobial exposure. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the blaTEM gene in all ampicillin-resistant isolates, while 75.35% of sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates carried the sul2 gene. Correlation analysis revealed a strong association between phenotypic resistance to ampicillin and the presence of the blaTEM gene (r = 1), along with a moderate correlation between sul2 and resistance to sulfamethoxazole (r = 0.5). These findings highlight the widespread presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli in broiler meat, posing a significant public health concern.",

We studied care-seeking behavior and antibiotic use for childhood diarrhea by analyzing data from 8294 diarrheal episodes of 1-59-month-old children visiting a tertiary-care hospital in rural Bangladesh. Overall, 55% of the study children received antibiotics, while only 6% had dysentery. Notably, 77% of the antibiotics were obtained from a local pharmacy without a prescription. Antibiotics alone, without zinc or ORS, were used by more children with dysentery than watery diarrhea (15% vs. 9%; p<0.001). While 85% of the children received ORS, only 7% received zinc and ORS without antibiotics. Children who received antibiotics before seeking care at the hospital had a significantly higher rate of hospitalization than those who did not have antibiotics (20% vs 13%; p<0.001). The factors that influenced the caregivers' decision to seek care from the pharmacy were the desire for early recovery, traditional practices, faith in seeking care at pharmacies, and distance to a healthcare facility.

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is responsible for a large burden of morbidity and mortality in children, potentially compounded by reduced efficacy of many commonly recommended empirical antibiotic regimens to treat infections in children. We used the PRISMA framework to systematically review studies describing AMR in children (0 to 18 years) in Southeast Asia. We analysed bacterial pathogens with a focus on the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) reported in studies published between 2010 and 2023. For each pathogen, non-susceptibility to currently recommended WHO empirical antibiotics was analysed with descriptive statistics. We evaluated AMR profiles for 21 191 bacterial isolates collated across 111 studies incorporating 484 540 children. Most published data (71 studies) arose from India. High levels of non-susceptibility were evident in gram-negative pathogens, with <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. exhibiting particularly high levels of resistance to gentamicin (median: 64%; IQR 38 to 81, n=2097) and third-generation cephalosporins (median 76%; IQR 40 to 92, n=2415). Furthermore, a median of 73% (IQR 50 to 86, n=4405) of <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolates were non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, and 48% (IQR 32 to 64, n=3659) were non-susceptible to gentamicin. Among gram-positive pathogens, the median methicillin resistance to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was 43% (IQR 33 to 60, n=1139). There are very high rates of AMR in pathogens isolated from children with common infectious illnesses in Southeast Asia. However, published data available are of variable quality and are heavily weighted towards South Asian countries (India, Nepal and Bangladesh), limiting the generalisability of these findings and highlighting the need for enhanced clinical surveillance networks to improve the surveillance within this populous and high-burden region.

We used estimates from the literature to establish infection type-specific case fatality rates and an overall case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. The total number of CRGN bacterial infections requiring an active agent could then be calculated by dividing the total number of CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths by the overall case fatality rate. We estimated the treatment gap (ie, the number of individuals with CRGN bacterial infections who were not appropriately treated) by subtracting from the total number of infections the number of individuals who initiated appropriate treatment, which was estimated using 2019 IQVIA sales data for six antibiotics active against CRGN bacteria, corrected to account for IQVIA's partial data coverage for each country and dose-adjusted by age. In 2019, in the eight selected countries, we estimated that there were 1 496 219 CRGN bacterial infections (95% CI 1 365 392-1 627 047) but that only 103 647 treatment courses were procured. The resulting treatment gap (1 392 572 cases [95% CI 1 261 745-1 523 400]) meant that only 6·9% of patients were treated appropriately. The treatment gap persisted even when we used more restrictive assumptions. The most-procured antibiotic was tigecycline (intravenous; 47 531 [45·9%] of 103 647 courses). India procured most of the treatment courses (83 468 [80·5%] courses), with 7·8% of infections treated appropriately (treatment gap 982 848 cases [95% CI 909 291-1 056 405]). The rates of appropriate treatment coverage were highest in Mexico (5634 [5·4%] courses procured; treatment gap 32 141 cases [30 416-33 867]) and Egypt (7572 [7·3%] courses procured; treatment gap 43 258 cases [38 742-47 774]), both with 14·9% of infections treated appropriately. Infections caused by CRGN bacteria are likely to be significantly undertreated in LMICs. To close this treatment gap, improved access to diagnostics and antibiotics, strengthening of health systems, and research to identify gaps in the treatment pathway are needed.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a serious threat to public health, with the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Escherichia coli, raising significant concerns. This study aims to elucidate the drivers of antimicrobial resistance, and the global spread of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (CREC) strains. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to explore genome-level characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted to compare twenty CREC strains from this study, which were isolated from broiler chicken farms in Bangladesh, with a global collection (n = 456) of CREC strains from multiple countries and hosts. The MIC analysis showed over 70% of strains isolated from broiler chickens exhibiting MIC values ≥ 256 mg/L for cefotaxime. Notably, 85% of the studied farms (17/20) tested positive for CREC by the end of the production cycle, with CREC counts increasing from 0.83 ± 1.75 log10 CFU/g feces on day 1 to 5.24 ± 0.72 log10 CFU/g feces by day 28. WGS revealed the presence of multiple resistance genes, including blaCTX-M, which was found in 30% of the strains. Phylogenetic comparison showed that the Bangladeshi strains were closely related to strains from diverse geographical regions and host species. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular epidemiology of CREC. The close phylogenetic relationships between Bangladeshi and global strains demonstrate the widespread presence of cefotaxime-resistant bacteria and emphasize the importance of monitoring AMR in food-producing animals to mitigate the spread of resistant strains.",

        "abstract": "Clinical mastitis (CM) remains a critical challenge in dairy production, exacerbated by the global rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which threatens herd health and productivity. This study pioneers a dual genomic-computational strategy to develop bacteriocin-based therapeutics-a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics-by targeting conserved virulence mechanisms in CM-causing pathogens. We aimed to (i) identify essential core proteins in CM-causing pathogens of dairy cows using the genomic approach; and (ii) assess the efficacy of bacteriocin peptides (BPs) as novel therapeutic agents targeting the selected core proteins for sustainable management of mastitis. Through pan-genomic analysis of 16 clinically relevant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. warneri, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. asiatica, we identified 65 evolutionarily conserved core proteins. Prioritization based on essentiality, virulence, and resistance potential revealed Rho (transcription termination factor) and HupB (nucleoid-associated protein) as high-value therapeutic targets due to their critical roles in bacterial survival and pathogenicity. A computational screen of 70 BPs identified 14 candidates with high binding affinity for both Rho and HupB proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that BP8, a novel dual-action bacteriocin, competitively inhibits Rho-mediated transcription termination and disrupts HupB-DNA interactions, effectively crippling bacterial replication and virulence. BP8 exhibited superior structural stability and binding efficacy compared to other candidates, positioning it as a potent broad-spectrum agent against diverse CM pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. Our study underscores the untapped potential of bacteriocins in veterinary medicine, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate antibiotic overuse and resistance. The computational validation of BP8 provides a foundational framework for developing targeted therapies, with implications for reducing dairy industry losses and improving animal welfare. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to translate these insights into practical therapeutics.",

This narrative review explores the potential of probiotics and plant-based foods as alternative or complementary preventive strategies against UTIs. Fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, and kombucha, contain probiotic strains that can modulate the gut and urogenital microbiota, enhancing resistance to uropathogens. Likewise, plant-based foods, including cranberry, garlic, bearberry, juniper, and nettle, possess bioactive compounds with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and diuretic properties. Laboratory and clinical studies suggest that these natural interventions may reduce the incidence of UTIs by inhibiting pathogen adhesion, modulating immune responses, and promoting urinary tract health. However, despite promising findings, inconsistencies in study methodologies, dosage standardization, and long-term efficacy warrant further investigation. Future research should focus on optimizing probiotic formulations, standardizing plant-based supplement dosages, and assessing potential food-drug interactions to establish evidence-based guidelines for UTI prevention.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, the clinical management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is continuously evolving as a challenge because of resistance to antibiotics. In addition to investigating the nature of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics, this study will investigate the age and gender nature of patients having these resistances. Patients who were prescribed urine culture sensitivity tests as part of their treatment at a tertiary-level hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were included as a sample. Urine culture was done following the guidelines of CLSI, and a sensitivity test was done following the Kirby-Bauer sensitivity method. About 55% of both males and females have been found to be infected with <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and about 15% were infected with <i>Klebsiella</i>. Other pathogens detected are <i>Enterococcus</i> and <i>Candida</i>. Age and gender nature of <i>E. coli</i> indicates that females are more infected below the age of 60 years, while males are more infected above this age. <i>E. coli</i> has exhibited the least resistance to Azithromycin, Netilmicin, and Amikacin. The resistance to Ciprofloxacin shows that females are more resistant until the age of 60 years, and males after that. Multidrug resistance shows an alarming result that about 20% of infected patients are resistant to nine antibiotics. This study clearly indicates that UTI is a continuously evolving problem, and its investigation should remain a continuous process. Because of economic and social practices in Bangladesh, urinary tract infection is a continually evolving disease. The treatment requires relatively updated information about the behavior of the pathogens causing this infection. There is not sufficient information in Bangladesh about the age and gender nature of the infected patients, the infected pathogens, and their antibiotic resistance. Moreover, because of indiscriminate and uncontrolled use of antibiotics within the country, the nature of multidrug resistance of these pathogens is also important for the effective management of these patients.

The focus was on identifying methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) strains that produce enterotoxin (<i>seb</i>), resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (<i>blaTEM</i>), tetracycline (<i>tet</i>A), and vancomycin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i>. A total of 200 egg samples were collected from various retail sources in Mymensingh City Corporation, Bangladesh. Swab samples (<i>n</i> = 100) were collected from eggshells, and another 100 samples were collected from the inner membrane, egg white, and yolk. Samples were enriched in trypticase soy broth and cultured on mannitol salt agar. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was isolated through conventional culture techniques, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction targeting the <i>nuc</i>, and further screened for the <i>mec</i>A, <i>seb</i>, <i>blaTEM</i>, <i>tet</i>A, <i>van</i>A, and <i>van</i>C genes.

The presence of exoU and exoS was determined in 187 MK isolates using PCR. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin were measured. Whole genome sequencing of 39 isolates was used to identify resistance genes via Resfinder. Mutations in key genes, including DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, efflux pumps, and DNA repair systems, were analyzed using Geneious Prime. Functional effects of novel SNPs were predicted using SIFT. Antibiotic resistance was significantly higher in exoU than exoS: 38.2% vs. 20.5% for ciprofloxacin, 29.1% vs. 12.1% for levofloxacin, 40% vs. 23.5% for gentamicin, and 29.1% vs. 14.4% for tobramycin (all p < 0.05). ExoU isolates exclusively had mutations in GyrA (Thr83Ile) and ParC (Ser87Ile), as well as in efflux pump regulators MexZ (Gly89Ser), NalC (Asp79Glu) and MexS (Val73Ala) (p < 0.01). They also more frequently harbored the acquired resistance genes aph(6)-Id (55% vs. 0%) and aph(3'')-Ib (60% vs. 5.3%) and had higher mutation rates in DNA repair genes mutL (70% vs. 15.8%) and mutS (45% vs. 5.3%) (p < 0.01).

        "abstract": "Biopolymers are natural polymers produced by the cells of living organisms such as plants, animals, microbes, etc. As these natural molecules possess antimicrobial activities against pathogens, they can be a suitable candidate for antimicrobials combating drug-resistant microorganisms including food-borne pathogens. Plant-derived biopolymers such as cellulose, starch, pullulans; microbes-derived chitosan, poly-L-lysine; animal-derived collagen, gelatin, spongin, etc. are proven to possess antimicrobial properties. They exert their antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens namely Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, etc. As antimicrobial resistance becomes a global phenomenon and threatens the effective prevention and treatment of infections caused by pathogens, biopolymers could be a promising candidate/substitute for conventional antimicrobials available in markets. Biopolymers can have detrimental effects on microbial cells such as disruption of the cell walls and cell membranes; damage to the DNA caused by strand breakage, unwinding, or cross-linking resulting in impeded DNA transcription and replication; lowering the amount of energy required for metabolic processes by compromising the proton motive force. Biopolymers also interfere with the quorum sensing mechanism and biofilm formation of microbes and modulate the host immune system by downregulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways resulting in the decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, conjugating these biopolymers with other antimicrobial agents could be a promising approach to control multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens. This review provides an overview of the various sources of biopolymers with special reference to their antimicrobial applications, especially against foodborne pathogens, and highlights their antimicrobial mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, exacerbated by the protective mechanisms of biofilms formed by drug-resistant bacteria. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in biofilms serve as a formidable shield, impeding the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Here, we investigated the potential of vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) to disrupt biofilm formation in drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and studied the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of vitamin C on these bacteria. Out of 117 study isolates, primarily identified as Escherichia coli (n = 52), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 19), and Klebsiella spp. (n = 46), 80 isolates exhibited a Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance (MAR) index greater than 0.2, classifying them as multi-drug resistant (MDR) superbugs. Among these, 58 isolates demonstrated moderate to strong biofilm-forming abilities and were selected for further experiments with vitamin C. The effective concentration of vitamin C inhibiting the growth of most E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates (90%) was estimated at 1.25 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml respectively, while for allStaphylococcus spp. isolates, it was 0.325 mg/ml. Vitamin C exhibited a notable anti-biofilm effect against the studied isolates, with biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of 0.625, 1.25, and 0.16 mg/ml for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. isolates respectively. Furthermore, when combined with oxacillin or amoxicillin - drugs that were found ineffective, vitamin C significantly reduced the ability of MDR isolates to form biofilms, rendering them susceptible to the drugs' effects and restoring their efficacy. The expression of the recA gene, an early and quantifiable marker for the onset of the SOS response and biofilm production was downregulated after treatment of E. coli with vitamin C. Relative gene expression analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin-induced recA expression was significantly inhibited when MDR isolates of E. coli were treated with vitamin C at a concentration of 0.625 mg/ml, the BPC of vitamin C. Our findings reveal that vitamin C, alone or in combination with ineffective antibiotics, attenuates biofilm formation and restores the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates to antimicrobial agents. This study underscores the promise of vitamin C as a non-lethal disruptor of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance. Not applicable.",

Here, we report the draft genome of a food-borne Klebsiella aerogenes strain isolated from street food of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The WGS analysis revealed the presence of a number of virulence genes and antibiotic-resistance genes. Using the infection model of the larvae of the silk moth, Bombyx mori, we show that the K. aerogenes strain killed larvae within 72 h of injection into the hemolymph (blood) or midgut. Although the strain showed resistance to ampicillin in vitro among the antibiotics tested, it showed sensitivity to ampicillin in vivo in Bombyx larvae. Direct injection of aqueous extracts of hog plum or Indian gooseberry into the midgut of larvae infected with K. aerogenes increased larval survival rate to ~ 75% after 72 h. These results indicate that Bombyx larvae could be used to carry out in vivo screening of plant extracts with potential therapeutic effects against pathogenic bacteria like K. aerogenes.",

        "abstract": "Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality among children under five, with few effective interventions beyond oral rehydration, antibiotics, and zinc supplementation. This study aimed to identify and evaluate the probiotic and anti-diarrheal potential of Enterococcus faecium WFD-128, isolated from fermented yogurt, through in vitro, in silico, and in vivo approaches. The bacterium showed notable antibacterial activity, with inhibition zones measuring 21 mm and 19 mm against Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei, respectively. Additionally, it exhibited anti-biofilm effectiveness of 82 % and 80 % against these pathogens. It exhibited resistance to Amoxicillin, intermediate sensitivity to Ampicillin and Chloramphenicol, and tolerance to bile salts over 3-48h, and to acidic pH levels ranging from 2 to 8. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 68 volatile compounds, of which [1,1'-Bicyclohexyl]-4-carboxylic acid, 4'-propyl-, 4-fluorophenyl ester (-8.5) and Cholest-4-en-26-oic acid, 3-oxo-, methyl ester (-7.9) showed strong binding affinities to the diarrheal protein T3SS of Shigella sonnei (PDB: 6WRY) in molecular docking studies. These compounds exhibited favorable pharmaceutical properties in ADMET analysis, further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. In vivo experiments with albino mice validated the bacterium's therapeutic potential. Histopathological analysis revealed significant recovery of diarrhea-affected organs, including the kidney, liver, intestine, and spleen, following treatment with E. faecium. This aligns with in vitro and in silico findings, demonstrating the bacterium's therapeutic effectiveness. This study highlights the promise of E. faecium as a probiotic-based treatment against bacteria-induced diarrhea, offering a strong foundation for the development of innovative anti-diarrheal therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "Green synthesis (GS) is a vital method for producing metal nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties. Unlike traditional methods, green synthesis utilizes natural substances, such as plant extracts, microorganisms, <i>etc.</i>, to create nanoparticles. This eco-friendly approach results in non-toxic and biocompatible nanoparticles with superior antimicrobial activity. This paper reviews the prospects of green synthesis of metal nanoparticles of silver (Ag), copper (Cu), gold (Au) and metal oxide nanoparticles of zinc (ZnO), magnesium (MgO), cobalt (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and titanium (TiO<sub>2</sub>) using plant extracts from tissues of leaves, barks, roots, <i>etc.</i>, antibacterial mechanisms of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, and obstacles and factors that need to be considered to overcome the limitations of the green synthesis process. The clean surfaces and minimal chemical residues of these nanoparticles contribute to their effectiveness. Certain metals exhibit enhanced antibacterial properties only in GS methods due to the presence of bioactive compounds from natural reducing agents such as Au and MgO. GS improves TiO<sub>2</sub> antibacterial properties under visible light, while it would be impossible without UV activation. These nanoparticles have important antimicrobial properties for treating microbial infections and combating antibiotic resistance against bacteria, fungi, and viruses by disrupting microbial membranes, generating ROS, and interfering with DNA and protein synthesis. Nanoscale size and large surface area make them critical for developing advanced antimicrobial treatments. They are effective antibacterial agents for treating infections, suitable in water purification systems, and fostering innovation by creating green, economically viable antibacterial materials.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from cases of subclinical mastitis (SCM) in buffaloes. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1540 quarter milk samples collected from 385 buffaloes. Milk samples were screened using the California Mastitis Test and Modified Whiteside Test. Positive samples underwent bacterial culture, biochemical tests, biofilm detection and molecular analysis for pathogen identification and detection of virulence, resistance, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes. The prevalence of SCM was 67.9% (1046/1540) at the quarter level and 80.8% (311/385) at the animal level. E. coli was identified in 9.5% (146/1540) of the samples, while K. pneumoniae was detected in 9.09% (140/1540). Virulence genes, such as stx1 (27.4%), and resistance genes, including aac(3)-iv (77.4%) and tetA (76.7%), exhibited higher prevalence. Additionally, β-lactamase genes, notably bla<sub>TEM</sub> (67.1%), and ESBL genes, such as bla<sub>CTX-M1</sub>, were detected. Biofilm formation was detected in 83.6% (122/146) of E. coli isolates and 75.7% (106/140) of K. pneumoniae isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed significant resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and aminoglycosides. MDR was observed in 31.5% of E. coli and 39.3% of K. pneumoniae isolates, with XDR rates of 8.9% and 12.9%, respectively.

Ciprofloxacin, a widely used antibiotic in poultry farming, promotes growth and disease prevention but raises concerns about antibiotic residues in meat and the development of antibiotic resistance. This study examines the dietary effects of WH and ciprofloxacin on broiler growth rate, feed conversion ratio (FCR), meat quality, and muscle histology. Ninety broilers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group, a WH-supplemented group (2.5% of daily feed), and a ciprofloxacin (Cipro) group (8 mg/kg body weight). Feed consumption and body weight were monitored daily, and after sacrifice, breast muscles were collected for meat quality assessment and histopathological analysis. WH supplementation significantly improved (P < 0.05) body weight gain, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and meat quality in broilers. Compared to control and ciprofloxacin groups, WH-treated broilers exhibited lower cooking and drip loss (P < 0.05), higher water-holding capacity (P < 0.01), and reduced shear force value (P < 0.05), indicating improved texture. Ciprofloxacin treatment resulted in reduced redness (P < 0.001) and increased yellowness (P < 0.01), while lightness remained unchanged across groups. Histological analysis revealed greater perimysium thickness and intermuscular adipose infiltration in WH-treated broilers, suggesting enhanced muscle structure.

        "abstract": "Declared as one of the ten most pressing threats to global health in 2019, the complexity around vaccine acceptance and hesitancy has once again gained great momentum following the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of vaccine acceptance may endanger the mission of improving vaccine uptake globally to tackle pandemics, reduce morbidity and mortality of preventable diseases and to prevent antibiotic resistance worldwide. Countries of the global south, including South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries are especially affected by the dangers of low vaccination uptake and continue to show decreases in coverage in recent years. This paper examines factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy in south Asia and the extent to which they are context and disease specific, guided by a modified version of the WHO SAGE 5 C model by Razai et al. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles by using a comprehensive search strategy. Results from 44 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies were included in the systematic review and appraised for quality, thematically analyzed and mapped onto the 5 C model. findings from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed vaccine hesitancy to be context and vaccine-specific within different settings of the countries. The main factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy can be identified as narrow confidence in vaccines, miscommunication, and lack of knowledge embedded into overarching constraints and contexts. To tackle vaccine hesitancy in SAARC countries, interventions need to be co-created by communities and mutual trust needs to be ensured, for instance through increased equity in knowledge distribution.",

Despite being a diverse species, very little information is available concerning environmental and human-associated aspects of <i>V. cholerae</i> serogroups, other than the two major epidemic-related serogroups O1 and O139. This represents a crucial gap in understanding the spectrum of diversity, ecology, and epidemiology of the species influencing the dynamics of global cholera. In this study, we describe an emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i> displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in coastal Bangladesh where cholera has been endemic for centuries. This outbreak coincides with a rise in cases of cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O1, as well as frequency of isolation of serogroups O47 and O1 from the environment. The <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 isolates proved clonal in nature, and their genome biology revealed distinct features, with respect to multidrug resistance (MDR), serogroup-specific genes, genomic island combinations, and overall phylogenetic properties. Genome comparison confirmed the absence of canonical virulence factors of <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 and O139, namely, cholera toxin (CTX) and toxin-co-regulated pili (TCP), and the presence of putative virulence factors including type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and an MDR pseudo-compound transposon, carrying genes for macrolide resistance and extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Results of the study suggest that <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 could represent an emerging <i>Vibrio</i> pathogen with the potential to spread virulence and antimicrobial resistance traits impacting the management of cholera-like diseases.IMPORTANCEDespite the global insurgence of human diseases caused by Vibrios in recent years, most research focuses only on the O1 serogroup of <i>V. cholerae</i>, leaving a significant gap concerning the environmental and human-associated aspects of other serogroups found in nature. Although other serogroups are often found associated with sporadic diarrhea cases, in 1992-1993, a massive cholera-like diarrhea epidemic was initiated by a \"non-O1\" serogroup, namely, O139 that temporally displaced O1 from endemic cholera in the Bay of Bengal villages of Bangladesh and India, highlighting the potential threat they might pose. This study describes yet another emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i>, displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in a coastal locality in Bangladesh. Findings of the study offer critical insights into the genome biology of <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 and its potential implications for understanding their ecology and epidemiology of cholera-like diseases.",

Furthermore, approximately 70%, 49%, and 30% of <i>S.</i> Enteritidis showed resistance against erythromycin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and ciprofloxacin, respectively. However, <i>S.</i> Enteritidis were sensitive to gentamicin (86.5%), meropenem (64.9%), ciprofloxacin (62.2%), and ceftriaxone (59.5%). The <i>Tet</i>A gene, which causes AMR against tetracycline, was shown to be present in all phenotypically resistant <i>Salmonella</i> species. Multiple antibiotic resistance index (MARI) ranged between 0.3 and 0.8. Overall, multidrug resistant (MDR) <i>Salmonella</i> Enteritidis emerged in the chicken meat along with the presence of a resistance gene that is a threat to human health. Therefore, action must be taken to stop the spread of AMR.",

        "abstract": "Recently bacterial infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria are becoming a threat to the health care system of many countries. Extensively-drug-resistant (XDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae are resistant to almost all classes of antibiotics and only a few are for clinical use. Recent emergence, worldwide dissemination and clinical impact of carbapenemase positive isolates persuade us to characterize the clinical K. pneumoniae isolates. We tested 647 K. pneumoniae that was isolated from different specimens of hospitalized patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Various phenotypic characterization, plasmid profiling and PCR assays followed by sequencing were performed. Round the year, 4.33% (n=28) K. pneumoniae isolates were found as XDR in addition to carbapenem resistant. Among the XDR isolates, 82.0% (n=23) showed Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) phenotype. Only two isolates showed MBL with KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) phenotype. By double disc synergy test, 12 isolates (43.0%) showed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype in addition. Among the isolates, 60.0% (n=17) were blaTEM positive, 82.0% (n=23) were blaSHV positive and 46.0% (n=13) were blaOXA positive determined by multiplex PCR. BlaCTX-M were present in 43.0% (n=12) isolates, which were of type-15 as revealed by sequencing. More than 60.0% (n=17) isolates were positive for blaNDM-1. Multiple genes coexisted in nearly all isolates. None of those were found to carry blaVIM or blaKPC. Twenty-six isolates were found to be strong biofilm former. Among the isolates, 16 harbored multiple plasmids ranging from 19 to 91 KDa; however, correlation between plasmid profile and antibiotic resistance pattern was not evident. Prevalence of carbapenem resistant and ESBL isolates have been previously reported in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study will expand our knowledge about XDR disseminated in Bangladesh and could assist in future therapeutic management.",

        "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli pose significant public health risks, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh. This study aimed to elucidate resistance patterns among UTI isolates and comprehensively investigate the mutational spectrum and its impact on drug-microbe interactions. We collected and identified E. coli isolates from hospitalized UTI patients at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and determined their resistance patterns using the disc diffusion method and broth microdilution. Quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the target genes (gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE) associated with fluoroquinolone resistance were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analyzed through BTSeq™ sequencing for mutations, followed by molecular docking analysis using PyMOL and AutoDock for the protein-quinolone binding affinity (PQBA) study. All isolates (100 %) displayed multidrug resistance, with chloramphenicol (16 % resistant) and colistin (28 % resistant) demonstrating superior efficacy compared to other antibiotics. The isolates resistant to colistin, as determined by disc diffusion testing, exhibited remarkably high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), with one isolate registering an MIC exceeding 512 µg/mL. Alarming resistance rates were observed for five antibiotic classes, except for polymyxins (28 % resistant) and protein synthesis inhibitors (48 % resistant). Fifty-two percent (52 %) of the isolates exhibited resistance to all five tested quinolones. Sequence analysis revealed a novel L88Q mutation in ParC, affecting PQBA and binding conformation. Additionally, three ParC mutations (S80I, E84V, and E84G) and two ParE mutations (S458A and I529L) were identified, which had not been previously reported in Bangladesh. Among these, S80I appeared in all isolates. Double-mutations (S83L+D87N) in GyrA, L88Q and S80I in ParC, and I529L in ParE were identified as key drivers of fluoroquinolone resistance. Our findings underscore the accumulation of significant mutations within QRDRs of UTI isolates, potentially compromising fluoroquinolone efficacy. The emergence of these novel mutations warrants further investigation to impede their dissemination and combat quinolone resistance.",

        "abstract": "Various studies reported the existence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in environmental samples, including hospital wastewater, municipal wastewater, and surface water. In this study, we investigated the impact of untreated municipal wastewater transmitting antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa strains in wastewater networks of Chattogram City, Bangladesh, through antibiotic susceptibility profiles and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the MDR P. aeruginosa bcsir_p4_s20. Forty-two P. aeruginosa isolates were identified from eight locations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), targeting the oprI and oprL genes, and antibiotic susceptibility was determined against 11 antibiotics by the disc diffusion method. Resistant isolates were identified at all locations, with the highest resistance frequency displayed towards meropenem, cefepime, and colistin. The WGS of bcsir_p4_s20 was performed using the NextSeq 2000 platform. Several bioinformatics tools, like FastQC, Trimmomatic, SPAdes, and Prokka, were used for quality evaluation, low-quality read and adapter filtration, de novo assembly, and functional annotation. Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), AMRFinderPlus, and virulence factor database (VFDB) were employed to determine resistance genes and virulence factors. The strain belongs to the O7 serogroup and sequence type ST357. The analysis identified antibiotic resistance genes (blaPDC-11, sul1, and others) that cause resistance through efflux pump and inactivation mechanisms, and virulent genes responsible for adherence (flagella, type IV pili), enzyme (phospholipase C), iron uptake (pyoverdine), secretion system (exoT, exoU), and toxin (toxA) secretion. Therefore, municipal wastewater is a potential reservoir for MDR P. aeruginosa, and establishing wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) at the primary source points before discharging it to the wastewater network is suggested to mitigate the risk of outbreaks.",

This study aimed to isolate and identify drug-resistant bacteria from raw beef samples, obtained from different butcher shops in Khulna city, Bangladesh, as well as, to determine their susceptibility pattern against <i>Ocimum tenuiflorum</i> extracts. Raw beef samples were randomly collected from various butcher shops, followed by the initial isolation of thirty pure bacterial isolates. Later, 16S rRNA gene amplification and analysis identified twelve distinct bacterial species from those isolates. The antimicrobial susceptibility test results revealed ten of the isolates, including <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Aeromonas veronii</i> and <i>Enterobacter hormaechei</i>, to exhibit multidrug resistance pattern. Amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin, and flucloxacillin were found to be ineffective against most isolates. However, the ethanolic extracts of <i>O. tenuiflorum</i> were found effective in inhibiting the growth of eight species at three different concentrations. Subsequent HPLC analysis of <i>O. tenuiflorum</i> reported the presence of five secondary metabolites epicatechin, syringic acid, rutin hydrate, p-coumaric acid, and myricetin as potent contributors to the observed antimicrobial activity. Lastly, <i>in silico</i> binding interaction simulations of the secondary metabolites against five relevant targets predict syringic acid and myricetin to have effective antibacterial properties, primarily mediated by better binding affinity and molecular interactions. Thus, this study identified diverse drug-resistant bacteria in raw beef and provided novel insights into the antibacterial properties of <i>O. tenuiflorum</i> extracts.",

        "abstract": "There are concerns globally with rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AMR is driven by high rates of inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics, particularly Watch antibiotics. To develop future interventions, it is important to document current knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) among key stakeholder groups in LMICs. We undertook a narrative review of published papers among four WHO Regions including African and Asian countries. Relevant papers were sourced from 2018 to 2024 and synthesized by key stakeholder group, country, WHO Region, income level and year. The findings were summarized to identify pertinent future activities for all key stakeholder groups. We sourced 459 papers, with a large number coming from Africa (42.7%). An appreciable number dealt with patients' KAP (33.1%), reflecting their influence on the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics. There was marked consistency of findings among key stakeholder groups across the four WHO Regions, all showing concerns with high rates of prescribing of antibiotics for viral infections despite professed knowledge of antibiotics and AMR. There were similar issues among dispensers. Patients' beliefs regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics for self-limiting infectious diseases were a major challenge, although educational programmes did improve knowledge. The development of the AWaRe (Access, Watch and Reserve) system, including practical prescribing guidance, provides a future opportunity for the standardization of educational inputs. Similar KAP regarding the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics across LMICs and stakeholder groups presents clear opportunities for standardization of educational input and practical training programmes based on the AWaRe system.",

This poses significant challenges that have a negative impact on the sustainability of the One Health approach, hindering its long-term viability and effectiveness in addressing the interconnectedness of global health. Recent studies on livestock animals, specifically ruminants, indicate that culturable ruminal bacteria harbour AMR genes with the potential for HGT. However, these studies have focused predominantly on using the faecobiome as a proxy to the rumen microbiome or using easily isolated and culturable bacteria, overlooking the unculturable population. These unculturable microbial groups could have a profound influence on the rumen resistome and AMR dynamics within livestock ecosystems, potentially holding critical insights for advanced understanding of AMR in One Health. In order to address this gap, this review of current research on the burden of AMR in livestock was undertaken, and it is proposed that combined study of the rumen microbiome and faecobiome, termed the 'rumenofaecobiome', should be performed to enhance understanding of the risks of AMR in ruminant livestock. This review discusses the complexities of the rumen microbiome and the risks of AMR transmission in this microbiome in a One Health context. AMR transmission dynamics and methodologies for assessing the risks of AMR in livestock are summarized, and future considerations for researching the impact of AMR in the rumen microbiome and the implications within the One Health framework are discussed.",

There is a need to review current evidence on antibiotic use, access, and AMR, in primary care across key countries. This narrative review analyzes publications from 2018 to 2024 regarding access, availability, and use of appropriate antibiotics. There were very few studies focussing on a lack of access to antibiotics in primary care. However, there was considerable evidence of high rates of inappropriate antibiotic use, including Watch antibiotics, typically for minor infections, across studied countries exacerbated by patient demand. The high costs of antibiotics in a number of LMICs impact on their use, resulting in short courses and sharing of antibiotics. This can contribute to AMR alongside the use of substandard and falsified antibiotics. Overall, limited implementation of national action plans, insufficient resources, and knowledge gaps affects sustainable development goals to provide routine access to safe, effective, and appropriate antibiotics.

Improving the quality of antibiotic use is a key rationale for the development of the WHO's AWaRe (Access, Watch and Reserve) system. There is a need to review the uptake of the AWaRe system since its launch to guide future practice. A literature search was conducted between 2017, the launch of AWaRe, and 2024. Inclusion criteria were studies that reported on antibiotic use in LMICs using the AWaRe system. Eighty-five studies were included in the review, of which 56.4% focused on antibiotic use trends, with 28.2% reporting on prescribing patterns; 51.7% of the studies included inpatients. Only 14.1% of studies reported meeting the 2024 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) AMR recommended target of at least 70% of human antibiotic use being Access antibiotics, with a concerning trend of overuse of Watch antibiotics (68.2% of studies). Dispensing practices revealed significant dispensing of antibiotics without prescriptions especially in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Watch antibiotics were more available but also more expensive than Access antibiotics. Encouragingly, many LMICs are now reporting antibiotic use via the AWaRe system, including in antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASPs). Wide variation exists in the proportion of AWaRe antibiotics used across LMICs, with overuse of Watch antibiotics.

        "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates is often correlated to poor disease management or prolonged hospitalization. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) <i>Salmonella</i> isolates in clinical samples collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. We investigated 150 clinical samples for the presence of <i>Salmonella</i>. The <i>Salmonella</i> isolates were tested against 12 antibiotics categorizable into three groups based on action mechanism and nine classes based on chemical structure. The susceptibility patterns were analyzed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. The isolates were classified as MDR and extensively drug-resistant based on their resistance patterns against different antibiotics. We used 100 <i>Salmonella</i> isolates for this study. The highest prevalence of resistance was observed against penicillin G (96.0%), cefuroxime (75.0%), and clindamycin (71.0%). The isolates exhibited 33.0% and 43.0% resistance against imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Almost all (98.0%) isolates showed MDR. A quarter of the isolates (23.0%) were resistant to five classes of antibiotics and 18.0% to six classes of antibiotics. Moreover, 20.0% of isolates exhibited extensive drug resistance. Among the cell wall synthesis inhibitors, the highest resistance was observed against penicillin G (31.0%). Resistance rates were in the range 20-30% against protein synthesis inhibitors, clindamycin (29.0%), tetracycline (21.0%), and chloramphenicol (21.0%). Among the <i>Salmonella</i> isolates, 90.0% showed multiple antibiotic resistance index scores of ≥ 0.3, while 65.0% scored ≥ 0.5. The carbapenem group accounted for the maximum sensitivity (62.0%), followed by 60.0% each for gentamicin and norfloxacin. The high prevalence of MDR <i>Salmonella</i> isolates in clinical samples from Bangladesh indicates a serious threat to public health. Our findings emphasize the urgent need to control MDR through promoting responsible use of suitable antibiotics and public awareness of the dangers of antibiotic misuse, increasing testing facilities, and promoting genetic research.",

        "abstract": "Phages, including the viruses that lyse bacterial pathogens, offer unique therapeutic advantages, including their capacity to lyse antibiotic-resistant bacteria and disrupt biofilms without harming the host microbiota. The lack of new effective antibiotics and the growing limitations of existing antibiotics have refocused attention on phage therapy as an option in complex clinical cases such as burn wounds, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia. This review describes clinical cases and preclinical studies in which phage therapy has been effective in both human and veterinary medicine, and in an agricultural context. In addition, critical challenges, such as the narrow host range of bacteriophages, the possibility of bacterial resistance, and regulatory constraints on the widespread use of phage therapy, are addressed. Future directions include optimizing phage therapy through strategies ranging from phage cocktails to broadening phage host range through genetic modification, and using phages as vaccines or biocontrol agents. In the future, if phage can be efficiently delivered, maintained in a stable state, and phage-antibiotic synergy can be achieved, phage therapy will offer much needed treatment options. However, the successful implementation of phage therapy within the current standards of practice will also require the considerable development of regulatory infrastructure and greater public acceptance. In closing, this review highlights the promise of phage therapy as a critical backup or substitute for antibiotics. It proposes a new role as a significant adjunct to, or even replacement for, antibiotics in treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.",

While SA can cause diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening bacteraemia, it can also be carried asymptomatically. Indigenous individuals in the Southwest USA experience high rates of invasive SA disease. As carriage is the most significant risk factor for disease, understanding the dynamics of SA carriage, and in particular co-carriage of multiple strains, is important to develop strategies to prevent transmission in vulnerable communities. Here, we investigated SA co-carriage and intrahost evolution by sampling several colonies from multiple anatomical sites and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 310 SA isolates collected from 60 Indigenous adults participating in a cross-sectional carriage study. We assessed the richness and diversity of SA isolates <i>via</i> differences in multilocus sequence type, core-genome SNPs and genome content. Using WGS data, we identified 95 distinct SA intra-subject lineages (ISLs) among 60 participants; co-carriage was detected in 42% (25/60). Notably, two participants each carried four distinct SA ISLs. Variation in antibiotic resistance determinants among carried strains was identified among 42% (25/60) of participants. Lastly, we found unequal distribution of clonal complex by body site, suggesting that certain lineages may be adapted to specific anatomical sites. Together, these findings suggest that co-carriage may occur more frequently than previously appreciated and further our understanding of SA intrahost diversity during carriage, which has implications for surveillance activities and epidemiological investigations.",

        "title": "Molecular and genomic investigation unveils Pseudomonas putida as an emerging multidrug-resistant pathogen linked to bovine clinical mastitis.",
        "abstract": "Pseudomonas putida is one of the emerging pathogens responsible causing mastitis in lactating animals. This study investigated the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), genetic diversity and virulence factor genes (VFGs) to highlight the pathogenic potentials of P. putida strains isolated from milk, feces and farm soil of dairy cows diagnosed with clinical mastitis (CM). A total of 110 samples were collected and analyzed, revealing an overall prevalence of P. putida in dairy farms at 40.90 %, with specific prevalence rates of 42.22 % in milk, 26.67 % in feces, and 31.11 % in farm soil. In vitro antimicrobial assays demonstrated that 76.0 % P. putida isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR, resistance to ≥ 3 antibiotics), particularly showing high resistance to oxacillin, ampicillin, nalidixic acid, and aztreonam. Conversely, P. putida isolates showed the highest susceptibility against imipenem. The genome analysis of three MDR P. putida strains 11CM-M1 (milk), 11CM-F1 (feces) and 11CM-S1 (farm soil), showed a close evolutionary relationship with different strains of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from bovine mastitis milk and feces samples, human stool, and samples sourced from hospital environment. The assembled genomes of three P. putida strains encoded nine antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), 36 VFGs, and 367 metabolic subsystems, highlighting a complex functional profile and potential for pathogenicity. The detailed analysis of these ARGs and VFGs demonstrated that P. putida strains employ distinct mechanisms of resistance (e.g., efflux pumps), biofilm formation, and virulence factors, including adhesins, secreted toxins, and lipopolysaccharides, which contribute to their pathogenic potential. Given the lack of reports linking P. putida strains to bovine mastitis in Bangladesh, the increasing trend of AMR, along with the presence of significant ARGs and VFGs in the studied strains, underscores the need for more intensive research, including animal model experiment, to better elucidate the pathogenesis and inform treatment decisions for mastitis in dairy animals.",

        "title": "Preliminary survey of biofilm forming, antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli in fishes from land based aquaculture systems and open water bodies in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, present major global public health challenges. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, antibiotic resistance patterns, biofilm production, and the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and biofilm-forming genes in E. coli isolated from fish in open-body water (wild) sources and land-based aquaculture (cultured) systems in Mymensingh, Bangladesh. We collected 130 fish (Koi: Anabas testudineus and Shing: Heteropneustes fossilis) among which 70 were from wild sources and 60 from cultured systems. We screened 116 probable E. coli isolates through selective culture, Gram-staining, and biochemical tests. Using malB gene-specific PCR, we confirmed 87 isolates (67.0%) as E. coli. Cultured fish had a higher prevalence (70.0%) compared to wild fish (64.0%). Biofilm formation was detected in 20.0% E. coli by Congo red agar tests. However, crystal violet assays revealed that 70.0% of E. coli from cultured fish produced biofilm, compared to 20.0% from wild fish, with 7.0% of cultured fish isolates showing strong biofilm production. Antibiotic resistance profiling showed that 100.0% E. coli isolates were resistant to ampicillin and ceftazidime, beta-lactamase-producing antibiotics. Resistance patterns varied by source, with nearly 97.0% of E. coli from cultured fish being multidrug-resistant (MDR), compared to 60.0% in wild fish. E. coli from cultured fish were identified as potential reservoirs of ARGs such as blaTEM (83.0%), blaSHV (81.0%), blaCTX (78.57%), and the biofilm forming gene fimC (100.0%). Significant associations were observed for blaTEM (p = 0.033), blaSHV (p = 0.038), and fimC (p = 0.005). These findings highlight the need for monitoring β-lactamase-resistant and biofilm-forming E. coli in both wild and cultured fish in Bangladesh due to their potential threat to public health and animal populations.",

        "abstract": "The escalating global threat of antibiotic resistance has prompted a critical need for innovative approaches to bacterial infection treatment. In terms of management, bacterial-associated disorders have reached a critical point in the world due to the advent of drug-resistant types of bacteria. Nonetheless, continued bacteriophage research presents a promising frontier in the battle against bacterial infections. In this study, we explored the effectiveness of bacteriophage therapy against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to our viewpoint, phage therapy could replace antibiotics in terms of safety, efficacy, and specificity. Furthermore, phage therapy offers versatility in administering single phage, phage products, or modified phage against various resistant bacteria. Moreover, Phage cocktails, with their synergistic combinations, showcase a holistic approach, mitigating the risk of resistance and expanding treatment possibilities. Similarly, the synergy between phages and antibiotics holds promise for overcoming antibiotic resistance and forging a path toward more effective and sustainable antimicrobial strategies. The review provides insights into the transformative impact of bacteriophage therapy on current bacterial infection treatment paradigms, its application with methodological challenges and limitations, as well as insights to scientists and policymakers on the best areas to study phages in order to combat antimicrobial resistance.",
