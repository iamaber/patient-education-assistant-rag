        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

        "abstract": "Viral infections continue to pose a significant threat to global health, especially with the emergence and re-emergence of resistant viral strains. The limitations of conventional antiviral therapies, such as narrow-spectrum activity, high toxicity, and rising resistance, underscore the need for innovative treatment strategies. Antiviral peptides (AVPs) have gained attention as promising therapeutic agents due to their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, low cytotoxicity, and ability to target multiple stages of the viral life cycle. This review provides a comprehensive overview of AVPs, focusing on their classification, mechanisms of action, and clinical relevance. Both natural and synthetic AVPs are discussed, including FDA-approved agents such as enfuvirtide (HIV) and boceprevir (HCV), along with candidates currently in clinical trials. AVPs inhibit viral attachment, fusion, replication, and assembly, while also modulating host immune responses. Their applications extend beyond treatment to include prophylaxis and combination therapies, offering potential benefits in pandemic preparedness. However, challenges such as enzymatic degradation, poor bioavailability, and high production costs limit their clinical translation. Recent advances in peptide engineering, computational drug design, and nanoparticle-based delivery systems aim to overcome these barriers. AVPs represent a promising class of antiviral agents with the potential to address current therapeutic gaps and improve future outbreak response. This review highlights their growing importance in the field of antiviral therapy and outlines future directions for research and development.",

        "abstract": "A child's exposure to arsenic (As) can begin in utero through placental transfer to the fetus. There is a growing body of epidemiologic evidence suggesting an association between As exposure and neuropsychological development. Therefore, our objective was to describe the consequences of maternal and/or childhood As exposure on children's neuropsychological development. We conducted a scoping review with a systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases. We included studies that assessed the association between maternal and/or childhood As exposure and neuropsychological development in children up to an average of 12 years of age. A total of 77 studies were included, most of which were published between 2020 and 2024 (44.1%), conducted in the United States of America (18.2%) and Bangladesh (16.9%), and involved participants with a median age of 6.6 years. Most studies performed cross-sectional analyses (51.9%) and assessed exposure to elements other than As (64.9%). Childhood was the most frequently studied exposure window (57.2%), and urine was the most commonly used biomarker of exposure (58.4%), followed by blood or serum (32.3%). Cognition was the most frequently evaluated neuropsychological domain (94.8%), followed by psychomotor function (40.3%) and social-emotional function (29.9%). Most studies reported evidence of a negative impact of As exposure on children's neuropsychological development (73.7%), while some found no changes (27.3%) and a few suggested an improvement (1.3%). An important limitation is that most studies measured total urinary As without speciation into inorganic versus organic forms, which limits the validity of dose-response conclusions based on total arsenic concentrations. This review highlights the potential deleterious neuropsychological effects of maternal and/or childhood As exposure while also identifying areas where the evidence remains inconclusive.",

The first NiV outbreak, in Malaysia, involved pig-to-human transmission, that resulted in significant economic losses to the local pig industry. Despite the risk NiV poses to pig-dense regions, no licensed vaccines exist. This study therefore assessed three NiV vaccine candidates in pigs: (1) adjuvanted soluble NiV (s)G protein, (2) adjuvanted pre-fusion stabilised NiV (mcs)F protein, and (3) adenoviral vectored NiV G (ChAdOx1 NiV G). NiV sG induced the strongest neutralising antibody response, NiV mcsF induced antibodies best able to neutralise cell-cell fusion, whereas ChAdOx1 NiV G elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Despite differences in immunogenicity, prime-boost immunisation with all candidates conferred a high degree of protection against NiV infection. Follow-up studies demonstrated longevity of immune responses and broadly comparable immune responses in Bangladeshi pigs under field conditions. These studies provide a platform for developing a NiV vaccine for pigs.",

We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

Using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach, it investigates how GST search can predict new COVID-19 cases. The findings show that GST can offer timely insights into public health responses. The results also show that GST search items can predict the outbreak before 1–2 weeks. While VAR analysis confirms the causal relationship between the GST terms and the new COVID-19 cases, this study also acknowledges the limitations of inappropriate regional data at the outset of any new pandemic. It also acknowledges the misinformation from GST can underestimate real time surveillance. Policymakers can use GST for real-time risk communication and informed decision during pandemic. The results also suggest the importance of infodemiology to integrate it into the public health system for disease surveillance as the country’s’ resources are constrained. This study highlights the contribution of infodemiology towards the enhancement of traditional methods and systems of surveillance, which is relevant both nationally and globally.

        "abstract": "The Oropouche virus (OROV), an emerging arbovirus transmitted by arthropods, has caused significant outbreaks in South and Central America, with over half a million reported cases. Despite its public health threat, no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments exist for Oropouche fever (OF). This study explores the potential of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a bioactive polyphenol from green tea, as an antiviral agent against OROV using computational approaches. Due to the lack of experimentally resolved OROV protein structures, we employed AlphaFold2 to predict 3D models of key viral proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelopment polyprotein, nucleoprotein, and glycoprotein Gc. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between EGCG and these targets, with particularly high interactions for RNA polymerase (-7.1 kcal/mol) and envelopment polyprotein (-8.7 kcal/mol), suggesting the inhibition of viral replication and entry. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified critical human host genes (e.g., FCGR3A, IRF7, and IFNAR1) involved in immune responses, while Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses highlighted enriched antiviral and inflammatory pathways. ADMET profiling indicated challenges in EGCG's bioavailability, including poor gastrointestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeability, but its low toxicity and natural origin support its potential as a lead compound. These findings suggest that EGCG may disrupt OROV infection through multi-target mechanisms, warranting further experimental validation. This study provides a foundation for developing EGCG-based therapeutics against OROV and underscores the utility of computational methods in antiviral drug discovery.",

Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are typically used directly on stool but are not considered sufficient for cholera confirmation. However, they may provide a practical alternative to the slide agglutination step of culture<i>,</i> as they are easy to use, store, and require minimal training. This study evaluates the concordance of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1/O139 detection from presumptive colonies by slide agglutination with RDTs. Patients (≥1 year) with acute watery diarrhea at the icddr,b Dhaka hospital were enrolled. Stool samples were cultured on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose medium, and presumptive colonies were subcultured on Gelatin Agar medium. Isolates were then tested by slide agglutination and four commercial cholera RDTs. From 4 February 2024 through 24 May 2025, 1,638 patients with acute watery diarrhea were enrolled, 1,140 (70%) had presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies, and 482 (29%) were culture-confirmed as <i>V. cholerae</i> O1. We tested suspected <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies using Cholkit (n=1,140), SD Bioline (n=693), Crystal VC O1/O139 (n=693), and Crystal VC O1 (n=655) RDT kits. RDTs showed near-perfect concordance with slide agglutination. Using slide agglutination as the reference, the sensitivity of the RDT kits ranged from 99.3% to 99.6% and the specificity from 99.3% to 99.7%. RDTs offer a practical and potentially easier alternative to slide agglutination of presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies within typical cholera culture protocols. This may help to provide a pathway to quick confirmation of outbreaks in settings where lab facilities and reagents may be limited.IMPORTANCEThis study demonstrated that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can effectively replace traditional slide agglutination methods to confirm suspected <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonies belonging to the O1 serogroup, which are responsible for the current seventh cholera pandemic. Comparing four RDTs to slide agglutination, we found almost perfect agreement, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 99%. Since RDTs are cheaper, easier to use and store, and require less technical training, adopting them could significantly speed up cholera outbreak confirmation, especially in areas with limited laboratory resources. This practical shift could lead to faster responses to cholera outbreaks, ultimately improving public health surveillance and disease control globally.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experience a plethora of long-COVID symptoms that may persist for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID, even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group, which had previously exhibited varying symptom severity (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered group, with significantly elevated titers in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. After vaccination, the recovered group showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in the severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups, compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p < 0.005). Notably, antibody titers were negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p < 0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days after receiving two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, antibody titers returned to baseline levels, highlighting the importance of vaccination and additional booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history. To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.",

        "abstract": "After a major outbreak in Bangladesh in 2017, chikungunya nearly vanished from its territory until its resurgence in late 2024. However, its symptomatic overlap with dengue virus (DENV), another major arbovirus, has hindered accurate diagnosis and reporting, resulting in limited molecular diagnostic efforts for chikungunya in this region. This diagnostic evaluation study aimed to detect and characterize arboviral infections at the molecular level, focusing on the re-emergence of chikungunya and implications for future outbreaks. Febrile individuals aged 5-65 years old presenting with fever onset within 2-5 days along with other corresponding febrile symptoms were prospectively recruited from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh diagnostic facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 569 of 1,280 screened individuals were enrolled, providing informed written consent/assent. Serum samples from 474 participants underwent real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, revealing 213 positive cases for at least one arbovirus. Chikungunya cases totaled 55, including seven coinfections (six with DENV and the first documented chikungunya virus-Zika virus coinfection in Bangladesh). No infections were reported from January to August, with a peak in October and November. Most chikungunya virus infections (72.7%) had moderate to high viral loads, with symptoms of joint pain, myalgia, and headaches. This resurgence of chikungunya in late 2024 highlights the potential for a major outbreak in 2025, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate public health impact and ensure a robust response to this re-emerging threat.",

        "abstract": "CPXV is responsible for animal diseases affecting cattle (Lumpy Skin Disease), sheep (Sheeppox), and goats (Goatpox). During outbreaks, these diseases have huge socio-economic effects. Now, no vaccination that is effective against sheeppox, goatpox, and lumpy skin disease is available. This work used an immunoinformatic methodology to discover possible targets for vaccination against CPXV. After the 122 CPXV proteins were obtained from the Vipr database, several investigations into the proteins' virulence, antigenicity, toxicity, solubility, and IFN-g activity were carried out. Three outer membrane and extracellular proteins were selected to predict their B-cell and T-cell epitopes based on certain distinctive features. These epitopes exhibit conservation across three species, namely Sheeppox virus (SPPV), Goatpox virus (GTPV), and Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) of CPXV. This will provide more comprehensive immunity against diverse virus strains worldwide. Nine MHC-I, MHC-II, and B-cell epitopes were selected to generate multi-epitope vaccine constructions. These constructs were linked using AAY, GPGPG, and KK linkers and 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Molecular modeling and structural validation enabled the production of vaccine constructs with high-quality 3D structures. CPXV (Protein A35, Protein Resolve A22, and Scaffold Protein) was selected for further analysis because of its varied immunological and physiochemical properties (Number of Amino Acids, Molecular Weight (Daltons), Theoretical pI Aliphatic index, Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), Instability index GC content, and CAI value) and docking scores. The bacterial expression system showed notable gene expression for the CPXV-V5 vaccine, as shown by computational cloning analysis. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed structural stability and long-term epitope visibility, implying strong immune responses after delivery. These results suggest that the developed vaccines might be quite safe and effective in practical settings, and they offer a solid foundation for further experimental verification.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between economic growth and nutrition is not yet fully understood in the context of the new nutrition reality where most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face an increasing double burden of malnutrition. We aimed to investigate the association between early life exposure to economic shocks and multiple forms of childhood malnutrition in LMICs. We pooled cross-sectional data on children younger than 5 years from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 1990 to 2022 and longitudinal income data from the World Inequality Database. An economic shock was defined as any negative income growth and was tested at intensity levels of less than -1%, -5%, and -10%. Malnutrition outcomes variables comprised stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, concurrent wasting and stunting (WaSt), and double burden of malnutrition (child is both stunted and overweight). Adjusted associations of economic shocks, at different critical windows (year of the interview, birth, first 1000 days of life), with malnutrition outcomes were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression models with robust errors. The associations were interpreted using prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs. A total of 1 643 898 children across 230 surveys in 68 LMICs were included in this study. Negative income shocks in the year of interview were associated with a 5·4% (PR 1·054 [95% CI 1·029-1·080]) increase in the prevalence of wasting and a 12·7% (1·127 [1·079-1·176]) increase in severe wasting. A dose-response association according to the intensity levels of income shock in the year of birth was found for stunting (-1%: PR 1·019 [95% CI 1·011-1·027]; -5%: 1·033 [1·025-1·042]; and -10%: 1·061 [1·051-1·072]) and severe stunting (-1%: 1·041 [1·026-1·055]; -5%: 1·059 [1·044-1·074]; and -10%: 1·099 [1·081-1·118]). In children aged 2-4 years, income shocks during the first 1000 days of life strongly increased the prevalence of double burden of malnutrition by 30·3% (PR 1·303 [95% CI 1·221-1·391]), obesity by 14·3% (1·143 [1·046-1·249]), and overweight by 13·8% (1·138 [1·090-1·188]). We also found a strong dose-response association between the intensity of income shock during the first 1000 days and double burden of malnutrition (-1%: PR 1·216 [95% CI 1·141-1·295]; -5%: 1·299 [1·192-1·416]; -10%: 1·350 [1·185-1·537]). Exposure to negative income shocks can significantly increase the risk of various forms of malnutrition during childhood, with critical windows of vulnerability that vary based on the timing of economic instability and the specific type of malnutrition. Policymakers and public health practitioners must recognise these critical periods and develop targeted interventions to safeguard maternal and child nutrition, particularly during times of economic crises.

        "abstract": "We previously identified genetic polymorphisms associated with <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>-positive diarrhea at the locus containing the transcription factor, cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>). Genetic association testing in birth cohorts of Bangladeshi children showed the previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the <i>CREM</i> locus associated with <i>E. histolytica-</i>positive diarrhea were independently associated with undernutrition at 1 year of age. The reference allele for both tested SNPs was associated with lower weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) at 1 year of age (rs2148483: 0.161 reduction in WAZ per allele, <i>P</i> = 0.007; rs58000832: 0.203 reduction in WAZ, <i>P</i> = 0.001). Small intestinal transcriptome data from Bangladeshi and American children revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for cAMP response element-binding sites. DEGs related to mitochondrial function were upregulated in the small intestine of children with the rs2148483 reference allele, while adaptive immune response processes were enriched among downregulated genes. Upregulation of mitochondrial function was mirrored by plasma metabolomics profiles concordant with a shift toward mitochondrial respiration. In mice, global conditional deletion of <i>Crem</i> resulted in reduced body weight, downregulation of genes related to innate immune function, and upregulation of metabolic gene expression in the intestine. Tissue-specific deletion of <i>Crem</i> in intestinal epithelial cells was sufficient to reduce overall body weight and alter intestinal expression of mitochondrial-related metabolic genes but not immune gene transcription. These data indicate that intestinal epithelial expression of <i>Crem</i> is linked to body weight, plausibly by regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, while <i>Crem</i> expression in other cell types influences the immune response to <i>E. histolytica</i>.IMPORTANCEUndernutrition and diarrheal disease are leading causes of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Undernutrition can present as a cause or consequence of diarrheal diseases, leading us to hypothesize these phenotypes share a common genetic basis. Our identification of cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>) as a transcriptional regulator that influences susceptibility to both undernutrition and diarrheal disease in children growing up in an impoverished Bangladeshi community advances our understanding of the interaction of two major causes of childhood illness and offers the potential of therapy targeted to the cAMP-regulated transcription factor, <i>CREM</i>.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers (HCWs) play a pivotal role in preventing healthcare-associated infections by adhering to infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. This study assessed IPC knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among HCWs at tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. From September 2020 to January 2021, semistructured questionnaires were administered to physicians, nurses, and cleaning staff at 11 tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. KAP components were classified into \"good,\" \"fair,\" and \"poor\" based on the frequency of favorable responses (>75%, 50%-75%, <50%). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported practices. We enrolled 1728 HCWs, including 526 physicians (30.4%), 934 nurses (54.1%), and 268 cleaning staff (15.5%). Physicians and nurses demonstrated \"good\" IPC knowledge (median 94.8% and 96.6% favorable responses, respectively) and self-reported IPC practices (median 76.2% and 80.4% favorable responses). However, most cleaning staff exhibited \"poor\" IPC knowledge (median 47.3% favorable responses) and practices (21.3% favorable responses). Across all categories of HCWs, the median attitude score was \"fair\" (range 60.0%-71.2% favorable responses). Having a positive attitude toward IPC was associated with increased IPC knowledge (adjusted odds ratio 3.0, P < .001) and good IPC practices (adjusted odds ratio 16.3, P < .001). HCW's KAP toward IPC was found to be suboptimal, especially among cleaning staff. However, the strong association noted between favorable attitudes toward IPC and adherence to safe IPC practices demonstrates the need for hospital leadership to promote a positive IPC culture, in addition to training and resources, to improve IPC practices and enhance healthcare resiliency beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.",

Despite whole blood being the gold standard for DENV detection, emerging evidence suggests that non-blood specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), may offer a less invasive alternative for diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of NPSs for detecting DENV RNA in pediatric patients in Bangladesh. We collected 130 paired NPS and blood specimens from children with suspected dengue (aged 1 month to 15 years) at Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute. Viral RNA was extracted from both sample types and subsequently detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 130 paired specimens, DENV RNA was detected in 115 blood samples and 104 NPSs. Compared with blood, NPS exhibited a sensitivity of 90.43%, specificity of 100%, and overall accuracy of 91.54%. An analysis of demographic and clinical factors revealed no significant differences between NPS-positive and -negative cases. This study underscores the potential of NPSs as a viable alternative diagnostic specimen for DENV detection, particularly, in settings where blood collection is difficult. Integrating NPS into existing diagnostic and surveillance systems could enhance early detection and outbreak management, ultimately improving patient care and public health response.",

        "abstract": "Most vaccinations in the immunization schedule need two or more doses to elicit a protective immune response. Therefore, completion of all doses is crucial for achieving the best possible immunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing missed opportunities of polio vaccination in children between the ages of 1-3 years in urban Dhaka. In 2018, according to the immunization card records or histories from parents/guardians, we sorted1-3-year-old children from areas of Dhaka South City Corporation who were not fully immunized. Immunization records were obtained from the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) card or maternal recall. Reasons for non-vaccination were documented. A total of 501 children were tracked down to determine the causes of their incomplete polio doses. Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities were assessed by using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model. The households with a child who had not received all the recommended vaccines had a considerably lower monthly income (18,000 BDT; p < 0.001). In both the complete and partial vaccination groups, the average family size was five people, and the average child age was 28 months. Education level of the household head after adjustment (AOR), the odds of the event occurring decrease by 25% with primary education (95% CI: 0.66, 0.85), p-value: < 0.001). Occupation of the household head for rickshaw/van/cart puller, AOR, the odds increase even more, with the event being 3.15 times more likely for this occupation (95% CI: 1.95, 5.08) and statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Again, for daily wager AOR, 2.16 times higher for daily wagers (95% CI: 1.35, 3.45) and statistical significance (p-value: 0.001). This study identifies sociodemographic factors that influence incomplete childhood immunization in this urban area of Dhaka. In order to improve the coverage, the identified factors need to be mitigated and policymakers should focus on enhancing community engagement, combating misinformation and increasing the accessibility of vaccination services.",

        "abstract": "Over the last two decades, Nepal has experienced substantial urbanization, with an increasing number of people choosing to move to cities. Although cities offer a wealth of opportunities, it also provides significant challenges. Many of those migrating to and living in cities contend with poor conditions and live in poverty. Defining and measuring urban deprivation is challenging due to its multi-dimensional nature, encompassing various dimensions such as housing, employment, living expenses, education, healthcare, and other unique challenges associated with city life. This study draws on the 'Domains of Urban Deprivation Framework' and evaluates the availability, commonness, and applicability of these domains. It measures multiple urban deprivation indices relevant to the context of Nepal. The research will commence with a review of the availability of data covering the urban domains listed in the Urban Deprivation Framework within routine data collected in Nepal at the province, district, and municipal levels. This will involve examining existing datasets and identifying any gaps or limitations in the data that could impact the construction of the local urban deprivation indices. To understand the commonness of different urban deprivation within different urban contexts in Nepal, a Delphi survey will be conducted in two municipalities and nationally with government policymakers, community representatives, data experts/researchers, and civil society actors. In the three urban contexts, stakeholders will prioritize and weigh the indicators according to their respective urban contexts and rank domains that reflects the priorities across different geographical areas and stakeholder communities. We will compare responses across these groups of stakeholders and explore contextual differences. The composite score for each domain will be calculated by summing the weighted scores of all indices and normalizing the results to ensure that they fall within a defined range. We will then plot the deprivation indices in urban areas at the provincial, district, and municipal levels. The urban deprivation index in Nepal will provide granular data that will enable policymakers and stakeholders to explore the urban deprivation index visually and access key insights for informed decision-making and resource allocation. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of Nepal Health Research Council (Reference number: 213/2024) and the School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee at the University of Leeds, UK. The findings will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health issue now and is the second leading cancer among women in Bangladesh, caused primarily by Human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite effective vaccination and screening methods, awareness and access to preventive methods are limited in developing regions. This nationwide study aims to explore socio-economic and cultural factors affecting cervical cancer awareness in Bangladesh and generate evidence-based recommendations for tailoring suitable health promotion strategies for the country. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to evaluate cervical cancer awareness among adults aged 18 years and above. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed for this research, keeping in mind the local sociocultural contexts. Face-to-face interviews were conducted after getting the participants' consent and making sure they understood all the questions. After checking for data quality and consistency, responses of 2,151 participants were finally retained. The collected data was analyzed using STATA (Version 17) statistical software. The majority (80.15%) of the participants were aware of cervical cancer, with healthcare workers being the primary source of information. Higher awareness rates were noted among married individuals (80.88%), urban dwellers (83.24%), those with more education (average 11.96 ± 4.36 years), individuals with higher income (88.17%), and those belonging to nuclear families (82.86%). Healthcare professionals had significantly greater awareness (98.91%) compared to other occupations. Participants undergoing regular health checkups were more informed and the association was statistically significant (87.03%, p < 0.001). Univariate and multiple logistic regression models revealed that each additional year of education increased the probability of being aware by 16-20%. Men had significantly lower odds of being aware compared to women (Adjusted Odds Ratio AOR = 0.41, β = -0.895, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.70, p = 0.001 in the multiple logistic regression analysis). Similarly, respondents not cohabitating with their spouse were less aware than those who were living with partners (AOR = 0.47, β = -0.750, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.81, p = 0.006). Income levels conversely influenced awareness level, participants from the highest income group (earning 35,001-50,000 BDT) had 47% lower odds (AOR = 0.53, β = -0.629, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.80, p = 0.002) of awareness compared to the lowest income group (earning ≤20,000 BDT). Despite the widespread awareness of cervical cancer among most Bangladeshi adults, there remains a notable gap, particularly among certain demographics. Since the study identified healthcare workers, social media, and mass media as major sources of information, targeted educational campaigns through media channels and outreach activities by healthcare workers might effectively enhance nationwide awareness of cervical cancer.",

Understanding the distribution and prevalence of different Norovirus genotypes is crucial for public health surveillance and intervention strategies. We conducted a systematic review of Norovirus genotypes in Asia from 2000 to 2023. The review adhered to PRISMA Guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (ID CRD42024572647). We extracted data on the prevalence of 22 genotypes and their genetic variations over time. The review highlighted Norovirus GII.4 as highly prevalent across Asia, particularly in India, Taiwan, Vietnam, and China. GII.2 dominated Indonesia, GII.3 prevailed in Malaysia, Russia, and Bangladesh, GII.7 in Bangladesh, and GII.17 in China, Taiwan, and Nepal, with notable epidemiological shifts between 2012 and 2016 and GII.4 resurgence from 2017. The study highlights the dynamic nature of Norovirus genotypic distribution in Asia, with both persistent dominance of certain genotypes and notable regional variations. The cyclic patterns of genotype prevalence, particularly the shifts between GII.4 and GII.17, underline the need for ongoing genotypic surveillance to inform targeted public health responses.

        "abstract": "Effective cholera outbreak response requires accurate bedside rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) because access to laboratories is often limited. Formative studies suggest cholera diagnostics have multiple vulnerabilities, including antibiotics and predation by bacteriophage ('phage') specific to <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (<i>Vc</i>). We conducted a prospective nationwide study in Bangladesh among over 2000 patients with diarrhoeal disease to characterize how these vulnerabilities impact RDT performance. Assays included culture, qPCR and mass spectrometry. With the current gold standard of culture or qPCR <i>Vc</i> positivity, we found no effect of phage on RDT performance. When the diagnostic criteria were expanded to include phage, there was a small decrease in RDT sensitivity. In contrast, large increases in sensitivity and specificity were observed among patients with moderate and severe dehydration. Using the expanded definition, the odds of RDT positivity decreased among cholera patients with phage exposure. The effect was most robust among patients with severe dehydration. Antibiotic were detected in over 80% of samples by LC-MS/MS which limited testing for effects on RDTs. Applying these findings, we estimated that restricting RDT use to severe patients with no reported antibiotic exposure increases sensitivity by 50% compared to unrestricted use. If phage were a diagnostic proxy for <i>Vc</i>, we estimate RDT would miss an additional 17% of cholera cases. Cholera RDTs have critical limitations that require consideration in global deployments. Inclusion of phage detection in diagnostic criteria may improve case detection which requires further study. The impact of these findings likely extends to other diseases where diagnostics share similar vulnerabilities.",

However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities. Conversely, the absence of a similar response pattern for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, and EAEC is consistent with large-scale studies showing a limited association between their quantities and diarrhea.",

Both scales were found to have robust psychometric properties, including content validity, structural validity (factor loadings ≥0·6), and reliability (ordinal alphas 0·79-0·92). High scores on both scales predicted an increased hesitancy to report symptoms and seek care. The RAPID Stigma Scales are validated tools for real-time assessment of stigma across outbreak settings, enabling responders to design targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and promote equitable care.",

        "abstract": "The 2024 student-led job quota reform protests in Bangladesh, initially peaceful, escalated into a nationwide uprising. The government responded with excessive force, leading to widespread violence, including severe eye injuries to hundreds of protesters. This study investigates the causes, consequences, and medical responses to these eye injuries, which resulted in lasting physical, psychological, and economic impacts on the victims using secondary data, including reports from human rights organizations, hospital records, and media sources. Victim testimonies were collected from published sources to assess the immediate and long-term effects. A total of 647 individuals sustained severe eye injuries during the protests. The use of pellet bullets by law enforcement was the primary cause. Hospitals reported over 1,300 eye injury cases, with more than 90% of those who underwent surgery and 550 lost vision in one or both eyes. This movement resulted in devastating eye injuries for hundreds of young men, with long-lasting physical and economic impacts. Victims, many of whom were breadwinners, faced significant challenges in receiving adequate medical treatment and long-term rehabilitation. Immediate governmental intervention is needed to ensure their inclusion in the rebuilding of post-uprising Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The increasing incidence of dengue virus (DENV) infections poses significant public health challenges in Bangladesh, demanding advanced forecasting methodologies to guide timely interventions. This study introduces a rigorous multivariate time series analysis, integrating meteorological factors with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, to predict DENV case trends across different temporal scales. Leveraging a robust data pipeline, this research incorporates a strategic downscaling technique, applying the Stochastic Bayesian Downscaling (SBD) algorithm to convert monthly DENV case data to daily frequency. This approach addresses key issues in the handling of sparse datasets and missing data, offering novel insights into the potential accuracy benefits of data downscaling in time series forecasting. Among the models assessed, the decision tree demonstrated superior performance on the actual monthly data, achieving an accuracy of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>74.6</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> . In contrast, the random forest model outperformed others on the downscaled daily data, reaching an accuracy of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>95.8</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> , thereby supporting the efficacy of data downscaling for ML applications in epidemiology. Comparative analysis reveals that downscaling provided a <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>28.5</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> improvement in accuracy and an <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>89.3</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) over non-downscaled data which has been proven to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, illustrating the substantial advantages of employing downscaling for effective DENV forecasting. Based on the best-performing model, the study further projects a worst-case scenario for 2024, forecasting daily cases to peak at 1,382 ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>95</mn> <mo>%</mo></mrow> </math> CI: 1,341-1,423) between August and October, with a gradual decline expected by December. The findings not only underscore the critical influence of meteorological variables on DENV transmission but also advocate for the adoption of sophisticated data preprocessing techniques, such as downscaling, to enhance prediction accuracy. This research marks a significant advancement in predictive epidemiology, offering a scalable framework for DENV and other vector-borne diseases, with implications for improving public health responses in vulnerable regions globally.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the spread of COVID-19 in humanitarian and fragile settings is challenging for many reasons, including the lack of data on social dynamics and preventive behaviors during an epidemic. We investigate social interactions in three such settings - Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central African Republic (CAR), Cox's Bazar (CXB), Bangladesh - and how they changed during the first year of the pandemic. This comparative mixed-methods study uses a representative household survey and focus group discussions or key informant interviews in each site. Descriptive weighted analysis of survey responses was conducted; multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with changes in social interactions. Thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data. Nearly all participants had social interactions the day before the survey, although the average number of daily interactions was low. Interactions primarily occurred indoors, at home and without masks. We saw a discrepancy between knowledge about and practice of preventive behaviors. Most respondents reported interacting less often (77.3% CXB, 86.7% CAR, 58.8% DRC) and having shorter meetings (80% CXB, 77.8% CAR, and 47.8% DRC). Reluctance towards the COVID-19 vaccine was a risk factor for non-compliant behaviors in CAR (OR increased frequency = 3.51, 95%CI = 1.41-8.75; OR increased duration = 2.47, 95%CI = 1.15-5.29) and DRC (OR increased duration = 3.06, 95%CI = 1.71-5.49), likely pointing to distrust towards institutional policies. Respondents from IDP communities in DRC were less likely to reduce the frequency of interaction, likely because living conditions did not facilitate physical distancing. Increased knowledge in CXB was associated with compliant behavior (for 1pt-increase: OR increased frequency = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.32-0.68; OR increased duration = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.31-0.69). Understanding social dynamics is fundamental to predict infectious disease spread, particularly in humanitarian settings. More evidence is needed to understand behaviors influencing disease dynamics and drivers of behaviors, including trust in authorities, social, and economic factors. Peace, community engagement, and reduction of misinformation remain critical for epidemic responses in humanitarian settings.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the initial findings of an IAEA project aimed at assessing the status of the medical physics profession in diagnostic radiology and image-guided interventional procedures in the Asia-Pacific region. The study involved distributing questionnaires covering ten thematic areas to 15 national project coordinators who had been nominated by IAEA National Representatives as medical physics experts in 15 countries, followed by an online workshop to discuss the responses and validate the data. The results indicate that while high academic qualifications are generally expected for entry into the radiology medical physics sub-specialty in countries where it is active, there are significant gaps in the availability of formal clinical training programs. Professional registration for radiology medical physicists is also limited across the surveyed countries. Most surveyed countries have medical physics professional societies and communication networks, and the majority have legal requirements for medical physics services and quality control of radiological equipment. However, the recognition and scope of practice for medical physicists in radiology vary across the region. The study identified key challenges, including a limited understanding of the profession among clinical staff, as well as opportunities, such as the availability of medical physics academic programs that include radiology physics in their curriculum. This paper also provides a brief overview of the role of the IAEA and the support it can offer to medical physicists in diagnostic and interventional radiology.",

This study aims to determine the prevalence of antihypertensive medication adherence and its associated factors among patients with hypertension receiving treatments at a Hypertension Center in Bangladesh. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 352 adult patients with hypertension registered in the Rangpur Hypertension and Research Center. The outcome variable for the study was medication adherence to the antihypertensive drug, which was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). Descriptive analysis was conducted to show the distribution of the study participants, Pearson's chi-square test was applied to explore associations between categorical response and explanatory variables, and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore factors associated with medication adherence. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 17.0. The prevalence of good medication adherence among patients with hypertension in the HRC, R was 54.83%. Among various reasons for taking the medicine irregularly, forgetfulness (20.29%) was the most common cause reported by the participants, followed by a busy work schedule (7.71%). Among the study participants, married patients were found to have higher medicine adherence (AOR= 3.81; 95% CI: 1.34-10.89) than unmarried patients. Compared to patients who had hypertension for less than or equal to 5 years, patients suffering from hypertension for 6-10 years had 68% (AOR= 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11-0.95) and patients suffering for more than 10 years had 72% (AOR= 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09-0.84) lower odds of medicine adherence, respectively. Patients who were diagnosed by non-professionals had 81% (AOR= 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.61) lower odds of medicine adherence compared to the patients who were diagnosed by health professionals. This study observed low medication adherence among patients with hypertension, where forgetfulness and a busy work schedule were reported to be the primary reasons for such non-adherence. Patients who are not married, who have been suffering for a long, and who have not been diagnosed by a health professional manifested as significant influencing factors for non-adherence.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested the negative effects of exposure to high temperature during pregnancy on multiple adverse birth outcomes. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the exposure-response relationship and future risk projections for extreme low birth weight (ELBW) in South Asia. A total of 393,530 pregnant women from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan were included in this analysis. Annual mean temperature throughout each woman's entire gestational period was estimated from the fifth generation of the European Re-Analysis Land Dataset (ERA5-land). We employed the multivariable mixed effect regression model, incorporating random effects for survey strata, to assess the relationship between temperature and ELBW. Stepwise regression models show robust and monotonically varying exposure-response relationships. In the fully adjusted model, for every 1 °C increase in temperature, the risk of ELBW may increase by 1.41 % (95 % CI: 0.99 %, 1.85 %), while birth weight may decrease by -2.26 g (95 % CI: 3.47, -1.04). We found that 2.25 % (95 % CI: 1.26 %, 3.25 %) of ELBW risk can be attributed to annual mean temperature in South Asia, with India having the highest attributed risk (AF = 3.01 %, 95 % CI: 2.48 %, 3.53 %), followed by Bangladesh (AF = 2.81 %, 95 % CI: 2.32 %, 3.29 %). Several environmental, maternal, and household factors may modify the relationship between ambient temperature and ELBW. The risk of ELBW related to temperature rise would increase in the future, especially under the unrestricted emission scenario (e.g. SSP585). In South Asia, greater risks and burdens of ELBW were observed with increasing prenatal ambient temperature. A deeper understanding of covariant factors and intervention measures were needed to address maternal and child health issues under climate change.",

        "abstract": "<i>Candida auris</i> (<i>C. auris</i>), an emerging fungus, is primarily recognized for causing healthcare-associated infections. While carriage among hospitalized patients is well documented, community spread remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the burden of community-acquired <i>C. auris</i> skin colonization among newly hospitalized participants without any recent healthcare exposure. This cross-sectional study was conducted at two tertiary-level government hospitals and their surrounding catchment areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from June 2023 to May 2024. We enrolled 800 participants (400 from each hospital) shortly after admission, meeting the following criteria: no healthcare exposure within the past three months, no invasive procedures performed since the current hospital admission, and residence within the hospital's catchment area for the past three months. Skin swabs from the axillae and groins were cultured on CHROMagar Candida Plus to determine fungal colonization. Presumptive positive isolates were identified using VITEK 2, and <i>C. auris</i> was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. No <i>C. auris</i> colonization was detected in the axillary or groin in any enrolled participant. However, 128 (16%) patients were found to be colonized with other fungal species. The absence of community-acquired <i>C. auris</i> colonization in this study suggests that transmission primarily occurs within hospital settings. However, our strict inclusion criteria, which excluded patients with recent healthcare exposure, may have influenced this finding. Further research using alternative study designs is needed to fully understand the potential for <i>C. auris</i> spread within the community.IMPORTANCE<i>Candida auris</i>, a rapidly emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen with high mortality, poses a critical global health threat, particularly in healthcare settings. While extensive research has focused on its colonization among hospitalized patients, its potential presence and community transmission remain largely unexplored. An earlier study among critically ill patients in Bangladesh detected four colonized cases of <i>C. auris</i> without hospitalization history within the past year and admitted directly from home (F. Chowdhury et al., unpublished data). Notably, three participants resided in the same district and one in an adjacent district, raising serious concerns about possible community spread. This study is crucial in addressing this knowledge gap by assessing the burden of community-acquired <i>C. auris</i> colonization among newly hospitalized patients in Dhaka. Understanding its potential transmission outside the hospital is vital for shaping public health responses, guiding infection control strategies, and strengthening global surveillance efforts to mitigate the spread of this highly resistant pathogen.",

Several tools are available for measuring health literacy, including the HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire using Rasch measurement theory to assess general health literacy among adults in rural Bangladesh. Baseline data was collected through a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) in the Narail district of Bangladesh from 1 December 2020 to 31 January 2021, involving 307 adults aged 30-75 with hypertension. The HLS-EU-Q12 questionnaire, which has 12 items, was validated using the Rasch measurement model and analyzed using RUMM2030. The analysis was focused on differential item functioning (DIF) across gender and age, targeting, multidimensionality, response dependency, and item categorization. The sample consisted of almost equal proportions of females (50.2%) and males (49.8%), and control (50.8%) and intervention participants (49.2%). Initial examination indicated that the tool had a poor overall fit with the Rasch model, shown by a significant item-trait interaction (χ2 = 100.5 df = 48, p < 0.001). The reliability, measured by person separation index (PSI), was 0.746, which was considered satisfactory. The overall item fit residual (IFR) (M = 0.236, SD = 1.318) and the person fit residuals (PFR) (M = -0.186, SD = 1.03) were within the acceptable range of SD ± 1.4. All items were found to have ordered thresholds, suggesting that respondents had no difficulty differentiating between response options on the 4-point Likert-type scale. Only item 12 (\"Join a sports club or exercise class if you want to\") had a fit residual value outside the acceptable range. Removing item 12 resulted in a good overall fit (χ2 = 60.35 df = 44, p = 0.05) and a slight improvement to the PSI (0.746 for 12 items vs.0.756 for 11 items). None of the items showed significant DIF for age and gender. Only two items showed residual correlation coefficient 0.20, indicating possible redundancy. The analysis demonstrated the scale's unidimensionality, as shown by the lower bound of a binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed proportion (5.2%) being within the 95% confidence limit. The study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the HLS-EU-Q12 as a tool for assessing health literacy among adults in Bangladesh. However, further study is needed to evaluate the tool across different populations, including an in-depth investigation of item 12 to determine its inclusion or removal.

The matrix protein facilitates the encapsidation of the viral genome and proteins, enabling the formation of mature viral particles. The virus can spread via different routes, including zoonotic spillover and human-to-human transmission. Clinical manifestations include mild respiratory illness and severe and fatal encephalitis. The case fatality rate of Nipah virus infection varies widely, ranging from 40 to 75%, and is regulated by factors such as healthcare availability and quality, the patient's condition, and the virulence of the infecting strain. NiV has been reported in Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India, with fruit bats serving as natural reservoirs. Early detection and prompt response are crucial for controlling outbreaks; however, these efforts are hindered by diagnostic challenges and delayed recognition. The World Health Organization has categorized NiV as a priority pathogen owing to its epidemic potential, recurrent outbreaks, and alarming mortality rates. The persistent transmission dynamics and genetic stability of the Nipah virus among fruit bats require immediate attention and coordinated global action. The present study reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, and modes of transmission of Nipah virus infection, its geographical distribution, and endemic regions, highlighting the challenges in managing disease outbreaks.",

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

This study sought to explore people with disabilities' experiences of inclusion in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand how such responses can be more inclusive in the future. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 372 people with disabilities and their caregivers in Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Peru, Thailand, Türkiye (with Syrian refugees), Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe between 1 December 2020 and 28 February 2023, and analysed using thematic analysis. The study found that people with disabilities demonstrated high levels of knowledge about COVID-19 and were willing to adhere to prevention measures. However, participants noted that countries' COVID-19 responses were largely not inclusive of people with disabilities; that pandemic information was seldom available in accessible formats; and that adhering to social distancing and other mandates was challenging and incurred personal and economic costs. Consequently, the pandemic compounded existing barriers and inaccessibility experienced by people with disabilities and contributed to inequality.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health concern. Limited data have shown unusually high HCV seroprevalence among Rohingya refugees residing in camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HCV seropositivity and active infection and identify risk factors to inform the HCV response. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 10 and June 14, 2023, in adult (≥18 years) residents of seven camps in Cox's Bazar. Households were selected by simple random geosampling and one participant per household was selected at random. Participants were screened for HCV antibodies with a rapid finger prick blood test and, if seropositive, venous samples were tested for HCV viral load. A structured questionnaire collected information about demographics, HCV knowledge, and exposure risks. Survey-adjusted prevalence estimates of HCV seropositivity and active infection were generated by applying sampling weights. Factors associated with HCV seropositivity were identified using univariable and multivariable current status analysis and those associated with active infection via logistic regression. The survey included 641 participants, of whom 425 (66%) were women and for whom the median age was 34 years (IQR 28-46). 191 individuals tested positive for HCV antibodies. 187 of these individuals were tested for active infection and 124 had a detectable HCV viral load. The survey-adjusted prevalence estimate of HCV seropositivity was 30·4% (95% CI 26·5-34·5), and that of active infection 19·8% (95% CI 16·5-23·4). Current status analysis identified higher odds of HCV seropositivity among individuals reporting medical injection(s) (adjusted odds ratio 1·8 [95% CI 1·2-2·8]) or surgery (5·9 [1·9-18·4]), and among women (2·1 [1·3-3·2]). 328 (51%) of 641 participants had never heard of hepatitis C. Five (4%) of 124 participants with HCV viraemia reported previous HCV treatment. There is a substantial burden of active HCV infection among adult Rohingya camp residents, highlighting the urgent need to scale up testing and treatment capacities. The survey had constraints in identifying risk factors and could not provide data on HCV incidence. Reassessing infection prevalence after mass interventions and prospective surveillance are recommended to monitor ongoing transmission. A well-concerted multi-stakeholder action plan is needed to prevent future large-scale burden of severe liver disease and halt ongoing transmission. Médecins Sans Frontières.",

        "abstract": "Influenza viruses are a major global health burden with up to 650,000 associated deaths annually. Beyond seasonal illness, influenza A viruses (IAVs) pose a constant pandemic threat due to novel emergent viruses that have evolved the ability to jump from their natural avian hosts to humans. Because of this threat, active surveillance of circulating IAV strains in wild and domestic bird populations is vital to our pandemic preparedness and response strategies. Here, we report on IAV surveillance data collected from 2017 to 2022 from wild and domestic birds in Bangladesh. We note evidence to suggest that male birds show a higher risk of IAV, including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) virus, positivity than female birds. The data was stratified to control for selection bias and confounding variables to test the hypothesis that male birds are at a higher risk of IAV positivity relative to female birds. The association of IAV and A(H5) largely held in each stratum, and double stratification suggested that the phenomena was largely specific to ducks. Finally, we show that chickens, male birds, and juvenile birds generally have higher viral loads compared to their counterparts. These observations warrant further validation through active surveillance across various populations. Such efforts could significantly contribute to the enhancement of pandemic prediction and risk assessment models.",

        "abstract": "Methanol poisoning is a tragic and avoidable health emergency that threatens life and often leads to irreversible disability. It primarily occurs when people unwittingly consume beverages contaminated with the chemical compound under the guise of alcoholic spirits. Although reliable data on its burden are unavailable, methanol poisoning is thought to be increasing globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Current scholarship related to methanol poisoning draws almost exclusively from clinical and epidemiological research traditions. In this article, and in the absence of anthropological scholarship examining methanol poisoning specifically, we provide a narrative review of anthropological and social science literature that bears on this growing phenomenon. We bring key areas of anthropological thought and inquiry that coalesce around the social phenomenon of methanol poisoning in conversation with the clinical and epidemiological scholarship. We begin with a biographical account of methanol, an unlikely character which has become omnipresent in the material world. We then turn to a social scientific examination of alcohol consumption, to which methanol poisoning is tethered. We pay special attention to alcohol consumption in Muslim-majority settings, where alcohol is often proscribed, but methanol-related incidents are common. Subsequently, we examine the scholarship related to health systems and technologies, which come to bear on diagnostic and treatment encounters for those who have consumed toxic alcohol. We argue that anthropological perspectives are urgently needed to contribute to a fuller understanding of methanol poisoning and to design socially sensitive clinical and public health responses to address this avertable scourge.",

        "abstract": "Mutation is one of the most important drivers of viral evolution and genome variability, allowing viruses to potentially evade host immune responses and develop drug resistance. In the context of COVID-19, local genomic surveillance of circulating virus populations is therefore critical. The goals of this study were to describe the distribution of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, assess their genomic differences, and infer virus importation events in Bangladesh. We individually aligned 1965 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained between April 2020 and June 2021 to the Wuhan-1 sequence and used the resulting multiple sequence alignment as input to infer a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Sequences were assigned to lineages as described by the hierarchical Pangolin nomenclature scheme. We built a phylogeographic model using the virus population genome sequence variation to infer the number of virus importation events. We observed thirty-four lineages and sub-lineages in Bangladesh, with B.1.1.25 and its sub-lineages D.* (979 sequences) dominating, as well as the Beta variant of concern (VOC) B.1.351 and its sub-lineages B.1.351.* (403 sequences). The earliest B.1.1.25/D.* lineages likely resulted from multiple introductions, some of which led to larger outbreak clusters. There were 570 missense mutations, 426 synonymous mutations, 18 frameshift mutations, 7 deletions, 2 insertions, 10 changes at start/stop codons, and 64 mutations in intergenic or untranslated regions. According to phylogeographic modeling, there were 31 importation events into Bangladesh (95% CI: 27-36). Like elsewhere, Bangladesh has experienced distinct waves of dominant lineages during the COVID-19 pandemic; this study focuses on the emergence and displacement of the first wave-dominated lineage, which contains mutations seen in several VOCs and may have had a transmission advantage over the extant lineages.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive impairment has a major impact on health, quality of life and survival and its increasing burden presents a critical global health challenge. Empirical population-based studies of cognitive function and its association with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors among older adults in low-resource setting are rare. This study describes the burden of cognitive impairment and associations with demographic, health and behavioural factors among older adults in rural Bangladesh. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of a random sample of men and women aged 60 years and above in 96 rural villages in Bangladesh. Cognitive function was measured using the Bangla Adaptation of the Mini-mental State Examination (BAMSE), where higher score indicates higher function. Blood pressure, height and weight were measured using standard protocols and fasting glucose and 2-h oral glucose test were used to identify diabetes risk. Interviewer administered survey questionnaires assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety and self-reported health behaviours. Analyses were carried out separately for men and women and examined associations between sociodemographic, health and behaviour factors with BAMSE scores using robust Poisson regression. Data were gathered from 403 (216 female, 187 male) eligible participants. More than 50% of the population had at least mild cognitive impairment and women had lower cognitive scores than men. Younger age, higher education, wealth, and literacy were significantly associated with higher BAMSE scores among women and men. Associations with marital status varied between men and women, with being married having a positive association with BAMSE among women, i.e. higher cognitive function (relative score ratio (95% CI) 1.08 (1.02, 1.15), p = 0.013), but no association among men (0.94 (0.87, 1.02), p = 0.13). No clear associations were observed with diabetes or hypertension, but overweight and obesity were associated with an increased BAMSE score among women (1.10 (1.02, 1.19), p = 0.011) but not men (1.01 (0.94, 1.10), p = 0.70). Moderate and severe depressive symptoms were associated with lower BAMSE scores among men (0.90 (0.82, 0.99), p = 0.037), but not women (0.94 (0.83, 1.06), p = 0.31). Physical activity was associated with a relative increase in BAMSE score (1.08 (1.01, 1.16), p = 0.020) among women, though no association was seen in men (1.01 (0.95, 1.07), p = 0.76). The consumption of betel was associated with lower BAMSE among women (0.94 (0.89, 1.00), p = 0.056), but there was no evidence of association among men (1.01 (0.96, 1.07), p = 0.61). A large proportion of older adults in rural Bangladesh have impaired cognitive function and there are important gender differences in the distribution of cognitive scores and their association with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors in this population. Improvement in health and social care systems, taking into account the specific social, economic and gender dimensions of the context, are needed to prevent and manage the burden of cognitive decline in rural Bangladesh. This survey and analysis were part of the Bangladesh Diabetes Community-Led Awareness, Response and Evaluation (DClare) study funded by UKRI/MRC (MR/T023562/1) under the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases Scale-Up Programme.",

Limited information is available on how cellular immunity is modulated by COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection, and whether it is differentially modulated in children compared to adults. Here, we aimed to compare COVID-19 vaccine-induced functional T cell response between adults and children with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adults (18-45 years; n = 45) and children (5-10 years; n = 51;), who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or remained unvaccinated, and previously infected or not with SARS-CoV-2 were selected from two cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies conducted in Bangladesh. Plasma nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; IFN-γ, perforin and granzyme B secreting T cells were assessed using ELISpot assay. Vaccination in adults without previous infection, induced higher frequencies of IFN-γ and granzyme B secreting T lymphocytes compared to unvaccinated adults, while it increased only IFN-γ expression in vaccinated children. Previous infection increased IFN-γ response in unvaccinated adults only. Unvaccinated children showed higher granzyme B expression compared to adults irrespective of infection status. In vaccinated individuals, prior infection induced perforin expression in both adults and children. Children showed slightly different functional T cell response than adults in response to COVID-19 vaccination and infection. mRNA vaccination provided higher IFN-γ response in both adults and children, but induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in adults only. Future studies may evaluate the impact of other types of COVID-19 vaccines on functional T cell immunity in children to confirm the findings.",

        "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly zoonotic pathogen in Southeast Asia causing severe respiratory and encephalitis symptoms with a high fatality rate. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is crucial for tracking transmission, conducting epidemiological analyses, and understanding NiV's adaptive evolution. WGS is essential for analyzing genomes, particularly in understanding pathogen nature, and pathogenesis and aiding in the development of therapeutics. However, sequencing this highly contagious virus directly from samples is challenging in low- and middle-income countries lacking BSL-4 facilities. This study developed and optimized a culture-independent, high-throughput multiplex PCR-based third-generation sequencing protocol for NiV using the Oxford Nanopore Technology platform and a proposed bioinformatics pipeline to generate consensus genome sequences directly from environmental and clinical specimens. We amplified 12 NiV RT-PCR-positive specimens (11 clinical, one environmental) to produce 60 amplicons, each approximately 400 bp, covering the entire ~18.2 kb genome. Using a two-step reverse transcriptase PCR approach, libraries were prepared with a ligation sequencing kit. Raw sequence data were then analyzed using bioinformatics tools. A minimum of 10,000 total reads per sample provided a nearly complete coverage (>95%) of the NiV genome, even with low virus concentrations (Ct ≤ 32), with an average quality score of 10.2. The WGS of 12 NiV-positive samples achieved coverage between 95.71% (Ct 29.54) and 99.3% (Ct 22.34). The entire process, from RNA extraction to finished sequences, took only 24 h. We developed a portable, culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing workflow suitable for resource-limited settings, aiding in real-time monitoring, outbreak investigation, and detection of new NiV strains and genetic evolution. The development of a culture-independent, high-throughput whole-genome sequencing (WGS) protocol for Nipah virus (NiV) using the Oxford Nanopore MinION technology marks a significant advancement in outbreak response, surveillance, and genomic analysis of NiV. NiV is an RG4 category C pathogen; working with the NiV virus is a deep concern of biosafety and biosecurity. It demands the development of biologically safe procedures to get genetic information. This protocol utilizes biologically safe samples that were collected into recommended lysis solution, multiplex PCR, and third-generation sequencing, effectively addressing challenges in sequencing NiV. This optimized workflow achieved over 95% genome coverage without the need for virus culture. It is a cost-effective, rapid, and efficient approach to the WGS of NiV, making it suitable for resource-limited settings like Bangladesh. The method enhances the capacity for outbreak investigations, epidemiological analyses, and monitoring virus, aiding in detecting emerging strains.

        "abstract": "Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines elicit immunological responses. However, it is difficult to distinguish responses generated after vaccination versus natural infection. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid-specific IgG and RBD specific IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) responses using ELISA in four different groups; (1) COVID-19 patients (n=39) with varying disease severity and (2) COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (n=24, both adenovirus/mRNA based) (3) vaccinated after infection (n=39) and (4) patients experienced breakthrough infection (n=14), in Bangladesh. Both COVID-19 patients and vaccinees developed robust RBD-specific IgG responses. In contrast, nucleocapsid specific IgG responses were found in patients but not in vaccine recipients. A distinct IgG subclass antibody response was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19-vaccinated individuals. Specifically, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated levels of both IgG1 and IgG3, with IgG3 dominating in the early phase of infection (days 1-7) followed by a subsequent increase in IgG1. Conversely, COVID-19 vaccination predominantly induced IgG1 responses without a concurrent rise in IgG3. This effect was more evident when a significant rise of IgG1 but not IgG3 was observed in patients who received COVID-19 vaccines after 90 days of infection. However, following breakthrough infection, we observed an increase in both IgG1 and IgG3. All of these findings collectively indicate that COVID-19 vaccination predominantly induces IgG1, whereas natural infection can elicit responses in both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. The findings highlight RBD-specific IgG3 as well as nucleocapsid IgG as crucial markers for differentiating between vaccination and natural infection and suggest these assays have utility for longitudinal monitoring of vaccinations and for establishing SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection.",

        "title": "Immunogenicity and safety of a measles and rubella-containing vaccine at age 6 and 9 months in Bangladesh: an open-label, randomised trial.",
        "abstract": "The first dose of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine is routinely administered to infants aged 9 months as part of a standard two-dose schedule. However, during large measles outbreaks and in other settings of increased circulation or increased risk, WHO recommends administering a supplementary dose at age 6 months to protect young infants. We aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a first dose of MR vaccine administered to infants aged 6 months and its effect on the immune response to the routine MR vaccine at age 9 months. This open-label, randomised trial enrolled healthy infants aged 6 months in Matlab, Bangladesh, who had never received an MR vaccine dose and had no history of measles or rubella. Using a computer-generated block randomisation scheme, infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two doses of the MR vaccine, one at age 6 months and the second at age 9 months (two-dose group), or one dose at age 9 months (one-dose group). Baseline characteristics were recorded for all enrolled participants at age 6 months. Blood samples were drawn for antibody assays before each vaccination and at final follow up when infants were aged 11 months. The primary outcome was immunogenicity of a first MR vaccine in infants aged 6 months or 9 months and the immunogenicity of a second MR vaccine in infants aged 9 months who received their first MR vaccine at 6 months. Immunogenicity was measured as the proportion of infants who seroconverted in the 12 weeks after vaccination at age 6 months or the 8 weeks after vaccination at age 9 months. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-times increase in IgG concentrations relative to the pre-vaccination concentrations or achieving seroprotective antibody concentrations between study timepoints. The modified intention-to-treat analysis included all infants who received MR vaccines per group assignment and had antibody results at baseline, 9 months, and 11 months. All enrolled infants were included in the safety analysis of the immediate reactions (observed by study staff at the fixed-site clinic in the first 30 min after vaccination), adverse events within 48 h of vaccination among infants in the two-dose group receiving their first MR vaccine at age 6 months, and adverse events observed by study staff or parents at any time during the study. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03071575, and is closed to enrolment. Between March 9, 2017, and March 18, 2018, 620 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two study groups (312 in the two-dose group and 308 in the one-dose group). Of the 301 infants vaccinated at 6 months, 282 seroconverted for measles (94%, 95% CI 90-96), and 283 seroconverted for rubella (94%, 91-96). By 11 months, after receiving a second dose at age 9 months, 297 (cumulative 99%, 95% CI 97-100) infants seroconverted for measles and 297 infants seroconverted for rubella (cumulative 99%, 96-100). Of the 292 infants vaccinated at 9 months only, 291 seroconverted for both antigens by age 11 months (100%, 95% CI 98-100). 123 adverse events were observed; 72 in the two-dose group and 51 in the one-dose group, with no differences in severity (p=0·78) or outcomes (p=0·71) by study group. 12 (17%) events in the two-dose group and seven (14%) in the one-dose group were severe; most events were mild, resolved without sequelae, and were unrelated to the MR vaccine. One death occurred in the one-dose group before the infant received the 9-month dose of the vaccine, and therefore was deemed to be unrelated to the MR vaccine. The data presented support use of MR vaccine at 6 months to protect young infants during measles outbreaks and in settings with increased risk or high transmission. We recommend additional studies to evaluate longer-term immunity based on age at vaccination. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

        "title": "Expanding cholera serosurveillance to vaccinated populations.",
        "abstract": "Mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns targeted at subnational areas with high incidence are central to global cholera elimination efforts. Serological surveillance offers a complementary approach to address gaps in clinical surveillance in these regions. However, similar immune responses from vaccination and infection can lead to overestimates of incidence of infection. To address this, we analyzed antibody dynamics in infected and vaccinated individuals to refine seroincidence estimation strategies for partially vaccinated populations. We tested 757 longitudinal serum samples from confirmed <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1 cases and uninfected contacts in Bangladesh as well as vaccinees from Bangladesh and Haiti, using a multiplex bead assay to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA binding to five cholera-specific antigens. Infection elicited stronger and broader antibody responses than vaccination, with rises in cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) and toxin-coregulated pilus A (TcpA) antibodies uniquely associated with infection. Previously proposed random forest models frequently misclassified vaccinated individuals as recently infected (over 20% at some time points) during the first four months post-vaccination. To address this, we developed new random forest models incorporating vaccinee data, which kept false positive rates among vaccinated (1%) and unvaccinated (4%) individuals low without a significant loss in sensitivity. Simulated serosurveys demonstrated that unbiased seroincidence estimates could be achieved within 21 days of vaccination campaigns by ascertaining vaccination status of participants or applying updated models. These approaches to overcome biases in serological surveillance enable reliable seroincidence estimation even in areas with recent vaccination campaigns enhancing the utility of serological surveillance as an epidemiologic tool in moderate-to-high cholera incidence settings.",

        "abstract": "Hearing impairment in early life can have deleterious effects on speech and language development and so as in communication. As hearing impairment in the infant is an invisible disability, screening is one of the most important methods of early identification. In this study, we screened the hospitalized high-risk neonates to estimate the prevalence of hearing impairment and to identify the risk factors in our settings. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 282 high-risk neonates admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCABU), BIRDEM (Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders) General Hospital-2, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2019 to December 2019. The screening was done by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE); first, by the age of 30 days, and second, two weeks after the first screening. Hearing impairment was confirmed by auditory brain stem response audiometry (ABR), which was performed at the age of three months. The prevalence of hearing impairment was found to be 9.5%. Among them, 7.4% had unilateral (right or left ear) and 2.1% had a bilateral hearing impairment. There was no gender predominance (p=0.92). The most prevalent risk factors were the use of ototoxic drugs (amikacin/ gentamycin ± furosemide) for more than 5 days or multiple courses (n=107, 37.9%) and birth weight less than 1500gm (n=30, 10.6%). The family history of hearing loss (OR=10.924, CI: 1.609-74.150, p= 0.014), craniofacial anomalies involving pinna and ear canal (OR=12.214, CI: 1.294-85.268, p=0.029), Hyperbilirubinemia at a serum level requiring exchange transfusion (OR=8.689, CI: 2.044-36.931, p=0.003) and needing mechanical ventilation for more than 5 days (OR=4.695, CI: 1.075-20.506, p=0.040) were detected as independent risk factors for hearing impairment in these high-risk neonates. The prevalence of hearing impairment among the high-risk neonates was 9.5%. The family history of hearing loss, craniofacial anomalies involving the pinna and ear canal, hyperbilirubinemia at the exchange level, and needing mechanical ventilation for more than 5 days was independent risk factors for hearing impairment in high-risk neonates.",

        "abstract": "Shigellosis is a leading cause of diarrhoea in children globally. We aimed to assess the burden of specific Shigella species and Shigella flexneri serotypes, characterise their clinical syndromes and natural immunity, and evaluate their relevance as causes of diarrhoea and linear growth faltering. In the MAL-ED birth cohort study, children younger than 17 days were enrolled from Nov 3, 2009, to Feb 29, 2012, in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Tanzania, and South Africa and were followed up for 2 years. In this retrospective substudy, we retested Shigella quantitative PCR-positive diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal stool samples with molecular subtyping assays. We estimated the prevalence of specific Shigella species and serotypes, estimated their associations with diarrhoea and clinical characteristics using generalised linear mixed models, estimated their associations with linear growth using linear regression, and used longitudinal infection data to estimate protection due to previous infection using the Andersen and Gill extension of the Cox model. 1715 children (874 [51·0%] male and 841 [49·0%] female) with complete follow-up to 2 years provided 45 835 stool samples collected between age 0 and 2 years. 1294 (75·5%) children had at least one Shigella detection in a non-diarrhoeal or asymptomatic stool and 507 (29·6%) had at least one Shigella-attributed diarrhoea episode. In this substudy, we were able to type 1202 samples. The most common species and serotypes were Shigella sonnei (366 [30·4%] of 1202), S flexneri 2a (250 [20·8%]), and S flexneri 6 (296 [24·6%]). The associations of S flexneri and S sonnei detection with diarrhoea versus asymptomatic control stools were similar. Compared with diarrhoea episodes attributable to S flexneri, those attributable to S sonnei were less likely to be bloody (prevalence ratio 0·36 [95% CI 0·23 to 0·56]) or severe (prevalence ratio 0·58 [0·35 to 0·96]). The associations between asymptomatic Shigella infections and impaired linear growth at age 2 years were stronger for S flexneri than S sonnei (S flexneri length-for-age Z score difference -0·18 [95% CI -0·29 to -0·07] and S sonnei length-for-age Z score difference -0·07 [-0·21 to 0·07]). Examination of longitudinal infections showed that previous S sonnei infection was associated with a lower hazard of subsequent S sonnei diarrhoea (calibrated hazard ratio 0·41 [95% CI 0·19 to 0·90]). Otherwise, evidence for homotypic or heterotypic natural immunity was not apparent. This study provides data on prevailing Shigella species and serotypes in settings with a high burden of disease, underscoring the importance of asymptomatic S flexneri infection on growth impairment and the severity of S flexneri diarrhoea. Upcoming Shigella vaccines might need to induce immune responses that improve upon those produced by natural infection. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "Past studies have documented detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the learning and mental health of preschool- and school-age children. Few studies have examined effects on younger children's development, though this age group is extremely sensitive to economic and health shocks. We assessed the effects of exposure to the pandemic on the cognitive, language, and motor development; behaviour; and growth among toddlers in rural Bangladesh. We estimated average differences between two repeated cross-sectional surveys of children and mothers living in the same villages. The first survey included 20-month-old children in 2019 and 2020 (unexposed group). The second survey took place in a randomly-selected subset of the same villages in 2022 among 20-month-old children, who had experienced pandemic-related lockdowns from approximately mid-gestation through their first year (exposed group). Both surveys used similar inclusion criteria and the same developmental assessments (Bayley's Scales of Infant and Toddler Development), behaviour observations, and field protocols. The exposed group (N = 526) had lower cognitive [Effect size = -0.45 (95% CI = -0.63 to -0.27)] and motor [-0.55 (-0.73 to -0.37)] composite scores, compared to the unexposed group (N = 1344). They were also observed to be less responsive to the examiner [-0.29 (-0.48 to -0.11)], less happy [-0.37 (-0.55 to -0.19)], less vocal [-0.57 (-0.73 to -0.4)] and less cooperative [-0.42 (-0.6 to -0.24)]. The pandemic increased depression among mothers with a primary education or less but not among better educated mothers. Children of less educated mothers also showed larger differences across exposed and unexposed groups in development and behaviour than those with better educated mothers. The COVID-19 pandemic detrimentally affected cognitive and motor skills and behaviour of young children in rural Bangladesh. Disadvantaged young children's development appears to be extremely vulnerable to shocks. Without intervention these deficits will likely lead to later problems in learning and mental health.",

        "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prioritize optimal early childhood development (ECD) for all children, emphasizing the principle of leaving no one behind. Despite this focus, the association between disability and ECD remains largely unknown in low- and middle-income countries. This study aims to investigate the impact of disability on ECD among 3 to 4-year-old children in three South Asian countries. Data from 56,841 children were analyzed, extracted from six rounds of Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan between 2017 and 2020. The outcome variables considered was the early childhood development index (ECDI) and its domains (physical, learning, emotional, and social well-being). Disability status and types of disability considered as the main explanatory variables. The association between explanatory and outcome variables was determined using a multi-level mixed-effect binary logistic regression model, adjusting for potential covariates. Approximately 44% of children in three South Asian countries were not developmentally on track, with prevalence increasing to 58-76% among children with disability. Children with disability exhibited significantly higher odds of not being developmentally on track across all domains compared to those without disability. Country-specific variations were evident, with Nepal consistently showing lower odds than Bangladesh and Pakistan. Likelihoods of poor ECDI and its domains were also observed across types of disability. The findings emphasize that children with disability face challenges in achieving developmental milestones, indicating a long-term burden, such as poor education performance and dropout from school. This poses a risk to the achievement of SDGs related to inclusivity and early childhood development. Implementing inclusive education policies, especially in rural areas, and creating supportive environments for individuals with disability are crucial for addressing these challenges.",

The process of telomere shortening is accelerated in response to stress and is well characterized in adult populations from high-income countries. Prior studies suggest the relationship between stress, shorter TL, and disease risk initiates in early life. Nested within the WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial, we examined associations between parental stressors, including maternal exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), maternal depressive symptoms, and parental perceived stress, and child TL in rural Bangladesh. We measured whole blood relative TL in 660 children at median age 14 months and 702 children at median age 28 months. We estimated mean differences between the 25th and 75th percentile or absence and presence of each exposure using generalized additive models. IPV during pregnancy was associated with more TL attrition between 14 and 28 months (- 0.32 (95% CI - 0.64, - 0.01), p-value 0.05). This association was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Other parental psychosocial stressors were not associated with child TL outcomes at 14 or 28 months of age in rural Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "Global concern exists for workplace violence against healthcare workers (HCWs), especially in low and middle-income nations. This violence includes physical, verbal, or sexual abuse and has a significant impact despite initiatives like Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines. We conducted a study in Kenya to address this issue. We did a cross-sectional survey that collected responses during June 6th to August 9th, 2022, focused on healthcare professionals in Kenya within the global ViSHWaS study. Violence against healthcare professionals in multiple Kenyan counties was analysed, The study reached participants through social media, emails, and other channels using a snowball sampling technique. The survey included 1,458 HCWs, primarily females (66.5%), aged 36-45 (42.4%), and of African race, representing 40 counties, with the majority from Nairobi (28.9%) and working in government academic (35.5%) and private academic institutions (20.6%). Most had over 11 years of healthcare experience (64.4%), and registered nurses were the most common cadre (27.8%). Approximately half of enrolled participants (49.9%) reported experiencing violence, with verbal violence (80.6%) and emotional abuse (78.6%) being common. Online harassment was reported by only 3.5%, mainly on Facebook (63.2%), involving hate speech (92.1%). Patients or their relatives were the most common aggressors (44.7%), while supervisors accounted for 12.5%. The frequency of violence varied, and 80.2% noted an increase after the COVID-19 pandemic. Only 41.2% of incidents were reported. Most were familiar with safety guidelines (93.6%). Self-violence was associated with familiarity with guidelines, concern about violence, preparedness, and night shifts, while colleague violence was associated with age, gender, race, work experience, training, preparedness, and night shifts. Our Kenya-based cross-sectional sub-analysis highlights that a significant number of HCWs experienced violence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected job satisfaction. Although most HCWs were familiar with OSHA guidelines, there were difficulties in their practical implementation.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the stigmatized experiences of vaccinated and non-vaccinated COVID-19 survivors in Bangladesh, emphasizing the factors contributing to stigma, the lived realities of stigmatization, and strategies for mitigating discrimination. Employing a qualitative comparative case study approach, the research draws on interviews with 22 survivors (13 non-vaccinated and 9 vaccinated) conducted during two critical phases of the pandemic: July-August 2020 and October 2022-April 2023. The findings reveal that stigma and discrimination were pervasive, stemming from deep-seated fears of death and infection, exacerbated by public health measures such as lockdowns, public announcements, and the symbolic marking of houses with red flags. Experiences surrounding COVID-19 testing further intensified stigma, influencing how survivors were perceived and treated by others. Notably, non-vaccinated survivors reported a broader spectrum of stigmatizing experiences compared to their vaccinated counterparts, highlighting the differential impact of vaccination status on social experiences. Despite these challenges, survivors identified key strategies for alleviating stigma, including robust social support, strengthened community connectivity, normalized attitudes toward COVID-19, and proactive media engagement. As a result, this study offers valuable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers in Bangladesh, informing the development of effective pandemic management strategies. Additionally, it enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between policy, social perception, and individual experiences in shaping pandemic-related stigma and discrimination, highlighting the critical role of community support and care in addressing these challenges.",

        "title": "Influence of environmental exposures on T follicular helper cell function and implications on immunity: a comparison of Bangladeshi and American children.",
        "abstract": "T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for B cell activation and subsequent antibody production. This functionality is influenced by surface markers such as CD40L, a costimulatory factor which promotes B cell activation, and CD57, which is a well-known marker of senescence. This study examined age-specific differences in Tfh cell function in Bangladeshi and American children. At age two, Bangladeshi children displayed impaired CD40L upregulation and significant CD57 downregulation upon stimulation. These patterns, not observed in American children of the same age, suggested an exhaustion-like phenotype potentially driven by environmental factors. Random forest and generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling was used to analyze predictors of Tfh cell response to stimulation. Days since the last antibiotic treatment, total antibiotic treatments, diarrheal episodes, and malnutrition were identified as variables that significantly impacted the Tfh response to stimuli. To assess Tfh cell ability to promote antibody responses, we correlated Tfh functionality with antibody concentration post-vaccination and in response to infection with <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, an endemic apicomplexan parasite. Increased CD40L expression upon stimulation correlated positively with anti-Poliovirus type 2/3 neutralizing antibody and anti-Cp17 (a <i>Cryptosporidium</i> sporozoite antigen) IgA concentrations. In contrast, increased CD57 expression was significantly correlated with decreased anti-Cp17 IgA. This indicates that an activation-supportive phenotype (CD40L+) may be more effective in promoting immunity than a senescent phenotype (CD57+). Together, these findings suggest that early-life environmental exposures may program Tfh cell functionality, impacting immune response potential in settings with high pathogen exposure. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are upstream mediators that shape the humoral immune response to specific antigens. The generation of an effective memory response to infection is vital to prevent subsequent reinfections. However, in areas with high burdens of exposure to infections, such as the urban community from Bangladesh studied here, children are consistently exposed to inflammatory pathogens. Specific environmental exposures significantly influenced Tfh cell activation and senescence phenotypes. Additionally, Tfh cell responses correlated with antibody concentrations following vaccination or infection, indicating that environmental factors may play a critical role in shaping effective immunity in early childhood.",

        "title": "Clinical characterisation, treatment outcomes, and case fatality risk of patients with different SARS-CoV-2 variants in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves. We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves. Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99). Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Union Parishads (UPs) launched Emergency Food Assistance Programmes (EFAPs) in Bangladesh to address food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its importance, EFAP had resource shortages, logistical barriers, and potential gaps in coverage. This study evaluates the critical factors of EFAP's contribution to food insecurity, including governance practices, political dynamics, and operational capabilities. A cross-sectional survey and mixed- method analysis was performed, encompassing beneficiaries and officials, to examine the distribution process, governance frameworks, and the significance of political neutrality. The findings reveal that governance_EFAP (β= 0.080, p < 0.05), distributive__EFAP (β = 0.084, p < 0.05), and crisisMgt_EFAP (β= 0.30, p < 0.05) significantly enhance EFAP effectiveness, while political bias negatively affects impartiality and efficiency. Political neutrality (pol_neu) (R² = 0.88) mediates the relationship between equity in distribution and the effectiveness of EFAPs. The study is innovative in examining how political neutrality mediates the success of EFAPs during the COVID-19 epidemic, notably UPs in Bangladesh. It provides unique insights into governance, equity, political dynamics, and evidence-based disaster relief distribution suggestions for local governments, international development organizations, and humanitarian agencies. The study suggests capacity-building for UP officials, accountability, and political neutrality in aid distribution to improve governance frameworks are crucial for addressing food insecurity in future crisis response. With its cross-sectional approach, this research cannot assess EFAPs' long-term effects. Its application may be limited because it solely examines UP governance. Longitudinal research across various administrative settings among multiple countries could determine the efficacy of the EFAP.",

Vaccine development against Nipah faces challenges due to its current epidemiology with limited outbreak sizes, which impedes the feasibility of conducting vaccine efficacy trials focused on disease endpoints. We review the progress of Nipah vaccine candidates in human clinical trials and highlight the challenges in evaluating the vaccine efficacy due to the sporadic nature of Nipah outbreaks, given the epidemic potential of Nipah virus and its implications for pandemic preparedness. We examine the alternative regulatory pathways, including the US FDA's Animal Rule and EMA's conditional marketing authorization, which permit vaccine approval based on surrogate markers rather than efficacy data from the large-scale Phase-3 efficacy trials. The need for standardized immune surrogate markers is emphasized, alongside calls for international collaboration to develop such endpoints and manage stockpile strategies. We recommend alignment among vaccine developers, regulators, and global health stakeholders to incentivize Nipah vaccine development and approval through alternative regulatory pathways, as well as ensuring epidemic preparedness via strategic vaccine stockpiling and response through targeted deployment strategies.",

        "abstract": "The resurfaced zoonotic disease, Monkeypox, has become a global public health concern recently. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the current knowledge, willingness to provide service during an outbreak and preparedness about human monkeypox among medical practitioners in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted among registered physicians at the three medical college hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Knowledge about monkeypox was assessed by 20 questions, collected through a self-answered paper-based structured questionnaire. Good knowledge was defined by 70% of correct responses among the asked questions. Willingness and preparedness to treat during the monkeypox outbreak were also assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the predictors of good knowledge of monkeypox infection. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS V.25.0. Out of 385 physicians, two-thirds (63%) were male, and between 31 and 50 years of age (58%). A majority (91.4%) knew monkeypox is transmitted human-to-human, followed by sexual (55.1%) and vertical transmission (34.8%), but only 19.5% were aware of vaccine availability. Overall, about half of the respondents (57%) showed a good knowledge of monkeypox and the remainder (43%) had poor knowledge. Older age, higher education and having a higher job designation were found to be associated with good knowledge. However, only 30.1% expressed willingness to provide care, and just 22.3% believed their hospitals were prepared for a potential outbreak. The present study highlighted that physicians in Bangladesh possess a relatively good level of knowledge, with a lack of practical preparedness and willingness to serve in managing monkeypox cases during an outbreak.",

This cross-sectional nationwide study is a pioneer in assessing knowledge levels of NiV outbreak among the general population in Bangladesh. It was conducted among the general population of Bangladesh from 15th January to 10th February 2024. A conveniently selected sample of individuals participated in the assessment of their knowledge about NiV. A semi-structured questionnaire was used as the data collection tool. After data curation, a total of 2121 responses that met the inclusion criteria were retained for analysis. Among 2121 participants, 69.38 % were aware of NiV. Overall, 62 % demonstrated good knowledge of the virus. The main sources of information were social media (29.9 %), television (25.41 %), educational institutions (18.95 %), newspapers (13.65 %), friends (6.39 %), and workplaces (5.91 %). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that participants aged 31-40 years had lower odds of poor knowledge (OR = 0.57, 95 % CI: 0.39-0.82, p < 0.01) compared to those aged 21-30. Females had higher odds of poor knowledge (OR = 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.05-1.81, p = 0.02) than males. Lower education levels were associated with higher odds of poor knowledge. Moreover, non-healthcare workers also had higher odds of poor knowledge compared to healthcare workers. There were regional differences, with varying odds in Rangpur (OR = 0.43, 95 % CI: 0.26-0.70, p < 0.01), Khulna (OR = 1.70, 95 % CI: 1.10-2.61, p = 0.01), and Mymensingh (OR = 2.77, 95 % CI: 1.70-4.53, p < 0.01) compared to Dhaka.

We aimed to examine the influence of hepcidin on the effects of supplementation with iron syrup and multiple micronutrient powders (MNPs) on hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations and the incidence of diarrhea in young children. Participants included a subsample of 1281 8-mo-old children enrolled in a 3-arm, double-blind, double-dummy, individually randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of 3 mo of universal supplementation with daily iron syrup (12.5 mg iron), MNPs (containing 12.5 mg iron), or placebo in children living in Bangladesh. In all participants at baseline, immediately postintervention (month 3), and after a further 9 mo of follow-up (month 12), serum hepcidin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, venous hemoglobin by HemoCue 301, and incidence of diarrhea by caregiver report. We used a likelihood-based longitudinal data analysis model to examine effect modification from baseline hepcidin on the effects of iron syrup or MNPs on hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations and a log-binomial model on the incidence of diarrhea at months 3 and 12. Hepcidin modified the effect of MNPs, but not iron syrup, compared with placebo on hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations immediately postintervention. The treatment effect of MNPs compared with placebo in the change from baseline to month 3 was larger among children with low compared with not-low baseline hepcidin [hemoglobin: mean difference 11.6 g/L (7.2, 15.9) compared with 4.3 (3.09, 5.7), P-interaction = 0.002; ferritin: geometric mean ratio 2.4 (1.6, 3.6) compared with 1.5 (1.3, 1.7), P-interaction = 0.024]. This effect modification was not sustained at month 12. Hepcidin did not modify the effects of either intervention on the incidence of diarrhea. Immediate effects of MNPs on child hemoglobin and iron status are larger among those with low compared with not-low hepcidin, indicating that preintervention screening could help identify those who would benefit most from MNPs.

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of biosimilar adalimumab drug Advixa® (Incepta Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to the reference drug Humira® (AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). In this randomized, double-blind, prospective, parallel-group, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial, each of 144 patients was treated with six doses of Advixa® biweekly for up to 12 weeks. In the test group, there were 108 patients, and in the reference group, there were 36 patients. The primary endpoint was the proportion of the patients achieving the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) in response to the treatment. In contrast, ACR50, ACR70, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) response were the secondary endpoints. The safety measurements included monitoring adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), well-being assessment, and clinical laboratory abnormalities. Additionally, the level of anti-adalimumab antibody was assessed as a measure of immunogenicity against the drug. After 12 weeks, the per-protocol (PP) population treated every other week with Advixa® had statistically similar response rates as compared to Humira®: ACR20 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (78.22% vs. 73.53%; P > 0.6), ACR50 ESR (55.45% vs. 52.94%; P > 0.8), ACR70 ESR (29.70% vs. 26.47%; P > 0.8). According to the intention to treat (ITT) population, the response rates were ACR20 (73% vs. 69%; P > 0.6), ACR50 (52% vs. 50%; P > 0.8), and ACR70 (28% vs. 25%; P > 0.8). In every criterion, the response rate for Advixa® was higher than Humira®. Similarly, the changes in DAS28-C-reactive protein (CRP) scores were -2.13 ± 1.43 vs -2.34 ± 1.55 in the PP population group (P > 0.4) and -2 ± 1.39 and -2 ± 1.56 in the ITT population group (P > 0.4) for Advixa® and Humira®, respectively. Six SAEs and 105 non-serious AEs were reported during the study. No significant difference was found between treatment groups for the incidence of SAEs (P > 0.3) and AEs (P > 0.7). There was no significant difference in the absolute value of change of anti-adalimumab antibody titer in the treatment groups from baseline to week 12 (P > 0.2). The comprehensive assessment of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity establishes the non-inferiority of Advixa® to Humira® at a 95% confidence level.",

        "abstract": "Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) remain a significant public health challenge and a neglected disease in many parts of Asia, contributing to morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations. Despite the potential of vaccines to reduce the burden of these neglected IPIs, little is known about the public's willingness to be vaccinated against these infections. This study aimed to assess the general population's knowledge, symptom experiences, and willingness to vaccinate against IPIs across six countries: Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, and China. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between June and December 2023 across six countries in Asia region. Participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire that assessed demographic information, knowledge of IPIs, symptom experiences, and willingness to receive a vaccine against IPIs for themselves and their children. Univariate and multivariable logistic analyses were performed to determine the factors related to vaccination the willingness. A total of 5470 complete responses were received. The highest proportion of individuals willing to receive the vaccine was in India (86.1 %), followed by China (80.8 %) and Pakistan (75 %), with Vietnam having the lowest proportion at 50.1 %. For child vaccination, China had the highest willingness (83.3 %). A higher knowledge score was significantly associated with increased willingness to be vaccinated [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)= 1.91, 95 % CI: 1.70-2.15]. Additionally, a higher symptom experience score was significantly associated with greater vaccination willingness (aOR=1.71, 95 % CI: 1.50-1.94). Females residing in urban-suburban areas showed significantly higher vaccination intentions. The willingness to vaccinate children against IPIs closely mirrored the trends observed in self-vaccination willingness, with knowledge being the only factor significantly associated with the willingness to vaccinate children. The study underscores the importance of enhancing educational efforts regarding neglected IPIs and vaccination, particularly when vaccines are available and recommended.",

        "abstract": "In August 2017, the Rohingya population of northern Rakhine State in Myanmar fled to Bangladesh following \"clearance operations\" by the Myanmar security forces that were characterized by widespread and systematic violence, constituting severe human rights violations. The \"clearance operations\" were preceded by years of consistent denial of the human rights of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. This study examines the impact of these human rights violations on the trauma experiences of Rohingya survivors, their resulting mental health, and the availability and access to post-migration mental health services. Qualitative one-on-one interviews were conducted with 26 health care professionals who cared for Rohingya refugees after their arrival in Bangladesh. Trauma experienced by the Rohingya spanned the period before, during, and following migration and was ongoing at the time of data collection. The impact of Rohingya survivors' concurrent grief and trauma in relation to the violence they experienced in Myanmar as well as during and after their journey to Bangladesh that, at times, exacerbated survivors' trauma presentation. There were limited mental health services available in Bangladesh and additional structural and procedural barriers to care that limited responsiveness to Rohingya survivors' mental health needs. The Rohingya experienced traumatic human rights violations in Myanmar that led to their forced migration to Bangladesh. The Rohingya continued to experience trauma during their forced migration to Bangladesh and were exposed to additional stressors in the post-migration settings in refugee camps, including lack of access to adequate mental health services. These experiences have resulted in a spectrum of stress-and trauma-related symptoms. These findings show the mental health impact of protracted human rights violations on the Rohingya, revealing how trauma is not a singular event but a continuous experience. Detailing the limited mental health infrastructure and structural barriers facing Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, the findings underscore the urgent need for trauma-informed interventions that address the complex psychological consequences of systemic violence and displacement. The findings emphasize the critical importance of holistic mental health support in refugee settings, providing evidence-based recommendations for the public health and humanitarian sector to consider when designing programs to address the mental health and psychosocial support needs of sexual violence survivors living in conditions of displacement.",

The primary focus of this research is to study the potential impact of parental education on under five children death in Bangladesh utilizing a secondary dataset extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2017-18. The total count of deceased children within a family is a non-negative numerical variable. The mean number of under five children death per 100 mothers is found to be 20 with variance of around 27, which indicates the presence of overdispersion. As the response variable exhibits 84.2% zero counts, we have considered three regression models in this research; Poisson model, zero-inflated Poisson model, and zero-inflated negative binomial model. Finally, zero-inflated negative binomial model, exhibiting the lowest AIC value, indicates that both maternal and paternal education have significant protective impact on under five children death. Specifically, greater levels of formal education achieved by the parents are associated with a decreased rate of children death.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty is defined as limited knowledge or lack of predictability about past, present or future events. The COVID-19 pandemic management was significantly impacted by uncertainty, as the gaps between existing information and the necessary knowledge hindered decision-making. Current uncertainty literature primarily focuses on natural disasters, leaving a gap in understanding decision-making under uncertainty in times of public health emergencies. Analysing strategies for making decisions under uncertainty during the pandemic is crucial for future pandemic preparedness. Using a comparative research design, we study the strategies governments used to make decisions under uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data through desk reviews, stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders from government, academia and civil society from six purposefully selected countries: Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Bangladesh, Jordan and the UK. Regardless of political, geographic and economic context, all six countries adopted common strategies to make decisions under three types of uncertainties. Decision-making under epistemic uncertainty involved seeking expert advice and collecting evidence from other countries and international organisations. Decision-making under strategic uncertainty involved coordination, collaboration and communication. Decision-making under institutional uncertainty involved using or adapting pre-existing experiences, structures and relationships and establishing new institutions and processes. We contribute to the theory and practice of public health crisis decision-making by presenting a unified national-level applied decision-making framework for events involving uncertainty. We provide practical guidance for approaches to enhance decision-making in future health crises that could also be used for other emergencies.",

        "abstract": "Fish disease outbreaks caused by bacterial burdens are responsible for decreasing productivity in aquaculture. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms activated in the gonads after infections is pivotal for enhancing husbandry techniques in fish farms, ensuring disease management, and selecting the most resilience phenotype. The present study, with an important commercial species the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), an important commercial species in Europe, examined changes in the miRNome and transcriptome 48 h after an intraperitoneal infection with Vibrio anguillarum. The findings indicate that following infection, testes exhibited more pronounced alterations in both the miRNome and transcriptome. Specifically, males showed approximately 26% more differentially expressed genes in testicular genes compared to females (2,624 vs. 101 DEGs). Additionally, four miRNAs (miR-183-5p, miR-191-3p, miR-451-5p, and miR-724-5p) were significantly expressed post-infection in males, while none were identified in females. Interestingly, upon deep analysis of sexual dimorphic gene modules, a larger number of miRNAs were identified in infected females targeting genes related to the immune system compared to infected males. These results suggest that fish ovaries demonstrate greater resilience in response to infections by suppressing genes related to the immune system through a post-transcriptional mechanism performed by miRNAs. In contrast, testes activate genes related to the immune system and repress genes related to cellular processes to cope with the infection. In particular, the crosstalk between the miRNome and transcriptome in infected males revealed a pivotal gene, namely, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (igfbp), acting as a gene network hub in which miR-192-3p was connected. The current study elucidated the need to comprehend the basic immune regulatory responses associated with miRNAs and gene regulation networks that depend on fish sex. The data reveal the importance of considering sex as a factor in interpreting the immune system in fish to generate efficient protocols to prevent outbreaks in fish farms.",

While the magnitude of claim suppression is difficult to quantify, various reports have identified it as a significant concern. In response, several Canadian jurisdictions, such as Ontario in 2015, introduced legislation addressing claim suppression. This article first discusses the legislative and policy context that influences claim suppression in Ontario, including concerns concerning the scope, interpretation, and enforcement of the law. It then presents qualitative findings from a community-based study with members of the Toronto Bangladeshi immigrant community that documented varied forms of employer claim suppression in precarious work, as well as facilitators of claim suppression within the workers' compensation and health care systems. Our findings and those of other research suggest that the scope of claim suppression is broader than that contemplated by the legislation. Our article proposes recommendations for the conceptualization of claim suppression and for legislation, policies, practices, and interventions that are grounded in workers' lived experiences.",

        "abstract": "This empirical study investigates the relationship between mindfulness and online engagement among Bangladeshi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners during the Covid-19 pandemic. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative data from the Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS) and the Online Student Engagement Scale (OSES) with qualitative data from open-ended responses. A total of 215 university students participated in the study, providing insights into their mindfulness levels and engagement in online learning. Quantitative analyses, including descriptive and regression analyses, revealed no significant correlation between mindfulness and online engagement. Reliability analysis indicated that while the OSES demonstrated acceptable internal consistency for this population, the LMS showed poor reliability across subscales, raising concerns about its validity for Bangladeshi EFL students. Qualitative data were analysed using descriptive phenomenology, which highlighted a shift in students' locus of control during online learning, often manifesting as feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. Participants reported that mindfulness practices did not adequately mitigate pandemic-related stress or support their engagement. The findings suggest that mindfulness alone may not be effective in enhancing student engagement in online EFL contexts within non-Western settings. The study calls for policymakers to prioritise the development of resilient online learning infrastructures, improve internet accessibility, and incorporate culturally sensitive approaches to student well-being in digital education environments.",

        "abstract": "Criteria air pollutant exposure impacts human health through various pathways. Preterm birth (PTB) is one of the major adverse birth outcomes (ABO) associated with such exposure. Although numerous global and regional studies have been conducted on this issue, few have recently investigated the impact of major criteria air pollutant exposure on PTBs in Bangladesh, one of the world's most polluted countries with the highest relative PTB rate. In this study, we retrieved high-resolution criteria air pollution data from recent studies and regionally scaled it to 10 km × 10 km resolution. We incorporated the MERRA-2 model, satellite measurements, and exposure-response modeling to quantify the impacts of CO, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure on PTBs in Bangladesh from 2015 to 2019. We observed the highest all-source CO, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure in 2018 at 272.8 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, 88.2 ppbv, 62.9 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, 20.5 μg/m<sup>3</sup>, and 11.6 ppbv, respectively. These exposures were associated with 0.18 million [95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.08-0.29 million] to 0.20 million [95%CI: 0.08-0.32 million] annual total PTBs among 4.3 million annual total live births, indicating an alarming 4.4-4.9% PTB rate exclusively attributable to the exposure to these five criteria air pollutants. Within these PTB estimates, our study found that combined CO, O<sub>3</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure caused the majority (94.7-95.8%) of the total PTBs, with hotspots in the central and southern regions of Bangladesh. This study provides quantitative evidence of the PTB incidence caused by major criteria air pollutant exposure and discusses the urgency of the targeted reduction of pollutants as well as source control to reduce the risks of PTBs, which is critical for the overall well-being of the overpopulated and underrepresented women and children of Bangladesh.",

With no vaccine or curative treatment available, and fatality rates as high as 94% in past outbreaks, the Nipah virus is a critical concern for health authorities worldwide. Transmitted primarily through contact with fruit bats or consumption of contaminated food, as well as direct human-to-human transmission, NiV remains a highly lethal and unpredictable pathogen. The World Health Organization has classified Nipah as a priority pathogen due to its alarming potential to cause widespread outbreaks and even trigger the next pandemic. Recent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh, occurring with seasonal regularity, have once again exposed the vulnerability of public health systems in containing this virus. This study explores the epidemiology, ecological factors driving transmission, and the public health response to NiV, emphasizing the role of zoonotic spillovers in pandemic preparedness. As the global community grapples with an increasing number of emerging infectious diseases, the Nipah virus stands as a stark reminder of the importance of coordinated surveillance, rapid containment measures, and the urgent development of novel strategies to mitigate the impact of this re-emerging threat.",

        "abstract": "White mold, caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> (Lib.) de Bary, is a significant biotic stress impacting horticultural and field crops worldwide. This disease causes plants to wilt and ultimately die, resulting in considerable yield losses. This monocyclic disease progresses through a single infection cycle involving basal infections from myceliogenically germinated sclerotia or aerial infections initiated by ascospores from carpogenically germinated sclerotia. The pathogen has a homothallic mating system with a weak population structure. Relatively cool temperatures and extended wetness are typical conditions for spreading the disease. Each stage of infection triggers a cascade of molecular and physiological events that underpin defense responses against <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>. Molecular markers can help rapid diagnosis of this disease in plants. Effective management strategies encompass altering the crop microclimate, applying fungicides, reducing inoculum sources, and developing resistant plant varieties. Integrated approaches combining those strategies often yield the best results. This review discusses the latest insights into the biology, epidemiology, infection mechanisms, and early detection of white mold. This review also aims to provide comprehensive guidelines for sustainable management of this destructive disease while reducing the use of excessive pesticides in crop fields.",

        "abstract": "Physical function in RA is largely influenced by multiple clinical factors, however, there is a growing body of evidence that psychological state and other comorbidities also play an essential role. Using data obtained in the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases study, an international self-reported e-survey, we aimed to explore the predictive ability of sociodemographic and clinical variables on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Short Form 10a (PROMIS PF-10a) in RA and to investigate variation in disease activity and functional outcomes based on country-level socio-economic parameters. Patient demographics, disease characteristics including current symptom status, functional status and treatment variables, as well as income level of the country of residence, were extracted from survey responses. PROMIS PF-10a scores were compared across country income levels. The influence of extracted variables on reversed PROMIS PF-10a scores were investigated using negative binomial univariable- and multivariable regression. A total of 1342 RA patients were included in this analysis. In the optimised parsimonious predictive model for reversed PROMIS PF-10a, older age, female gender, disease duration, fatigue and pain levels were independently associated with worse physical function, whereas Asian ethnicity, higher overall physical health ratings, ability to carry out everyday activities and residing in a country with an upper-middle or high-income level were independently associated with better physical function. Our study highlights that clinical factors remain strong predictors of physical function in RA, irrespective of individual and country-level socio-economic differences. Interestingly, high country-level income was associated with better physical function, irrespective of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors.",

        "abstract": "Human rhinovirus C (HRV-C) is a significant contributor to respiratory tract infections in children and is implicated in asthma exacerbations across all age groups. Despite its impact, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for HRV-C. Here, we present a novel approach to address this gap by employing immunoinformatics techniques for the design of a multi-epitope-based vaccine against HRV-C. The sequences of the chosen structural proteins VP1 and VP2, along with the non-structural protein 2C of HRV-C, were downloaded in FASTA format from the NCBI server for further analysis. Through an exhaustive analysis of HRV-C genomic sequences, we identified highly conserved immunogenic regions capable of eliciting a protective immune response. Leveraging advanced immunoinformatics tools, we predicted epitopes for B-cells, Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and Helper T lymphocytes, ensuring broad coverage across different HRV-C strains. The vaccine candidate was constructed by integrating selected antigens with immunogenic epitopes and adjuvants, employing optimal linkers. Three vaccine constructs were developed, with V2 being the most promising, consisting of 480 amino acids residues. V2 exhibited strong antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and solubility, with a solubility score greater than 0.550, and demonstrated excellent structural stability, with 91.9% of residues in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot. Molecular dynamics and simulation studies revealed a stable Vaccine-TLR8 complex, with a binding energy of -296.15 and consistent RMSD values. Furthermore, in silico cloning and sequence optimization ensured efficient expression in <i>E. coli</i>, with a Codon Adaptation Index of 0.99 and GC content of 54.58%. The minimum free energy of the RNA secondary structure was -494.90 kcal/mol. While our findings suggest the potential effectiveness of the designed vaccine candidate against HRV-C, further <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> investigations are warranted to validate its safety and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the prevalence and correlates of anxiety-induced sleep disturbance (AISD) in Paraguayan adolescents through sex-stratified analysis. This study used the cross-sectional data from Paraguay's 2017 Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS). A total of 3149 in-school adolescents (12-17 years; 51.2 % female) were included in the final analysis. Anxiety-induced sleep disturbance (AISD) was evaluated using the survey question: \"During the past 12 months, how often have you been so anxious about something that you could not sleep at night?\" Participants could respond on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always). For analysis, responses were categorized as follows: \"never/rarely/occasionally\" indicated no AISD, while \"often/always\" indicated the presence of AISD. Age-adjusted univariate and multiple logistic analyses were used to determine the correlates of AISD. Regression analysis findings were presented using adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), with a p-value <0.05. The overall prevalence of AISD was 9.5 % among the respondents, significantly higher in girls (12 %) than boys (6.7 %). Loneliness, suicidal ideation, not attending physical education classes, and sitting activities were significantly associated with respondents' AISD. In both sexes, those with loneliness and those who had suicidal ideation were more likely to suffer from AISD than their counterparts. Among girls, those who did not attend physical education class and those who engaged in sedentary activities for three hours or more had significantly higher odds of AISD than boys. This study found differences in patterns of significant associations between risk factors of AISD for boys and girls. Therefore, different sex-based strategies are recommended to reduce the prevalence of AISD among adolescents in Paraguay.",

        "abstract": "The BioFire FilmArray® Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel, a widely used diagnostic tool, is designed to detect the genetic material of 22 common pathogens responsible for gastroenteritis, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. It can detect human adenovirus (HAdV) species F, particularly serotypes F40 and F41, which are the major causes of diarrhea and mortality in children. However, its potential shortcomings in detecting other HAdV species limit its effectiveness in broader HAdV detection in clinical settings and outbreak investigations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the GI Panel to detect three clades of HAdV-F41 and other HAdV species (viz., A31, B3, C1, C2, C5, C2/6, and D56) in Japan. Eighteen stool samples were analyzed, five of which contained HAdV-F41, and 13 contained other HAdV species, as confirmed via PCR and sequencing. Although the GI Panel reliably detected all clades of HAdV-F41, it failed to detect any other species, highlighting its limited diagnostic utility beyond F40/41 serotypes. Considering the high false-negative rate for non-F40/41 species, integrating complementary diagnostic methods such as PCR is crucial for comprehensive HAdV detection. These findings underscore the limitations of the GI Panel in detecting non-F40/41 species, such as HAdV-C (commonly associated with pediatric gastroenteritis) and other species that are important in immunocompromised patients. Complementary diagnostic methods, such as PCR or immunochromatographic assays, are essential to ensure accurate HAdV detection, especially in vulnerable populations.",

This study examines correlates of HPV vaccine adoption in Dhaka Division, the largest division in Bangladesh. The 18-day vaccination campaign was accompanied by multimedia messages. We use the Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) as the theoretical framework for our analysis. Using a survey instrument based on the FBM, we analyze cross-sectional data collected from 611 caregivers of girls aged 9-17 in Dhaka. Survey data was collected in November and December 2023. Caregivers were recruited via Facebook and Instagram ads and interviewed through the Facebook Messenger App. About one-third of caregivers reported that their child had been vaccinated. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to assess the relationships between the caregivers' motivation, ability, exposure to the campaign and their child's vaccination status. Adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression analyses, suggest that caregivers' motivation, ability, and exposure to the multimedia campaign contributed to vaccine uptake. Caregivers' motivation to get their child vaccinated was high (74%) but their ability was low (20%). Exposure to campaign messages had a dose-response relationship with vaccine adoption. However, 48% of caregivers remained unexposed to the multimedia campaign. We discuss challenges that the government's HPV vaccination program is likely to face and identify program-related research questions that are important to answer for the success of future vaccination efforts.",

The emergence of a new strain in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its identification with neighboring countries led to the declaration of a public health emergency in 2024. The objective is to focus on the recent outbreak that led to its declaration as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, assess the significant global public health threat posed by the newly identified class, and explore effective strategies to address this situation. The present review searched information from databases (PubMed and Scopus), WHO, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The search methods followed database-specific criteria. Key terms included mpox, prevalence, public health emergency, treatment, new variant, prevention, and strategy. We reviewed and extracted information from the relevant literature. Mpox has been endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for over a decade, with a consistent annual rise in reported cases. In August 2024, at least 13 African countries have confirmed 2,863 cases and 517 fatalities. The recent emergence and transmission of a new strain, which appears to be predominantly spreading through sexual networks, along with its identification in neighboring countries, raises significant concerns for public health. The emergence of the new clade of mpox represents a critical public health challenge that necessitates immediate and coordinated global response efforts. By addressing the current outbreak comprehensively, we can mitigate its impact and safeguard public health across affected regions.",

        "abstract": "To optimize vaccination strategies, it is useful to detect breakthrough infections and assess vaccine effectiveness in programmatic use. Monitoring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine effectiveness against them is also essential to determine the most effective vaccine options. This study aims to monitor SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and host immune response during the peri-infection period of COVID-19. The study will also assess the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, and associated barriers or motivations among healthcare workers (HCWs). Leveraging an existing HCW cohort in Bangladesh, HCWs will be enrolled from purposively selected health facilities from four different administrative divisions across Bangladesh. We captured cohort data on HCW's demographic information, clinical information, COVID-19 illness, and exposure, and vaccination histories for COVID-19. However, no biological specimens were collected for testing during the first phase of the cohort. In the current study, we plan to follow enrolled HCWs biweekly for suspected COVID-19 illness and capture relevant data including illness outcomes. Respiratory swab samples from symptomatic and a subset of asymptomatic HCWs will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR and positive samples will undergo Sanger sequencing to identify the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). We will also perform Whole Genome Sequencing on a subset of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with low CT values (Ct ≤ 30) to identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. To examine the antibody response, we will collect blood samples from the participants at 12-week intervals for one year. We will use the EUROIMMUN kit and will also perform in-house ELISA to assess host immune factors with Luminex platform. This proposed study will generate useful data on COVID-19 breakthrough infection and the durability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs following vaccination. The findings on booster vaccination intention and uptake will inform government COVID-19 vaccination strategies. Information on circulating and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine performance against those strains will help understand population-level risks of COVID-19 infection. The study will generate data on facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 booster uptake among HCWs which can inform health communication messaging to improve booster acceptance in this population.",

        "abstract": "The resilience of established business strategies has been tested in the wake of recent global supply chain upheavals triggered by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine combat, Hamas-Israel war, and other geopolitical conflicts. Organizations are compelled to integrate sustainable practices into their supply chains to navigate the complexities of the post-COVID-19 era and mitigate the far-reaching consequences of such disruptions. However, exploring supply chain imperatives from sustainability dimensions still remains underexplored, presenting a significant research gap, particularly in the fashion retail sector. In response, this study aims to pioneer an innovative approach by amalgamating Pareto analysis, Bayes theorem, and the Best-Worst Method to evaluate sustainability imperatives comprehensively. Focusing on emerging economies like Bangladesh and its fashion retail industry, this methodology synthesizes insights from literature reviews, expert feedback, and Pareto analysis to curate a definitive set of influential imperatives. Finally, the Bayesian Best-Worst Method is applied to examine them. The results reveal the availability of government support schemes to promote sustainability, developing strategic supply chain interventions to ameliorate the impact of disruptive events, and digitalizing the supply chain as the most monumental imperatives under economic, social, and environmental perspectives, respectively. The study's innovative methodology and its implications for sustainable supply chain management offer valuable insights for both academic research and practical application, presenting a strategic blueprint for the fashion retail industry to navigate and thrive in the post-COVID-19 era. This work can not only advance the theoretical understanding of supply chain sustainability but also provide actionable guidance for industry leaders in developing robust, resilient, and sustainable supply chain strategies.",

        "abstract": "Rapid human movement plays a crucial role in the spatial dissemination of the dengue virus. Nevertheless, robust quantification of this relationship using both spatial and temporal models remains necessary. This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue transmission under various human movement contexts. We obtained district-wise aggregated dengue incidence data from the Management Information System, Directorate General of Health Services of Bangladesh. The stringency index (SI), along with eight individual policy measures (from the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker database) and six mobility indices (as measured by Google's Community Mobility Reports) were obtained as human movement indicators. A multi-step correlative modelling approach, including various spatial and temporal models, was utilized to explore the associations of dengue incidence with the SI, fourteen human movement indices and the Eid festival. The global Moran's I indicated significant spatial autocorrelation in dengue incidence during the pre-pandemic (Moran's I: 0.14, P < 0.05) and post-pandemic periods (Moran's I: 0.42, P < 0.01), while the pandemic period (2020-2022) showed weaker, non-significant spatial clustering (Moran's I: 0.07, P > 0.05). Following the pandemic, we identified the emergence of new dengue hotspots. We found a strong negative relationship between monthly dengue incidence and the SI (r<sub>spearman</sub>: - 0.62, P < 0.01). Through the selection of an optimal Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, we observed that the closure of public transport (β = - 1.66, P < 0.10) and restrictions on internal movement (β = - 2.13, P < 0.10) were associated with the reduction of dengue incidence. Additionally, observed cases were substantially lower than predicted cases during the period from 2020 to 2022. By utilising additional time-series models, we were able to identify in 2023 a rise in dengue incidence associated with the Eid festival intervention, even after adjusting for important climate variables. Overall, rapid human movement was found to be associated with increased dengue transmission in Bangladesh. Consequently, the implemention of effective mosquito control interventions prior to large festival periods is necessary for preventing the spread of the disease nationwide. We emphasize the necessity for developing advanced surveillance and monitoring networks to track real-time human movement patterns and dengue incidence.",

        "abstract": "Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) that are ten-valent (PCV10) and 13-valent (PCV13) became available in 2010. We evaluated their global impact on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in all ages. Serotype-specific IPD cases and population denominators were obtained directly from surveillance sites using PCV10 or PCV13 in their national immunisation programmes and with a primary series uptake of at least 50%. Annual incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated comparing the incidence before any PCV with each year post-PCV10 or post-PCV13 introduction using Bayesian multi-level, mixed-effects Poisson regressions, by site and age group. All site-weighted average IRRs were estimated using linear mixed-effects regression, stratified by product and previous seven-valent PCV (PCV7) effect (none, moderate, or substantial). Analyses included 32 PCV13 sites (488 758 cases) and 15 PCV10 sites (46 386 cases) in 30 countries, primarily high income (39 sites), using booster dose schedules (41 sites). By 6 years after PCV10 or PCV13 introduction, IPD due to PCV10-type serotypes and PCV10-related serotype 6A declined substantially for both products (age <5 years: 83-99% decline; ≥65 years: 54-96% decline). PCV7-related serotype 19A increases before PCV10 or PCV13 introduction were reversed at PCV13 sites (age <5 years: 61-79% decline relative to before any PCV; age ≥65 years: 7-26% decline) but increased at PCV10 sites (age <5 years: 1·6-2·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 3·6-4·9-fold). Serotype 3 IRRs had no consistent trends for either product or age group. Non-PCV13-type IPD increased similarly for both products (age <5 years: 2·3-3·3-fold; age ≥65 years: 1·7-2·3-fold). Despite different serotype 19A trends, all-serotype IPD declined similarly between products among children younger than 5 years (58-74%); among adults aged 65 years or older, declines were greater at PCV13 (25-29%) than PCV10 (4-14%) sites, but other differences between sites precluded attribution to product. Long-term use of PCV10 or PCV13 reduced IPD substantially in young children and more moderately in older ages. Non-vaccine-type serotypes increased approximately two-fold to three-fold by 6 years after introduction of PCV10 or PCV13. Continuing serotype 19A increases at PCV10 sites and declines at PCV13 sites suggest that PCV13 use would further reduce IPD at PCV10 sites.

Patients typically develop rapidly progressive weakness and sensory deficits that can result in complete paralysis requiring mechanical ventilation. GBS is usually a monophasic disease in which an aberrant immune response to an infection or other trigger damages the peripheral nerves. For example, in patients with preceding Campylobacter jejuni infection, molecular mimicry causes a cross-reactive antibody response to nerve gangliosides. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, supported by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nerve conduction studies. Effective treatments include plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulins. However, ~20% of patients who received treatment are unable to walk after 6 months and ~5% die as a consequence of GBS. Important knowledge gaps in GBS include its pathogenesis, especially after viral infections. In addition, there is a lack of specific biomarkers to improve the diagnosis, monitor the disease activity, and predict the clinical course and outcome of GBS. Major challenges for the future include finding more effective and personalized treatments, which are affordable in low-income and middle-income countries, and preparation for outbreaks of infections as potential triggers for GBS.",

        "abstract": "The limited but recurrent outbreaks of the zoonotic Nipah virus (NiV) infection in humans, its high fatality rate, and the potential virus transmission from human to human make NiV a concerning threat with pandemic potential. There are no licensed vaccines to prevent infection and disease. A recombinant Hendra virus soluble G glycoprotein vaccine (HeV-sG-V) candidate was recently tested in a Phase I clinical trial. Because NiV outbreaks are sporadic, and with a few cases, licensing will likely require an alternate regulatory licensing pathway. Therefore, determining a reliable vaccine correlate of protection (CoP) will be critical. We assessed the immune responses elicited by HeV-sG-V in African Green monkeys and its relationship with protection from a NiV challenge. Data revealed values of specific binding and neutralizing antibody titers that predicted survival and allowed us to establish a mechanistic CoP for NiV Bangladesh and Malaysia strains.",

        "abstract": "Significant disparities in group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization and neonatal disease rates have been documented across different geographic regions. For example, Bangladesh reports notably lower rates as compared with the United Kingdom and Malawi. This study investigates whether this epidemiologic variability correlates with the immune response to GBS in these regions. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of naturally acquired immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against GBS capsular polysaccharide and the Alp protein family were conducted in serum samples from women of childbearing age in the United Kingdom, Bangladesh, and Malawi. The efficacy of these antibodies in clearing vaginal colonization or protecting newborns from GBS infection was assessed with humanized mouse models. Bangladeshi women displayed the highest diversity in serotype distribution, with elevated IgG levels in the serum against GBS capsular polysaccharides Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V, as well as Alp family proteins. In contrast, Malawian sera demonstrated the weakest antibody response. Bangladeshi sera also showed heightened IgG-mediated complement deposition, opsonophagocytic killing, and neonatal Fc receptor binding while tested against capsular polysaccharide Ib. In a humanized neonatal Fc receptor mouse model, Bangladeshi sera led to faster clearance of GBS virulent serotype Ib vaginal colonization. Additionally, offspring from dams passively immunized with Bangladeshi sera demonstrated notably increased survival rates. This study demonstrates significant variability in the immune response to GBS across different geographic regions. These findings underscore the importance of understanding GBS-induced immune response in diverse populations, which may significantly affect vaccine efficacy in these regions.",

        "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious transboundary disease prevalent across the Asian continent, affecting both wild and domestic artiodactyls. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the Aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family which is categorized into seven serotypes: C, O, A, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia1. The virus spreads through direct and indirect contact, including semen, meat, fomites, ingestion, and aerosols. FMD has a severe economic impact due to the high morbidity and mortality, especially in young animals. Prevention of the disease relies on vaccination with the prevalent serotype(s) or the slaughter and destruction of affected animals. This review discusses the prevalence of various FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes across Asia, along with the transmission modes, pathogenesis, immune response, and immune suppression by FMDV. Additionally, the review explores FMD diagnosis, prevention, and control strategies, and highlights future opportunities for research aimed at developing strain-specific viral and bacterial combined vaccines.",

        "abstract": "This study examined relations between caregiver feeding behaviours, child dietary diversity and anthropometry at 24 months of age in rural Bangladesh. Twenty-four hours dietary recall, weight and length data were collected on 4733 children. Factor analysis was applied to an 11-item caregiver feeding behaviours scale administered at 24 months, revealing two constructs: responsive/involved (five items) and forceful (six items); each dichotomised to reflect low and high use. Stunting (length-for-age Z-score < -2), wasting (weight-for-length Z-score < -2) and underweight (weight-for-age Z-score < -2) were defined using international growth reference standards. Associations between feeding behaviours, dietary diversity score (DDS, food groups consumed; range 0-7) and anthropometric indicators were examined using multivariable linear or logistic regression models, adjusting for study design, confounders and intervention arm. Mean (SD) age of children in the study was 24.1 (0.3) months. Mean (SD) DDS was 3.7 (1.4), with 55% of children meeting minimum dietary diversity (MDD, DDS ≥ 4). Stunting, wasting and underweight were 40%, 19% and 42%, respectively. Use of high responsive/involved feeding behaviours (reported in 71% of mothers) was associated with higher DDS (0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.001, 0.17) and higher odds of achieving MDD (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.33) but not with anthropometric outcomes. Use of high forceful feeding behaviours (reported in 34% of mothers) was associated with lower DDS (-0.12, 95% CI: -0.21 to 0.04), lower odds of achieving MDD (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.93), and higher odds of underweight (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.56) and wasting (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.81). In Bangladesh, responsive/involved feeding was associated with higher child dietary diversity whereas forceful feeding was associated with lower dietary diversity and undernutrition. Future research is needed to understand causality and test the effect of responsive feeding interventions on the promotion of child growth.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever is a serious public health issue in Bangladesh, where its incidence rises with the monsoon. Meteorological variables are believed to be responsible factors among others. Therefore, this study examines the effects of meteorological variables (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) on dengue incidence in Bangladesh. While previous studies have examined the relationship between dengue and meteorological variables using single model approaches, this study employs advanced econometric techniques to capture dynamic interactions. Furthermore, in the case of Bangladesh, this type of analysis is necessary due to the fact that dengue outbreak become one of the major issues. However, the analysis related to this issue is not available. For estimation purposes, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, Granger causality tests, Impulse Response Function (IRF), Variance Decomposition (VDC), and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) are employed. Rainfall has a significant impact on dengue incidence compared to temperature and humidity. The Granger causality test demonstrates that rainfall and dengue incidence are causally related unidirectionally. Rainfall can potentially have a short-term and long-term effect on the incidence of dengue, as per the estimates of the VECM model. These findings will assist policymakers in Bangladesh in developing a dengue fever early warning system depending on climate change. In order to efficiently avoid the spread of dengue in Bangladesh's dengue-endemic urban areas, this study suggests societal monitoring.",

They have a debilitating impact on global health with previous occurrences causing major mortalities worldwide. The adverse outcomes are not limited to health outcomes but ravage the social, economic, and political landscapes. The World Health Organization (WHO) stands at the front of the pandemic response, strategizing to contain and mitigate the impacts on humans and the environment. It also intervenes in regional disease outbreaks that pose a threat to global health through strategic technical guidance, resource allocations, and expert support. With emerging pathogens, and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions are currently underway on global preparedness for a potential future pandemic. The effects of previous pandemics underscore the need to improve global health preparedness for upcoming pandemics. The WHO's July 2024 updated list of emerging pathogens serves as a potential tool to foster global health readiness for a future pandemic. It represents a change in the world's approach to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, shifting focus from specific pathogens to adopting a broader family-focused approach. This new list recognizes the shortcomings of previous lists and adopts a more forward-thinking, proactive, and flexible approach to dealing with familiar and unfamiliar pandemic risks, now incorporating 'Prototype Pathogens' and 'Pathogen X' into its risk classification. The WHO has set the pace, developing tools and guidelines for practice. This updated list of high-priority pathogens seeks to gear research and development toward combating and neutralizing the virulence of these pathogens. Recent outbreaks of Cholera, Mpox, and Dengue fever in Africa, Avian influenza (H5N2) in Mexico, Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh, and Oropouche virus in the Americas necessitate intensifying regional disease surveillance Research organizations and institutions must prioritize incorporating these tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies in the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative as outlined by WHO.",

The research aimed to develop an inactivated IB vaccine using local isolates and assess its immunogenicity compared to other commercial live IB vaccines. An inactivated vaccine using a candidate IB virus (PP067159.1: Alim_IB_1001) of the QX genotype was developed according to WOAH guidelines. Chickens were vaccinated with three doses (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 ml) at 7 days old, with a booster at 37 days old via subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) routes. Blood samples were collected on days 7, 37, and 67 to measure immune response by indirect ELISA. On day 67, chickens were challenged with a virulent IBV strain to assess vaccine protection. The experimental IB vaccine's immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and antibody duration were compared to a live IB vaccine (Live CEVAC<sup>®</sup> IBird) using three vaccination schedules: killed-followed-killed, live-followed-killed, and live-followed-live. Chickens vaccinated with SC with 1.0 ml showed higher antibody titers compared to other SC and IM routes of vaccination. SC vaccination with 0.5 and 1 ml provided the highest protection (93%). The killed-followed-killed vaccination method produced a more consistent and protective level of antibody titers in chickens compared to the other vaccination schedules. The experimental inactivated IB vaccine led to a higher survival rate (93%) compared to live-followed-killed (87%) and live-followed-live (73%), with statistical significance (<i>p < 0.01</i>). All three chicken groups maintained protective antibody titers (>396) at 307 days, but titers declined faster in the live-followed-live and live-followed-killed groups compared to the killed-followed-killed group. The study found that the experimental inactivated IB vaccination can protect commercial-layer chickens from natural IB outbreaks of the QX genotype.",

Beta cell 2 (insulin deficiency) and Lipodystrophy 1 (unfavorable fat distribution) pPSs were most strongly associated with T2D, GDM and younger age at T2D diagnosis. Individuals at high genetic risk of both insulin deficiency and lipodystrophy were diagnosed with T2D 8.2 years earlier with BMI 3 kg m<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup> lower compared to those at low genetic risk. The insulin deficiency pPS was associated with poorer HbA1c response to SGLT2 inhibitors. Insulin deficiency and lipodystrophy pPSs were associated with faster progression to insulin dependence and microvascular complications. South Asians had a greater genetic burden from both of these pPSs than white Europeans in the UK Biobank. In conclusion, genetic predisposition to insulin deficiency and lipodystrophy in British Pakistani and British Bangladeshi individuals is associated with earlier onset of T2D, faster progression to complications, insulin dependence and poorer response to medication.",

        "abstract": "Nipah virus spillovers via consumption of date palm sap in Bangladesh vary substantially between years and have been associated with lower winter temperatures and precipitation. However, the mechanisms driving the interannual variation and the influence of weather remain unexplained. Here we investigated the hypothesis that weather patterns change human sap consumption and explain interannual variation in observed spillovers. We analyzed responses from a nationally representative survey conducted in Bangladesh in 2013-2016 on household date palm sap consumption and weather data for each division of Bangladesh, using logistic regression to examine whether sap consumption is associated with weather variability. We found significant associations of lower minimum temperatures and precipitation with increased household sap consumption during the sap harvesting season. This relationship was largely similar within all months and divisions, and strong associations of temperature (χ2 (1, n = 5,027) = 7.74, p < 0.01) and, independently, precipitation (χ2 = 8.00, p < 0.01) remained strong after accounting for month, location, and annual sap season. Interannual variation in date palm sap consumption in Bangladesh is likely best explained by temperature and precipitation patterns, where colder, drier winter days pose a higher risk for Nipah virus spillover. The knowledge gained in this study may be valuable for targeting timing of future behavioral interventions against consumption of date palm sap in Bangladesh.",

We identified 49 eligible studies reporting 112 critical bleed patients with ITP, including 66 children (median age, 10 years), 36 adults (median age, 41.5 years), and 10 patients with unreported age. Patients received corticosteroids (n = 67), IVIG (n = 49), platelet transfusions (n = 41), TPO-RAs (n = 17), and splenectomy (n = 28) either alone or in combination. Studies reported 29 different treatment combinations, the 5 most common were corticosteroids, platelet transfusion and splenectomy (n = 13), corticosteroids and IVIG (n = 13), or splenectomy alone (n = 13); IVIG alone (n = 11); and corticosteroids, IVIG and TPO-RA (n = 8). Mortality among patients with critical bleeds in ITP was 30.6% for adults and 19.7% for children.

        "abstract": "The August 2024 floods in Bangladesh have precipitated a major public health crisis, significantly elevating the risk of waterborne and vector-borne diseases and exacerbating existing health vulnerabilities. This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",
