        "title": "Global inequities in the survival of extremely preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Despite the associated major morbidities, advances in neonatal care units have improved the survival rates of extremely preterm infants. However, the varying survival rates make it challenging to set policy decisions around the standardization of care. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the global survival rate of extremely preterm infants and to compare it across different income levels and over time during the last two decades. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google, to identify relevant articles. All peer-reviewed studies reported the survival rate of extremely preterm infants (born before 29 weeks' gestation) between January 1<sup>st,</sup> 2000, and June 25th, 2024, were included. Outcomes were compared between Epoch 1 (2000-2015, Millennium Developmental Goals period) and Epoch 2 (2016-2024, Sustainable Developmental Goals period). DerSimonian‒Laird random effects model was fitted to estimate the pooled weighted outcomes. A total of 217 studies involving 917,176 infants were included. Based on published data, 61.4% (95% CI: 58.13-64.81) of extremely preterm infants survived to discharge, and 51.7% (95% CI: 44.25-59.22) of survivors were discharged without major morbidity. Survival rate was significantly lower in low- and middle-income countries (44.3%) compared to high-income countries (69.3%). Among low- and middle-income countries, survival improved from 38% during the epoch 1 to 44.8% during the epoch 2. While in high-income countries it was 69.9% during epoch 1 and 64.2% during epoch 2. These findings are based on reported literature; may not fully reflect outcomes in low-resource settings where data are limited and underreported. Variability in the inclusion and care of borderline viable infants also contributes to the heterogeneity and uncertainty of the estimates. Survival of extremely preterm infants varies widely across settings, with fewer than half surviving in low- and middle-income countries. While some improvement was observed in these regions during the Sustainable Developmental Goals period, comparisons across epochs and regions should be interpreted cautiously due to differences in data availability and population characteristics. These variations underscore the need for context-specific strategies that balance available resources, cultural values, and ethical considerations. Further population-level data, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, are essential to inform equitable global neonatal care policies. PROSPERO (CDR42023447612 (PROSPERO (york.ac.uk)).

        "title": "Is rotavirus aetiology in young children with acute diarrhoea associated with sociodemographic and clinical factors, including rotavirus vaccination status? A secondary cross-sectional analysis of the ABCD trial.",
        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of global child mortality continues to be diarrhoea where rotavirus contributed to about 24% of deaths among all diarrhoeal deaths, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Rotavirus vaccination programmes have contributed to the reduction of mortality from 24% to 19% in rotavirus infections among hospitalised children, but the burden of rotaviral diarrhoea remains high, especially in settings with undernutrition. We aimed to determine the association of rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology with prior vaccination, socioeconomic status and clinical factors in children to see their utility in clinical settings. We analysed secondary data from a multicentre clinical trial on antibiotic impact in children with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We used stored stool samples of 6697 children aged 2-23 months old, presenting to a health facility with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We determined rotavirus aetiology prevalence using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and looked at its association with the patient's rotaviral vaccination status, clinical symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models; if they did not converge, log-Poisson models were used. Rotavirus prevalence of 21.1% was observed. There was a weak and statistically non-significant inverse association between rotavirus vaccination and rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology (adjusted PR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03). Of the five tested clinical symptoms, shorter diarrhoea duration was associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.45). Of the seven tested socioeconomic characteristics, only maternal and paternal secondary education compared with no formal education were associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, PR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00 respectively). Rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology cannot accurately be determined with prior receipt of rotavirus vaccination among children presenting to facilities with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. Short diarrhoea duration and parental secondary education were associated with increased prevalence of rotaviral aetiology; however, their utility in clinical care remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "Small efficacy trials have demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can improve early child development. We evaluated the large-scale delivery of a multicomponent intervention delivered by government health workers throughout a rural subdistrict in northwestern Bangladesh. We evaluated a group-based, multicomponent intervention with a curriculum covering responsive parenting, caregivers' mental health, lead exposure prevention strategies at the household level, water, sanitation, hygiene and nutrition. Group sessions were held throughout a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh (August 2019-March 2020). A longitudinal sample of caregivers (n=517) of children 6-24 months was assessed at baseline and endline (primary cohort), and 1179 additional caregivers were assessed only at endline (supplementary cross-sectional). Outcomes were the variety of child play activities and materials, number of books, caregiver depressive symptoms and nutrition and lead knowledge. For primary analyses, we used difference-in-difference. Over half (n=276, 53%) of the cohort participants attended any of the 16 intervention sessions and of these, 83% (228) attended 2+. Caregivers attending 2+ sessions, compared with ≤1 session, had more play materials (adjusted mean difference: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85) and were more likely to have any children's books (adjusted prevalence difference (aPD): 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.34), to have heard of lead (aPD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.19) or to know how to avoid harm from lead (unadjusted PD: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.17). These findings were similar to those from the supplementary cross-sectional analysis. There were no differences in caregiver depressive symptoms in either analysis. More child play activities and nutrition knowledge were associated with attendance in the cross-sectional sample. A multicomponent child development intervention delivered by government health workers increased the presence of children's toys and books and caregiver knowledge of lead in families who attended two or more sessions. Further adaptation and alternative delivery methods are likely to improve the reach and the breadth of impacts. NCT04111016.",

        "title": "Determinants of inequalities in health care seeking behavior for childhood illness in Bangladesh: a trend analysis.",
        "abstract": "Worldwide, pneumonia and diarrhea are the leading public health problems; they kill more children under five years of age than any other infectious disease. Approximately two-thirds of all deaths occur in 15 developing countries, including Bangladesh. To achieve the targets of childhood mortality, it is essential to reduce the current rate of under-5 mortality. In Bangladesh, healthcare utilization for childhood illnesses has increased in recent years, but not to a desirable level, and disparities among different groups remain a matter of concern. This study explores the determinants contributing to unequal access to healthcare-seeking behavior for childhood illnesses, namely diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), over the last decade and a half. This study extracted data from the latest three Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (2006, 2012-13, and 2019). Children younger than five years with diarrhea and/or ARI 2 weeks prior to the survey were included in the study. The prevalence and association of care-seeking were investigated through a chi-square test and multivariate logistic model applied to identify the determinants of unequal access to healthcare services. Care seeking for diarrhea and symptoms of acute respiratory infections showed a downward trend from 2006 to 2012-13 (30% vs. 18.5%) and an upward trend from 2012 to 13 to 2019 (18.5% vs. 74.6%). Several socioeconomic and demographic factors such as gender, administrative division, children's age, mother's education, household head's education, wealth, and ethnicity were found to have significant associations with care-seeking behavior for children under 5. Gender, division, and age were significant predictors across the three study periods. This study identified some possible determinants of care-seeking behaviors in childhood illnesses. Based on the findings of this research, policymakers should revise the existing policy to increase the utilization rate and reduce inequality in health care seeking for children under the age of 5. Specifically, counseling slum residents provide a provision for subsidizing or providing free health care benefits to the poorest households and enhancing parents' counseling to remove gender bias.",

        "title": "Risk factors of under-five mortality in Tanzania: insights from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2022.",
        "abstract": "Under-five mortality (U5M) is a key indicator and major concern of population health globally, which reflects the quality of maternal and childcare facilities and health services. Despite the significant decline globally, the challenge remains, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, although Tanzania, a lower-middle-income country, is showing notable improvements, yet still needs attention to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Therefore, this study aims to explore the socioeconomic, maternal, child and environmental risk factors of U5M in Tanzania. This study is based on the secondary data extracted from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2022. The data consisting of 10 884 children were analysed through bivariate analysis, spatial analysis and a multilevel logistic regression model. It is observed that U5M was more prevalent in rural areas (adjusted OR (AOR): 1.878, 95% CI: 1.877 to 1.878). Findings also revealed that households that use improved drinking water (AOR: 0.921, 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.921) and are exposed to media (AOR: 0.945, 95% CI: 0.945 to 0.945) have lower odds for U5M. Multiple births (AOR: 5.518, 95% CI: 5.517 to 5.52) increased the odds of U5M, while postnatal care (AOR: 1.878, 95% CI: 1.877 to 1.878) and wealth index (poorer-AOR: 1.908, 95% CI: 1.908 to 1.909; middle-AOR: 1.533, 95% CI: 1.533 to 1.534; richer-AOR: 1.706, 95% CI: 1.705 to 1.706; richest-AOR: 2.950, 95% CI: 2.949 to 2.951) revealed counterintuitive results. It also revealed that minimum dietary diversity (AOR: 0.057, 95% CI: 0.057 to 0.057) reduces the chances of U5M, and the odds of mortality increase with child age. The study highlights the spatial variability and risk factors of U5M in Tanzania. Therefore, it is necessary to address the identified determinants for reducing U5M in Tanzania to achieve the targeted interventions by policymakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve child survival rates and meet the SDGs by 2030.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining an appropriate gap between childbirths is essential for promoting the health of both the mother and the child. This practice lowers the risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Inadequate birth spacing is a multifaceted issue linked to increase infant mortality and has the potential to impact the health and demographic landscape of the nation. This study aims to assess the prevalence of short birth spacing (SBS) in association with demographic and socio-economic factors in India with special reference to maternal and child health. This study investigated SBS in India using a cross-sectional design and data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The analysis included data from 636,699 households, encompassing 724,115 women and 139,660 birth intervals. The primary outcome was SBS, and secondary outcomes included maternal undernutrition, full antenatal care (ANC), low birth weight (LBW), infant mortality, and child mortality. The analysis incorporated demographic and socio-economic variables as explanatory factors for SBS. Data analysis was conducted after checking its normality. The data characteristics were summarised and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In India, SBS is more prevalent (50.8%) with a median of 32 months. Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have shortest spacing (27 months), while Lakshadweep has longest (63.9 months). The Central zone has highest SBS prevalence (53.8%), especially in rural areas (55.9%). SBS is significantly associated with lack of maternal education, younger maternal age, unwanted pregnancies, larger families, and poor wealth index. Additionally, it is found that the explanatory variables have a significant impact on SBS, with area under the curve (AUC) covering 68% to 71% (p < 0.001). Furthermore, SBS has a detrimental effect on maternal and child health as secondary outcomes. This study emphasizes the substantial influence of socio-demographic factors on the practice of SBS. It is crucial to provide educational programs for mothers that focus on the importance of birth spacing and using family planning services. The study highlights the need to implement economic development initiatives within families to address the factors contributing to inadequate birth spacing. These measures enhance maternal and child health and align with the SDGs in India.",

        "abstract": "The Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) Framework has been instrumental in helping countries plan and monitor maternal health services for over 20 years. Given evolving health systems, the changing expectations of both patients and health providers, and the expanded evidence base, the \"Re-Visioning EmONC\" project was initiated to update this framework to better meet countries' needs. To understand the needs of its primary intended users, the project used human-centered design (HCD) to conduct in-depth studies in three countries with extensive experience using the EmONC Framework: Bangladesh, Malawi, and Senegal. The study employed HCD methods to conduct interviews, focus groups, and consultative workshops with 337 participants (e.g., health managers, health providers, and service users) across the three countries. Each country team developed their own themes to explore within the boundaries of the overall Re-Visioning EmONC project's global objectives and developed unique generative activities based on the primary research questions and the category of participants. Multi-stage data analysis was conducted using affinity diagrams and either atlas.ti or Nvivo. Seven key cross-country insights emerged that together can be summarized as follows: when health systems fail, the burden of accessing and providing EmONC shifts to individuals - women, families, and health providers - who must improvise solutions, leading not only to poor quality of care, but also to huge out of pocket expenses, poor wellbeing and a profound mistrust in each other and in the system. The insights informed revisions to the EmONC Framework, including enhanced guidance on context-specific planning, new indicators for facility readiness, incorporation of workforce wellbeing, and increased focus on integrated maternal-newborn care. The HCD approach enabled meaningful integration of user perspectives into the revised EmONC Framework. The revised framework provides a roadmap for strengthening health systems and improving outcomes for women with obstetric complications and small and sick newborns.",

        "abstract": "Evidence regarding the impact of the private health sector on healthcare outcomes is often fragmented. Knowledge gaps remain around the impact of private sector care on health outcomes. This systematic review examines the quality of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) care delivery by private sector providers. The review aims to systematically assess the evidence from studies reporting outcome data on morbidity and mortality among mothers, newborns, and children. Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, EconLit, Excerpta Medica Database, International Bibliography of the Social Science, Popline, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science) and two websites and supplemented with hand-searches and expert recommendations. We conducted the searches and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria using the PRISMA method. For inclusion, studies in low- and middle-income countries must have examined at least one of the following primary outcomes: maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, newborn morbidity, newborn mortality, child morbidity, or child mortality. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted for descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Of the 46 studies included, most studies were conducted in India, Bangladesh, Uganda, and Kenya. Thirty-six studies were quantitative, and over one-third implemented a specific intervention that went beyond the broad delivery of quality care in the private sector. Studies indicated that the outcomes of private sector delivery of MNCH care across health systems were mixed. Studies frequently reported on the utilization of health facilities for the treatment of morbidities. Interventions to improve MNCH care included improved coverage and contracting services, community-based training, and public-private partnerships. Studies often did not provide greater contextual detail, including the complexities and realities of people seeking care across provider types. Future research should disaggregate data on quality of care, as well as describe the methods and specific facility details in their sample.",

        "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) rates are on the rise globally, creating serious public health concern with their increased risk of morbidity and mortality for low-risk pregnancies. The aim of this study is to identify whether re-striking the indications of CS can reduce the rate of unnecessary procedures at a system level, whilst preserving maternal and fetal outcomes. This cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 277 Bangladeshi antenatal patients between 2020 and 2021, evaluating them in two groups: 138 individuals in the intervention group and 139 in the control group. A CS was recommended for any deviation from normal labor progression, with clinical experts providing second opinions and ongoing patient care in the intervention group. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was calculated utilizing bias-corrected multivariable Poisson regression models and adjusting for cluster variation and plausible confounders. We utilized cluster-adjusted samples with identical baseline characteristics among study groups. Re-striking the indication reduces the likelihood of CS (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.82-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The difference in the likelihood of maternal birth canal injury (<i>p</i> = 0.16) and the requirement of maternal resuscitation (<i>p</i> = 0.31) remained similar across the study arms. Although the APGAR score and perinatal mortality were identical across the two clusters, the likelihood of neonatal admission decreased (IRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.02) in re-striking arms. After re-striking, the CS indication rate in the intervention group dropped from 60.1% to 44.2%, resulting in a 15.9% net reduction in CS events. Re-striking the primary indications for cesarean sections is crucial for reducing avoidable deliveries; that is why it should be integrated into hospital policy to benefit patients and the healthcare system.",

        "abstract": "Under-5 mortality in Bangladesh remains a critical indicator of public health and socio-economic development. Traditional methods often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear relationships influencing under-5 mortality. This study leverages advanced machine learning models to more accurately predict under-5 mortality and its key determinants. By enhancing prediction accuracy, the study aims to provide actionable insights for improving child survival outcomes in Bangladesh. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to data from the 2022 Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, LightGBM and Neural Networks. Feature selection was performed using the Boruta algorithm and model performance was evaluated by comparing accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, MCC, Cohen's Kappa and AUROC. The Random Forest (RF) model emerged as the most effective predictive model for under-5 mortality in Bangladesh, surpassing other models in various performance metrics. The RF model delivered impressive results, achieving 98.75% Accuracy, 98.61% Recall, 98.88% Precision, 98.74% F1 Score, 97.5% MCC, 97.5% Cohen's Kappa and an AUROC of 99.79%. These metrics highlight its exceptional predictive accuracy and robustness. Key factors influencing under-5 mortality identified by the model included the number of household members, wealth index, parents' education (both father's and mother's), the number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, birth order and the father's occupation. The Random Forest model excelled in predicting under-5 mortality in Bangladesh identifying key predictors such as household size, wealth, parental education, ANC visits, birth order and father's occupation. These findings underscore the efficacy of machine learning in predicting under-5 mortality and identifying critical determinants these also provide a data-driven foundation for policymakers to design targeted interventions, such as improving access to maternal healthcare, promoting parental education and addressing socio-economic inequalities, ultimately contributing to enhanced child survival outcomes in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Inequities in pediatric health care services persist in Bangladesh, with critical disparities between public and private hospitals, particularly for children younger than 5 years. These disparities hinder progress toward equitable health care access and quality outcomes. To evaluate the availability and quality of health care workforce and service coverage for children younger than 5 years in public and private hospitals in Bangladesh to identify gaps in infrastructure, workforce distribution, and adherence to pediatric care standards. This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 13, 2023, to May 24, 2024. Data collection included facility assessments, structured questionnaires, and direct observations using World Health Organization (WHO)-adapted tools. The study covered both private and public hospitals across 6 subdistricts in Bangladesh, representing a mix of urban and rural populations. Senior hospital staff and administrators were surveyed. Inclusion criteria were general inpatient and outpatient pediatric care delivered in hospitals. Diagnostic centers and specialized facilities were excluded. Availability of pediatric infrastructure, workforce, essential medications, and adherence to clinical guidelines assessed against WHO standards. The primary outcomes included the presence of pediatric-specific departments, neonatal care facilities, and trained personnel and adherence to WHO care standards. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and χ2 tests to highlight disparities. The study sample included 102 private and 7 public hospitals. A significantly higher proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals had pediatric inpatient departments (100% vs 39.2%), newborn wards (100% vs 12.8%), and trained nurses (100% vs 32.4%). Only private hospitals in the sample had neonatal intensive care units (6.9% vs 0%). Pediatricians were available for extended consultations at a greater proportion of public hospitals compared with private hospitals (71.4% vs 26.5%). These findings show substantial disparities in the availability of pediatric health care services between public and private hospitals in Bangladesh. Addressing these disparities through workforce investment and infrastructure improvements is crucial for equitable child health care and better health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired neonatal infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It is unknown to what extent home-based births, which account for nearly a third of deliveries in Bangladesh, may also result in exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We enrolled mothers who delivered at home and their newborns from a rural community in Bangladesh during April-June, 2022. Within 2-7 days after delivery, we collected vaginal and rectal swabs from mothers and rectal swabs from the newborns. Swabs were cultured on chromogenic culture media selective for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL-PB) and carbapenem-resistant bacteria (CRB). Demographic and risk factor data were collected via surveys. Birth attendants who facilitated the deliveries were interviewed regarding infection prevention practices. We performed descriptive analyses to identify potential risk factors associated with colonization. Of the 50 mothers enrolled, the median age was 23 years (range 18 to 26). Thirty-eight (76%) mothers had at least one antenatal care visit. Only one mother reported hospitalization during pregnancy, and 4 reported antibiotic use during pregnancy. Following delivery, 47 (94%) mothers were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 37 (74%) were colonized with CRB. Of the newborns, 36 (72%) were colonized with ESBL-PB, and 27 (54%) were colonized with CRB. No associations were found with any perinatal exposures, though all households reported incomes below the international poverty level. Of the 9 birth attendants were able to be interviewed, 7 (78%) reported performing hand hygiene before delivery, and 8 (89%) reported glove use during the delivery. Attendants reported cleaning equipment shared across deliveries with soap and water and using boiled water for delivery (89%, n=8). Women and newborns in this rural population were frequently colonized with both ESBL-PB and CRB following home deliveries. This demonstrates the importance of community-based antibiotic-resistant bacterial transmission and need for further understanding community exposures driving antibiotic resistance.",

        "abstract": "Multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) in pregnancy reduces risk of infant low birthweight (LBW) and improves other maternal and infant outcomes compared with iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements alone. However, the impact of timing of initiation and adherence on the MMS effectiveness in real-world programs remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a 2-stage individual participant data meta-analysis that included 15 randomized trials (61,204 pregnant women) and assessed whether the relative effect of MMS differed by the following: adherence alone; adherence in combination with gestational age at initiation; and the total number of tablets taken. We also evaluated the observational association of these factors with outcomes among participants who received MMS. Compared with IFA supplements, the relative effect of MMS on the primary outcome of continuous birthweight was greater with higher adherence (P-interaction < 0.05). Among women who took ≥90% of supplements, MMS increased birthweight by 56 g (95% CI: 45, 67 g), whereas among women who took <60% of supplements, there was no difference in birthweight between MMS and IFA supplements [mean difference (MD): 9 g; 95% CI: -17, 35 g). Higher adherence was also associated with greater effect of MMS on LBW and birthweight-for-gestational age centile and women who took more supplements experienced a greater relative impact of MMS on birthweight-for-gestational age centile and small-for-gestational age births (SGA) as compared with IFA supplements. Observational analyses among participants who received MMS showed that ≥90% adherence was associated with increased birthweight (MD: 44 g; 95% CI: 31, 56 g) and lower risk of LBW [relative risk (RR): 0.93 g; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 g] and small-for-gestational age (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.98), whereas <75% adherence was associated with greater risk of stillbirth (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.83) and maternal anemia (RR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.43) than 75%-90% adherence. Programs should invest in strategies that promote early initiation and high adherence to MMS. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022319207.",

        "title": "From parental education to under-5 mortality: how antenatal care and hand hygiene mediate the pathway mechanisms.",
        "abstract": "Reducing the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) to as low as 25/1000 live births globally by 2030 to reach the sustainable development goal (SDG) 3.2.1 appears to be a race against time. Amidst this situation, Bangladesh experienced stagnancy in U5MR at the beginning of the SDG era. While a comprehensive understanding of this stagnancy is crucial, research on stagnancy is scant and limited to investigating the direct effects of the key predictors. Therefore, building on the existing evidence, this research investigated the effect of one of the key predictors, parental education, on under-5 mortality (U5M) mediated through antenatal care (ANC) and the availability of hand washing stations. This study conducted weighted mediation analyses using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data from 2011, 2014 and 2017-18, with sample sizes 4,658, 4,367, and 4,826, respectively, and estimated a generalised structural equation model. The \"nlcom\" post-estimation command of STATA was used to obtain the direct effects (coefficients), which were then multiplied to estimate the indirect effects for the indirect parallel and sequential pathways. The indirect effects were added to obtain the total indirect effect, which was added to the direct effect of education to estimate the total effect of education. This study reveals inconsistent parallel and sequential mediation of parental education's effect across the three surveys. The direct effect of education on U5M reduced over time. The total (parallel and sequential combined) mediated effects of either parent's education on U5M were negative (reduced U5M risk). While the mediated effect of mother's education on U5M was not significant, the mediated effect of father's education was significant in 2011. The total effect of education (direct and indirect combined) on U5M was negative (reduced U5M risk) and significant in 2011. However, the effect reduced over time and changed direction in 2017-18. Since 2011, the effects decreased and changed direction to become positive (increased U5M risk) in 2017-18. Due to the weakening direct effect of education and the opposite nature of the indirect effect, the indirect effect of education appeared to be greater than the total effect in 2014 and 2017-18. In 2011, approximately 50% of the total effect of either parent's education was mediated. However, in 2014 and 2017-18, the proportions were greater than 100%, except for the proportion of the mediated effect of father's education in 2014. This study reports a weakening and inconsistent mediated effect of both parents' education on U5M. Using existing literature, it also justifies that improving the quality of education and ANC could more effectively reduce U5M to achieve SDG 3.2.1. To improve the quality of education, this study recommends updating the school curriculum with a greater emphasis on maternal and child health education. To improve the quality of ANC, it is recommended that the mandatory use of ANC cards be strictly monitored.",

        "abstract": "Early initiation of breastfeeding, defined as breastfeeding within one hour of birth, halves the risk of neonatal mortality, establishing it as a crucial outcome component in various interventions implemented across South Asian countries. However, the overall effect of these interventions remain unexamined. Therefore, this study seeks to address this knowledge gap by evaluating the overall effect of these interventions on maternal early initiation of breastfeeding practice. A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomised controlled trials conducted in South Asia focusing on early initiation of breastfeeding as an outcome variable. The interventions identified were categorized into behavioral, mobile health (mHealth), health system strengthening, and nutritional interventions. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled effect of interventions and effectiveness by intervention categories. Heterogeneity was explored by sub-group and meta-regression analyses. The risk of bias and strength of evidence were assessed by Cochrane's RoB2 assessment tool and GRADE criteria, respectively. We included 22 articles published, representing 19 unique interventions, from a pool of 2,524 screened records for review and narrative synthesis. Among these, 19 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled relative risk (RR) of early initiation of breastfeeding among mothers in the intervention groups, as compared to their counterparts, was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.95; I<sup>2</sup> = 99.56; p < 0.001). Interventions targeted health system strengthening represented stronger effect than other types of interventions. The overall strength of evidence was moderate. The overall intervention effect appeared efficacious in improving maternal early initiation of breastfeeding practice in South Asia, providing valuable insights for policymakers to develop contextually feasible strategies.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh faces one of the highest global burdens of maternal and newborn deaths, primarily caused by hemorrhage and eclampsia/preeclampsia. Despite reducing maternal mortality by 40%, comprehensive medical interventions remain insufficient in health facilities. This study assessed the readiness of sub-district hospitals in Bangladesh to provide Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) and analyzed the association between facility readiness and delivery rates. Using Health Facility Assessment Survey data from 140 hospitals in 2014 and 141 in 2017, facility readiness was measured based on nine signal functions: administering antibiotics, oxytocin, and anticonvulsants; providing blood transfusions; performing cesarean and assisted vaginal deliveries; managing retained placentas and products of conception; and neonatal resuscitation. Donabedian's model guided the analysis. Multiple linear regression examined associations between facility readiness and delivery rates using 2017 data. Between 2014 and 2017, the availability of signal functions such as oxytocin (85% to 95%), anticonvulsants (58% to 63%), and blood transfusions (22% to 38%) improved. In 2014, 77% of facilities had at least 5 signal functions, 49% had 7, and 6% had all 9. By 2017, these increased to 83%, 56%, and 8%, respectively. Despite these improvements, the mean readiness index remained nearly unchanged (0.67 in 2014 vs. 0.69 in 2017). Only 8% of facilities performed fewer than 52 deliveries annually in 2017, while 26% conducted over 500. Regression analysis revealed a significant association between readiness scores and delivery rates (p =  0.009). While certain indicators improved, overall readiness stagnated due to shortages of anesthetists, gynecologists, and essential supplies. With 64% of surveyed sub-district hospitals classified as comprehensive care facilities, resource and staffing investments are crucial to enhance readiness and reduce maternal and newborn mortality.",

A lack of data on the burden of RSV infections and the impact on health systems in resource-limited settings hinders evidence-based policy decisions. Here, we aimed to assess RSV's burden on the health system in Bangladesh. From January to December, 2019, we conducted a prospective study at Bangladesh's largest paediatric hospital among children aged 0-59 months admitted with a possible respiratory infection, as guided by the WHO RSV hospital-based surveillance case definition. Outcomes for RSV-positive children younger than 5 years were analysed. We also followed up outcomes of children denied hospitalisation due to bed shortages. Adjusted hazard ratios for children denied admission versus admitted were estimated using survival analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with a queueing model were used to estimate the effects of RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab on admission denials and mortality. Of 40 664 children admitted, 31 692 were younger than 5 years; 19 940 were in study wards. Among 7191 admitted with possible respiratory infections, 6149 (85·5%) had nasopharyngeal swabs taken, with 1261 (20·5%) testing RSV-positive. The median age of children who tested positive for RSV was 3·0 months (IQR 1·0-8·0), with a median hospital stay of 5 days (IQR 4-8); 24 (1·9%) of 1261 died in hospital. 8274 (5·5%) of 151 110 bed days were for children who were positive for RSV. Additionally, of 9169 children denied admission, outcomes were tracked for 3928 and compared with 2845 admitted. The hazard ratio for death was 1·56 (95% CI 1·34 to 1·81) for children denied versus admitted, being highest for neonates at 2·27 (1·87 to 2·75). RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab could have reduced denials by 677 (95% prediction interval 63 to 1347) and 1289 (684 to 1865), respectively, potentially preventing 130 (-60 to 322) and 258 (32 to 469) deaths.

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether targeting 1-hour PPG (1 hPG) vs 2-hour PPG (2 hPG) altered fetomaternal outcomes in GDM. Studies that compared pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing 1 hPG vs 2 hPG monitoring in GDM were identified through comprehensive search of electronic databases. Primary outcomes analyzed were large-for-gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia. Secondary outcomes included low birthweight (LBW), neonatal intensive-care unit admission, neonatal hypoglycemia, cesarean section (CS), pre-eclampsia, gestational age at delivery, and preterm delivery. Six articles that compared 1 hPG<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) vs 2 hPG <120 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) were analyzed. Additionally, 3 articles that assessed 1 hPG<120 mg/dL vs1 hPG<140 mg/dL were also examined. Targeting 1 hPG<140 mg/dL vs 2 hPG<120 mg/dL significantly lowered the risk of LGA [odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.93; P = .03] but not macrosomia [OR 0.45; 95%CI:0.19-1.06; P = .07]. There was no difference in other parameters such as birthweight [mean difference -61.77g; 95%CI:-152.16-28.62; P = .018], LBW [OR 0.90; 95%CI:0.30-2.68;P = .85], neonatal hypoglycemia [OR 0.60; 95%CI:0.28-1.26; P = .18], gestational age at delivery [mean difference 0.20 weeks; 95%CI:-0.29-0.68; P = .43], CS [OR 0.99; 95%CI:0.46-2.12;P = .97], pre-eclampsia [OR 0.66;95% CI:.22-1.96; P = .46], or need for insulin therapy [OR 1.39; 95%CI:.79-2.43; P = .25]. More intensive 1 hPG target <120 mg/dL vs <140 mg/dl increased the risk of preterm delivery [OR 1.62; 95% CI:1.00-2.62; P = .05], without affecting birthweight, LGA, macrosomia, LBW, and CS. Our findings suggest that targeting 1 hPG <140 mg/dL vs 2 hPG<120 mg/dL lowers the risk of LGA, but does not affect other parameters. A stricter target of 1 hPG<120 mg/dL can increase the risk of preterm delivery. Further studies to corroborate these findings are necessary.",

        "abstract": "Administering antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) to pregnant women at risk of imminent preterm labour improves newborn survival. However, ACS remains substantially underused in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where most preterm births occur globally. Providing ACS in inadequately equipped settings can be harmful. Health facilities must demonstrate readiness to ensure safe and effective ACS use. We aimed to assess ACS utilisation and facility readiness to administer ACS based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. We used data from Service Provision Assessments in nine LMICs. The primary outcome was ACS utilisation, which was defined as having ever provided ACS in a health facility. We assessed the availability of injectable corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) and facility readiness to administer ACS appropriately. To measure readiness, we developed an overall readiness index based on 35 indicators, grouped into four categories based on WHO recommendations. The results were stratified by facility level. Across eight countries with comparable sampling strategies, only a median of 10.7% (range = 6.7-35.2%) of facilities had provided ACS, one-fourth (median = 25.3%; range = 4.6-61.5%) had injectable corticosteroids available at the time of the survey. Significant gaps were observed between corticosteroid availability and ACS use. We found low overall readiness indices, ranging from 8.1% for Bangladesh to 32.9% for Senegal. Across four readiness categories, the readiness index was the lowest for criterion one (i.e. ability to assess gestational age accurately) (7.3%), followed by criterion two (i.e. ability to identify maternal infections) (24.8%), criterion four (i.e. ability to provide adequate preterm newborn care) (31.3%), and criterion three (i.e. ability to provide adequate childbirth care) (32.9%). We proposed a strategy for measuring facility readiness to implement one of the most effective interventions to improve neonatal survival. Countries should operationalise readiness measurement, improve facility readiness to provide ACS appropriately, and encourage ACS uptake in well-equipped facilities.",

        "abstract": "Nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) represents the third most common stroke type with unique etiologies, risk factors, diagnostics, and treatments. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

        "abstract": "Most of the 2.3 million annual neonatal deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis being the leading causes of neonatal mortality. Most neonatal deaths are considered preventable through high-quality clinical care, which includes adherence to clinical care guidelines. To assess adherence to World Health Organization clinical care guidelines for management of perinatal asphyxia and neonatal sepsis and to identify patient-level factors in adherence among neonates who died from these conditions. This cross-sectional study obtained data from December 2015 through October 2023 from the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) catchment areas in 7 low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa) and South Asia (Bangladesh). Participants were neonates who were born alive and were aged 0 to 28 days at the time of death and had either perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. Medical records of neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis determined by postmortem diagnostics. The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines.",

        "title": "Enhancing emergency obstetric care navigation through a 'Welcome Person' model: insights from a health system strengthening initiative in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains critical in Bangladesh, driven by delays in accessing timely care at health care facilities. Globally, a woman dies every two minutes from pregnancy or childbirth, often due to systemic inefficiencies in health care. In Bangladesh, high maternal mortality rates are worsened by overcrowded facilities, limited resources, and complex procedures. The 'three delays' model identifies barriers to care, with the third delay - receiving timely treatment - being a major contributor to maternal deaths. This study aims to generate evidence on how the 'Welcome Person' can improve maternity care at the facility level in Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study from April to December 2022 among pregnant women at three selected health care facilities in Gaibandha District, Bangladesh. We deployed 20 'Welcome Persons' to navigate and assist pregnant women, enhancing maternal health care. The Welcome Persons provided round-the-clock support, guiding mothers from the moment they entered the hospital through their admission, treatment, and any necessary referrals. The Welcome Persons maintained detailed time-stamped records, tracking patient movements and service timelines. In this study of 5260 mothers, 47% presented with complications, with 52% arriving after office hours. The median time from entry to treatment was 15 minutes, with those without complications taking 14 minutes and those with complications 15 minutes. Entry-to-admission took a median of nine minutes, varying by age, with younger patients completing faster. Admission-to-treatment had a median time of six minutes, with severely complicated patients experiencing shorter times. Only 1% completed within five minutes, while 63% finished within 15 minutes. Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs) showed better performance in completing procedures within median times compared to the District Hospital (DH). Future study plans should include measuring maternal and neonatal outcomes as well. This study demonstrates that timely maternal care is achievable by deploying a support person. Using the 'Welcome Person' model to address admission bottlenecks, health care facilities can enhance patient experiences and outcomes. Despite a few limitations, evidence generated from this study can be utilised for scaling up decisions and can contribute to the health policy.",

        "abstract": "To describe the immunization status of children with CP in Vietnam and identify factors associated with vaccine non-uptake in this group. We conducted an active prospective case ascertainment of children with cerebral palsy (CP) attending the National Children's Hospital in Hanoi between June to November 2017, following the model proposed by the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance system in Australia. All children were assessed by trained paediatricians at the hospital and their immunization history was recorded. Data were collected from 765 children with CP (median age = 1.7 years, IQR = 2.7 years). Of these children, 82.7% were fully immunized for their age (compared to 96.4% of the general child population) according to the Vietnamese Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule. A BCG vaccination scar was present in 94.0% of children with CP, and 95.9% of eligible children had received the measles-rubella vaccine as part of the national campaign (compared with 96.0% and 98.2% of the general population respectively). Incomplete vaccination according to the EPI was associated with younger age, living in an earth/sand house, homebirth, low-level maternal education, being diagnosed with CP before the age of three, having bilateral CP, having associated impairments (i.e., epilepsy, intellectual, visual, speech), being at level IV-V on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, and being undernutrition. This is the first study to document the immunization status of children with CP in Vietnam. A large proportion had not received the measles-rubella vaccine and 17.3% were not fully immunized. To increase vaccination coverage, interventions and strategies are required to ensure that all children with CP have equitable access to early diagnosis, immunization, health education programs, outreach programs, and frequent follow-up. Early diagnosis and focused intervention in early life could further improve vaccination coverage in children with CP.",

        "abstract": "Timely initiation and adequate number of antenatal care (ANC) visits are crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of both pregnant women and their unborn children. Despite recent progress, Bangladesh continues to face challenges in achieving sustainable development goal (SDG-3) related to maternal and neonatal health. This study examines the factors contributing to delayed initiation and a low number of ANC visits, while also evaluating the association between the timing and overall number of ANC visits. Nationally representative data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS) conducted in 2007 (n = 3050) and 2017-18 (n = 4544) on women aged 15-49 years. We investigated two binary outcome variables: late ANC, defined as the initiation of ANC visits after 12 weeks of gestation, and low ANC, defined as having less than four ANC visits. Geospatial mapping was employed to visualize spatial patterns, followed by survey-weighted logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with late initiation of ANC and low ANC visit frequency. Additionally, classification tree analysis was utilized to explore interactions between predictors and outcomes. Logistic regression modeling revealed that late ANC was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the odds of having fewer than four ANC visits (AOR: 4.60 [95% CI: 3.69-5.73] in 2007 and AOR: 4.68 [95% CI: 4.00-5.48] in 2017-18). Classification tree analysis further confirmed that late ANC initiation was the most critical predictor of total number of ANC attendance, underscoring the necessity of early ANC initiation to ensure sufficient coverage. Early initiation of ANC is essential for achieving an adequate number of ANC visits. Notably, the same set of sociodemographic factors remained statistically significant predictors in both 2007 and 2017, highlighting the persistent nature of these disparities and underscoring the urgent need for targeted policies and health interventions.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), in comparison to iron and folic acid supplementation (IFA), improves pregnancy outcomes, but less is known about their effect on infant growth. We conducted a systematic review of trials comparing maternal MMS to IFA and assessed the effect on infants' anthropometric outcomes at birth, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo of age. We included trials from a Cochrane review and new studies identified through systematic literature searches in 3 databases. We calculated the pooled effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a generic inverse variance method, with fixed (primary analysis) and random-effects, and assessed subgroup differences. The 19 included trials showed that MMS, compared to IFA, led to significantly greater length and weight from birth to 6 mo, head circumference (HC) from birth to 12 mo, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) through 3 mo. Infants born to pregnant women consuming MMS were longer at birth (mean difference: 0.05 cm; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.08 cm) and had higher length-for-age z-score at birth (0.09; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), 3 mo (0.09; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), and 6 mo (0.04; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07) of age but not thereafter. MMS resulted in significantly higher weight-for-age z-score and HC-for-age z-score until 6 mo and higher weight-for-length z-score and MUAC-for-age z-score until 3 mo. MMS reduced risk of stunting (risk ratio [RR]: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.91), underweight (RR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.90), small HC (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90), and low MUAC (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82, 0.99) at 3 mo and wasting (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.96) at birth. For some outcomes, effects were greater when MMS was continued postpartum and in settings with higher prevalence of low birthweight. Prenatal MMS improves size at birth and subsequent infant growth through 6 mo of age but not thereafter. These results strengthen the evidence on MMS benefits beyond birth outcomes.

        "abstract": "Provision of quality antenatal care (QANC) services and delivery care by skilled health professionals can effectively reduce and manage complications throughout pregnancy and childbirth, leading to better maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The WHO recently updated its recommendation to at least eight antenatal care (ANC) visits. However, little is known about how QANC services and completion of eight or more ANC visits interact with skilled delivery care utilization. This study utilized data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-18, including 4,457 pregnant women aged 15-49 years who had given birth three years preceding the survey. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the study population's characteristics and the proportion of skilled birth attendance (SBA) and facility delivery (FD) in Bangladesh. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were used to determine the strength of association of QANC services and completion of eight or more ANC visits with skilled delivery care utilization. Only one in five women received good QANC services, and one in eight completed eight or more ANC visits. The overall proportions of SBA and FD were 56.74% [95% CI: 55.27-58.20] and 53.85% [52.37-55.32] respectively. Women with eight or more ANC visits had significantly higher odds of utilizing SBA (OR: 2.11 [1.60-2.77]) and FD (OR: 2.19 [1.68-2.85]) compared to those with only 1-3 ANC visits. Likewise, good QANC services were associated with higher odds of SBA (OR: 1.72 [1.38-2.15]) and FD (OR: 1.56 [1.26-1.93]). This study highlights the significant positive association of QANC services and adherence to the WHO-recommended eight or more ANC visits with increased skilled delivery care utilization in Bangladesh. Strengthening policies and programs to enhance the quality and frequency of ANC services can promote skilled delivery care, ensuring safe motherhood and childbirth.",

However, there are gaps in assessing the quality of ANC, leading to the proposal of standards by the World Health Organization. The study aims to examine the impact of quality ANC on delivery services and PNC compliance in Bangladesh using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), providing insights for policymakers to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. This study used data from 2017 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) to investigate the impact of quality antenatal care (qANC) on delivery services and PNC in Bangladesh. The study population included ever-married women aged 15-49 years who had experienced a recent pregnancy. The analysis assessed the relationship between qANC and facility delivery, skilled birth attendant (SBA)-assisted delivery, and PNC services within 48 hours of delivery. The study employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design, and data analysis was conducted using generalized linear models and considered various demographic and socioeconomic factors. Key findings include a low rate of qANC services (18%), with pregnancy-related counseling being the lowest component. About 82% received at least one ANC visit, but only 18.3% received a quality visit. Higher compliance with facility delivery (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.27-1.41), SBA-conducted delivery (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.24-1.35), and PNC services for both mother (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.24-1.35) and child (ARR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.23-1.35) within 48 hours were observed when quality ANC was received. Factors such as completing secondary education, engaging in skilled/unskilled manual labor and higher wealth quintile were associated with better delivery and post-delivery outcomes. Ensuring qANC and expanding PNC service use remain challenging in Bangladesh. Increasing the provision of qANC is crucial, as it is associated with higher adherence to PNC.",

The analysis considered mothers with a most recent child under three years of age at the time of the survey, leading to a total of 4899 women. The response variable of interest is the receipt of PNC from a medically trained provider (MTP) within two days of delivery. It is observed that 52.8% of mothers received PNC from MTP within two days of childbirth. The variables mother's age at birth, birth order, mother's education level, place of residence, wealth index, media exposure, antenatal care (ANC) visits, working status, and region are all found to be significantly associated with PNC seeking behavior. General dominance (GD) analysis was employed to assess variable importance because complete, and conditional dominances rarely occur. GD is the simplest among the three dominances and can be computed without computing the other two by using a simpler subset model structure. Considering the two-stage stratified sampling design, the analysis reveals that ANC visits, family wealth status, and the mother's education level were the three most dominant predictors of PNC visits, explaining approximately 68% of the total variance. The results suggest that policymakers and stakeholders should intensify the existing facilities to increase awareness of taking ANC visits, which would eventually encourage women to take PNC. Additionally, efforts should be made to help economically disadvantaged women overcome the barriers that prevent them from accessing maternal health care. Finally, the government of Bangladesh should stimulate women to complete at least their secondary education.",

        "title": "Identifying determinants of malnutrition in under-five children in Bangladesh: insights from the BDHS-2022 cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Malnutrition remains one of the most pressing global health challenges, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh, where it continues to significantly impact child health and contribute to chronic illness and high child mortality. Despite the potential of machine learning to improve malnutrition predictions, research in this area remains limited in the country. This study utilizes Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 data to identify and quantify key determinants of under-five malnutrition (underweight, wasting, stunting) and evaluates various machine learning models for predicting malnutrition. By addressing a critical gap, this research provides deeper insights into the root causes of malnutrition in Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics were conducted to summarize the key characteristics of the dataset. Boruta algorithm was employed to identify important features related to malnutrition which were then used to evaluate several machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks (NN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), XGBoost (XGBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), in addition to the traditional logistic regression (LR) model. The best-performing model was selected to identify the most important factors contributing to malnutrition. The significance of these variables was further assessed using Feature Importance plot (Based on Gini Importance) and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. Model performance was evaluated through various metrics, including accuracy, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), Cohen's kappa, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and precision. The study examined a cohort of 7,910 children, reporting prevalence rates of 19% for stunting, 8% for wasting, and 17% for underweight. The Boruta algorithm identified 18 confirmed features for stunting, 22 for wasting, and 19 for underweight. For stunting, the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 64.19%, 95% CI of (0.623, 0.666), Cohen's kappa of 0.158, sensitivity of 56.25%, specificity of 66.00%, F1 score of 0.750 and precision of 0.60. In wasting prediction, RF achieved the highest accuracy at 76.68%, 95% CI of (0.743, 0.787), Cohen's kappa of 0.049, sensitivity of 27.22%, specificity of 80.98%, F1 score of 0.865 and precision of 0.810. Similarly, for underweight, RF demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 68.18%, 95% CI of (0.662, 0.703), Cohen's kappa of 0.130, sensitivity of 43.02%, specificity of 73.48%, F1 score of 0.792 and precision of 0.735. Across all malnutrition types, the RF model consistently outperformed traditional logistic regression (LR) and other ML techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other performance metrics. For stunting, key predictors identified in both the Shapley and Gini importance plots included mother's education, father's occupation, place of delivery, wealth index, birth order, and toilet facility; for wasting, significant predictors were antenatal care, unmet family planning, mother's BMI, birth interval, father's occupation, and television ownership; and for underweight, important factors included father's occupation, mother's education, child's age, birth order, wealth index, and place of delivery. This study highlights the effectiveness of Random Forest (RF) in predicting malnutrition outcomes-stunting, wasting, and underweight-using key features identified by the Boruta algorithm. While RF demonstrates moderate performance in predicting stunting and underweight, it shows strong predictive ability for wasting. This underscores RF's potential in guiding targeted interventions for wasting, though further improvements are needed for stunting and underweight predictions. Moreover, the study identifies key contributors for each malnutrition outcome. By pinpointing these determinants, the study provides actionable insights for designing targeted interventions to combat malnutrition more effectively. These findings align with the global development agenda, particularly Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, reinforcing efforts to reduce malnutrition and improve child health outcomes in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Evidence shows that skin-to-skin contact (SSC) enhances children's well-being. More information is needed on the prevalence and determinants of SSC in Bangladesh. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of mothers and their newborns' skin-to-skin contact in Bangladesh. Data extracted from a cross-sectional survey, (Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18), where 5304 (unweighted) women who gave birth in the last 3 years preceding the survey were included in the final analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the determinants of SSC practice. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. The prevalence of SSC practice in Bangladesh was 15.6% (95% CI [14.3, 17.0]). The adjusted regression model showed that the SSC practice was significantly associated with the geographic region, place of delivery, mode of delivery, and number of antenatal care visits. The SSC practice was 50% lower (aOR = 0.5, 95% CI [0.3, 0.8]) in the Rajshahi Division compared to the Dhaka Division. Women who had an institutional delivery had 2 times higher odds (aOR = 2.0, 95% CI [1.6, 2.5]) of SSC practice than women who had experienced a non-institutional delivery. Compared to women who delivered by cesarean section, the odds of SSC practice were 2.1 times higher (aOR = 2.1, 95% CI [1.6, 2.6]) for women who had a normal delivery. Women who completed at least four antenatal visits had 20% higher odds (aOR = 1.2, 95% CI [1.0, 1.4]) of SSC practice than women who completed fewer than four antenatal visits. Given that only approximately one-sixth of the surveyed women are engaged in SSC practice, informal instructional and awareness programs are necessary in Bangladesh to promote the importance and extent of SSC practice.",

        "abstract": "Rapid and reliable diagnostic tests for tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in children remain limited. This study evaluated the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra), an improved version of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), for detecting TBM in children using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Children (0-14 years) presumptive of TBM were enrolled prospectively from three tertiary level hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from December 2019 to January 2022. CSF was tested by Ultra, Xpert, Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) culture, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy. Diagnostic performance was assessed against clinical case definitions, composite microbiological reference standard (CMRS), and L-J culture. Of 187 children, Ultra detected TBM in 23.4% of cases, significantly higher than the 9.1% detected by Xpert (p < 0.001). Compared to the clinical case definition of probable and definite TBM, Ultra exhibited a sensitivity of 88% (44/50), markedly outperforming Xpert (34%, 17/50) and L-J culture (30%, 15/50) (p < 0.001). Against the CMRS, Ultra's sensitivity was 100% (44/44), compared to Xpert (38.6%, 17/44) and L-J culture (34.1%, 15/44) (p < 0.001). AFB microscopy showed very low sensitivity (2.3%, 1/44). Negative predictive values for both clinical case definition and CMRS were higher for Ultra (95.8-100%) than Xpert (80.6-84.1%) and L-J culture (79.7-83.1%) (p < 0.001). Compared to gold standard L-J culture, Ultra's sensitivity (100%, 15/15) was also higher than Xpert (93.3%, 14/15) (p = 0.316), with specificities of 83.1% (143/172) and 98.3% (169/172), respectively. Ultra detected 26 TBM cases missed by other tests, with most (84.6%) in the 'trace detected' category. Due to the high performance, Ultra can be used widely at health care settings of high TB burden countries like Bangladesh for rapid and accurate diagnosis of paediatric TBM using CSF samples.",

        "title": "Comparative study on the factors influencing pre-eclampsia symptoms at different pregnancy stages in Bangladeshi women: urban vs. rural perspectives.",
        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, pre-eclampsia poses a significant concern, evident in the low attendance (37%) for antenatal care (ANC). Despite efforts to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, the latest Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey (BMMS-2016) indicates limited progress. Access to essential maternal and newborn health services, including ANC, remains constrained, highlighting the challenge of translating service coverage into improved outcomes. A research gap on pre-eclampsia symptoms such as severe headache, blurred vision, high blood pressure, and oedema emphasizes the need for targeted interventions for these symptoms early so that we can reduce the prevalence of pre-eclampsia and therefore maternal mortality in Bangladesh. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the risk factors for three stages of pre-eclampsia among Bangladeshi women living in urban and rural areas. The study utilized BMMS-2016 data, employing statistical analyses, including binary logistic regression, to identify associations. It assessed four pre-eclampsia symptoms prevalence across pregnancy stages, considering factors like maternal age, stillborn births, residency, ANC, healthcare facility delivery, education, and children. Logistic regression highlights key associations with pre-eclampsia symptoms. Urban mothers aged 36 + face the highest risk during delivery (AOR = 2) and the lowest in rural areas after delivery (AOR = 1.43). Two or more stillborn births increase the risk in urban delivery by 97%. Complete ANC raises odds, notably in urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.5) and rural post-delivery (AOR = 1.16). Skilled ANC providers elevate risks during all stages, with the highest in urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.54) and lowest after rural delivery (AOR = 1.28). Unskilled ANC associates with symptoms only during pregnancy. Healthcare facility delivery increases odds at all stages, particularly in rural delivery (AOR = 1.74) and urban pregnancy (AOR = 1.26). Multifetal gestation raises urban delivery risk (AOR = 2.11). Rural areas show higher chances during both pregnancy and delivery. Higher education in rural pregnancy and 2 to 3 birth order in urban delivery reduce odds of pre-eclampsia symptoms. Addressing pre-eclampsia symptoms in Bangladesh, especially among urban women, is urgent. Identified risk factors necessitate targeted interventions to enhance ANC and overall maternal health. Advocating findings to policymakers is crucial for effective policies, reducing pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, contributing to lower maternal mortality.",

In phase 1, a ternary composite of Sodium-Acetate-Trihydrate, Glycerol, Paraffin, and water contained in a high-density polyethylene-pouch named 'CWP' was finalised, and an insulating jacket was designed for targeted heat retention. In phase 2, the device's efficacy was evaluated using a mannequin in a controlled setting. The sample size was 81 events. Welch's t-test, ANOVA, and GEE were used to assess any significant differences between successful and failed events. Among 81 events, approximately 93% events of CWP and 98% events of insulating jacket successfully maintained temperature within 36-38°C for 120 minutes. Moreover, ambient temperature, reuse of CWPs, humidity did not have any significant effect on the success rate of the CWP and insulating jacket. Thermal Jacket had achieved and sustained the temperature range of 36-38°C for 2 hours.

        "abstract": "Access to early intervention and rehabilitation services among children with cerebral palsy (CP) remains limited in Bangladesh, which demands an innovative and sustainable service delivery model. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Sustainable Model of Early Intervention and Telerehabilitation for Children With CP (SMART-CP) model compared with usual care in improving access to and utilization of early diagnosis, early intervention, and rehabilitation services in rural Bangladesh. This was a 2-arm cluster randomized clinical trial, with 8 clusters (ie, subdistricts) randomly allocated to the intervention (SMART-CP model) or control arm. The setting was in Sirajganj, Bangladesh, and included children with CP 18 years or younger. Outcomes were measured at 0 and 12 months, and an intention-to-treat analysis was conducted. Data were analyzed from December 2023 to May 2024. The SMART-CP model comprised (1) a rural referral network involving key informants and caregiver peer groups (called mPower or mothers' power), (2) subdistrict level SMART-CP centers, and (3) telerehabilitation services. Children in the intervention arm received weekly goal-directed therapy, mPower group meetings every 2 weeks, and monthly telerehabilitation sessions. The primary outcome was whether a child with CP accessed any form of rehabilitation services, with secondary outcomes analyzed as hypothesis generating. Overall, 968 children with CP (mean [SD] age, 7.9 [4.9] years; 581 male [60.0%]) were enrolled, with 500 in the intervention arm and 468 in the control arm. Between baseline and endline, rehabilitation services uptake significantly increased in the intervention arm (70.2% [351 of 500] vs 99.4% [497 of 500]), compared with the control arm (63.9% [299 of 468] vs 68.2% [319 of 468]; P <.001). Children in the intervention arm were 1.5 times more likely to access rehabilitation than the control arm. Secondary analyses suggested that the intervention arm also facilitated early CP diagnosis (mean [SD] diagnosis time, 2.0 [2.0] years vs 3.8 [3.3] years; Cohen d = -0.7) and initiation of rehabilitation (mean [SD] rehabilitation time, 1.8 [1.8] years vs 3.6 [2.4] years; Cohen d = -0.9). Additionally, higher therapy session counts (mean [SD] session counts, 23.4 [31.7] vs 4.3 [20.8]; Cohen d = 0.7), increased assistive device utilization (20.8% [104 of 500] vs 3.0% [14 of 468]; risk ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.86; P < .001), and lower out-of-pocket expenditure per month (mean [SD] expenditure, $1.5 [$1.6] vs $2.9 [$5.1]; Cohen d = -0.4) were found in the intervention arm. No significant difference in clinical outcomes and mortality rates was observed between the intervention and control groups. Results of this cluster randomized clinical trial reveal that the SMART-CP model improved access to and utilization of early diagnosis and intervention services for children with CP in rural Bangladesh. This model holds promise for global scalability. ANZCTR Trial Identifier: ACTRN12622000396729.",

        "abstract": "Alleviating suffering and preserving dignity are essential components of healthcare. Patients in need of palliative care often require opioid medication to relieve breathlessness and pain. However, a lack of access to essential opioids, particularly morphine, remains a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is notably critical in the humanitarian context. We conducted two case studies to identify the barriers and facilitators of access to opioids, particularly morphine, for palliative care patients in humanitarian settings while exploring humanitarian healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences with opioids. Two case studies were conducted based on two Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) projects which integrated palliative care: advanced HIV care in Patna, Bihar, India, and paediatric and neonatal care in the refugee context in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with key MSF healthcare professionals. Interviews were conducted in English, video- and/or audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed using the grounded theory approach. Several barriers impeding access to and use of essential opioids in palliative care were reported by the participants. These included limited availability, accessibility obstacles, sociocultural challenges such as low awareness and misconceptions, lack of healthcare providers' training on opioid use, and burdensome regulatory processes. Most participants reported that clinical guidelines, familiarity with the use of opioids and interdisciplinary teamwork were important facilitators of opioid prescribing. Participants expressed the urgency for further educational and advocacy initiatives to improve access to essential opioids for patients requiring palliative care. Humanitarian healthcare workers face multiple challenges, leading to inadequate access to essential opioid medication, which undermines effective palliative care delivery. Further training on the use of opioids and strong advocacy efforts led by humanitarian organizations and the medical community are critical to improving access to these essential medicines for the relief of pain and suffering.",

        "abstract": "Several studies are being conducted worldwide to find out the prevalence of Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and any associated risk factors amongst preterm infants with very low birth weight (VLBW), birth weight ≤1500gm and Extreme low birth weight (ELBW) birth weight ≤1200gm. At the SCABU (Special Care Baby Unit) of Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM) General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh a prospective observational study was conducted from October 2016 to March 2017. Newborns with a gestational age of 35 weeks or less at birth and a birth weight of 1500 gm or less admitted at SCABU in BIRDEM General Hospital were the study subjects. The percentage of newborns with ROP were 30.0% (27) amongst screened infants (n=90), where 81.5% (22) were among VLBW and 18.5% (5) were among ELBW infants. Out of them 22.2% (6) had stage I, 37% (10) at stage II, 29.6% (8) at stage III and 11.1% (3) infants had Aggressive Posterior ROP (APROP). It was also found that other than the common causes of developing ROP, frequent blood transfusion and use of mechanical ventilator may be potential risk factors for developing ROP. Comparable rate of ROP was found between the SCABU of BIRDEM to the other Neonatal care units in Bangladesh. Factors other than prematurity and oxygen supplementation were found to play a role in the development of ROP i.e. blood transfusion and mechanical ventilation. Hence ROP screening should be a part of the routine service for premature babies and the threshold for screening should be lowered.",

        "abstract": "Hearing impairment in early life can have deleterious effects on speech and language development and so as in communication. As hearing impairment in the infant is an invisible disability, screening is one of the most important methods of early identification. In this study, we screened the hospitalized high-risk neonates to estimate the prevalence of hearing impairment and to identify the risk factors in our settings. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 282 high-risk neonates admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCABU), BIRDEM (Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders) General Hospital-2, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2019 to December 2019. The screening was done by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE); first, by the age of 30 days, and second, two weeks after the first screening. Hearing impairment was confirmed by auditory brain stem response audiometry (ABR), which was performed at the age of three months. The prevalence of hearing impairment was found to be 9.5%. Among them, 7.4% had unilateral (right or left ear) and 2.1% had a bilateral hearing impairment. There was no gender predominance (p=0.92). The most prevalent risk factors were the use of ototoxic drugs (amikacin/ gentamycin ± furosemide) for more than 5 days or multiple courses (n=107, 37.9%) and birth weight less than 1500gm (n=30, 10.6%). The family history of hearing loss (OR=10.924, CI: 1.609-74.150, p= 0.014), craniofacial anomalies involving pinna and ear canal (OR=12.214, CI: 1.294-85.268, p=0.029), Hyperbilirubinemia at a serum level requiring exchange transfusion (OR=8.689, CI: 2.044-36.931, p=0.003) and needing mechanical ventilation for more than 5 days (OR=4.695, CI: 1.075-20.506, p=0.040) were detected as independent risk factors for hearing impairment in these high-risk neonates. The prevalence of hearing impairment among the high-risk neonates was 9.5%. The family history of hearing loss, craniofacial anomalies involving the pinna and ear canal, hyperbilirubinemia at the exchange level, and needing mechanical ventilation for more than 5 days was independent risk factors for hearing impairment in high-risk neonates.",

        "abstract": "Childhood pneumonia affects an estimated 18% of under-five children in Bangladesh. Urban slum-dwellers face challenges in healthcare-seeking. This study examined the factors influencing the healthcare-seeking for childhood pneumonia among under-two children in urban slums in Bangladesh. The study examined influence of children's characteristics (age, sex, number of ARI/pneumonia symptoms, and duration of symptoms), maternal factors (age, education, and working status), and household characteristics (number of household members, wealth quintile, sex of household heads, age of household heads). The outcome variable was receiving care from a qualified medical provider for childhood pneumonia or pneumonia-like symptoms within 14 days before the collection of surveillance data. The research utilized data from the Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System, which included 155,000 people from five slums in Dhaka and Gazipur City Corporation areas. Overall, 753 out of 4,679 (16%) children under two years of age were included in this study, all of whom had ARI/pneumonia-like symptoms. The mean age of these children was 11.4 months, and 50% were boys. Of them, 350 (46%) sought care from local pharmacies, while 37% sought care from medically trained providers. Logistic regression analyses indicated that children with multiple symptoms (AOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.71-3.14) and illness duration over seven days (AOR: 2.61, 95% CI: 1.51-4.51) had higher odds of receiving care from a medically trained provider. Higher maternal education compared to no formal education, having five or more household members compared to four or fewer, household heads aged 40-49 years compared to those under 25 years, a longer duration of living in the slum (more than 10 years compared to less than five years), and belonging to the richest wealth quintile compared to the poorest were protective factors for care-seeking from qualified providers. Further research is required to understand the context for designing appropriate interventions and comprehensive policies for improved child health regarding ARI/pneumonia-like symptoms.",

A community-based cross-sectional study. Low-income regions of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. 530 children aged 0-23 months and their mothers. Prevailing IYCF practices were assessed against the 17 indicators of IYCF recommended by the WHO/UNICEF in 2021. Modified Poisson regression models were built to explore the relation between socio-demographic variables and each of the selected IYCF indicators (early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF), exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF) and minimum acceptable diet (MAD)). More than two-thirds of the children were reported to follow appropriate breastfeeding practices (EIBF, 70.4% and EBF, 60.9%). Among the complementary feeding indicators, almost half of the children (48.8%) were reported to meet MMF; however, only about 26% of the children reportedly met the MDD with a consequent low prevalence (22.9%) of the composite indicator MAD. More than half (55%) of the children were reported to consume egg and/or flesh food consumption; still, inappropriate dietary practices were observed among 60% had unhealthy food consumption, and 56% had zero vegetable or fruit consumption). Child age was a significant determinant of IYCF practices. The children of mothers with no pregnancy complications exhibited a greater chance of having EIBF (estimate: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.42, p=0.02), MDD (Estimate: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.55, p=0.02), and MAD (estimate: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.77, p=0.03) compared with the children of mothers with pregnancy complications. The children with a mother having secondary or higher education had a higher chance of having MDD (estimate: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.76, p=0.003) and MMF (estimate: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.56, p=0.02) than the children of mothers having primary or no education. Similarly, children from higher-income households had a higher chance of getting MDD (estimate: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.03, p=0.02), and MAD (estimate: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.64, p=0.01) compared with children from lower-income households. IYCF practices among a considerable proportion of children aged 0-23 months in the low-income regions of Dhaka City were found to be suboptimal and predicted by children's age, maternal education and pregnancy complications, and household income.",

The World Health Organization recommends G6PD testing prior to 8AQ-based hypnozoitocidal treatment. We undertook an individual level meta-analysis of the performance of commercially available quantitative point-of-care diagnostics (PoCs) compared with reference spectrophotometry. A systematic literature search (PROSPERO: CRD42022330733) identified 595 articles of which 16 (2.7%) fulfilled pre-defined inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, plus an additional 4 datasets. In total there were 12,678 paired measurements analyzed, 10,446 (82.4%) by STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, RoK, [SDB]), 2,042 (16.1%) by CareStart G6PD Biosensor (AccessBio, USA, [CSA]), 150 (1.2%) by CareStart Biosensor (WellsBio, RoK [CSW]), and 40 (0.3%) by FINDER (Baebies, USA, [FBA]). The pooled sensitivities of the SDB when measuring G6PD activity <30% of normal were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.89) for capillary and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99) for venous blood samples. The corresponding values for measuring <70% G6PD activity were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.67-0.99) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73-0.96), respectively. The pooled specificity of the SDB was high (>96%) for all blood samples and G6PD activity thresholds. Irrespective of the blood samples and thresholds applied, sensitivity of the CSA did not exceed 62%, although specificity remained high at both 30% and 70% thresholds (>88%). Only one study each for CSW and FBA was included. Sensitivities of the CSW were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.14) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89) at the 30% and 70% thresholds, respectively (venous blood samples). Sensitivities of the FBA were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.29-1.00) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.19-0.99) at the 30% and 70% thresholds (venous blood samples). Specificities of the CSW and FBA were consistently high (>90%) at both thresholds. Accuracy of the SDB was higher in females at the 30% cut-off (OR: 3.49, p=0.002) and lower in malaria patients at the 70% cut-off (OR: 0.59, p = 0.005). The SDB performed better than other PoCs. More evidence was available for the performance of the SDB compared to other PoCs, giving higher confidence in its utility in diagnosing G6PD deficiency.",

        "abstract": "Greater efforts are needed to better integrate nutrition services focused on the first 1000 days into health systems. Key constraints to large-scale impact include the scale of coverage, intensity and quality of nutrition services. But there is little understanding to date on what quality comprises in the context of maternal, infant, young child and adolescent nutrition (MIYCAN) services. This qualitative assessment presents findings from five countries (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Ethiopia, and India) where Alive and Thrive (A&T) addressed the quality of MIYCAN services to understand the quality frameworks used, components addressed and factors that can improve the quality of MIYCAN services. The methodology consisted of reviewing programme documents and conducting purposive key informant interviews (n = 30) with A&T country staff and stakeholders involved with MIYCAN service provision supported by A&T technical assistance (TA). Countries used either health-system-level quality assurance (QA), largely systems strengthening, or facility-level continuous quality improvement (QI) that used an iterative process to improve service quality. Joint pilot interventions supported by A&T and respective country governments demonstrated that implementing QA/QI to improve MIYCAN services was feasible. Common QA/QI activities included improving nutrition standards of care, harmonising training materials, changing how services were delivered, altering counselling from didactic to dialogue-oriented and promoting the strategic use of data to address service provision challenges and identify solutions. Factors that facilitated QA/QI included working jointly with the government. The findings suggest that there are common principles that can guide the development of future MIYCAN programmes with similar objectives.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), exacerbated by inappropriate antibiotic use, access to quality antibiotics and weak antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). There is a need to review current evidence on antibiotic use, access, and AMR, in primary care across key countries. This narrative review analyzes publications from 2018 to 2024 regarding access, availability, and use of appropriate antibiotics. There were very few studies focussing on a lack of access to antibiotics in primary care. However, there was considerable evidence of high rates of inappropriate antibiotic use, including Watch antibiotics, typically for minor infections, across studied countries exacerbated by patient demand. The high costs of antibiotics in a number of LMICs impact on their use, resulting in short courses and sharing of antibiotics. This can contribute to AMR alongside the use of substandard and falsified antibiotics. Overall, limited implementation of national action plans, insufficient resources, and knowledge gaps affects sustainable development goals to provide routine access to safe, effective, and appropriate antibiotics. There is a clear need to focus health policy on the optimal use of essential AWaRe antibiotics in primary care settings to reduce AMR in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Despite global efforts to improve vaccination, the coverage of completing basic immunization (BCG, Polio 3, DPT 3, and Measles vaccines) remains unsatisfactory in Somalia. Limited research exists on the determinants influencing immunization among under-5 Somali children, highlighting the novelty of this study. This study aims to identify the coverage and factors influencing the coverage of complete basic immunization among under-5 Somali children. A dataset of 9,290 children was extracted from the Somali Demographic and Health Survey-2020 (SDHS-2020). Vaccination coverage was defined as the proportion of children receiving all four basic vaccinations. The association between coverage and covariates was assessed using chi-square tests, and multivariable logistic regression identified influential determinants. Findings showed that the BCG was influenced by maternal education, place of residence, number of antenatal visits, and highest wealth index. The DPT3 was influenced by birth order (AOR: 0.425; 95% Cl:0.241, 0.750), maternal primary education (AOR: 1.525; 95% Cl: 1.130, 2.059), place of residence (AOR: 2.549; 95% Cl: 1.863, 3.487), number of ANC visit and wealth index; Polio 3 was influenced by the wealth index (1.883; Cl: 95%, 1.283, 2.764) and the number of prenatal care visits (AOR: 1.356; Cl: 95%, 1.043, 1.762) and measles was influenced by mother age (AOR: 3.458; 95%Cl: 1.429, 8.370), place of residence (AOR: 1.630; 95% Cl: 1.280, 2.077), number of ANC visits (AOR: 1.510; 95%, Cl: 1.074, 2.123), child age (AOR: 3.264, 95% Cl: 2.131, 5.001), birth order (AOR: 0.311; 95% Cl: 0.199, 0.486), and wealth index (AOR: 2.079; 95%, 1.496, 2.888). Complete basic vaccination among under-5 Somali children was influenced by maternal education, age, residence, antenatal visits, household wealth, and child characteristics, e.g., place of delivery, size of child at birth, age, and birth order. Policymakers should prioritize interventions that enhance antenatal care attendance and support mothers from socioeconomically disadvantaged households.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal disorders represent a significant public health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where they account for 79% of global neonatal mortality. South Asia, comprising countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, bears a disproportionately high burden, contributing to 38% of the world's neonatal deaths. Despite notable progress, South Asia remains off track in meeting the Sustainable development goals (SDG). This study aims to assess the current burden, trends in neonatal disorders, and forecast mortality rates across South Asian countries, providing insights to guide investment priorities and improve neonatal outcomes. Data for this study were sourced from the Global burden of disease (GBD) 2021 study, which utilizes a Bayesian meta-regression model to estimate mortality, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Spatial maps depicting the age-standardized prevalence rate and age-standardized mortality rate for neonatal disorders in South Asia were generated using QGIS software. Mortality forecasts for the period 2022-2031, attributed to various neonatal disorders, were produced employing the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model in R software. Additionally, an analysis of overall neonatal mortality trends from 1980 to 2021 was conducted, supplemented by a heat map that compares DALYs attributable to various neonatal disorders across South Asian countries in 2021. Between 1980 and 2021, South Asia experienced a substantial decline in neonatal mortality rates, with India and Bangladesh leading the progress. Mortality decreased by 40%, while DALYs fell by 35%, despite a 15% increase in the prevalence. The prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma surged by 355%, yet its mortality dropped by 31%. Pakistan recorded the highest neonatal mortality and disease burden, particularly for hemolytic disease and other neonatal jaundice and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. In India and Bangladesh, neonatal preterm birth and neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections contributed most to mortality. Neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma accounted for the highest DALYs. Forecasts predict continued reductions in neonatal mortality across South Asia, except in Pakistan, where persistently high rates are expected till 2031. For South Asian countries to meet the SDG target for neonatal mortality by 2030, intensified and continuous efforts are required. These efforts should focus on identifying high-risk pregnancies and improving the quality of care during childbirth to address the root causes and reduce preventable neonatal deaths.",

However, little is known about any progress made in the availability and readiness of BEmONC services in Bangladesh. Using nationally representative data from the Bangladesh Health Facility Survey conducted between 2014 and 2017, we measured changes in the availability and readiness of BEmONC services in health facilities in Bangladesh, calculating the BEmONC service availability and readiness scores according to the World Health Organization Service Availability and Readiness Assessment guideline. The percentage of health facilities performing all seven basic signal functions declined slightly from 13% in 2014 to 11% in 2017. The decline was largely noticed in Maternal and Child Welfare Centers, Upazila Health Complexes, and Union Subcenter/Rural Dispensaries, as well as in all divisions except Rangpur. No remarkable changes in overall readiness of health facilities across location, division and facility type were observed between 2014 and 2017. However, significant reductions in availability and readiness were noticed when item-specific assessment was made. Type of health facility was significantly associated with both availability and readiness scores in adjusted regression models. Appropriate strategies and efforts could improve the availability and readiness of BEmONC services in health facilities in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The extensive network of community health workers in rural Bangladesh has the potential to deliver maternal and child nutrition services, while promoting linkages with healthcare facilities. A strategy for strengthening community-based nutrition services was developed and tested. The three-phased strategy included review of existing community-based systems, co-designing service package with multi-sector government representatives, and testing implementation feasibility. Integrated health and nutrition service delivery, supportive supervision, and increased accountability of local government were core components of the service package being implemented in selected geographies since March 2023. The assessment followed a mixed-method design with household survey of 1,166 pregnant women, mothers of children under-6 months and 6-23 months, and observations of 965 service delivery points along with qualitative study. A higher proportion of children received growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) services through expanded program on immunization (EPI) sessions, with better compliance to service delivery protocol in intervention areas compared with controls. Maternal nutrition services of gestational weight gain monitoring and distribution of supplements were better available in intervention areas. However, minimum dietary diversity among pregnant women (69% intervention, 72% control), early initiation of breastfeeding (55% intervention, 51% control), and complementary feeding practices were comparable in intervention and control areas. Nutrition services were successfully integrated in supervision which earlier covered EPI and family planning. The local government contributed to strengthening nutrition services but at a small scale. There is potential to scale-up GMP services through EPI and merging antenatal clinics with GMP and EPI such that all maternal and childcare services are available at the same place and same time. A coordinated investment and oversight from multiple national government departments is needed. At district and sub-district levels, scale-up requires joint annual planning of nutrition and EPI services, strengthened management of nutrition services, bridging health worker vacancies, introducing volunteers in sites with high EPI case load, capacity building, and supportive supervision. Replacement of multiple health and nutrition records with a single mother and child health and nutrition card is also feasible. However, behavior change interventions through home visits and courtyard meetings need more testing before recommending scale-up.",

        "abstract": "Liver dysfunctions during pregnancy can either be pregnancy-specific or preexisting in acute or chronic form. Data on the prevalence of abnormal liver functions and dyslipidemia during pregnancy in Bangladesh are scarce since these tests are not typically done in routine prenatal screening. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of elevated liver enzymes and dyslipidemia and associated risk factors in a cohort of pregnant women in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study included 194 pregnant women participants from different trimesters. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect baseline, demographic, and lifestyle data. Blood samples were collected from each participant to measure biochemical parameters such as liver enzymes (ALT and GGT), lipid profile (TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C), glucose, and creatinine levels in the serum. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with liver dysfunction and lipid profile abnormalities. The average age of the participants was 25 ± 5 years. Overall, the prevalence of preeclampsia was 12.4%. Among participants, 27% had increased ALT levels, most in their third trimester, while 11.8% had elevated GGT levels, mostly in early pregnancy. 83.8% of the study subjects had general dyslipidemia, with the highest prevalence in the second trimester and 5.2% had mixed dyslipidemia. Several factors were significantly associated with ALT elevation, such as preeclampsia, elevated blood pressure, low HDL-C levels, high parity number, having a higher number of children, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and inadequate knowledge about pregnancy diet. On the other hand, advanced maternal age, high gravidity, and mixed dyslipidemia were associated with elevated GGT levels. Conversely, age, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, preeclampsia, and diabetes were associated with dyslipidemia. In conclusion, elevated levels of liver enzymes and an abnormal lipid profile are common among pregnant women in Bangladesh. Various factors are linked to abnormal liver enzymes and dyslipidemia in these participants. Monitoring liver function and lipid levels, along with proper prenatal care, can help reduce the risk of maternal and neonatal mortality.",

        "abstract": "Hypoxaemia (low oxygen saturation in blood) is a key predictor of in-hospital mortality, affecting people of all ages with many different conditions. Early detection and treatment of hypoxaemia are critical, but there are few data to quantify hypoxaemia burden outside the child pneumonia population. We aimed to estimate hypoxaemia prevalence for adults and children with acute illness attending health facilities in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cumulated Index in Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Index Medicus, and Google Scholar for studies reporting hypoxaemia prevalence among patients attending health facilities. We included articles with original data on peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), from an LMIC, published between Jan 1, 1998, and Jan 10, 2023. We included studies in acutely unwell people of any age and with any condition, but excluded those admitted to intensive care units, receiving perioperative care, or attending hospital for preventive or chronic care. We assessed study quality using Joanna Briggs Institute's Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Two reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment, requesting summary data from authors. We reported pooled prevalence of hypoxaemia (typically defined as SpO<sub>2</sub> <90%) overall and by condition, using a random-effects meta-analysis model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136622. We identified 9173 unique records from searches and included 213 in meta-analyses involving 601 757 participants. The majority of studies were from the World Bank regions of sub-Saharan Africa (108 [51%] of 213) or south Asia (58 [27%]). The pooled prevalence of hypoxaemia among admitted patients was 24·5% (95% CI 19·9-29·4) for neonates (aged 0-28 days), 12·1% (10·0-14·4) for children (aged 1 month-17 years), and 10·8% (4·9-18·7) for adults (aged ≥18 years). Hypoxaemia prevalence was highest in neonatal and primary respiratory conditions but still common in many other conditions. Hypoxaemia was associated with 4·84 (95% CI 4·11-5·69) times higher odds of death than no hypoxaemia. Hypoxaemia is common across all age groups and a range of primary respiratory and other critical illnesses and is strongly associated with death. These estimates will inform oxygen-related strategies and programmes, and integration of pulse oximetry and oxygen into clinical guidelines, service structures, and strategies for maternal, neonatal, child, adolescent, and adult health.

        "abstract": "The Quality-of-Care Network (QCN), launched by WHO and partners, links global and national actors across several countries to improve maternal and newborn health. We conducted a prospective qualitative study to examine how QCN in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda facilitated learning, sharing, and innovation within and between network countries. We conducted 227 key informant interviews with QCN actors at global, national, and facility levels iteratively in two to four rounds from June 2019 to March 2022. We also reviewed all accessible QCN documents. Drawing on knowledge sharing theory, we thematically analysed the qualitative data according to three themes: sharing, learning, and innovations. Sharing and learning were evident through virtual and in-person platforms including conferences and webinars, held on online resource libraries such as the QCN website. This provides access to strategies and approaches shared by countries and actors. Locally, there was a strengthening of learning collaborative meetings, coaching, and mentorship. Regular meetings, such as stakeholder coordination meetings and learning collaborative sessions, provided opportunity for stakeholders to strategize, share and learn maternal and child health approaches. The network also promoted coordination among stakeholders. Common sharing and learning approaches, such as learning collaborative sessions, were evident across QCN countries. However, innovation was not as apparent across countries. While there were some exceptions, such as the development and adoption of innovative software applications aimed at boosting the capacity of service providers in network countries, these were limited. Most innovation approaches were similar to pre-existing maternal health approaches, adopted from an era preceding the QCN. Nevertheless, there was evidence that QCN improved their functionality. We provide evidence of how learning, sharing, and innovation among and within countries can be fostered for improving maternal and child health; and limitations. This understanding may help country efforts to achieve targets for ending preventable maternal and neonatal deaths.",

        "abstract": "Programmatic interventions to increase the detection of children with tuberculosis (TB) are rarely evaluated to understand age- and sex-specific completion rates. We applied modified TB screening and treatment cascade frameworks to assess indicators of effective implementation by age and sex of a TB screening program for children (zero to 14 years) in Bangladesh. We implemented an intensified screening program for paediatric TB detection in 119 health care facilities (2018-21). We followed systematic verbal screening by referral for full evaluation for children who reported symptoms or contact history with a patient with TB. Further, we linked children to treatment if diagnosed and followed for outcomes. We calculated the percentage of children, by age and sex, progressing through each step of the care cascade and compared the frequency of step completion by sex using χ<sup>2</sup> tests. In total, we screened 552 182 males and 461 419 females for TB. 2.8% of males and 2.6% of females screened positive (P < 0.001). 74.2% of males and 73.9% of females underwent appropriate evaluation (P = 0.560). 10.3% of males and 11.5% of females were diagnosed with TB (P = 0.008). 100% of children initiated treatment, and 97.6% of males and 97.1% of females achieved a successful treatment outcome (P = 0.428). The percent of children screening positive on verbal screen, who were clinically evaluated for TB, and who were diagnosed with TB generally increased with age, with some variability throughout (ranges: 1.2-9.1%, 59.8-88.5%, 6.5-21.9%, respectively). The largest gap observed for both sexes and among all ages was children who were not appropriately evaluated for TB despite screening positive. In our research, we highlight the value of identifying gaps in paediatric TB care to inform innovative, age- and sex-tailored interventions to improve future care in children.",

Retrospective cohort. SCANU of Patuakhali Medical College Hospital, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. Records of 930 neonates admitted to the SCANU from August to December 2022 were included in the study. The inclusion criteria consisted of neonates admitted during the specified period, while the exclusion criteria excluded records of newborns who were referred to intensive care units or who left against medical advice. Primary outcome: In-hospital neonatal mortality. Specific conditions or factors affecting the in-hospital deaths. Of the 930 neonates analysed, 3.44% died in the hospital. Factors significantly associated with shorter survival time and increased in-hospital mortality included low birth weight (p=0.004), preterm delivery (p=0.022) and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (p=0.002). RDS showed an independent association with death in the hospital (adjusted HR: 3.39; 95% CI: 1.11 to 10.35). Newborns delivered at home or in an ambulance had a 2.90 times higher hazard of dying in the hospital (95% CI: 1.17 to 7.17) compared with those delivered at the hospital. Addressing preterm birth, low birth weight and respiratory distress, along with promoting institutional deliveries, is crucial for reducing neonatal mortality rates in resource-limited settings like Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "This review explores the establishment of diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for pediatric brain computed tomography (CT) examinations in Saudi Arabia and compares them with nine other countries. An extensive search strategy was employed across various databases, resulting in the inclusion of 9 studies. The studies included patient-based and phantom-based investigations into DRLs, highlighting variations across age groups and countries. Findings suggest notable differences in CT dose index (CTDI mGy) and dose length product (DLP mGy.cm) values. There was a difference in the classification of age group between Saudi food and drug administration (SFDA) and literature. For the age groups 0-5 years and 6-15 years, the DRLs for the SFDA were as follows: CTDI (28 and 42 mGy) and DLP (482 and 697 mGy cm). The discussion emphasizes the importance of age-specific DRLs to optimize radiation doses while ensuring patient safety and diagnostic efficacy. Recommendations include adopting globally accepted standards for dose optimization and continued research into factors influencing DRL variations. Limitations include varying age groupings among studies and limited access to some relevant literature. Overall, this study underscores the importance of standardizing DRLs for pediatric CT to improve patient care and safety.",

        "abstract": "Care of newborn is traditionally provided by mothers. Maternal knowledge and practice of newborn care can significantly affect neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is convincing concern to explore knowledge and practice of postnatal mothers regarding newborn care. The objective of the study was to evaluate knowledge and practice of postnatal mothers regarding newborn care at hospital setting. This cross-sectional observational study was carried out in Special Care Newborn Unit, Rangpur Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from July 2018 to January 2019. In this study, mean maternal age was 23.27±3.87 years. Out of 150 respondent mothers 121(81.0%) possessed average knowledge and 144(96.0%) demonstrated average practice on newborn care. Level of knowledge was high in the area of clean cord care by using sterile thread 125(83.3%), p<0.001, duration of exclusive breastfeeding 100(66.7%), p<0.001), colostrum as first food of newborn 122(81.3%), p<0.001) and awareness about immunization 95(63.3%), p<0.001). Postnatal mothers demonstrated poor knowledge regarding cord stump stuff 41(27.3%) p<0.001) and first bath of newborn 38(25.3%), p<0.001. Mothers showed higher level of practice in the area of wash and clean napkins after motion 147(98.0%), p<0.001 and poor practice in correct position and attachment of breastfeeding 00(00.0%), p=0.001. Most postnatal mothers practiced exclusive breastfeeding 139(92.7%), p<0.001. Association between knowledge and practice of newborn care was non significant (p=0.305). Results of the present study demonstrated that majority of the mothers had average knowledge and practice regarding newborn care. Level of knowledge was high in clean cord care using sterile thread, colostrum as first food, duration of exclusive breastfeeding and awareness about immunization. Mothers had poor knowledge about cord stump material and first bath of newborn. Mothers claimed higher level of practice in the area of napkin wash and clean after motion, eye care, exclusive breastfeeding and poor practice in correct position and attachment of breastfeeding.",

        "abstract": "Nearly 80 % of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia cases are identified too late for medical treatment in lower-middle-income countries. Parents' understanding of neonatal jaundice is crucial for early detection and effective treatment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of prenatal sensitization in improving maternal knowledge and attitude toward neonatal hyperbilirubinemia management in Bangladesh. Cluster-randomized trial. Between September 2019 and March 2021, a prospective home-based intervention trial on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was conducted in 20 interventions and comparison clusters through community health workers (CHW). Participants were pregnant women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. Proportion-based difference-in-difference (DID) was calculated to determine changes in the mother's knowledge and attitude towards newborn jaundice. A total of 539 pregnant women were enrolled, 273 in the intervention, and 266 in the comparison arm. Following the intervention, participant's overall knowledge level about neonatal hyperbilirubinemia increased significantly (DID: 24.9, 95%CI: 19.2, 30.7) from baseline (33.2 %) to endline (70.5 %). Knowledge of newborn jaundice management showed the most improvement (DID: 60), followed by danger signs detection (DID: 40.0). The intervention also enhanced participants' positive attitudes regarding neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (DID: 13.1, 95%CI: 8.1, 18.0). Mothers with improved knowledge of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia were nearly five times more likely to have a favorable attitude toward it than those with counterparts. CHW-led home-based prenatal sensitization interventions substantially improved mothers' awareness and attitudes toward neonatal hyperbilirubinemia detection and management. Integrating such sensitization into prenatal care of the existing health system could be a practical approach to improve neonatal health outcomes in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Early gestational diabetes mellitus (eGDM) refers to elevated blood glucose levels not meeting the criteria for overt diabetes before 20 weeks gestation. Observational studies link eGDM to adverse outcomes, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence on early intervention benefits remains inconclusive. To address this, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) of RCTs on this subject. We searched electronic databases to identify RCTs comparing early treatment vs observation for eGDM. The primary neonatal outcomes analyzed were large-for-gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia. The primary maternal outcome was pregnancy-related hypertension. Secondary neonatal outcomes included neonatal respiratory distress (NRD), neonatal intensive-care unit admission, small-for-gestational age, cord-blood C-peptide ≥90th percentile, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Secondary maternal outcomes were cesarean section (CS), emergency CS, labor induction, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. Seven RCTs involving 4427 pregnancies were analyzed. The studies differed in their timing and methods of inclusion. Six studies used a combination of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions, while 1 relied solely on lifestyle modifications. Early treatment did not reduce LGA [odds ratio (OR) 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.32; P = .44], macrosomia (OR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.43-1.06; P = .09), or pregnancy-related hypertension (OR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.68-1.57; P = .87). Among the secondary outcomes, only NRD was significantly reduced in the treatment arm (OR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.80; P = .003). However, sensitivity analysis, omitting the lifestyle-only study, demonstrated a lower risk of macrosomia with early intervention (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.91; P = .02). The SRM demonstrates early intervention does not improve most pregnancy outcomes, except NRD. Sensitivity analysis, excluding the lifestyle-only study, additionally revealed a reduction in macrosomia. The findings must be interpreted cautiously due to the variability in study designs. Replication in well-designed multicenter trials is required before clinical application.",

        "abstract": "The rising prevalence of cesarean deliveries (CD) is a major public health problem worldwide, especially in Bangladesh. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with cesarean deliveries in the Jashore district of Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study, conducted from December 2022 to February 2023 in Jashore district, Bangladesh, involved face-to-face interviews with 662 mothers during hospital visits. A pretested, structured, and validated questionnaire was employed to gather information on socioeconomic characteristics, obstetric history, maternal healthcare utilization, and factors influencing the choice of delivery method. Multinomial logistic regression models were employed to assess and predict determining factors influencing cesarean delivery. The study revealed a high cesarean delivery (CD) prevalence of 70.5 %, exceeding the WHO-recommended threshold. Key socioeconomic factors associated with increased CD rates included rural residence, younger maternal age (15-20 years), nuclear family structure, and husbands in business. Additionally, private hospital deliveries, a history of previous CD, maternal self-preference, and doctor's influence were significant predictors of CD. The majority of participants believed CD enhances maternal safety (74.6 %) and alleviates pain (74.8 %). The high rate of cesarean deliveries in Jashore highlights the need for public health interventions that improve access to quality maternal care and promote evidence-based decision-making. Reducing unnecessary cesarean procedures, particularly in private hospitals, and enhancing patient education can significantly improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.",

The aim of this study was to explore MLBCs in this humanitarian context from the perspectives of women, midwives, and other key stakeholders. A mixed-method case study was conducted at one of the MLBCs within the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar. The MLBC serves a population of approximately 8,500 people. Quantitative data were collected from the medical records and documents of the MLBC. Qualitative data included two key informant interviews (KIIs) with policy makers, one focus group discussion (FGD) with 7 midwives and ten in-depth interviews (IDIs) with Rohingya women who gave birth in this MLBC. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was performed. In 2022, 267 women gave birth at the MLBC, and 70 women with complications were transferred to higher-level facilities. Women chose the MLBC because of the respectful care provided by kind and skillful midwives, and the high-quality services. The MLBC was often recommended by community volunteers and relatives. Midwives provided a range of health services including antenatal, labour and birth, postnatal, family planning, mental health support and gender-based violence services. Challenges included language barriers, difficulty obtaining transport from home and back particularly at night in remote areas, security fears and weak cell phone coverage that affected communication for referral and follow-up. Recommendations included increased support and security staff, establishing a referral hospital nearer to the camp, refresher training for midwives and monitoring, and mentoring to improve service quality. The MLBC in the Rohingya camp shows that respectful midwifery care including management and referral of obstetric complications with wider sexual and reproductive health services can be provided in a humanitarian setting to optimize maternal and neonatal health outcomes.",

We analyzed 6 788 947 respondents' data from a cross-sectional and nationally representative 2021 Bangladesh Disaster-related Statistics (BDRS). The key explanatory variables were the types of disasters respondents faced, while the outcome variables were the disease burden during and following disasters. Descriptive statistics were used to determine disease burden. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model assessed the association between disease burden and disaster types, along with socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. Nearly 50% of respondents experienced diseases during disasters, rising to 53.4% afterward. Fever, cough and diarrhea were prevalent during and after disasters, with increases in skin diseases, malnutrition, and asthma post-disaster. Vulnerable groups, such as children aged 0-4, hijra individuals, those with lower education, people with disabilities, and rural residents, especially in Chattogram, Rangpur, and Sylhet divisions, were most affected. Floods, cyclones, thunderstorms, and hailstorms significantly increased disease likelihood during and after disasters.

        "abstract": "Although death in old age is unavoidable, premature death-defined here as death before age 70 years-is not. To assess whether halving premature mortality by 2050 is feasible, we examined the large variation in premature death rates before age 70 years and trends over the past 50 years (1970-2019), covering ten world regions and the 30 most-populous nations. This analysis was undertaken in conjunction with the third report of The Lancet Commission on Investing in Health: Global Health 2050: the path to halving premature death by mid-century. In this cross-country analysis of past mortality trends and future directions, all analyses on the probability of premature death (PPD) were conducted using life tables from the UN World Population Prospects 2024. For each sex, country, and year, probability of death was calculated from these life tables with 1-year age-specific mortality rates. Globally, PPD decreased from 56% in 1970 to 31% in 2019, although some countries saw reversals because of conflict, social instability, or HIV and AIDS. Child mortality has decreased faster than adult mortality. Among all countries, 34 halved their PPD over three decades between 1970 and 2019. Among the 30 most-populous countries, seven countries, with varying levels of baseline PPD and income, halved their PPD in the past half century. Seven of the most-populous countries had average annual rates of improvement in the period 2010-19 that, if sustained, could lead to a halving of PPD by 2050, including Korea (3·9%), Bangladesh (2·8%), Russia (2·7%), Ethiopia (2·4%), Iran (2·4%), South Africa (2·4%), and Türkiye (2·3%). Halving premature death by 2050 is feasible, although substantial investments in child and adult health are needed to sustain or accelerate the rate of improvement for high-performing and medium-performing countries. Particular attention must be paid to countries with very low or a worsening rate of improvement in PPD. By reducing premature mortality, more people will live longer and more healthy lives. However, as people live longer, the absolute number of years lived with chronic disease will increase and investments in services reducing chronic disease morbidity are needed.

While global health efforts have focused on the first 1000 days, the next 7000 days (ages 2-21) are equally vital, especially concerning the unmet burden of surgical conditions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Approximately 1.7 billion children globally lack access to essential surgical care, with LMICs accounting for 85% of these unmet needs. Common surgical conditions, including congenital anomalies, injuries, infections, and pediatric cancers, often go untreated, contributing to significant mortality and disability. Despite the substantial need, LMICs face severe workforce and infrastructure shortages, with most pediatric surgical conditions requiring specialized skills, equipment, and tailored healthcare systems. Economic analyses have shown that pediatric surgical interventions are cost-effective, with substantial societal benefits. Expanding surgical care for children in LMICs demands investments in workforce training, infrastructure, and health systems integration, complemented by innovative funding and equitable global partnerships. Prioritizing surgical care within national health policies and scaling up children's surgery through initiatives like the Optimal Resources for Children's Surgical Care can improve health outcomes, align with Sustainable Development Goals, and foster equity in global health. Addressing the surgical care gap in LMICs will reduce preventable mortality, enhance quality of life, and drive sustainable growth, emphasizing surgery as an essential component of universal health coverage for children.",

Optimising infection management is crucial for improving individual outcomes and reducing the incidence of antimicrobial resistance. Digital health technologies, through their accessibility and scalability, hold promise in improving the quality of care across diverse health-care settings. In settings with poor access to laboratory services, innovative uses of existing data, point-of-care diagnostics, and wearables could allow for better recognition of host responses during infection and antimicrobial optimisation. The linkage and connectivity of information can support the coordinated delivery of care between health-care facilities and the community. Continuous real-time monitoring of infection markers in the mother and neonate through biosensing can provide notable opportunities for intervention and improvements in care. However, the development and implementation of these interventions should be respectful, prioritise safety, and emphasise sustainable, locally derived solutions.

        "abstract": "Postnatal care (PNC) is the care of a newborn and mother for up to six weeks from one hour of placenta birth. The postnatal period is one of the most hazardous stages for mothers and their baby's health. The PNC is influenced by several maternal, family, biological, and socio-economic factors and it is necessary to identify the most significant factors of PNC. Therefore, the authors focus on determining the significant determinants of postnatal care in Bangladesh. This study is based on a secondary dataset extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS)-2017/18. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and multilevel logistic regression have been used to determine the contributing factors of PNC. The rate of postnatal care was highest in Sylhet (73.7%) and lowest in Dhaka (57.1%). Female babies had 10.1% less odds of having postnatal care than male babies. Findings depict that the children with 1-3 siblings have 1. 82 times more odds (odds ratio (OR):1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.03-3.21) of PNC than babies without any siblings. Children who suffered from fever recently had 1.25 times (OR = 1.25, 95% CI:1.09-1.45) more odds of taking PNC than their counterparts. Children of working mothers had 1.33 times (OR:1.33, 95% CI:1.14-1.56) more odds of having PNC than children of non-working mothers. The sex of a child, birth order number, place of residence, region, receiving Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, number of antenatal care visits, having fever recently, number of household members, media exposure, and household facilities are significantly linked with PNC in Bangladesh. To ensure the good health of a child, it is necessary to focus on the targeted groups and put emphasis on the identified variables. The authors believe that the findings will be helpful to the policymakers of Bangladesh to lessen childhood morbidities which will be helpful in achieving the target of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for reducing preventable maternal and under-five deaths by 2030.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI)-associated hospitalizations in children. It is unclear if hospitalized RSV-positive ALRI is clinically different from other viral ALRIs. We aimed to compare the disease impact of hospitalized RSV with other viral ALRI in children aged <2 years. We conducted a retrospective study using the electronic medical records of children aged <2 years who were hospitalized with ALRIs at Sydney Children's Hospital Network from 2020 to 2022. We compared demographics and clinical features between RSV-positive cases and RSV-negative ones (ie, positive for other viruses). Poisson quasi-likelihood regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios for 3 in-hospital outcomes: length of stay, need for respiratory support, and intensive care. We examined 330 children aged <2 years hospitalized with RSV-positive ALRIs and 330 with RSV-negative ALRIs (positive for other viruses). RSV-positive cases were older (12 vs 8 months, P < .001) and more often presented with cough (99% vs 92%), fever (80% vs 58%), crackles (89% vs 76%), hypoxia (50% vs 36%), and lethargy (36% vs 20%). They were also more likely to undergo chest radiographs (74% vs 49%) and receive antibiotics (65% vs 35%). Adjusted analysis showed that children who were RSV positive had a higher likelihood of an extended length of stay (>2 days; adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.14-3.36). However, there were no differences in the need for intensive care or respiratory support. Children with RSV-positive ALRI exhibited more severe symptoms, received more antibiotics, and had longer hospital stays as compared with those with other viral ALRIs, underscoring the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies for RSV.",

Descriptive cross-sectional study using hospital-based surveillance. National Children's Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between June and November 2017. 765 children with CP were recruited. We assessed clinical characteristics of CP, associated impairments (epilepsy, intellectual, visual, hearing, speech impairments) and their correlates. We performed descriptive analyses (median, IQR and proportion). χ<sup>2</sup> test and Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression models were established and associated impairments were included as independent variables. The median age of children was 1.7 years (IQR=2.7). Quadriplegia was the predominant subtype (69.5%) and 46.5% were at Gross Motor Function Classification System level IV-V. Of children, 76.3% had ≥one associated impairment, most commonly speech or intellectual impairments (59.1% and 57.8%, respectively). Severity of motor impairment, type of CP, maternal and perinatal factors (eg, gestational age, perinatal asphyxia, timing of injury causing CP) were associated with greater risk of associated impairments. Children with CP have a high burden of associated impairments. Findings from our study will inform the development and implementation of appropriate screening and interventions and reduce the long-term adverse effects of these impairments on individuals with CP and their socioeconomic impact.",

        "abstract": "This study describes the experiences of women in rural Bangladesh, and the cultural practices related to how they take care of themselves and their babies, in the early postnatal period. Data were gathered through immersion in the field for six months, participant observation, document collection and in-depth interview techniques to gain a deep understanding of women's everyday lives and practices during the postnatal period. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 28 mothers who had had at least one live child within the five years before the date of data collection, in <i>Purba Sharifabad</i> village of the Barisal Division in Bangladesh. The key findings of this study highlight the role of culture in the experiences of women during the postnatal period, and reveal that cultural practices, beliefs and traditions are deeply embedded in the lives of rural women. This study focuses on cultural practices which have an effect on the choices of women regarding care and support from healthcare facilities. Culture, together with poverty and low levels of education, leads them to resist healthcare from a skilled birth attendant and encourages them to believe in and trust traditional care practices during the postnatal period. Therefore, the findings of this study may contribute to future policies, planning, programs and research in Bangladesh by providing an understanding of the importance of culturally and socially rooted traditional beliefs and cultural practices. These need to be addressed for maternal and newborn healthcare initiatives to be effective, particularly in rural Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Non-institutional births remain prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, associated with a majority of adverse maternal and child health outcomes, including maternal and child mortality. Ensuring essential newborn care (ENC) practices for these non-institutional births is crucial for reducing these adverse outcomes. This study aimed to identify the prevalence, and factors associated with the adoption of ENC practices among non-institutional births in urban Bangladesh. A total of 2,165 children's data were analyzed, extracted from the 35,186 ever-married women interviewed in the 2021 Bangladesh Urban Health Survey. Six ENC components and their level (lowest/none, moderate, and highest) were considered as the outcome variables. Several socio-demographic factors were considered as the explanatory variables. Multivariate binary and multinomial logistic regression model were used to explore the association between outcome and explanatory variables. Approximately 49% of all mothers reported practicing the highest level of ENC. Among the individual components, the highest adherence was observed for the use of a disinfected instrument to cut the umbilical cord (90%). The likelihood of adopting the highest level of ENC practices was higher among mothers with relatively higher education and wealth quintiles and lower among those residing in slum and other urban areas of city corporations compared to non-slum areas. Mothers living in the Khulna and Sylhet divisions had a lower likelihood of adopting the highest level of ENC practices. Awareness building programs are needed to educate the population, particularly mothers, about the importance of practicing ENC for improving maternal and child health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Personalized Asthma Action Plans (AAPs) are a cornerstone of pediatric asthma management. We aimed to assess parental knowledge and perceptions of the use of AAPs in managing their child's asthma. In 2023 we conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge and perceptions of AAPs in parents/caregivers of children aged 0-17 years with asthma who had an AAP and attended respiratory clinics at Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick. The questionnaire included parental perceptions on the utility of AAPs, parental asthma management self-efficacy (PAMSE), and an adapted version of the Asthma Action Plan Knowledge Interview tool (AAPKI). Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to assess associations between AAPKI, PAMSE and other outcomes. Seventy-one parents completed the survey. Mean PAMSE score was 4.2/5 (SD 0.5). Median AAPKI score was 70.2% out of 100% (IQR 20.4%). Most parents (80.0%, <i>n</i> = 56) were satisfied/very satisfied with using AAPs to manage their child's asthma. Most agreed/strongly agreed that AAPs were helpful in knowing when to seek medical attention for their child's asthma (81.7%, <i>n</i> = 58), helped their understanding of asthma severity (81.7%, <i>n</i> = 58), and increased their confidence in asthma management (76.0%, <i>n</i> = 54). Over half of parents (55.7%, <i>n</i> = 39) would prefer AAPs digitally and majority (78.6%, <i>n</i> = 55) would like color-coded AAPs. High levels of AAP knowledge and self-efficacy scores were demonstrated. Most parents expressed understanding of the benefits of AAPs. Our findings suggest parents of children with asthma prefer AAPs in color and in digital version which may help guide standardization of AAPs across Australia.",

        "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

This paper provides a comparative analysis of CHW programs in five countries (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka), examines successes and challenges, and suggests reforms to better ensure highly performing CHW programs. To examine CHW programs in the region, we conducted a narrative review of the peer-reviewed and grey literatures, as well as eliciting opinions from experts. Common roles of CHWs include health education, community mobilization, and community-based services, particularly related to reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health. Some countries utilize CHWs for non-communicable diseases and other emerging health issues. To maximize the potential contribution of CHWs to achieving Universal Health Coverage, we recommend future research and policy focus on strengthening existing health systems to support the expansion of CHWs roles and better integrating of CHWs into national PHC systems.

        "abstract": "As the Sustainable Development Goal 3.2.1 deadline (2030) approaches, rapidly reducing under-5 mortality (U5M) gains more prominence. However, initiatives or interventions that aided Bangladesh in achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 showed varied effectiveness in reducing certain cause-specific U5M. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the predictors of the key cause-specific mortalities. This cross-sectional study was conducted using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011 and 2017-18 data. Cause-specific U5M was examined using multilevel multinomial mixed-effects analyses, and overall/all-cause U5M was examined using multilevel mixed-effects analyses. The respective estimates were compared. The cause-specific analysis revealed that pneumonia and prematurity-related U5M were significantly associated with antenatal care and postnatal care, respectively. However, analysis of overall/all-cause U5M did not reveal any significant association with health services. Twins or multiples had a greater risk of mortality from preterm-related conditions (adjusted Relative Risk Ratio (aRRR): 38.01, 95% CI: 19.08-75.7, p < .001), birth asphyxia (aRRR: 6.52, 95% CI: 2.51-16.91, p < .001), and possible serious infections (aRRR: 11.12, 95% CI: 4.52-27.36, p < .001) than singletons. Children born to mothers 18 years or younger also exhibited a greater risk of mortality from these three causes than children born to older mothers. This study also revealed an increase in the predicted risk of prematurity-related mortality in the 2017-18 survey among children born to mothers 18 years or younger, children born to mothers without any formal education, twins or multiples and children who did not receive postnatal care. This research provides valuable insights into accelerating U5M reduction; a higher risk of preterm-related death among twins underscores the importance of careful monitoring of mothers pregnant with twins or multiples through the continuum of care; elevated risk of death among children who did not receive postnatal care, or whose mothers did not receive antenatal care stresses the need to strengthen the coverage and quality of maternal and neonatal health care; furthermore, higher risks of preterm-related deaths among the children of mothers with low formal education or children born to mothers 18 years or younger highlight the importance of more comprehensive initiatives to promote maternal education and prevent adolescent pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of acute neurological symptoms in children necessitates immediate intervention. Although low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden of neurological diseases, there is a scarcity of diagnostic and therapeutic resources. Therefore, current understanding of the etiology of neurological emergencies in LMICs relies mainly on clinical diagnoses and verbal autopsies. To characterize the association of premortem neurological symptoms and their management with postmortem-confirmed cause of death among children aged younger than 5 years in LMICs and to identify current gaps and improve strategies to enhance child survival. This cross-sectional study was conducted between December 3, 2016, and July 22, 2022, at the 7 participating sites in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and South Africa). Minimally invasive tissue sampling was performed at the CHAMPS sites with specimens from deceased children aged younger than 5 years. This study included deceased children who underwent a premortem neurological evaluation and had a postmortem-confirmed cause of death. Data analysis was performed between July 22, 2022, and January 15, 2023. Descriptive analysis was performed using neurological evaluations from premortem clinical records and from postmortem determination of cause of death (based on histopathology, microbiological testing, clinical records, and verbal autopsies). Of the 2127 deaths of children codified during the study period, 1330 (62.5%) had neurological evaluations recorded and were included in this analysis. The 1330 children had a median age of 11 (IQR, 2-324) days; 745 (56.0%) were male and 727 (54.7%) presented with neurological symptoms during illness before death. The most common postmortem-confirmed neurological diagnoses related to death were hypoxic events (308 [23.2%]), meningoencephalitis (135 [10.2%]), and cerebral malaria (68 [5.1%]). There were 12 neonates with overlapping hypoxic events and meningoencephalitis, but there were no patients with overlapping meningoencephalitis and cerebral malaria. Neurological symptoms were similar among diagnoses, and no combination of symptoms was accurate in differentiating them without complementary tools. However, only 25 children (18.5%) with meningitis had a lumbar puncture performed before death. Nearly 90% of deaths (442 of 511 [86.5%]) with neurological diagnoses in the chain of events leading to death were considered preventable. In this cross-sectional study of children aged younger than 5 years, neurological symptoms were frequent before death. However, clinical phenotypes were insufficient to differentiate the most common underlying neurological diagnoses. The low rate of lumbar punctures performed was especially worrying, suggesting a challenge in quality of care of children presenting with neurological symptoms. Improved diagnostic management of neurological emergencies is necessary to ultimately reduce mortality in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Despite remarkable success in the Millennium Development Goal era, Bangladesh experienced a sluggish reduction in the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) between 2014 and 2017-18. Our study aimed to explain this stagnancy by examining the variation in the key predictor-specific mortality risks over time, using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011, 2014 and 2017-18 data. We applied multilevel mixed effects logistic regression to examine the extent to which the under-5 mortality (U5M) risks were associated with the key sociodemographic and health service-specific predictors. We found that the rise in mortality risks attributable to maternal age 18 years or below, low maternal education, mother's overweight or obesity and the absence of a handwashing station within the household were the key contributors to the stagnant U5MR between 2014 and 2017-18. Poverty and low education aggravated the mortality risks. Besides, antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) did not impact U5M risks as significantly as expected. Compulsory use of ANC and PNC cards and strict monitoring of their use may improve the quality of these health services. Leveraging committees like the Upazila Hospital Management Committee can bring harmony to implementing policies and programmes in the sectors related to U5M.",

        "title": "Every Newborn-Reach Up Early Education Intervention for All Children (EN-REACH)- a parent group intervention for school readiness in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Tanzania: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.",
        "abstract": "Vulnerable children, including those with neuro-developmental delays and disabilities, often face barriers in accessing early primary education, thus hindering progress toward Sustainable Development Goal 4.2. Evidence-based interventions are essential to enhancing inclusivity and establishing sustainable implementation strategies to address this challenge. This study, Every Newborn-Reach up Early Education Intervention for All Children (EN-REACH), builds on the previous Every Newborn- Simplified Measurement Integrating Longitudinal Neurodevelopmental and Growth (EN-SMILING) observational cohort study. This paper provides the protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a parenting group intervention program for enhancing school readiness in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Tanzania, and an embedded process evaluation to inform scalability and feasibility. EN-REACH is a cRCT with at least 150 clusters to evaluate the impact of a parent training program led by trained parent-teacher facilitator pairs, focusing on children aged 4 ~ 6 years preparing for preschool. Approximately 500 participants from the EN-SMILING cohort at each site have been identified. A geographic information system will define ~ 50 clusters in each of the three countries, each with approximately ten parent-child dyads. Half the clusters will be randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The primary outcome is \"school readiness\", assessed using the Measuring Early Learning Quality and Outcomes tool. Secondary outcomes include Intelligence Quotient, child functioning, growth, visual, and hearing assessments. Data will be collected at baseline, and post-intervention data following implementation of the parent group intervention sessions over approximately 5 months. Quantitative data on coverage and quality care, combined with qualitative insights from children, caregivers, facilitators, and stakeholders' perspectives, will be used to conduct a process evaluation applying the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.  DISCUSSION: This protocol details a trial focused on enhancing school readiness and cognitive abilities in young children, inclusive of those with disabilities, aiming to bridge gap from home to early primary education. EN-REACH aims to provide insights into the effectiveness and acceptability of a co-designed disability-inclusive school readiness program in three countries, potentially impacting national and global policies for all children, including those with disabilities. The trial was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov on 29 February 2024 (NCT06334627).",

        "abstract": "Rectovaginal group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonisation in pregnant individuals at the time of labour is a major risk factor for invasive GBS disease by age 7 days (early-onset disease). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of rectovaginal GBS colonisation at the time of labour among pregnant women and vertical transmission to their newborns across selected low-income and middle-income African and south Asian countries. This prospective, observational study was undertaken at 11 maternity and obstetric care facilities based in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Mali, South Africa, Bangladesh, India, and Bhutan. HIV-negative pregnant women aged 18-45 years who were in the early stages of labour and at least 37 weeks' gestation were eligible for inclusion. Lower vaginal and rectal swabs and urine were collected from the women, and swabs of the umbilicus, outer ear, axillary fold, rectum, and throat were obtained from their newborns, for GBS culture. Standardised sampling and culture using direct plating and selective media broth for detection of GBS colonisation was undertaken at the sites. Serotyping of GBS isolates was done in South Africa. The primary outcome was the prevalence of rectovaginal GBS among pregnant women, analysed in participants with available data. This study is registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Register, number DOH-27-0418-4989. 6922 pregnant women were enrolled from Jan 10, 2016, to Dec 11, 2018, of whom 6514 (94·1%; 759-892 per country) were included in the analysis; data from Bhutan were not included in the study due to issues with specimen collection and processing. Overall, the prevalence of maternal GBS colonisation was 24·1% (95% CI 23·1-25·2; 1572 of 6514); it was highest in Mali (41·1% [37·7-44·6]; 314 of 764) and lowest in Ethiopia (11·6% [9·5-14·1]; 88 of 759). The overall rate of vertical transmission of GBS from women with rectovaginal GBS colonisation was 72·3% (70·0-74·4; 1132 of 1566); it was highest in Mozambique (79·2% [73·3-84·2]; 168 of 212) and lowest in Bangladesh (55·8%, 47·5-63·8; 77 of 138). The five most common GBS colonising serotypes were Ia (37·3% [34·9-39·7]; 586 of 1572), V (28·5% [26·3-30·8]; 448 of 1572), III (25·1% [23·0-27·3]; 394 of 1572), II (9·2% [7·8-10·7]; 144 of 1572), and Ib (6·5% [5·4-7·8]; 102 of 1572). There was geographical variability in serotype proportion distribution; serotype VII was the third most common serotype in India (8·6% [5·3-13·7]; 15 of 174) and serotype VI was mainly identified in Bangladesh (5·8% [3·0-11·0]; eight of 138) and India (5·7% [3·2-10·3]; ten of 174). Our study reported a high prevalence of GBS colonisation in most settings, with some geographical variability even within African countries. Our findings suggest that serotypes not included in current multivalent capsular-polysaccharide GBS vaccines prevail in some regions, so vaccine efficacy and post-licensure effectiveness studies should assess the effect of vaccination on maternal GBS colonisation given the potential for replacement by non-vaccine serotypes.

        "title": "Accuracy of Mothers' Perception of Birth Size to Predict Birth Weight Data in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) is an important indicator of child health and wellbeing. However, in many countries, decisions regarding care and treatment are often based on mothers' perceptions of their children's birth size due to a lack of objective birth weight data. Additionally, birth weight data that is self-reported or recorded often encounters the issue of heaping. This study assesses the concordance between the perceived birth size and the reported or recorded birth weight. We also investigate how the presence of heaped birth weight data affects this concordance, as well as the relationship between concordance and various sociodemographic factors. We examined 4,641 birth records reported in the 2019 Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. The sensitivity-specificity analysis was performed to assess perceived birth size's ability to predict LBW, while Cohen's Kappa statistic assessed reliability. We used the kernel smoothing technique to correct heaping of birth weight data, as well as a multivariable multinomial logistic model to assess factors associated with concordance. Maternally-perceived birth size exhibited a low sensitivity (63.5%) and positive predictive value (52.6%) for predicting LBW, but a high specificity (90.1%) and negative predictive value (93.4%). There was 86.1% agreement between birth size and birth weight-based classifications (Kappa = 0.49, indicating moderate agreement). Smoothed birth weight data did not improve agreement (83.4%, Kappa = 0.45). Of the sociodemographic factors, early marriage was positively associated with discordance (i.e., overestimation). An important consideration when calculating the LBW prevalence is that maternally perceived birth size is not an optimal proxy for birth weight. Focus should be placed on encouraging institutional births and educating community health workers and young mothers about the significance of measuring and recording birth weight.",

        "abstract": "Fetal macrosomia, marked by excessive birth weight, is a significant public health issue in developing countries, yet it has received less attention compared to low birth weight. This study aims to determine the prevalence of fetal macrosomia in Bangladesh and its associated factors. The study utilized data from 4,754 women with complete birth weight information of their children from the Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) -2019, defining fetal macrosomia as newborns with a birth weight ≥4,000 g regardless of gestational age. Bivariate logistic regression assessed associations between independent variables and fetal macrosomia, presenting adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI), while controlling for potential confounders such as women's age, wealth index, education, healthcare utilization, comorbidities, newborn sex, and place of residence. The prevalence of fetal macrosomia was 11.6%. Significant associations with fetal macrosomia included higher maternal age group (30-34 years) (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.74), secondary level of mother's education (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.43-2.66), experienced physical attacks (AOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.06-1.88), hypertension during pregnancy (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.15-2.07), and rural residence (AOR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.15-1.49). Female infants had 18% lower odds of being macrosomic compared to male infants (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.72-0.93). One in ten infants in Bangladesh are born with macrosomia, necessitating a multi-faceted approach involving improving maternal nutrition, promoting healthy lifestyles, enhancing access to quality prenatal care, and addressing socioeconomic, residential, and healthcare system challenges, underlining the importance of further community-based research to expand the study's scope.",

        "abstract": "Undernutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a small vulnerable newborn. Small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) contain both macro- and micronutrients and can help prevent multiple nutritional deficiencies. We examined the effects of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy compared with 1) iron and folic acid or standard of care (IFA/SOC) or 2) multiple micronutrient supplements (MMSs) and identified characteristics that modified the estimates of effects of SQ-LNSs on birth outcomes. We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 4 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided during pregnancy (n = 5273). We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with IFA/SOC or MMS and pooled the estimates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether the results differed depending on methods for gestational age dating, birth anthropometry, or study design. SQ-LNSs (compared with IFA/SOC) increased birth weight [mean difference: +49 g; 95% confidence interval (CI): 26, 71 g] and all birth anthropometric z-scores (+0.10-0.13 standard deviation); they reduced risk of low birth weight by 11%, newborn stunting by 17%, newborn wasting by 11%, and small head size by 15%. Only 2 trials compared SQ-LNSs and MMSs; P values for birth outcomes were >0.10 except for head circumference (e.g., z-score for gestational age: +0.11; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.23). Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with IFA/SOC were greater among female infants and, for certain outcomes, among mothers with body mass index <20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, inflammation, malaria, or household food insecurity. Effect estimates for SQ-LNSs compared with MMSs were greater for certain outcomes among female infants, first-born infants, and mothers <25 y. SQ-LNSs had positive impacts on multiple outcomes compared to IFA/SOC, but further research directly comparing SQ-LNSs and MMSs is needed. Targeting SQ-LNSs to vulnerable subgroups may be worth considering. This study was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021283391.",

        "abstract": "Treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) generates complex data where machine learning (ML) modelling could be beneficial. Using routine hospital data, we evaluated the ability of multiple ML models to predict inpatient mortality in a paediatric population in a low/middle-income country. We retrospectively analysed hospital record data from 0-59 months old children admitted to the ICU of Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Five commonly used ML models- logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, elastic net, gradient boosting trees (GBT) and random forest (RF), were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Top predictors were selected using RF mean decrease Gini scores as the feature importance values. Data from 5669 children was used and was reduced to 3505 patients (10% death, 90% survived) following missing data removal. The mean patient age was 10.8 months (SD=10.5). The top performing models based on the validation performance measured by mean 10-fold cross-validation AUROC on the training data set were RF and GBT. Hyperparameters were selected using cross-validation and then tested in an unseen test set. The models developed used demographic, anthropometric, clinical, biochemistry and haematological data for mortality prediction. We found RF consistently outperformed GBT and predicted the mortality with AUROC of ≥0.87 in the test set when three or more laboratory measurements were included. However, after the inclusion of a fourth laboratory measurement, very minor predictive gains (AUROC 0.87 vs 0.88) resulted. The best predictors were the biochemistry and haematological measurements, with the top predictors being total CO<sub>2</sub>, potassium, creatinine and total calcium. Mortality in children admitted to ICU can be predicted with high accuracy using RF ML models in a real-life data set using multiple laboratory measurements with the most important features primarily coming from patient biochemistry and haematology.",

        "abstract": "Maternal hypertension may be an underrecognized but important risk factor for perinatal death in low resource settings. We investigated the association of maternal hypertension and perinatal mortality in rural Bangladesh. This nested, matched case-control study used data from a 2019 cross-sectional survey and demographic surveillance database in Baliakandi, Bangladesh. We randomly matched each pregnancy ending in perinatal death with five pregnancies in which the neonate survived beyond seven days based on maternal age, education, and wealth quintile. We estimated associations of antenatal care-seeking and self-reported hypertension with perinatal mortality using conditional logistic regression and used median and interquartile ranges to assess the mediation of antenatal care by timing or frequency. Among 191 cases and 934 matched controls, hypertension prevalence was 14.1% among cases and 7.7% among controls. Compared with no diagnosis, the probability of perinatal death was significantly higher among women with a pre-gestational hypertension diagnosis (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.29, 6.57), but not among women with diagnosis during pregnancy (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.98, 2.98). We found no association between the number of antenatal care contacts and perinatal death (p = 0.66). Among women with pre-gestational hypertension who experienced a perinatal death, 78% had their first antenatal contact in the sixth or seventh month of gestation. Hypertension was more common among rural women who experience a perinatal death. Greater effort to prevent hypertension prior to conception and provide early maternity care to women with hypertension could improve perinatal outcomes in rural Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Determining aetiology of severe illness can be difficult, especially in settings with limited diagnostic resources, yet critical for providing life-saving care. Our objective was to describe the accuracy of antemortem clinical diagnoses in young children in high-mortality settings, compared with results of specific postmortem diagnoses obtained from Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS). We analysed data collected during 2016-2022 from seven sites in Africa and South Asia. We compared antemortem clinical diagnoses from clinical records to a reference standard of postmortem diagnoses determined by expert panels at each site who reviewed the results of histopathological and microbiological testing of tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. We calculated test characteristics and 95% CIs of antemortem clinical diagnostic accuracy for the 10 most common causes of death. We classified diagnostic discrepancies as major and minor, per Goldman criteria later modified by Battle. CHAMPS enrolled 1454 deceased young children aged 1-59 months during the study period; 881 had available clinical records and were analysed. The median age at death was 11 months (IQR 4-21 months) and 47.3% (n=417) were female. We identified a clinicopathological discrepancy in 39.5% (n=348) of deaths; 82.3% of diagnostic errors were major. The sensitivity of clinician antemortem diagnosis ranged from 26% (95% CI 14.6% to 40.3%) for non-infectious respiratory diseases (eg, aspiration pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, etc) to 82.2% (95% CI 72.7% to 89.5%) for diarrhoeal diseases. Antemortem clinical diagnostic specificity ranged from 75.2% (95% CI 72.1% to 78.2%) for diarrhoeal diseases to 99.0% (95% CI 98.1% to 99.6%) for HIV. Antemortem clinical diagnostic errors were common for young children who died in areas with high childhood mortality rates. To further reduce childhood mortality in resource-limited settings, there is an urgent need to improve antemortem diagnostic capability through advances in the availability of diagnostic testing and clinical skills.",

        "title": "Modelling climate impacts on paediatric sepsis incidence and severity in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Sepsis is a leading cause of paediatric mortality worldwide, disproportionately affecting children in low- and middle-income countries. The impacts of climate change on the burden and outcomes of sepsis in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in paediatric populations, remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess the associations between climate variables (temperature and precipitation) and paediatric sepsis incidence and mortality in Bangladesh, one of the countries most affected by climate change. We conducted retrospective analyses of patient-level data from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and environmental data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Using random forests, we assessed associations between sepsis incidence and sepsis mortality with temperature and precipitation between 2009-22. A nonlinear relationship between temperature and sepsis incidence and mortality was identified. The lowest incidence occurred at an optimum temperature of 26.6°C with a gradual increase below and a sharp rise above this temperature. Higher precipitation levels showed a general trend of increased sepsis incidence. A similar distribution for sepsis mortality was identified with an optimum temperature of 28°C. Findings suggest that environmental temperature and precipitation play a role in paediatric sepsis incidence and sepsis mortality in Bangladesh. As children are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts, it is important to consider climate change in health care planning and resource allocation, especially in resource-limited settings, to allow for surge capacity planning during warmer and wetter seasons. Further prospective research from more globally representative data sets will provide more robust evidence on the nature of the relationships between climate variables and paediatric sepsis worldwide.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adversely on the provision of essential health services globally. The Southeast Asia region (SEAR) has experienced extremely high rates of COVID-19 infection, with potential adverse impacts on provision of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health (RMNCH) services. We conducted a systematic literature review of quantitative evidence to characterise the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of essential RMNCH services across the SEAR. Studies published between December 2019 and May 2022 were included in the study. The quality of studies was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. We reviewed 1924 studies and analysed data from 20 peer-reviewed studies and three reports documenting quantitative pre-post estimates of RMNCH service disruption because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eleven studies were of low methodological quality, in addition to seven and five studies of moderate and high methodological qualities respectively. Six countries in the region were represented in the included studies: India (11 studies), Bangladesh (4), Nepal (3), Sri Lanka (1), Bhutan (1) and Myanmar (1). These countries demonstrated a wide reduction in antenatal care services (-1.6% to -69.6%), facility-based deliveries (-2.3% to -52.4%), child immunisation provision (-13.5% to -87.7%), emergency obstetric care (+4.0% to -76.6%), and family planning services (-4.2% to -100%). There have been large COVID-19 pandemic related disruptions for a wide range of RMNCH essential health service indicators in several SEAR countries. Notably, we found a higher level of service disruption than the WHO PULSE survey estimates. If left unaddressed, such disruptions may set back hard-fought gains in RMNCH outcomes across the region. The absence of studies in five SEAR countries is a priority evidence gap that needs addressing to better inform policies for service protection. WHO Sri Lanka Country Office.",

        "abstract": "Extreme hyperbilirubinemia leading to neurologic disability and death is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Bangladesh, and is largely preventable through timely treatment. In LMICs, an estimated half of all newborns are born at home and few receive screening or treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, leading to 6 million newborns per year who need phototherapy treatment for hyperbilirubinemia but are untreated. Household screening and treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy administered by a trained community health worker (CHW) may increase indicated treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in comparison to the existing care system in Bangladesh. 530 Bangladeshi women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy from the rural community of Sakhipur, Bangladesh will be recruited for a cluster randomized trial and randomized to the intervention arm - home screening and treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia - or the comparison arm to receive usual care. In the intervention arm, CHWs will provide mothers with two prenatal visits, visit newborns by 2 days of age and then daily for 3 days to measure transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) and monitor for clinical danger signs. Newborns without danger signs but with a TcB above the treatment threshold, but >15 mg/dL will be treated with light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy at home. Newborns with danger signs or TcB ≥15 mg/dL will be referred to a hospital for treatment. Treatment rates for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in each arm will be compared. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of CHW-led home phototherapy to increase neonatal hyperbilirubinemia treatment rates in rural Bangladesh. LMICs are expanding access to postnatal care by using CHWs, and our work will give CHWs a curative treatment option for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Similar projects in other LMICs can be pursued to dramatically extend healthcare access to vulnerable newborns with hyperbilirubinemia.",

        "abstract": "Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) systems provide an opportunity for health systems to understand the determinants of maternal and perinatal deaths in order to improve quality of care and prevent future deaths from occurring. While there has been broad uptake and learning from low- and middle-income countries, little is known on how to effectively implement MPDSR within humanitarian contexts - where disruptions in health service delivery are common, infrastructural damage and insecurity impact the accessibility of care, and severe financial and human resource shortages limit the quality and capacity to provide services to the most vulnerable. This study aimed to understand how contextual factors influence facility-based MPDSR interventions within five humanitarian contexts. Descriptive case studies were conducted on the implementation of MPDSR in Cox's Bazar refugee camps in Bangladesh, refugee settlements in Uganda, South Sudan, Palestine, and Yemen. Desk reviews of case-specific MPDSR documentation and in-depth key informant interviews with 76 stakeholders supporting or directly implementing mortality surveillance interventions were conducted between December 2021 and July 2022. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Dedoose software. Thematic content analysis was employed to understand the adoption, penetration, sustainability, and fidelity of MPDSR interventions and to facilitate cross-case synthesis of implementation complexities. Implementation of MPDSR interventions in the five humanitarian settings varied in scope, scale, and approach. Adoption of the interventions and fidelity to established protocols were influenced by availability of financial and human resources, the implementation climate (leadership engagement, health administration and provider buy-in, and community involvement), and complex humanitarian-health system dynamics. Blame culture was pervasive in all contexts, with health providers often facing punishment or criminalization for negligence, threats, and violence. Across contexts, successful implementation was driven by integrating MPDSR within quality improvement efforts, improving community involvement, and adapting programming fit-for-context. The unique contextual considerations of humanitarian settings call for a customized approach to implementing MPDSR that best serves the immediate needs of the crisis, aligns with stakeholder priorities, and supports health workers and humanitarian responders in providing care to the most vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "There is limited evidence regarding the proportion of wheeze in young children attributable to respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections (RSV-LRTI) occurring early in life. This cohort study prospectively determined the population attributable risk (PAR) and risk percent (PAR%) of wheeze in 2-<6-year-old children previously surveilled in a primary study for RSV-LRTI from birth to their second birthday (RSV-LRTI<2Y). From 2013 to 2021, 2-year-old children from 8 countries were enrolled in this extension study (NCT01995175) and were followed through quarterly surveillance contacts until their sixth birthday for the occurrence of parent-reported wheeze, medically-attended wheeze or recurrent wheeze episodes (≥4 episodes/year). PAR% was calculated as PAR divided by the cumulative incidence of wheeze in all participants. Of 1395 children included in the analyses, 126 had documented RSV-LRTI<2Y. Cumulative incidences were higher for reported (38.1% vs. 13.6%), medically-attended (30.2% vs. 11.8%) and recurrent wheeze outcomes (4.0% vs. 0.6%) in participants with RSV-LRTI<2Y than those without RSV-LRTI<2Y. The PARs for all episodes of reported, medically-attended and recurrent wheeze were 22.2, 16.6 and 3.1 per 1000 children, corresponding to PAR% of 14.1%, 12.3% and 35.9%. In univariate analyses, all 3 wheeze outcomes were strongly associated with RSV-LRTI<2Y (all global P < 0.01). Multivariable modeling for medically-attended wheeze showed a strong association with RSV-LRTI after adjustment for covariates (global P < 0.0001). A substantial amount of wheeze from the second to sixth birthday is potentially attributable to RSV-LRTI<2Y. Prevention of RSV-LRTI<2Y could potentially reduce wheezing episodes in 2-<6-year-old children.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to disruptions of health service delivery in many countries; some were more resilient in either limiting or rapidly responding to the disruption than others. We used mixed methods implementation research to understand factors and strategies associated with resiliency in Rwanda and Bangladesh, focussing on how evidence-based interventions targeting amenable under-five mortality that had been used during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) period (2000-15) were maintained during the early period of COVID-19. We triangulated data from three sources - a desk review of available documents, existing quantitative data on evidence-based intervention coverage, and key informant interviews - to perform a comparative analysis using multiple case studies methodology, comparing contextual factors (barriers or facilitators), implementation strategies (existing from 2000-15, new, or adapted), and implementation outcomes across the two countries. We also analysed which health system resiliency capabilities were present in the two countries. Both countries experienced many of the same facilitators for resiliency of evidence-based interventions for children under five, as well as new, pandemic-specific barriers during the early COVID-19 period (March to December 2020) that required targeted implementation strategies in response. Common facilitators included leadership and governance and a culture of accountability, while common barriers included movement restrictions, workload, and staff shortages. We saw a continuity of implementation strategies that had been associated with success in care delivery during the MDG period, including data use for monitoring and decision-making, as well as building on community health worker programmes for community-based health care delivery. New or adapted strategies used in responding to new barriers included the expanded use of digital platforms. We found implementation outcomes and strong resilience capabilities, including awareness and adaptiveness, which were related to pre-existing facilitators and implementation strategies (continued and new). The strategies and contextual factors Rwanda and Bangladesh leveraged to build 'everyday resilience' before COVID-19, i.e. during the MDG period, likely supported the maintained delivery of the evidence-based interventions targeting under-five mortality during the early stages of the pandemic. Expanding our understanding of pre-existing factors and strategies that contributed to resilience before and during the pandemic is important to support other countries' efforts to incorporate 'everyday resilience' into their health systems.",

        "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a significant cause of maternal mortality worldwide. The classification and treatment of hypertension in pregnancy remain debated. We aim to compare the effectiveness of the revised 2017 ACC/AHA blood pressure threshold in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement (AMANHI) biorepository study, including 10,001 pregnant women from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tanzania. Blood pressure was measured using validated devices at different antenatal care visits. The blood pressure readings were categorized as: normal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) < 80 mm Hg), elevated blood pressure (sBP 120-129 and dBP < 80), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130-139 or dBP 80-89, or both), and stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥ 140 or dBP ≥ 90, or both). We estimated risk ratios for stillbirths and preterm births, as well as diagnostic test properties of both the pre-existing JNC7 (≥ 140/90) and revised ACC/AHA (≥ 130/80) thresholds using normal blood pressure as reference group. From May 2014 to June 2018, blood pressure readings were available for 9,448 women (2,894 in Bangladesh, 2,303 in Pakistan, and 4,251 in Tanzania). We observed normal blood pressure in 70%, elevated blood pressure in 12.4%, stage 1 hypertension in 15.2%, and stage 2 hypertension in 2.5% of the pregnant women respectively. Out of these, 310 stillbirths and 9,109 live births were recorded, with 887 preterm births. Using the ACC/AHA criteria, the stage 1 hypertension cut-off revealed 15.3% additional hypertension diagnoses as compared to JNC7 criteria. ACC/AHA defined hypertension was significantly associated with stillbirths (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4, 2.3). The JNC 7 hypertension cut-off of ≥ 140/90 was significantly associated with a higher risk of preterm births (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2, 2.2) and stillbirths (RR 3.6, 95% CI 2.5, 5.3). Both criteria demonstrated low sensitivities (8.4 for JNC-7 and 28.1 for ACC/AHA) and positive predictive values (11.0 for JNC7 and 5.2 for ACC/AHA) in predicting adverse outcomes. The ACC/AHA criteria (≥ 130/80) identified additional cases of hypertension but had limited predictive accuracy for stillbirths and preterm births, highlighting the ongoing need for improved criteria in managing pregnancy-related hypertension.",

As parity advances more cesarean section are done for maternal rather than fetal indications. The objective of this study was to determine the indications and complications of caesarean section in multiparous women with history of previous vaginal delivery. This cross-sectional descriptive observational study was conducted in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital from January 2019 to June 2019 among 100 purposively selected multiparous women who underwent primary caesarean section. A well-designed, semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data by face-to-face interview, clinical examinations and laboratory investigations. Data analysis was conducted in SPSS 20.0 version. Majority (74.0%) of the women in this study were in the age group 21-30 years with mean age of 26.3±5.76 years. Majority of the patients were of second gravida (42.0%) followed by third gravida (33.0%). The highest gravida in this study was 6th. Most of the patients were of para 1(44.0%). Highest para in this study was para 5. The most common indication of caesarean section in this study was foetal distress (26.0%). The next common indications were cephalo-pelvic disproportion (22.0%), antepartum haemorrhage (13.0%), mal-presentaion or mal-position (16.0%). Other causes were PROM (8.0%), prolonged labour (6.0%), cord prolapse (2.0%), post-dated pregnancy (4.0%), severe pre-eclampsia (2.0%) and secondary subfertility (1.0%). There was no case of maternal mortality in this study but 15 mothers suffered from various post-operative complications like wound infection (4.0%), UTI (4.0%), puerperal pyrexia (3.0%), postpartum haemorrhage (3.0%) and paralytic ileus (1.0%). Among the babies delivered 97 were live births. Among the 97 live births 11(11.34%) were preterm babies. Among the babies delivered majority (85.0%) was with good APGAR score (7-10). In conclusion it can say that a multiparous women in labour requires the same attention as that of primigravida. A parous women needs good obstetric care to improve maternal and neonatal outcome and still keeping caesarean section to a lower rate.",

        "abstract": "In Intensive Care Units (ICUs) infection represents the most frequent complication leading to high mortality. Particularly the incidence of fungal infections, especially due to Candida spp., has been increasing during the last years. Over last two decades there is predominance of Non albicans Candida (NAC) infection with increased isolation of novel species and decreased susceptibility. Early identification of Candida species and determination of antifungal susceptibility pattern is essential for effective management. Therefore, the study was conducted to isolate and identify Candida species from the blood samples of the patients suspected of candidemia and assess their antifungal susceptibility pattern. This cross-sectional, descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Bangladesh from March 2021 to February 2022. Venous blood was collected from clinically suspected patients admitted at ICU, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh. Primary blood culture was performed by automated method followed by sub-culture in Saboraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) and blood agar media. Candida species were recognized by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Antifungal susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion and broth microdilution method (BMD). Out of 125 blood specimens collected, Candida species were isolated from 39(31.0%) blood samples of which NAC species were 35(89.0%) whereas C. albicans was only 4(10.2%). Eight (8) different Candida species were identified of which C. parapsilosis was predominant 16(41.0%). Rare and emerging drug resistant species of C. ciferrii 23.0%, C. auris 7.7%, C. rugosa 10.3%, C. lusitaniae 2.6% were also isolated. Candidemia was highest in neonate 33(84.61%) with male predominance 24(61.54%). Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged hospital stay, pre-maturity and low birth weight (LBW) were found to be important risk factors. In candidemia the highest resistance was to Fluconazole-33% and lowest to Voriconazole-5%. The study showed that NAC species were more common with emergence of rare and multidrug resistant species.",

Therefore, this study aimed to identify the influential factors contributing to stunting among under-five children in Cambodia. A secondary dataset consisting of 3268 under-five children was extracted from the latest Cambodian Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)-2021/2022 dataset. The Chi-square test and Boruta algorithm were used for covariate selection, and logistic regression approaches were used to determine the influence of demographic, socioeconomic and other factors on the presence of stunting. Findings revealed that about 21% of under-five children were stunted, and the prevalence of stunting was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The prevalence of child stunting was lower in families with highly educated parents. A child whose father had a secondary education had 0.71 times lower (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.520-0.969) chance of stunting than a child whose father had no education. Findings revealed that Ratnak Kiri, Mondul Kiri, Stung Treng, Pursat and Kampot had a greater prevalence of stunting than other places, ranging from 27.11% to 35.70%, whereas Banteay Meanchey, Phnom Penh and Kandal had the lowest rates, ranging from 12.80% to 16.00%. Results of the Boruta algorithm and logistic regression suggested that under-five stunting is significantly influenced by factors such as the child's age, size at birth, mother's age at first birth, mother's body mass index (BMI), father's educational status, cooking fuel, and wealth index. It is necessary to take initiatives for reducing the prevalence of stunted children prioritising the identified factors that ultimately help to reduce the burden of child health. The authors believed that the findings of this study will be helpful for policymakers in designing the appropriate policies and actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing stunting among under-five children in Cambodia.",

        "title": "Prevalence and barriers to early initiation of breastfeeding among urban poor full-time readymade garments working mothers: a mixed-methods study in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Early initiation of breastfeeding is the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth, which plays a significant role in a born baby's growth and survival, however its prevalence and predictors among urban full-time readymade garments (RMG) working mothers are not investigated. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and factors affecting early initiation of breastfeeding among urban RMG working mothers. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study was conducted between March 2023 and December 2023 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A total of 452 full-time female RMG workers were included for the quantitative study. Qualitative study was carried out among 30 full-time female RMG workers, four female physicians who were employed in the RMGs, four RMG factory managers, and four local pediatricians. The prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding was 40% among the women. It was significantly associated with various factors, including socio-cultural barriers, the advanced age of the mother (AOR 3.93, 95%CI 1.18, 13.04), lack of education (AOR 6.86, 95%CI 1.11, 42.49), lack of awareness, and cultural practices such as initiating goat milk and honey instead of breast milk. The absence of colostrum feeding (AOR 8.96, 95%CI 4.30, 18.70) and pre-lacteal feeding (AOR 0.06, 95%CI 0.03, 0.11) were significant baby feeding practice-related barriers to early initiation of breastfeeding. Maternal health factors, notably post-delivery sickness, cesarean delivery, and lack of breastmilk production, were revealed as a significant hindrance to the early initiation of breastfeeding explored from qualitative analysis. In addition, RMG factory-related factors that significantly affect early initiation of breastfeeding include a strong focus on production, a busy schedule, and a lack of initiative regarding the early initiation of breastfeeding. The prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding among RMG working women is poor. This study emphasizes the need for interventions that address specific challenges of early initiation of breastfeeding faced by working mothers in RMG sectors, including improved lactation education, increased awareness to mitigate cultural barriers, RMG factory-based initiatives to empower female workers early initiation of breastfeeding, and preparing early initiation of breastfeeding -friendly post-cesarean unit at the health care facility.",

        "abstract": "Preventable newborn deaths are a global tragedy with many of these deaths concentrated in the first week and day of life. A simple low-cost intervention, chlorhexidine cleansing of the umbilical cord, can prevent deaths from omphalitis, an infection of the umbilical cord. Bangladesh and Nepal have national policies promoting chlorhexidine use, as well as routinely collected household survey data, which allows for an assessment of coverage and predictors of the intervention. We used data from the 2017-2018 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, two large-scale nationally representative household surveys. We studied coverage of single application of chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord of newborns born in the past year using descriptive, bivariate and multivariable analyses. Key predictors of newborns receiving chlorhexidine cleansing, including socio-economic factors, healthcare related factors and the application of harmful and nonharmful substances, were explored in this study. Coverage of chlorhexidine cleansing was 15.0% in Bangladesh and 50.7% in Nepal, while the application of a harmful substance was 16.9% in Bangladesh and 22.6% in Nepal. Results from the multivariable analyses indicated that delivery in a health facility was strongly associated with a newborn's receipt of chlorhexidine in both countries (Bangladesh: OR = 2.23, p = 0.002; Nepal: OR = 5.01, p = 0.000). In Bangladesh, delivery by Cesarean section and application of another non-harmful substance were significantly and positively associated with the receipt of chlorhexidine. In Nepal antenatal care was significantly and positively associated with chlorhexidine, while application of a harmful substance was significantly and negatively associated with receipt of chlorhexidine. Maternal education, urban/rural residence, religion and sex were not significant in the multivariable analysis. Wealth was not a significant factor in Bangladesh, but in Nepal newborns in the two highest wealth quintiles were significantly less likely to receive chlorhexidine than newborns in the lowest wealth quintile. As Bangladesh and Nepal continue to scale-up chlorhexidine for newborn umbilical cord care, additional focus on newborns born in non-facility environments may be warranted. Chlorhexidine cleansing may have the potential to be an equitable intervention, as newborns from the poorest wealth quintiles and whose mothers had less education were not disadvantaged in receiving the intervention in these two settings.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the study was to establish an international multicenter registry to collect data on patients with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), in order to highlight a relationship between clinical presentation, age of onset and geographical distribution on the clinical outcome. Multicenter retrospective study involving different international societies for rare immunological disorders.1009 patients diagnosed with MIS-C between March and September 2022, from 48 centers and 22 countries were collected. Five age groups (<1, 1-4, 5-11, 12-16, >16 years) and four geographic macro-areas, Western Europe, Central-Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asian-African resource-limited countries (LRC), were identified. Time to referral was significantly higher in LRC. Intensive anti-inflammatory treatment, including biologics, respiratory support and mechanic ventilation were more frequently used in older children and in European countries. The mortality rate was higher in very young children (<1 year), in older patients (>16 years of age) and in LRC. Multivariate analysis identified the residence in LRC, presence of severe cardiac involvement, renal hypertension, lymphopenia and non-use of heparin prophylaxis, as the factors most strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes. The stratification of patients by age and geographic macro-area provided insights into the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of MIS-C. The mortality and sequelae rates exhibited a correlation with the age and geographical areas. Patients admitted and treated in LRC displayed more severe outcomes, possibly due to delays in hospital admission and limited access to biologic drugs and to intensive care facilities.",

        "abstract": "More children are surviving through interventions to address the infectious causes of under-5 mortality; subsequently, the proportion of deaths caused by birth defects is increasing. Prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care interventions for birth defects are available but are needed where the burden is highest, low-and-middle-income countries. A selection of birth defect focused publications, conferences, and World Health Assembly resolutions from 2000 to 2017 show that global efforts were made to raise the profile of birth defects in global public health. However, recent donor support and national government interest has waned. Without concerted global action to improve primary prevention and care for children born with birth defects, the Sustainable Development Goal targets for child survival will not be met. Birth defects make up 8% and 10% of global under-5 and neonatal deaths respectively, making them significant contributors to preventable loss of life for children. Survivors face long-term morbidity and lifelong disability which compounds the health and economic woes of individuals, families, communities and society as a whole. Demographic changes in sub-Saharan Africa portend a growing number of births with 1.6 billion projected from 2021 to 2050. More births and better survival without effective prevention and treatment for birth defects translates into more mortality and disability from birth defects. We recommend interventions for prevention of birth defects. These are evidenced-based and affordable, but require low- and middle-income countries to strengthened their health systems. Action against birth defects now will prevent premature deaths and long-term disability, and lead to stronger, more resilient health systems.",

        "abstract": "Prevalent use of antibiotics in hospitals results in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), rising mortality, and substantial financial burden. This study assessed the current pattern of antibiotic use among inpatients in tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Between August and November 2022, we conducted a point prevalence survey in 4 tertiary hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The World Health Organization-directed point prevalence survey methodology and tools were followed for the data collection. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were performed using Stata version 15. Of 1,063 hospitalized patients, antibiotics were prescribed to 73.5% (781/1063, 95% confidence interval: 70.8-76.1) of patients. A total of 1,164 antibiotics were prescribed, and 49.1% of patients consumed multiple antibiotics. Only 31.4% of patients were prescribed antibiotics based on microbiology results. The reasons for antibiotic prescribing were mentioned only in 19.3% of patients. Infants (adjusted odds ratio: 8.52, P-value: <.001) and neonates (adjusted odds ratio: 4.32, P-value: <.001) were more likely to consume antibiotics compared to adults. Cephalosporins accounted for the majority (54.0%) of antibiotics used in hospitals. None of the hospitals had any antibiotic use guidelines. Consumption of Watch group antibiotics empirically among all age groups demonstrates irrational antibiotic usage in Bangladeshi hospitals. Implementation of a tailored stewardship program, antibiotic use guidelines, and prescriber-patient awareness could improve the rational use of antibiotics.",

        "title": "Improved pediatric ICU mortality prediction for respiratory diseases: machine learning and data subdivision insights.",
        "abstract": "The growing concern of pediatric mortality demands heightened preparedness in clinical settings, especially within intensive care units (ICUs). As respiratory-related admissions account for a substantial portion of pediatric illnesses, there is a pressing need to predict ICU mortality in these cases. This study based on data from 1188 patients, addresses this imperative using machine learning techniques and investigating different class balancing methods for pediatric ICU mortality prediction. This study employs the publicly accessible \"Paediatric Intensive Care database\" to train, validate, and test a machine learning model for predicting pediatric patient mortality. Features were ranked using three machine learning feature selection techniques, namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost, resulting in the selection of 16 critical features from a total of 105 features. Ten machine learning models and ensemble techniques are used to make accurate mortality predictions. To tackle the inherent class imbalance in the dataset, we applied a unique data partitioning technique to enhance the model's alignment with the data distribution. The CatBoost machine learning model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 72.22%, while the stacking ensemble model yielded an AUC of 60.59% for mortality prediction. The proposed subdivision technique, on the other hand, provides a significant improvement in performance metrics, with an AUC of 85.2% and an accuracy of 89.32%. These findings emphasize the potential of machine learning in enhancing pediatric mortality prediction and inform strategies for improved ICU readiness.",
