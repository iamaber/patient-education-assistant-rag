        "title": "Prevalence and Associated Factors of Prediabetes and Diabetes in Rural and Peri-Urban Bangladesh: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Background and objectives The global burden of prediabetes and diabetes is rising rapidly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries like Bangladesh, where lifestyle and nutritional transitions are accelerating. Economically disadvantaged rural populations often lack awareness and access to care, making them highly vulnerable. Measuring the prevalence and identifying associated factors is essential for guiding public health strategies and resource allocation. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi community to inform targeted prevention and control strategies. Methodology We recruited 891 adults for this cross-sectional study in January-June 2020 through random sampling from the Mirzapur Demographic Surveillance System in Bangladesh, ensuring at least five years of residency. Trained Community Health Workers collected sociodemographic data using a semi-structured questionnaire and performed physical examination and anthropometric measurements. We used fasting blood sugar to screen patients for prediabetes and diabetes, and measured serum creatinine and urine albumin to creatinine ratio to diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also collected blood samples to measure serum albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Blood and urine samples were tested in an accredited laboratory. Results Prevalence of prediabetes was 38% (n=343), and diabetes was 17% (n=151). Age-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 5%, 12% and 22%, and of diabetes were 1%, 3% and 13%, for the age groups of 18-30, 31-45, and ≥46 years, respectively. Sex-specific prevalences of prediabetes were 22% and 17%, and diabetes were 9% and 8%, for female and male participants, respectively. In multiple multinomial logistic regression, for prediabetes, significant risk factor was age ≥31 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.84, 95%CI 1.64-4.92), and protective factors were smokeless tobacco use (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.36-0.94) and hypoalbuminemia (aOR 0.48, 95%CI 0.24-0.99), and for diabetes, significant risk factors were age ≥31 years (aOR 4.04, 95%CI 1.37-11.95), abdominal obesity (aOR 2.80, 95%CI 1.49-5.30), CKD (aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.70-4.62), hypercholesterolemia (aOR 1.97, 95%CI 1.17-3.30) and hypertriglyceridemia (aOR 2.33, 95%CI 1.44-3.79), and protective factors were being female (aOR 0.21, 95%CI 0.066-0.68), and smokeless tobacco user (aOR 0.32, 95%CI 0.17-0.63). Conclusion This study reveals a high burden of prediabetes and diabetes in a rural and peri-urban Bangladeshi population. The findings underscore the urgent need to strengthen community-based screening and targeted prevention strategies to address the growing diabetes burden in underserved areas.",

        "abstract": "Sales of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are rising in South Asia, yet UPF consumption and its sociodemographic determinants remain largely unknown. We aimed to quantify UPF consumption and investigate its sociodemographic correlates in four countries of South Asia. Between January 2020 and September 2022, the South Asia Biobank recruited 63,914 participants aged 18 years or older who were resident in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and North and South India, and self-reported as being of South Asian ethnicity. We analysed data from 60,714 eligible adults. Dietary consumption was assessed using interviewer-led 24-h recalls. Foods were classified by their degree of processing using the NOVA classification. Two-part multivariable-adjusted regression models examined associations of sociodemographic factors with the likelihood and quantity of UPF consumption. In Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and North India, ∼75% of participants reported consuming UPFs during the previous day, versus 41% in South India and Pakistan. Among consumers, UPFs contributed 13-17% of total energy intake, with biscuits being a common source across regions. Other UPFs included sweetened beverages in Pakistan, packaged salty snacks in South India, and breakfast cereals in Bangladesh. Younger age was associated with UPF consumption in Pakistan and Sri Lanka whereas in Bangladesh and North India, older age was. Women were more likely to consume UPFs in all regions except Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, and North India, any level of education above none (i.e., primary, secondary, or higher) was associated with UPF consumption. Among consumers, UPF consumption was lower in married or cohabiting than single people, in all regions. UPF consumption was higher in rural versus urban residents in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower in Pakistan. UPF consumption varied across South Asia by sociodemographic factors including age, gender, and education. Understanding this heterogeneity is crucial when designing interventions aimed at reducing UPF consumption. Our findings of regional variations in the types of UPFs consumed provide valuable insights for targeted interventions. The South Asia Biobank is funded by the National Institute for Health Research.",

        "abstract": "Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) affects metabolic and thyroid function parameters, which may worsen macrovascular complications. This study aims to find the association between chronic hyperglycemia, thyroid autoantibody, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, as well as examine important clinical demographic and metabolic variables. This is a retrospective cohort study. Data from 2017-2023 of T2DM patients were collected. A total of 300 patients were included. Further, the T2DM patients are subdivided by TPOAb values. TPOAb categorized (0-60 IU/mL) as negative; TPOAb titer (>60 IU/mL) as positive. To analyze the data, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 29.0.2.0 (Released 2022; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) was utilized. For continuous variables, the independent samples t-test for normally distributed data and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data were performed. The chi-square test was used to assess the association between categorical variables. The risk of PAD was assessed using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. P<0.05 was set as statistically significant.  The prevalence of PAD was significantly higher in the TPOAb-positive group (38.5%) compared to the TPOAb-negative group (21.6%, p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis finds that poorly controlled HbA1c had an increased risk of PAD compared to well-controlled individuals (OR: 2.14, p = 0.046). Those who had diabetes for >10-15 years showed the highest risk (OR: 3.67, P = 0.002), followed by those with diabetes for more than 15 years (OR: 2.22, P = 0.038). Similarly, TPOAb positivity was independently correlated with increased odds of PAD (OR: 2.48, P = 0.003) and therefore potentially heightened the risk of macrovascular complications in association with thyroid autoimmunity. TPOAb positivity is associated with an increased risk of PAD. In addition, poor glycemic control and longer diabetes duration were associated with PAD.",

        "abstract": "Current strategies to prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes focus primary prevention in high-risk groups and secondary prevention in people with known cardiovascular disease. We aimed to determine the proportion of events occurring in lower-risk groups globally. We included people aged 40 years to younger than 75 years who were enrolled in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which is an ongoing, international, prospective, population-based cohort study that started recruiting adults from households selected to be broadly representative of the sociodemographic composition of their communities. We prospectively documented fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or any other fatal cardiovascular event stratified by history of cardiovascular disease and by the 10-year predicted disease risk scores based on WHO 2019 laboratory risk tables (<10% [low], 10% to <20% [intermediate], and ≥20% [high]) in people without previous cardiovascular disease from 26 high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries. Outcome event rates were standardised for the cohort's age and sex distribution. Between July 11, 2000, and May 6, 2019, 128 973 participants were included from 26 countries (mean age 53·6 years [SD 8·2]; 75 858 [58·8%] were female and 53 115 [41·2%] were male). We observed 11 483 outcome events affecting 8·9% of the cohort during a median follow-up of 12·3 years (IQR 9·8-14·6). Among participants, 89 508 (69·4%) had a low cardiovascular disease risk, 22 363 (17·3%) had an intermediate cardiovascular disease risk, and 5529 (4·3%) had a high cardiovascular disease risk, while 11 573 (9·0%) had known cardiovascular disease. The age-standardised and sex-standardised cardiovascular disease incidence rates per 1000 person-years was 4·1 (95% CI 4·0-4·2) in the low-risk group, 17·7 (15·2-20·2) in the intermediate-risk group, and 40·8 (25·1-56·4) in the high-risk group. Overall, 41% of outcome events occurred in cardiovascular disease-naive participants at low risk. The proportion of adverse cardiovascular outcomes occurring in this low-risk group was inversely related to country income level (32% in high-income, 38% in middle-income, and 54% in low-income countries) and was higher in women (51%) than in men (32%). To achieve a substantial population-level reduction in cardiovascular disease, a fundamental change is needed, so that preventive strategies for cardiovascular disease extend beyond those at high or even intermediate predicted risk to include those at considered to be at low risk.

        "abstract": "The increase in overweight and obesity cannot be exclusively ascribed to environmental or lifestyle factors, since a substantial proportion of this phenomenon is impacted by genetic and racial factors. This study investigated the link between body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels among Marma tribal community members in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was carried out on the Marma tribe of the Bandarban using random sampling techniques to select the participants. A total of 208 (74 male and 134 female) respondents participated, and a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data. In addition to descriptive statistics, <i>χ</i> <sup>2</sup>, and logistic regression model were employed for analysis at a 5% significance level. This study reveals that 65.9% of the people belong to the 30-50 age group, followed by 28.8% of the 51-70 age group associated with BMI (<i>p</i> < 0.024). The prevalence of obesity (46%) is higher among females (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Physical activity level is associated with BMI (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Among all the subjects, 14.9% are diabetic, 37.5% are prediabetic, and 46.7% belong to the normal blood glucose range. The relation between physical activity level and body mass index is notable (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Blood glucose level and dietary diversity score are also significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05). There is no significant association between BMI and blood glucose levels, but a positive correlation exists. The BMI tends to be greater among females. Future research could compare it with non-tribal groups and use the HbA1c approach for a more comprehensive evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Managing coronary artery disease in diabetic patients, especially left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease, requires complex decision-making. Drug-eluting stents, such as the Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES), provide a less invasive alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting for revascularisation. We aimed to compare the mortality rates between patients with or without diabetes following left main percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using the Resolute ZES and to assess the major predictors of cardiac death based on baseline characteristics, lesion features, and procedural details. This retrospective cohort study conducted between 2010 and 2019 at a tertiary care cardiac hospital in Bangladesh involved 884 patients undergoing left main PCI with the Resolute ZES. The primary endpoint of this study was the difference in mortality between the two groups (diabetes vs non-diabetes). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes. Survival analyses utilised Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models for both univariate and multivariate analyses. All-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-1.61; p=0.67) and cardiac death rates (HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.43-1.65; p=0.61) were similar for the diabetes and non-diabetes groups, and the predictors of cardiac death in the multivariate analysis included age (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.13; p<0.001), elevated creatinine levels (HR 4.45, 95% CI: 1.80-11.02; p<0.001), and post-dilatation (HR 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.39; p<0.001); the Medina classification also showed a significant association with cardiac death. The use of the Resolute ZES was associated with comparable outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients undergoing left main PCI. Age, renal function, and certain procedural techniques are key predictors of cardiac death, emphasising the need for individualised patient assessment in LMCA disease management.",

        "abstract": "<b>Aims/Background</b> Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy and safety of thrice-weekly insulin degludec (IDeg 3TW) versus once-daily insulin glargine (IGlar OD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are scarce and not uniform. Moreover, no systematic review and meta-analysis (SRM) is available for such a comparison. This SRM aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of IDeg 3TW versus IGlar OD in the available RCTs in T2DM. <b>Methods</b> Electronic databases and registers, which include MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane Central Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov, were searched for RCTs conducted among T2DM subjects with IDeg 3TW as intervention and IGlar OD as control from inception to 30 July 2024. The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction from baseline; secondary outcomes were the changes in other glycemic parameters and adverse events (AEs). RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR), or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). <b>Results</b> Three RCTs (N = 1171) with study durations ranging from 16-26 weeks and minimal risk of bias were included. IDeg 3TW was less effective than IGlar OD in HbA1c reduction (MD 0.27%, 95% CI [0.14, 0.39], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), reduction in mean nine-point self-monitored capillary blood glucose profile (MD 0.45 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.22, 0.67], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and HbA1c reduction <7% (OR 0.69, 95% [0.53, 0.89], <i>p</i> = 0.005). IDeg 3TW outperformed IGlar OD regarding the mean daily insulin dose (MD -0.07 U, 95% CI [-0.13, -0.01], <i>p</i> = 0.02). However, both groups achieved comparable fasting plasma glucose reduction (MD 0.37 mmol/L, 95% [-0.19, 0.93], <i>p =</i> 0.19), changes in body weight (MD 0.04 kg, 95% CI [-0.46, 0.55], <i>p =</i> 0.86), and overall physical (MD 0.21, 95% CI [-0.62, 1.04], <i>p</i> = 0.62) and mental health scores (MD -0.02, 95% CI [-1.05, 1.01], <i>p</i> = 0.97). The risks for confirmed hypoglycemia (RR 1.16, 95% CI [0.83, 1.62], <i>p</i> = 0.38), nocturnal hypoglycemia (RR 1.18, 95% CI [0.49, 2.84], <i>p</i> = 0.71), any AEs (RR 1.04, 95% CI [0.84, 1.30], <i>p</i> = 0.71), serious AEs (RR 1.43, 95% CI [0.77, 2.65], <i>p</i> = 0.25), and injection-site reactions (RR 1.29, 95% CI [0.56, 2.96], <i>p</i> = 0.55) were identical in the two groups. <b>Conclusion</b> In short-term follow-up, IDeg 3TW was less effective than IGlar OD in glycaemic control; however, their safety profile was comparable. Larger multicenter RCTs comparing the overall benefit-risk ratio are necessary for appropriate clinical practice decisions. <b>Systematic Review Registeration</b> PROSPERO: CRD42024593493.",

We examine the epidemiology, assessment methodologies, and management approaches to osteoporosis in diabetes and discuss strategies to improve skeletal health outcomes. Public healthcare strategies for fracture risk reduction in diabetes include educating healthcare providers, empowering patients, and integrating fracture liaison services for secondary prevention. Community-based awareness programs, digital health solutions, and screening tools such as FRAX® (with diabetes-specific adjustments) facilitate early identification and management. Policies supporting insurance coverage and cost-effective management strategies are likewise crucial. Diabetes-related bone fragility, characterized by altered bone quality and increased fracture risk despite relatively preserved bone density, creates a significant yet underrecognized health burden.

This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4. Ongoing updates and local adaptations will be essential to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. This study was funded internally by WHO.",

        "abstract": "Catharanthus roseus (L.) (CR), is a perennial flowering herb, has traditionally been used by local populations in South Asia, Africa, China and Malaysia to treat diabetes, cancer and microbial infection. The principal objective of this study was to investigate the antidiabetic, antilipidemic and antiarthritic effects of methanol (MCR) and ethanol (ECR) extracts and dichloromethane fraction (DCR) of Catharanthus roseus leaves by in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico model. The in-vivo antihyperglycemic activity of C. roseus was explored in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Type- 1 diabetic mice model. MCR, ECR and DCR exhibited a significant ability to lower fasting blood glucose levels and normalized the altered body weight when treatment was carried out for 20 days in a dose-dependent manner. Among the experimental samples, ECR at 200 mg/kg (4.95 ± 0.31 mmol/L) showed greater fasting blood glucose lowering activity than the standard drugs metformin (6.8 ± 0.34 mmol/L), and glibenclamide (5.20 ± 0.29 mmol/L). MCR at 200 mg/kg, likewise significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the blood glucose (5.70 ± 0.12 mmol/L) compared to the control at day 20. The lipid profile (LDL, HDL, TG, and TC) of diabetic mice was significantly reduced by ECR in a biochemical study compared to the control group. The in-vitro antidiabetic study revealed a dose-dependent hypoglycemic potential of the extracts and fraction; where ECR showed the highest α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory effects with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.62 ± 0.02 mg/ml and 0.64 ± 0.01 mg/ml respectively. The antiarthritic activity was assessed by using bovine serum albumin denaturation inhibition assay and the denaturation was found to be inhibited by all extracts and fraction. The MCR and DCR fractions inhibited the denaturation by 70.20% and 62.09%, respectively, at 1600 µg/mL compared to the standard aspirin (81.57%). Moreover, the Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometric (GC-MS) investigation of the extract revealed several bioactive constituents and the in-silico docking study suggested that Ergost- 5-en- 3-ol, (3.beta.)-; Stigmasterol; 9,19-Cyclolanostan- 3-ol, acetate, (3.beta.)-;.gamma.-Sitosterol, and 24-Norursa- 3,12-diene would be the probable lead compounds for hypoglycemic and antiarthritic effect in many potential targets, however, further mechanistic and experimental elucidation is needed to solidify our findings.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity and cigarette smoking are significant public health issues that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Previous research often overlooks daily smoking patterns, focusing instead on smoking status or cessation. This study seeks to fill that gap, hypothesizing that food insecurity is positively associated with higher daily cigarette consumption. This study investigates the non-linear association between food security status and daily cigarette consumption using data from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). It introduces a novel statistical approach-the COM-Poisson Generalized Additive Model (CMP-GAM)-to capture the non-linear dynamics between these variables. The CMP-GAM model was applied to a sample of 819 adults, controlling for key variables like age, body mass index (BMI), and mental health conditions (anxiety and depression severity). The results indicated that while food security status did not significantly affect daily cigarette consumption, the age of smoking initiation was a strong predictor, with earlier smoking onset leading to higher daily cigarette use. Subgroup analyses among participants with cardiovascular disease and diabetes also did not reveal a significant relationship between food insecurity and smoking frequency. The findings suggest that targeted interventions aimed at preventing early smoking initiation may be more effective in reducing smoking prevalence and improving public health outcomes than addressing food security alone. This study highlights the need for further research into the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors and health behaviors like smoking.",

        "abstract": "Fetal distress due to maternal medical conditions during pregnancies can lead to significant neurodevelopment complications including language disorders. However, the relationship is largely understudied in developing countries like Bangladesh. The aim of the study was to determine the correlation between maternal medical conditions and subsequent language disorders in children experiencing fetal distress in context of Bangladesh. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between June, 2021 to June, 2022 at Z.H. Sikder Women's Medical College and Hospital, Bangladesh. Eighty children between 4 to 12 years with documented histories of antenatal or intrapartum fetal distress were recruited and assessed for language disorder by experienced clinicians using standardized diagnostic criteria. SPSS Version 12 was used for statistical analysis. The mean age of children was 6.54 ± 1.9 years, with 70% being male. Most children (70%) lived in rural areas with parents of low socioeconomic status. The reported maternal medical conditions included hypertensive disorders (40%), diabetes mellitus (30%), hypothyroidism (20%), and malnutrition (10%). Language disorders included delayed language acquisition (90%), receptive/perceptive disorders (60%), motor speech production impairments (60%), metalinguistic competence disorders (70%), cognitive linguistic disorders (80%), and pragmatic disorders (80%). Statistical analysis revealed significant associations (P < .05) between maternal medical conditions and all domains of language disorders. The results indicate significant relationship between maternal medical conditions, presence of fetal distress, and language disorders in children. Early identification and speech-language therapy during the neurodevelopment period could potentially improve outcomes.",

        "title": "Clinical insights into the role of smoking, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis in osteoporotic fractures.",
        "abstract": "Osteoporotic fractures pose a significant public health challenge, with various risk factors contributing to their incidence. Smoking, diabetes mellitus (DM), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are known to disrupt bone metabolism and increase fracture susceptibility. Moreover, smoking is a well-known risk factor of DM and RA, and thereby imposes a greater impact on osteoporotic fractures. This review explores the impact of these conditions on osteoporotic fractures, emphasizing the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the biochemical and physiological effects of smoking, DM, and RA on bone metabolism. The review focused on key regulatory pathways, including the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and inflammatory cytokines. Smoking contributes to osteoporotic fractures by altering bone metabolism through multiple mechanisms, including dysregulation of PTH, vitamin D, and the RANKL/OPG balance. RA disrupts bone homeostasis by increasing osteoclast activity, reducing osteoblast function, and elevating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Additionally, RA treatment with glucocorticoids further impairs calcium balance and bone integrity. DM accelerates bone resorption by upregulating osteoclastogenic factors (e.g., TNF-α, VEGF, RANKL) and suppressing osteoblastogenic pathways (e.g., Runx2). It also reduces essential bone-forming substances, including PTH and osteocalcin, while promoting the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products and adiposity, both of which negatively impact bone health. Smoking, DM, and RA significantly contribute to osteoporotic fractures by disrupting bone metabolism through direct biochemical alterations and treatment-related effects. Furthermore, smoking exacerbates both DM and RA, compounding the risk of fractures. Effective clinical management of these risk factors is essential to reducing the burden of osteoporotic fractures and improving patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Background Youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an escalating global public health concern, mostly driven by increasing obesity and insulin resistance. Leptin, a key adipokine regulating appetite, energy balance, and metabolism, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. However, its role in youth-onset T2DM remains unclear, with conflicting findings. Objective This study aimed to measure and compare circulating leptin levels between Bangladeshi young individuals with a clinical diagnosis of new-onset T2DM and normal glucose tolerance (NGT), and to investigate the associations of leptin with obesity markers, glycemic parameters, and insulin resistance. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 36 youth (aged 13-30 years) with a clinical diagnosis of new-onset T2DM and 36 age-matched individuals with NGT attending the young diabetes clinic of Bangladesh Medical University (BMU), Bangladesh, during 2017-2018. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, and fasting blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, and leptin levels by glucose-oxidase, chemiluminescent immunoassay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and both the T2DM and NGT groups were dichotomized to non-obese (including normal weight and underweight; for adults, BMI <23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, for children <85<sup>th</sup> percentile) and obese (including overweight and obesity; for adults, BMI ≥23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, for children ≥85<sup>th</sup> percentile) for subgroup analysis. Results Leptin levels were significantly lower in the T2DM group compared to the NGT group (median (IQR): 1.6 (0.2-6.6) vs. 11.0 (3.5-18.4) ng/mL; p < 0.001). Within subgroups, non-obese individuals with T2DM had lower leptin levels than both non-obese and obese NGT individuals, while obese individuals with T2DM had lower leptin levels than obese NGT individuals. Leptin levels positively correlated with BMI (ρ = 0.45, p < 0.001) and waist circumference (ρ = 0.28, p = 0.019) but negatively with glycemic parameters and HOMA-IR. In multivariate analysis, higher BMI and normoglycemic status were independent predictors of elevated leptin levels. Conclusions Despite a positive correlation with obesity markers, leptin levels were significantly lower in newly diagnosed youth-onset T2DM compared to NGT and had a negative correlation with insulin resistance.",

Research is needed to inform tailored interventions to improve the health behaviours (diet, physical activity and sleep) of people with SMI in South Asia as these behaviours are closely linked to obesity. The study aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators to healthy diet, physical activity and good sleep among individuals with SMI. A qualitative design was employed using photovoice, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Participants included 16 people with SMI, 16 caregivers and 17 health professionals in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Data were analysed thematically, informed by the socio-ecological framework. A complex interplay of individual, familial and societal factors influenced these health behaviours. Individual factors include knowledge, beliefs and mental health limitations. Caregivers play a crucial role in influencing behaviour. At the societal level, gender expectations, financial constraints and religious influences significantly impact these behaviours.

        "abstract": "L-Quebrachitol (LQB), a naturally occurring bioactive compound, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetic properties. However, its therapeutic potential in convulsant management remains largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the anticonvulsant effects of LQB in an In Vivo model and to examine its molecular interactions via In Silico docking simulations. In the In Vivo study, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 80 mg/kg to induce convulsions, and the test animals were treated orally with three doses of LQB (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg), with carbamazepine (CBZ) at 80 mg/kg as a standard drug. The results indicated that LQB at all tested doses significantly (p < 0.05) prolonged seizure latency and decreased convulsion frequency, with the 10 mg/kg dose showing the most significant effects. Furthermore, the combination of LQB (10 mg/kg) and CBZ (80 mg/kg) resulted in a synergistic increase in anticonvulsant activity. In the In Silico study, molecular docking analysis revealed that both LQB and CBZ interacted with the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), a key receptor involved in convulsions, with LQB demonstrating a binding affinity (BA) of -5.4 kcal/mol, which was moderate compared to CBZ's BA. LQB showed potential anti-convulsant activity in PTZ-induced convulsion animals, possibly through blocking sodium channel receptors. Further studies are needed to clarify its mechanisms and clinical potential in convulsion treatment.",

Its widespread ethnomedicinal use suggests promising pharmacological applications. This review comprehensively examines the origin, habitat, taxonomy, conventional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties of Acalypha species (AS). Data were compiled from more than 100 peer-reviewed studies retrieved from multiple scientific databases (e.g., PubMed, PubChem, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and others). Phytochemical structures were generated using Chemaxon Marvin Sketch, and data were evaluated to assess chemical diversity and biological activity. Key species such as Acalypha hispida, Acalypha paniculata, Acalypha fruticosa, Acalypha wilkesiana, and Acalypha indica are prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants contain various bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and phenolics, which demonstrate antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing effects. These findings support their conventional applications in managing a range of health conditions. However, toxicity profiles vary among species, highlighting the need for careful evaluation. The Acalypha genus represents a valuable source of bioactive compounds with significant therapeutic potential. Although traditional use and preclinical evidence are encouraging, limited clinical data and variability in safety profiles necessitate further investigation. Rigorous pharmacological validation and standardization are essential for the safe and effective integration of AS into modern medicine.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health concern caused by poor blood sugar regulation. Despite oral hypoglycemic medications, diabetes and its complications remain clinically serious. Using animal models and in silico research, the antidiabetic potential of Ficus racemosa (F. racemosa) has been assessed in this study. The methanol extract of F. racemosa fruits was prepared using suitable methods. After injecting Alloxan (150 mg/kg) into Swiss Albino mice to cause diabetes, both diabetic and non-diabetic animals underwent OGTT and acute toxicity testing. The antihyperglycemic action was assessed by administering oral doses of 300 and 500 mg/kg of the methanol extract of F. racemosa fruit, as well as 5 mg/kg of glibenclamide. Subsequently, in silico techniques such as ADMET profiling, molecular docking, and simulations were employed. The findings from this study suggest that mice have tolerated doses under 3000 mg/kg without death or side effects. In mice model, both doses of F. racemosa extracts effectively reduced blood glucose (BGL) after 7 days of oral administration. Molecular docking and simulations demonstrated that the SIRT1 receptor had a greater affinity for friedelin, lupeol acetate, gluanol, and ferulic acid. The molecular dynamics demonstrated that all the compounds are stable to the receptors, as revealed by RMSD, RMSF, Rg and SASA parameters. This study found that F. racemosa fruit extract significantly reduced hyperglycemia. Furthermore, four compounds may significantly contribute to the treatment of diabetes by reducing blood glucose levels. Thus, the findings of the current study may strengthen future research in the identification of antidiabetic compounds.",

Compared to controls without diabetes, subjects with T2DM exhibited lower unadjusted TBS in the combined sex group (MD -0.10 [-0.18, -0.02], P = 0.01), as well as in men (MD -0.02 [-0.04, -0.00], P = 0.02) and women (MD -0.05 [-0.07, -0.03], P < 0.0001). Individuals with T2DM also had a lower adjusted TBS in the combined sex group (MD -0.16 [-0.24, -0.08], P < 0.0001), men (MD -0.02 [-0.04, -0.00], P = 0.02), and women (MD -0.04 [-0.06, -0.02], P = 0.0005). While lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was higher in individuals with T2DM than in those without across all three groups, total hip BMD was higher in women and the combined sex group; femoral neck BMD was higher only in the combined sex group. According to the data analyzed in this updated meta-analysis, T2DM appears to adversely affect TBS, despite having a positive effect on BMD; however, the evidence level is very low. Larger and longer-term studies are necessary to explore the implicated factors and potential remedial strategies. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024608004.",

        "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) regained its position as the leading cause of death globally from a single infectious disease agent in 2024. Delayed diagnosis and treatment hamper effective TB control. We investigated the duration of diagnostic and treatment delay along with the associated factors among people with pulmonary TB in Bangladesh. A mixed-method study was conducted between December'19 and March'21, at icddr,b TB Screening and Treatment Centres (TBSTCs), Dhaka. We interviewed people with TB (PWTB) seeking care at these TBSTCs using a structured questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographic, clinical and healthcare seeking behaviors. We used established frameworks to define stages of delay and associated factors. Qualitative interviews were conducted among a subset of participants to gain further insight into the factors associated with delay. We enrolled 895 PWTB with mean (±SD) age 36.6 (±16.1) years; majority of participants were males (69.9%) and living in urban areas (82.3%). The median (IQR) patient delay estimated was 47 (29-72) days, with diagnostic delay 45 (30-70) days and treatment delay 2 (2-4) days. The predictors of delay were those with diabetes (OR 2.0, 95% CI - 1.11, 3.42), who initially self-treated (OR 2.1, 95% CI - 1.09, 3.88), and were bacteriologically diagnosed (OR 3.7, 95% CI - 1.31, 10.46). Qualitative approach supported the quantitative findings and revealed the practice of visiting formal physicians during worsening illness, neglecting to acknowledge signs or symptoms consistent with TB, lack of TB related knowledge, and financial insolvency as major reasons for delay. Our findings showed that improper health-seeking behavior is one of the major drivers of patient delay. Thus, targeted programmatic intervention to raise community awareness on TB and its care services with a special focus on informal providers can help reduce this delay.",

        "abstract": "<i>Codariocalyx gyroides</i> (Roxb. ex Link) Hassk has long been recognized in traditional medicine for its diverse pharmacological attributes. However, its potential hypoglycemic and analgesic properties remain insufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the in vivo hypoglycemic and analgesic activities of the methanolic extract of <i>Codariocalyx gyroides</i> (MECG), supported by in silico molecular docking analyses to elucidate possible mechanisms of action. The acetic acid-induced writhing assay investigated the analgesic activity in Swiss albino mice. MECG demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy, significantly reducing writhing counts at 200 mg/kg (45.66) and 400 mg/kg (55.11). The hypoglycemic potential of MECG was assessed in a Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic murine model, where a 200 mg/kg dose elicited a substantial reduction in plasma glucose levels. Complementary in silico analysis identified stigmasterol and lanosterol as key bioactive compounds. Stigmasterol exhibited a superior docking score (-7.9 kcal/mol) against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) relative to diclofenac (-7.2 kcal/mol), suggesting a mechanistic basis for the observed analgesic effects. Lanosterol demonstrated enhanced affinity (-10.3 kcal/mol) for the sulfonylurea receptor, outperforming the standard hypoglycemic agent Glibenclamide (-9.2 kcal/mol). These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of MECG as a dual-acting pharmacological agent, warranting further investigation to validate its clinical applicability in managing pain and diabetes.",

To assess the presence of fatty liver disease by ultrasonography (USG) and to find out its predictors in newly diagnosed young-onset T2DM. This cross-sectional study enrolled 137 newly diagnosed adolescents and young adult T2DM subjects (aged 10-34 years) by non-probability purposive sampling at a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh. Individuals with a history of alcoholism, pregnancy, infections, endocrinopathies, genetic disorders, or drugs that can cause fatty liver were excluded. Fatty liver was assessed by ultrasonography. C-peptide, anti-GAD65, and anti-IA2 antibodies were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay, and anti-ZnT8 antibodies by ELISA. Among 137 newly diagnosed adolescents and young adult T2DM patients, 92 (68.1%) had fatty liver on ultrasonography-58 (63%) with grade 1 and 34 (37%) with grade 2. Most were overweight/obese (67.2%), had central obesity (88.3%), and reported low physical activity (68.6%). Fatty liver was significantly associated with older age, higher BMI, WHR, and a positive family history of diabetes. On multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.25, p=0.004), positive family history of DM (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.29-8.22, p=0.012), acanthosis nigricans (OR: 5.05, 95% CI 1.59-16.04, p=0.006), and fasting C-peptide levels (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.92; p = 0.007) were significant predictors of fatty liver. Fatty liver is highly prevalent in young-onset T2DM at diagnosis. Age, a positive family history of diabetes, acanthosis nigricans, and elevated fasting C-peptide levels are strong predictors. Routine use of ultrasonography may facilitate early detection and management of liver disease in this population.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated robust vaccination strategies, including booster doses to sustain immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The comparative immunogenicity of homologous (same vaccine type) versus heterologous (different vaccine types) booster regimens remains understudied, particularly in diverse settings. This study assesses anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody responses to these regimens in Bangladesh. A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from March 2022 to February 2023. Seventy-three participants, selected via convenience sampling, were grouped into homologous (n=40) or heterologous (n=33) vaccine regimens based on primary and booster vaccine types. Anti-RBD IgG levels were measured pre-booster and three weeks post-booster using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant Reagent Kit (Abbott, Ireland). Demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, BMI, diabetes, and blood pressure) were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used, with p≤0.05 indicating significance. Participants (mean age: 35.51 years, 79.5% male) showed higher pre-booster (median: 4499.65 vs. 1863.7 AU/mL, p<0.001) and post-booster (median: 13835.15 vs. 10423.3 AU/mL, p=0.014) anti-RBD IgG levels in the homologous group compared to the heterologous group. However, the heterologous group exhibited a greater fold increase (median: 4.6 vs. 3.65, p=0.024) of anti-RBD IgG levels. A higher proportion of participants in the homologous regimen achieved high post-booster IgG levels (>20,000 AU/mL, p=0.016). Diabetes significantly reduced antibody responses in the heterologous group (p=0.006). Hypertensive participants had significantly reduced antibody responses before (p=0.005) and after (p=0.001) the booster in the heterologous group and after (p=0.033) the booster in the homologous group. Age, sex, and BMI had no significant effect on the results. Homologous regimens yield higher anti-RBD IgG levels, while heterologous regimens produce greater fold increases of anti-RBD IgG levels, indicating robust recall. Diabetes and hypertension impair responses, particularly in heterologous regimens. These findings support the need for tailored vaccination strategies to enhance immune protection.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the major causes of death worldwide. Onion peels have antioxidant and antidiabetic activities due to the presence of flavonoids and phenolic compounds. In current research, the antidiabetic potential of a herbal-based silver nanodrug synthesized using aqueous extract of <i>Allium cepa</i> peels was studied against Alloxan-induced diabetes in rabbits. The green synthesized reduced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and aqueous extract were characterized using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS-MS) analysis. After the acclimation period, the rabbits were divided into nine groups of 5 rabbits each (<i>n</i> = 5). Experimental animals were injected with a single dose of Alloxan monohydrate (160 mg/mL per kg BW) and then orally treated with aqueous extract of <i>A. cepa</i> peels and AgNPs at three dose concentrations (100, 200, 300 mg/mL per kg BW) for 20 days. Serum levels of blood sugar, renal function tests, lipid profile, and oxidative stress markers were determined photometrically. Results from mass spectral analysis revealed that quercetin and vanillic acid are the major phenolic compounds. XRD analysis confirmed the stabilization and shape of green synthesized AgNPs. Results from in vivo studies indicated that treatment with aqueous extract of <i>A. cepa</i> peels and AgNPs attenuated the Alloxan-induced diabetes in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by a decrease in blood sugar, triglycerides, urea, creatinine, and cholesterol to 100 ± 0.8, 57.66 ± 0.8, 38 ± 0.8, 1.11 ± 0.08, 40 ± 0.00 mg/dL, respectively, in rabbits administered with 300 mg/mL per kg BW AgNPs. The levels of oxidative stress markers (CAT, SOD, and GPx) in blood, that is, 3.6 ± 0.08, 6.0 ± 0.08, 918 ± 2.0 IU/mL, respectively, were also increased in rabbits administered with 300 mg/mL per kg BW AgNPs.

Then, in-vivo investigations were performed on the STZ-induced HFD type 2 diabetes mellitus (TIIDM) rat model, which included an assessment of acute toxicity, body weight, biochemical tests, and histopathological evaluation. Furthermore, an in-silico study was performed using AUTODOCK Tools 1.5.6 and BIOVIA Discovery Studio 4.0, then a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for 100 ns for the best compounds using Desmond. Our results reveal that methanol extract C. mitis (MECM) has no toxic effect in-vitro and in-vivo models. The MECM inhibited the α-glucosidase and α-amylase in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the MECM improves glucose uptake and normalizes GLUT-4, PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ expression in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, MECM treatment improved oral glucose tolerance and showed anti-hyperglycemia activity in HFD-STZ diabetic rats. The molecular docking and MD simulation results reveal that Sciadopitysin and Catechin of MECM are the desirable compounds for anti-hyperglycemia activity. The results suggest that C. mitis significantly reduces blood glucose levels through the PPAR- α/γ, GLUT-4, and is a promising natural antidiabetic agent.",

The NCDs prevalence significantly varied across divisions in Bangladesh, with Barisal having the highest hypertension (25 %) and Sylhet the lowest (18.1 %). Chittagong led in diabetes prevalence (12.0 %), while Rangpur had the lowest (4.8 %). For hypercholesterolemia, Barisal topped (34.9 %), and Mymensingh had the lowest (20.9 %). The significant risk factors of NCDs included age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category. Older age and obesity notably increased significantly (p < 0.05) the odds of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, while urban residence increased the odds of diabetes. Several factors, mostly age, occupational status, physical activity, and BMI category are responsible for higher prevalence of NCD diseases.

Consequently, it is worthwhile to investigate the serum vitamin E levels in Bangladeshi T2DM patients. <b>Methods:</b> 94 T2DM patients and 30 healthy subjects were evaluated for their serum vitamin E concentration for a comparative cross-sectional study. Mean serum concentrations were compared between these two groups, as well as among different sex and age groups using independent sample <i>t</i>-test and one-way ANOVA, as appropriate. <b>Results:</b> The serum vitamin E concentration was significantly lower in T2DM patients (mean ± standard deviation: 8.97 ± 2.99 μg/mL) than in healthy subjects (13.13 ± 2.70 μg/mL), <i>p</i> < 0.001. Additionally, male T2DM patients had significantly higher serum vitamin E levels compared to those in female patients (9.73 ± 3.02 μg/mL in males vs. 7.74 ± 2.53 μg/mL in females; <i>p</i>=0.001). The study showed a significant fall in serum vitamin E concentration with increasing age in T2DM patients (≤ 30 years: 12.7 ± 1.05 μg/mL vs. 31-50 years: 11.06 ± 2.65 μg/mL vs. 51-70 years: 8 ± 2.04 μg/mL vs. 71-90 years: 6.05 ± 0.78 μg/mL; <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that lower serum vitamin E levels are significantly associated with T2DM, particularly among female and older patients, highlighting the potential relevance of antioxidant status in T2DM management.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally different parts of <i>Litchi chinensis</i> Sonn. (Family: Sapindaceae) have been used medicinally to treat a variety of diseases, including stomach ulcers, flatulence, obesity, cough, diabetes, and hernia-like situations. This study investigates the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) profiling to detect different types of phytochemicals and antibacterial activity of various solvent extracts derived from the seeds of <i>Litchi chinensis</i> Sonn. Eventually, comprehending the potential biological functions of the detected compounds is explored. GC-MS analysis revealed a diverse array of chemical compounds, with 34, 35, and 25 compounds identified in the n-hexane, n-hexane-chloroform (2:1), and methanol extracts, respectively. The major compounds identified were 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) phenol (14.38%) in the n-hexane extract, hexadecenoic acid (13.35%) in the n-hexane-chloroform extract, and 2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol (39.16%) in the methanol extract. While most compounds exhibited biological activity, some were neutral or fatty acid derivatives. Notable bioactive compounds included bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and pentadecane in the n-hexane extract, naphthalene in the n-hexane-chloroform extract, and 13-docosanamide (Z) and beta-longipinene in the methanol extract. Antibacterial activity was tested against <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> and <i>Salmonella choleraesuis,</i> where methanolic extract showed the highest activity (ZOI-10 mm for both bacteria), followed by n-hexane extract and n-hexane-chloroform (2:1) extract, respectively. The study's findings highlight the potential of <i>L. chinensis</i> seed extracts as sources of bioactive compounds, supporting their traditional medicinal uses and suggesting possible applications in antimicrobial therapy. Future studies should focus on isolating and characterizing the key bioactive compounds and broadening the scope to test against additional pathogens and assess other biological activities, such as anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects, could further validate the medicinal uses of <i>L. chinensis</i> Sonn.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes remains a silent epidemic in underrepresented high-risk groups like professional drivers, highlighting the urgent need for informed health policies and targeted interventions. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and related health awareness among professional drivers in northeastern Bangladesh using opportunistic random blood glucose (RBG) testing to address knowledge gaps and inform health policy. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,454 participants enrolled between February 5, 2024 and July 27, 2024, using a consent-based questionnaire, anthropometric measurements, and RBG testing with a glucometer. Diabetes awareness was assessed using pre-tested questionnaires, while the prevalence of diabetes and associated factors were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U tests, Welch ANOVA, and Spearman correlation analysis. A total of 2.20% of the driver population were found to have undiagnosed diabetes. RBG levels differed significantly across regions. Middle age (7.63%) and overweight (3.77%) groups exhibited the highest prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Confounding variables such as BMI (r = 0.22, p < 0.0001), age (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001), and sleep duration (r = -0.05, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with glucose levels, indicating potential risk factors for diabetes. The obese group (AOR: 3.04, 95% CI: 0.81-11.46) and overweight group (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 0.83-3.99) were 3.04 and 1.81 times more likely, respectively, to develop diabetes compared to the healthy weight group. Participants with less than 7 hours of sleep (AOR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.46-2.75) were also at greater risk. Co-morbidities and a family history of diabetes were also significantly associated with elevated RBG levels. Overall, this study highlights the regional and behavioral disparities influencing the development of diabetes risk among professional drivers, a population often neglected in health policy. It underscores the need for health education and large-scale RBG testing to improve awareness and alert policymakers in formulating effective health guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Polymorphisms of the leptin receptor (LEPR) gene are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the association varies among different geographic populations. The present study aims to observe the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the LEPR gene (rs1137100 and rs1137101) with youth-onset T2DM in Bangladesh. Methods This case-control study encompassed 62 individuals with youth-onset T2DM (age range 18-29 years) and an equal number of age-matched controls with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Genotypes of both LEPR SNPs were expressed as AA, AG, and GG, where G is considered a risk allele. Results The frequency of G-allele was higher in DM than in NGT for both rs1137100 (55.6% (69/124) vs. 42.7% (53/124); OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.02-2.78; p=0.042) and rs1137101 (59.7% (74/124) vs. 41.9% (52/124); OR 95% CI 1.24-3.40, p=0.005). In the codominant model, the GG genotype was associated with DM (GG vs. AA: rs1137100: OR 3.37; CI 1.11-10.19; p=0.032; rs1137101: OR 4.93; CI 1.62-14.99; p=0.005) but not the AG genotype (AG vs. AA). In the dominant model, the risk variants AG+GG (vs. AA) of rs1137100 did not have an association (p=0.289), but rs1137101 had (OR 2.60; CI 1.07-6.33; p=0.035). In the recessive model, risk variant GG (vs. AG+AA) of both SNPs had an association with DM (rs1137100: OR 2.98; CI 1.19-7.47; p=0.017; rs1137101: OR 3.02; CI 1.25-7.27; p=0.014). No association was significant in any models when adjusted for body mass index (BMI).

The study was designed to assess the antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial potentialities of B. acuminata fruits ethanolic extract. Phytochemical characterization by HPLC analysis, pure compound isolation by column chromatography and in silico analysis were performed. Column chromatography was conducted to isolate pure compounds. HPLC analysis was performed using sixteen standard polyphenol s. Three different methods evaluated the antidiabetic effect of the extract. Analgesic property was evaluated. Protein denaturation and formalin-induction tests were done to measure the anti-inflammatory effect. Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia was followed to assess the antipyretic effect. Antibacterial tests were performed using disc diffusion and anti-biofilm activity assay. Binding interaction was investigated by molecular docking (MD) analysis. Moreover, oral bioavailability and toxicity profiles were analyzed using ADMET assay. We have isolated β-sitosterol and β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucoside from the extract. Presence of four polyphenols was evident by HPLC analysis. The extract and two isolated compounds showed prominent α-glucosidase inhibition. No mortality and abnormality were found in the acute toxicity test. The extract exhibited good peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in a dose-dependent fashion and antipyretic effect. The extract inhibited biofilm formation on the test bacterial colony. MD analysis revealed better binding characteristics of two identified phytosterols, rutin hydrate, and kaempferol with selected protein molecules. ADMET analysis exerted compliance with the compounds except rutin with Lipinski's rule of five.

        "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically map available evidence on menopause-related knowledge, symptoms and management in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and identify critical gaps to inform research and policy. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies were those that reported on menopause-related knowledge, symptom prevalence or management in LMICs. Data were extracted and synthesised descriptively and thematically. From 10,758 records, 252 studies from 41 LMICs were included. Most were cross-sectional (85%) and relied on non-probability sampling (62%), with only 4% being nationally representative. Menopause classification methods were often inconsistent, with only 17.5% of studies using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) +10 or World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. National-level data on age at menopause are lacking across all LMICs. The prevalences of vasomotor symptoms, joint pain and sexual concerns were comparable with high-income countries. However, data on the severity and burden of symptoms were scarce. Knowledge about menopause and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was poor, especially in low-income and rural settings. Cultural stigma, misconceptions and healthcare provider knowledge gaps contributed to low uptake of evidence-based menopause care. MHT use was consistently low, with women predominantly using traditional remedies. Provider hesitancy, lack of training and structural health system barriers were key limitations in service delivery. Despite a growing population of postmenopausal women, menopause remains a neglected health issue across LMICs. There is an urgent need to integrate menopause into reproductive and non-communicable disease policies, invest in provider education and ensure equitable access to evidence-based menopause care, including MHT, for women in LMICs.",

        "title": "Fatty acids and physical activity are critical for β-cell mass and insulin sensitivity: Pathways to T2D and prevention.",
        "abstract": "Existing mathematical models investigating the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D) over time primarily focus on glucose, insulin, β-cell mass, and other related factors, while often omitting fatty acids (FA) as an explicit variable-despite FA being a major energy source for the body. There exists a complex network of dynamical interactions among glucose, insulin, FA, and β-cell mass. To gain deeper insights into the metabolic dynamics and pathophysiology of T2D, it is essential to incorporate FA into such models. In this paper, we extend the classic Topp's GIβ model by explicitly incorporating FA and exploring its interactions with glucose, insulin, and β-cell mass. A new formula for insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub>) is proposed to better capture the impaired effect of FA on S<sub>I</sub>, enabling the exploration of diabetes development pathways and strategies for prevention or delay. Model simulations align well with clinical data and successfully replicate key characteristics of T2D progression, including declining S<sub>I</sub>, reduced β-cell mass, a sedentary lifestyle, and excessive dietary intake. Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation between glucose and FA levels, indicating that elevated FA is associated with increased glucose concentrations. Model analysis shows that FA levels in diabetic subjects rise significantly as a result of T2D development. Numerical analyses indicate that maintaining adequate physical activity or reducing dietary excess effectively preserves S<sub>I</sub> and β-cell mass, thereby reducing the risk of developing T2D. Most notably, our detailed simulations reveal a striking pattern: in healthy and non-diabetic individuals, FA levels consistently remain below glucose levels across their lifespan. In contrast, in individuals with T2D, FA levels initially remain lower but begin to increase sharply and tangle with glucose levels, and then surpass glucose concentrations near the time of β-cell failure. These patterns suggest that elevated FA may play a contributory role in increasing glucose levels, reducing insulin sensitivity, and ultimately leading to hyperglycemia. Our findings support the notion that glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity accelerate β-cell decline, impair insulin secretion, and drive T2D progression. Elevated FA thus emerges not only as a contributing pathway but also as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease development. Furthermore, the observed relationship between glucose and FA levels seems suggesting a quantitative marker that could be used to track progression toward T2D.",

        "abstract": "Background Among the elderly population of Bangladesh, diabetes mellitus (DM) is highly prevalent. DM has a strong relationship with musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders responsible for chronic pain, disability, and morbidity. Nevertheless, MSK disorder data of elderly diabetics are scarce in the literature, particularly in rural setups. The objective of this study was to evaluate the status of MSK disorders and their associated factors among elderly diabetic people living in rural Bangladesh. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we included participants with diabetes over 60 years from six rural villages in Muksudpur Union, Bangladesh. The details of the study, including data collection using the Community-Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) questionnaire, followed clinical examination. Disability was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and associated factors were analyzed statistically. Results A total of 234 older adults with diabetes were included from six villages of rural Muksudpur Union, Bangladesh, and were recruited. They were also subjected to clinical examinations after completing the COPCORD questionnaire. Disability was measured by the HAQ and analyzed by stepwise multiple linear regression. A total of 234 persons participated, yielding 179 (76.5%) with MSK pain, of whom 144 (61.5%) were women and 90 (38.5%) men. The lower back (50 (28.6%)), knee (38 (21.7%)), and foot (23 (13.1%)) were the most reported pain sites. MSK disorders were also significantly associated with obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) and uncontrolled diabetes. Functional disability was remarkable; 130 (55.5%) of participants were moderately disabled; 71 (30.3%), mildly disabled; and 33 (14.1%), severely disabled. Conclusion This study highlighted the high burden of MSK pain among elderly diabetics in rural Bangladesh, with women, obesity, and poor glycemic control as significant predictors. This finding emphasizes the need for early screening and weight control and for integrated healthcare strategies to ameliorate mobility and life quality in this susceptible population.",

        "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) and erectile dysfunction (ED) are among the most prevalent sexual disorders in men, significantly impairing quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to assess and compare QoL among patients with PE and ED. A cross-sectional, single-center study was conducted where participants aged ≥18 years with complaints of either PE or ED were included, while those with both conditions were excluded. PE, ED, and QoL, along with depression, were assessed using validated tools. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Continuous variables (e.g., QoL domain scores) were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Differences in QoL domain scores between patients with PE and ED were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. An independent samples t-test was used for the unadjusted analysis to compare mean differences in World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) domain scores between the PE and ED groups. For the adjusted analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed, controlling for potential confounders including depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)), physical illness, smoking status, physical activity, and education level. Among the 245 participants, 140 (57.1%) presented with PE and 105 (42.9%) with ED. Based on diagnostic tools, 87.1% of PE cases were confirmed using the Bengali-validated Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), and 95.2% of ED cases were confirmed using the IIEF-6. Both groups scored highest in the physical domain and lowest in the social domain of WHOQOL-BREF, with PE generally showing better scores. Depression was prevalent in both groups, affecting 72.9% of PE and 65% of ED participants, with severe depression slightly more common in ED (7%). Physical illnesses like hypertension and diabetes were more frequent in ED patients. Education level, active lifestyle, smoking status, and living place (urban vs. rural) were significantly linked to the environmental and psychological domains (p = 0.028, p = 0.008, p = 0.013, p = 0.030). A history of physical illness significantly impacted the physical domain (p = 0.032). Statistical analyses revealed that PE participants had significantly better physical and psychological QoL scores than ED participants, both before and after adjusting for confounders such as depression severity (PHQ-9), physical illness, smoking status, physical activity, and education level.  This study highlights that men with PE report significantly better physical and psychological QoL compared to those with ED, even after adjusting for key confounding factors. Depression and physical illnesses were more prevalent among ED patients, negatively influencing their QoL. Sociodemographic and lifestyle variables also played a notable role in shaping QoL outcomes. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing both sexual dysfunction and associated psychosocial factors.",

To summarize the therapeutic effects of beinaglutide in patients with overweight/obesity with/without type 2 diabetes. RCTs involving patients receiving beinaglutide in the intervention arm and placebo or active comparator in the control arm were searched through multiple electronic databases. The change from baseline in body weight was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, glycemic parameters, lipids, and adverse events (AEs). RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as mean differences (MDs), odds ratios (ORs), or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Six RCTs (<i>n</i> = 800) with mostly some concerns about the risk of bias were included. Over 12-24 weeks, beinaglutide 0.1-0.2 mg thrice daily was superior to the control group in reducing total (MD = -3.25 kg, 95%CI: -4.52 to -1.98, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 84%, <i>P</i> < 0.00001) and percent (MD = -4.13%, 95%CI: -4.87 to -3.39, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 54%, <i>P</i> < 0.00001) body weight reduction. Beinaglutide also outperformed the control group in achieving weight loss by 5% (OR 4.61) and 10% (OR = 5.34).

Beinaglutide and the control group had comparable impacts on blood pressure, glycemic parameters, insulin resistance, hepatic transaminases, and lipid profile. Beinaglutide posed higher risks of treatment discontinuation due to AEs (RR = 3.15), nausea (RR = 4.51), vomiting (RR = 8.19), palpitation (RR = 3.95), headache (RR = 2.87), and dizziness (RR = 6.07) than the control. However, the two groups had identical risks of total and serious AEs, diarrhea, fatigue, and hypoglycemia. Short-term data from RCTs suggested that beinaglutide causes modest benefits in reducing body weight, BMI, and WC, with no significant difference in glycemic and other metabolic endpoints compared to the control arm. Safety data were consistent with those of the other drugs in the glucagon-like polypeptide-1 receptor agonist class. Larger RCTs are warranted to prove the longer-term metabolic benefits of beinaglutide.",

In contrast, mutations in <i>HNF4A, HNF1A</i>, and <i>HNF1B</i> genes lead to progressive beta-cell failure and similar risks of complications as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare form of monogenic diabetes that usually presents within the first six months. Half of the cases are lifelong, while others experience transient remission. Permanent NDM is most commonly due to activating mutations in genes encoding the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel (<i>KCNJ11</i> or <i>ABCC8</i>) and can be transitioned to sulfonylurea after confirmation of diagnosis. Thus, in many cases, monogenic diabetes offers an opportunity to provide precision treatment. The scope has broadened with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, replacing older methods like Sanger sequencing. NGS can be for targeted gene panels, whole-exome sequencing (WES), or whole-genome sequencing. Targeted gene panels offer specific information efficiently, while WES provides comprehensive data but comes with bioinformatic challenges. The surge in testing has also led to an increase in variants of unknown significance (VUS). Deciding whether VUS is disease-causing or benign can be challenging. Computational models, functional studies, and clinical knowledge help to determine pathogenicity. Advances in genetic testing technologies offer hope for improved diagnosis and personalized treatment but also raise concerns about interpretation and ethics.",

        "abstract": "Wearable technology in the management of chronic diseases has emerged as a significant and growing concern in healthcare. These technologies, including smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other sensor-based devices, offer continuous monitoring and real-time data collection for individuals with chronic conditions. The data collected can include vital signs, activity levels, sleep patterns, and more, providing valuable insights into a patient's health. This trend is particularly relevant in the context of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and respiratory disorders, where continuous monitoring is crucial for effective management. Wearable devices empower patients to actively participate in their healthcare by facilitating self-monitoring and promoting healthy behaviors. Healthcare providers can also leverage the data generated by these devices to make informed decisions, personalize treatment plans, and intervene proactively. However, challenges exist, such as data security and privacy concerns, the accuracy of the collected information, and the need for effective integration into existing healthcare systems. Despite these challenges, the increasing adoption of wearable technology in chronic disease management reflects a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs through preventive and personalized care.",

        "abstract": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the preferred agents for managing type 2 diabetes in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and for reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in patients with heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction. We undertook this meta-analysis, as, to date, no meta-analysis has holistically analysed the potential benefits and safety of SGLT2i in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with MI who received SGLT2i in the intervention arm (initiated within 2 weeks of the index event) and placebo/active comparator in the control arm. The primary outcome was to evaluate the impact on cardiovascular death, all-cause death and HHF. The secondary outcomes were to evaluate the impact on echocardiographic parameters, N-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, MI, stroke, all-cause hospitalization and safety issues. From initially screened 8,922 articles, data from 6 RCTs were analysed (7,409 patients). Early initiation of SGLT2i following MI was associated with significantly lower future HHF (odds ratio [OR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.90; p=0.002; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=0%) and significantly higher left-ventricular ejection fraction (mean difference [MD]: 1.65%; 95% CI: 0.34-2.96; p=0.01; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=0%) compared with placebo. Compared with placebo, SGLT2i following MI had no beneficial impact on cardiovascular deaths (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83-1.30; p=0.76; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=0%), all-cause mortality (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.82-1.21; p=0.98; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=0%), stroke (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.26-1.27; p=0.17), all-cause hospitalization (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.97-1.32; p=0.11; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=0%) and percentage change in NT-proBNP (MD: 1.18%; 95% CI: -9.78 to 12.14; p=0.83; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=52%). SGLT2i were well tolerated without increased ketoacidosis, acute renal failure or hepatic injury. Early initiation of SGLT2i in acute MI is safe, well tolerated and associated with a reduction in HHF.",

        "abstract": "In-hospital mortality during COVID-19 treatment is a crucial metric used to assess the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of medical interventions. By identifying mortality risk factors, we aim to inform policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve preparedness for future pandemics. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Data were gathered from the hospital's electronic medical records between July 2021 and September 2021. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 218 patients with complete medical records were selected for the analysis. The independent variables examined included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. To assess in-hospital mortality, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis employing the Delta method. The study included 218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, primarily male (51.4%) with an average age of 56.4 years (standard deviation of 15 years). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 18.3%. Older age (≥60) (RR:3.10, 95% CI: 1.16-8.29), long-standing hypertension (≥5 years) (RR:2.78, 95% CI:1.54-5.02), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR:4.43, 95% CI:2.93-6.70) were significant risk factors for mortality. Patients with diabetes (≥3 years) had a moderately increased risk (RR:1.68, 95% CI: 1.01-2.83). Notably, shorter hospital stays (≤7 days) were associated with higher mortality, potentially due to delayed treatment initiation. Moreover, Vaccinated patients have a significantly lower risk of death (RR: 0.07) compared to unvaccinated patients, highlighting the protective effect of vaccination. Greater lung involvement (especially in lower lobes) and higher Total Severity Scores (TSS ≥ 14) strongly predict COVID-19 mortality, with non-survivors exhibiting significantly worse radiographic damage. Age, particularly when combined with chronic conditions like hypertension or chronic kidney disease, is a key predictor of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. While gender is not an independent risk factor, males tend to have higher mortality rates. Delayed treatment, reflected by shorter hospital stays, also increases risk. Vaccination markedly lowers mortality. In resource-limited settings, lower lobe involvement >50% and TSS ≥ 14 can serve as early triage markers to guide ICU admission or intensified care. These indicators should inform risk assessment tools, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to reduce pandemic-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health concern, particularly prevalent in low to middle-income countries like Bangladesh. This case-control study aims to explore the correlation between the <i>ADIPOQ</i> rs1501299 polymorphism and susceptibility to T2DM among the population of Noakhali region of Bangladesh. The study, involving 152 T2DM patients and 118 healthy controls, explores the genetic underpinnings of T2DM, considering the rising prevalence in Bangladesh. The <i>ADIPOQ</i> gene, implicated in diabetes development, is examined for the rs1501299 polymorphism, known for its associations with insulin resistance and T2DM in various populations. Genotyping, conducted through PCR and RFLP analysis, reveals significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the TT genotype, suggesting potential demographic influences. Clinical and biochemical characteristics, including blood pressure and lipid levels, highlight the complex interplay between genetics, metabolic outcomes and cardiovascular health in T2DM patients. This study identifies a significant association between the <i>ADIPOQ</i> rs1501299 T allele and increased T2DM risk, emphasizing the need for personalized risk assessment. However, <i>ADIPOQ</i> rs1501299 did not show any substantial association with CVD in the studied population.

        "abstract": "Traditionally regarded as a vestigial organ, the appendix is now being reevaluated for its significant function in health and nutrition of humans. Serving as a \"safe house\" for beneficial, desired gut bacteria, the appendix is protected by resilient biofilms that create a secure environment. This makes the appendix a\"basin\" for gut microbiota (GM), replenishing the microbial population following disruptions from infections, antibiotic use, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Beyond simply hosting bacteria, the appendix has an active role in functions of the immune system. Disruption of the Appendix Microbiome (AM), such as through appendectomy, was found to result in lowered diversity of gut microorganisms and an increased risk of various diseases. The potential therapeutic applications of the AM are a particularly promising area of research. The appendix's unique microbial environment and its impact on immunity open new avenues for treatments. These include modulating GM to improve cancer treatment outcomes, mitigating IBD, regulating metabolic pathways in obesity and diabetes, influencing neurotransmitter production in neurological disorders, and addressing cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. This review highlights the appendix's transformation from a misunderstood organ to a critical component of gut health and immunity. It explores the function of the human appendix as a resilient reservoir for desired microorganisms, and its role in disease progression. Furthermore, it examines the potential therapeutic applications of AM, presenting exciting opportunities for future research and treatment innovations.",

Its therapeutic potential includes addressing cancer, diabetes, and antibiotic-resistant infections, making it a promising candidate for drug discovery. This study focused on isolating active compounds from the n-hexane and dichloromethane (DCM) fractions of the plant's ethanolic extract employing size exclusion chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It also aimed to assess their potential antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic activities while validating traditional uses through experimental and computational approaches. The biological activities of these compounds were tested through cytotoxicity and antimicrobial assays, glucose-lowering experiments in mice, and molecular docking to simulate interactions with disease-related proteins. Five compounds were isolated, including β-amyrin, 7β-hydroxysitosterol, oleanolic acid, lauric acid, and viscic acid. Notable findings include high cytotoxicity (LC<sub>50</sub> = 0.231 µg/mL for the n-hexane fraction), antimicrobial activity with inhibition zones reaching 19 mm, and a 57.53% reduction in blood glucose levels (DCM fraction, 400 mg/kg, 3 h). Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding affinities for the isolated compounds against targeted receptors.

        "abstract": "The built environment around schools that are regularly accessed by young people is determined by governments, national and regional policies in each country or region. Zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol sales are expected to restrict availability and access by young people. This study aimed to examine (non) compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations around schools in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a representative sample of geographic locations in Bangladesh, India North (Delhi) and India South (Chennai), Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the built environment was mapped by systematically walking all streets within the site boundary to collect data on different types of tobacco and alcohol retailers and schools. Data was collected on KoboToolBox, and the maps indicating zoning compliance were created using ArcGIS. Descriptive analysis of outlet compliance to the zoning laws was conducted at the national and school levels, with heterogeneity analyses done by school type, income level and outlet type for tobacco and alcohol. The zoning regulations for tobacco and alcohol differed among the settings ranging from 50 to 100 m for tobacco and absolute bans to 500 m for on-premise alcohol. Among the five different settings within the four countries, 441 areas were studied, including 3615 schools. Non-compliance with the zoning laws is evident in all jurisdictions for both tobacco and alcohol. Within restricted zones around schools (location non-compliant with zoning laws), 12-38% of outlets selling tobacco and 16% to 100% of outlets selling alcohol were identified. For supply non-compliance, 3-70% of shops within the school buffer zones were selling tobacco, while only 0.2-1% of shops were selling alcohol. Non-compliance with tobacco and alcohol zoning regulations has been observed around schools in Bangladesh, India (North and South), Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Within each country, there was a higher percentage of alcohol outlets that were location non-compliant than for tobacco, except for South India. In India and Sri Lanka, there was a higher percentage of supply non-compliance for tobacco than alcohol. This study calls for governments to strictly enforce existing zoning regulations that are expected to restrict access to tobacco and alcohol for young people.",

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between SUA and dyslipidemia, as well as its components, among young adults in Bangladesh. This study consisted of 458 participants (281 male and 177 female) aged between 18 and 30 years. The levels of SUA, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile (TG, TC, HDL-C and LDL-C) were measured using standard colorimetric methods. Bivariate logistic regression modelling was used to examine the relationship between SUA and dyslipidemia and its components. The overall prevalence of hyperuricemia was 24% with 27.6% in males and 18.6% in females. Males had a higher mean SUA level (6.6 ± 1.5 mg/dL) than females (5.3 ± 1.2 mg/dL) (p < 0.001). The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 74.2% with 83.2% in male and 59.8% in female subjects. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, high LDL-C and low HDL-C was 30.1%, 26.2%, 28.8% and 64.8%, respectively. There was an increasing trend in the level and prevalence of elevated lipid profile markers across the SUA quartiles (p < 0.001). SUA level showed a positive correlation with TG, TC and LDL-C and a negative correlation with HDL (p < 0.001). In regression analysis, a significant association was found between SUA and dyslipidemia in all participants as well as in the male-female groups separately (at least p < 0.05). Furthermore, a significant association (p < 0.001) was found between SUA and individual lipid components in the regression models. Dyslipidemia and its components were more prevalent in individuals with hyperuricemia than in those without.

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether targeting 1-hour PPG (1 hPG) vs 2-hour PPG (2 hPG) altered fetomaternal outcomes in GDM. Studies that compared pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing 1 hPG vs 2 hPG monitoring in GDM were identified through comprehensive search of electronic databases. Primary outcomes analyzed were large-for-gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia. Secondary outcomes included low birthweight (LBW), neonatal intensive-care unit admission, neonatal hypoglycemia, cesarean section (CS), pre-eclampsia, gestational age at delivery, and preterm delivery. Six articles that compared 1 hPG<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) vs 2 hPG <120 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L) were analyzed. Additionally, 3 articles that assessed 1 hPG<120 mg/dL vs1 hPG<140 mg/dL were also examined. Targeting 1 hPG<140 mg/dL vs 2 hPG<120 mg/dL significantly lowered the risk of LGA [odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.93; P = .03] but not macrosomia [OR 0.45; 95%CI:0.19-1.06; P = .07]. There was no difference in other parameters such as birthweight [mean difference -61.77g; 95%CI:-152.16-28.62; P = .018], LBW [OR 0.90; 95%CI:0.30-2.68;P = .85], neonatal hypoglycemia [OR 0.60; 95%CI:0.28-1.26; P = .18], gestational age at delivery [mean difference 0.20 weeks; 95%CI:-0.29-0.68; P = .43], CS [OR 0.99; 95%CI:0.46-2.12;P = .97], pre-eclampsia [OR 0.66;95% CI:.22-1.96; P = .46], or need for insulin therapy [OR 1.39; 95%CI:.79-2.43; P = .25]. More intensive 1 hPG target <120 mg/dL vs <140 mg/dl increased the risk of preterm delivery [OR 1.62; 95% CI:1.00-2.62; P = .05], without affecting birthweight, LGA, macrosomia, LBW, and CS. Our findings suggest that targeting 1 hPG <140 mg/dL vs 2 hPG<120 mg/dL lowers the risk of LGA, but does not affect other parameters. A stricter target of 1 hPG<120 mg/dL can increase the risk of preterm delivery. Further studies to corroborate these findings are necessary.",

Nevertheless, epidemiological studies often cluster SAH with other stroke types leaving its distinct burden estimates obscure. To estimate the worldwide burden of SAH. Based on the repeated cross-sectional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, the global burden of SAH in 1990 to 2021 was estimated. Moreover, the SAH burden was compared with other diseases, and its associations with 14 individual risk factors were investigated with available data in the GBD 2021 study. The GBD study included the burden estimates of nontraumatic SAH among all ages in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2021. SAH and 14 modifiable risk factors. Absolute numbers and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) of SAH incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as well as risk factor-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs). In 2021, the global age-standardized SAH incidence was 8.3 (95% UI, 7.3-9.5), prevalence was 92.2 (95% UI, 84.1-100.6), mortality was 4.2 (95% UI, 3.7-4.8), and DALY rate was 125.2 (95% UI, 110.5-142.6) per 100 000 people. The highest burden estimates were found in Latin America, the Caribbean, Oceania, and high-income Asia Pacific. Although the absolute number of SAH cases increased, especially in regions with a low sociodemographic index, all age-standardized burden rates decreased between 1990 and 2021: the incidence by 28.8% (95% UI, 25.7%-31.6%), prevalence by 16.1% (95% UI, 14.8%-17.7%), mortality by 56.1% (95% UI, 40.7%-64.3%), and DALY rate by 54.6% (95% UI, 42.8%-61.9%). Of 300 diseases, SAH ranked as the 36th most common cause of death and 59th most common cause of DALY in the world. Of all worldwide SAH-related DALYs, 71.6% (95% UI, 63.8%-78.6%) were associated with the 14 modeled risk factors of which high systolic blood pressure (population attributable fraction [PAF] = 51.6%; 95% UI, 38.0%-62.6%) and smoking (PAF = 14.4%; 95% UI, 12.4%-16.5%) had the highest attribution. Although the global age-standardized burden rates of SAH more than halved over the last 3 decades, SAH remained one of the most common cardiovascular and neurological causes of death and disabilities in the world, with increasing absolute case numbers. These findings suggest evidence for the potential health benefits of proactive public health planning and resource allocation toward the prevention of SAH.",

This new threshold yielded higher sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and agreement with other standard diagnostic tests. Notably, hyperglycaemic symptoms were not required for diagnosis. The number needed to screen to identify one case of type 2 diabetes using the ≥8.7 mmol/L cut-off was 2.74, lower than that for fasting plasma glucose (2.86) and random capillary blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (4.68). Random capillary blood glucose may be an effective and affordable diagnostic tool for type 2 diabetes in resource-limited settings. The proposed cut-off of ≥8.7 mmol/L offers improved diagnostic accuracy and reflects the population's glucose distribution pattern.",

        "abstract": "Limitations in cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior are hallmarks of Intellectual Disability (ID), a neurodevelopmental disease. Specific genetic disorders that result in ID can also have immune system anomalies, such as changes in T (CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>) cell activity. This work aimed to compare single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transcriptome data to find biomarkers linked to T cells that could potentially be utilized for the diagnosis and assessment of ID. After integrating genes and performing a comparative analysis 196 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Furthermore, the DAVID online platform and FunRich software were utilized to detect signal transduction and translation, immune response, MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) class II, antigen processing and presentation, allograft rejection and important pathways of type I diabetes mellitus. In this investigation, six ribosomal proteins (RPS27A, RPS21, RPS18, RPS7, RPS5, and RPL9) have been identified as the hub genes of ID from PPI. Additionally, eleven topological algorithms discovered only one hub protein, namely RPS27A from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Through the analysis of the regulatory network, we have identified several crucial transcriptional factors (TFs) including FOXC1, FOXL1, and GATA2; microRNAs such as mir-92a-3p, and mir-16-5p were investigated by procedural data analysis. This study used scRNA-seq and transcriptomics data analysis to define unique biomarkers associated with T cell types throughout the progression of ID. Ongoing research on the activity of ID genes is contributing to a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of ID and will become more scientific and research-based in future.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention model by observing people's health conditions in a rural area of Bangladesh. Through a repeated cross-sectional design, health outcomes were assessed at six-month intervals over 18 months. The data presented in this paper are obtained from the model's pilot implementation in one catchment area in Bangladesh. The model involved community health workers (CHWs) using a smart health kit and Artificial Intelligence(AI)-based mobile application to provide monthly doorstep health education, screenings, risk assessments, and digital referrals. Socio-demographic and health measurement data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between diseases and their respective risk factors. We compared health vitals across three consecutive periods to determine the effectiveness of the model in improving health outcomes over time. The model served 32,581 people from 7,090 households during this operation. We found that 21.76% of the served population were overweight, 8.18% had prehypertension, 16.45% had high blood glucose, and 11% children were malnourished. From the analysis of risk factors, we found that people aged <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>></mo> <mtext>40</mtext></mrow> </math> were associated with developing hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases(CVD). CVD was associated with hypertension and stroke. A comparative analysis of different periods showed an improvement in BMI, BP, and MUAC. Blood glucose measurements did not show significant improvement. This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of digital health interventions in enhancing primary healthcare in rural settings. Integration of AI-driven decision support with CHW-led health education and screenings can improve early detection, intervention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Scaling up this model through public-private partnerships offers a cost-effective approach to bridging healthcare gaps and promoting universal health coverage.",

        "abstract": "The 'Developing and evaluating an adapted behavioural activation intervention for depression and diabetes in South Asia (DiaDeM)' trial investigates a psychological intervention, behavioural activation (BA), on people with both diabetes and depression in Bangladesh and Pakistan. This study aimed to aid the intervention and trial design. This was a modelling study using microsimulation to assess the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Diabetes was modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study model based on Pakistani patients and depression was modelled using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) trajectories allowing for multiple depressive episodes. It was assumed that diabetes-related adverse events increased depression recurrence, while depression impacted haemoglobin A1c, increasing diabetes-related events. The model estimated (1) maximum cost of BA which would be cost-effective (headroom analysis) to inform intervention design, and (2) value of reducing uncertainty around different measures (value of information analysis) to prioritise data collection in the DiaDeM study. Analysis was conducted from a Pakistani healthcare perspective over a lifetime with costs and outcomes discounted at 3%. BA plus usual care was compared against usual care. BA involved six sessions by a trained (non-mental health) facilitator. The usual care comparator was the prevailing mix of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used in Pakistan. The primary outcome was disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Secondary outcomes included life years, healthcare costs and the rate of depression and diabetes-related events. Over their lifetime, individuals receiving BA plus usual care avoid 3.2 (95% credible interval: 2.7 to 3.8) years of mild depression and experience fewer diabetes-related events. BA plus usual care resulted in an additional 0.27 (0.03 to 0.52) life years, 0.98 (0.45 to 1.86) DALYs averted and had incremental healthcare costs of -US$97 (-US$517 to US$142), excluding BA costs. The maximum cost per BA course at which was cost-effective is US$83 (US$9 to US$214). Value of information analysis found the most important measures to include in the trial are the impact of depression on diabetes and PHQ-9 over time. This is the first model to jointly model depression and diabetes for South Asia and uses novel methods to reflect the diseases and inform intervention and trial design. This evidence has helped to inform the design of the DiaDeM intervention and the trial to evaluate it.

        "abstract": "Studies of correlates of active transport to and from school (ATS) focus mainly on children, have a limited conceptualisation of ATS trips, lack heterogeneity in built environments, and rarely consider effect modifiers. This study aimed to estimate associations of parent-perceived neighbourhood environment characteristics with self-reported ATS among adolescents from 14 countries, and whether associations differ by sex, city/region, and distance to school. Observational cross-sectional design. Data were from the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) Adolescent study and included 6302 adolescents (mean age 14.5 ± 1.7 years, 54% girls) and a caretaker from 16 diverse sites. Adolescents self-reported usual travel to and from school by walking and bicycling (days/week) and time it would take to walk. Parents completed the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale for Youth (13 scores computed). Generalised additive mixed models estimated associations of parent neighbourhood perceptions with 1) any active transport to/from school, 2) regular walking (5-10 times/week), 3) regular cycling to/from school, and 4) profiles of ATS generated using latent profile analyses. Interactions were also explored. Overall, 58.7% reported any ATS, 39.9% regularly walked, 7.7% regularly cycled, and four profiles of ATS were identified: walk to and from school; walk from school; cycle to and from school; no ATS. Distance to school was negatively associated with all outcomes, though evidence was weak for regular cycling to/from school. Land use mix - diversity was positively related to all ATS outcomes except those related to cycling. Accessibility and walking facilities were associated with higher odds of any ATS, regular walking to/from school, and the profile walking to and from school. Residential density was negatively related to regular cycling to/from school. Positive associations were observed between traffic safety and any ATS, and between safety from crime, aesthetics, and odds of regular cycling to/from school. Distance to school, adolescent sex, and city moderated several associations. Parent perceptions of compact, mixed-use development, walking facilities, and both traffic and crime-related safety were important supportive correlates of a range of ATS outcomes among adolescents in high- and low-middle-income countries. Policies that achieve these attributes should be prioritised to support more widespread ATS.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing public health issue in Bangladesh, projected to affect 13.7 million individuals by 2045. Physical inactivity and poor dietary habits increase the risk of complications. This study examined the effects of physical activity and lifestyle modifications on T2DM management. A case-control study was conducted at Manikganj District Diabetic Hospital with 334 T2DM patients (aged 45-60 years). The case group (n = 167) followed structured physical activity and dietary modifications, while the control group (n = 167) did not. Data on socio-demographics, lifestyle and glycaemic markers-fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) and HbA1c-were collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Chi-square tests and ordinal logistic regression models assessed associations between lifestyle factors and glycaemic outcomes. The control group had significantly higher plasma glucose levels, associated with gender (p < 0.001), treatment type (p = 0.004), medical adherence (p = 0.009), food habits (p = 0.007) and BMI (p = 0.005). The case group showed a significant FPG reduction from 10.035 mmol/L to 6.261 mmol/L (p < 0.001), with similar trends for PPG and HbA1c. Males had 1.8 times higher odds of elevated FPG, while poor adherence increased this risk 2.5-fold. Lifestyle modifications significantly improve glycaemic control in T2DM patients.

        "abstract": " A reliable marker of COVID-19 past infection is the anti-spike IgG antibody (Ab) titer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be identified even one year from diagnosis. Serology can be effective in diagnosing asymptomatic infection and patients with negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Exploring these dynamics and the persistence of antibodies is vital to understanding the disease process.  We designed this observational study to compare the seroconversion status of COVID-19 patients to healthy healthcare workers. The total number of participants was 272, including 58 hospitalized (recovered) patients, 153 healthcare workers (HCWs), and 61 control populations from the community. A total of 404 samples were taken for IgG titer measurements using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.  Among 58 COVID-19 patients, 58.6% were men, and the male-to-female ratio was 1:1.41. All hospitalized patients had three months of persistence of Ab titer. The median IgG titer (interquartile range) optical density values for the hospitalized severe group on day 0, as well as during the fourth, eighth, and twelfth weeks, were 9.25 (6.01-11.893), 8.95 (5.52-12.42), 13.19 (12.26-13.26), and 12.99 (9.23-13.24), respectively. In comparison, the nonsevere group exhibited median values of 4.19 (3.08-9.89), 6.99 (4.32-9.75), 8.65 (5.83-13.08), and 12.48 (7.88-13.16), respectively. However, seroprevalence was higher in the control group (83.3%); in the HCWs, it was 54.9%. Although patients with severe disease had higher antispike IgG titers, no difference in titers was seen among age, gender, body mass index, or diabetes subgroups.  We observed Ab titer persistence up to three months in cases of COVID-19-recovered patients, whereas seroprevalence was high among HCWs and the control group during the Delta wave.",

Data from 365 bankers from five public and private banks in Bangladesh were collected using a pretested semistructured questionnaire. The Seventh Joint National Committee on Hypertension (JNC 7) guideline was followed to define prehypertension and undiagnosed hypertension. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to investigate the associated factors. The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and prehypertension were 22.5% and 55.3%, respectively. Most of the bankers were males and 35-44 years of age. The risk of hypertension and prehypertension was significantly higher among males (Odds ratio [OR], 16.6; OR, 6.4), longer service duration (F, 3.6), prolonged working hours (OR, 3.8; OR, 3.1), smoking (OR, 6.2; OR, 3.4), overweight (OR, 6.8; OR, 2.4) and obese (OR, 8.9; OR, 3.4) bankers, respectively. After controlling for confounders, the predictors of hypertension were males (Adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 12.8; 95%CI, 2.7-60), current smokers (aOR, 2.9; 95%CI, 1-8), overweight (aOR, 5.1; 95%CI, 1.5-17.9), and obesity (aOR, 9.6; 95%CI, 2.4-38.2). For prehypertension, males (aOR, 9.7; 95%CI, 3.1-30.9) and obesity (aOR, 3.9; 95%CI, 1.5-10.3) were found as predictors. More than three-fourths of bankers in Bangladesh have either prehypertension or undiagnosed hypertension.

However, comparable data on the use of these modalities in PCI of patients with diabetes are only sparsely available from South Asia. This study investigated the feasibility and clinical outcomes of systematic use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) during PCI in patients with diabetes. The study enrolled 275 patients (≥ 18 years) from nine centers in India and one from Bangladesh between October 2021 and September 2022. Patients with stable ischemic heart disease, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), and unstable angina were included in the study. Angiographically intermediate lesions (diameter stenosis of 40% to 80%) underwent FFR-guided PCI. Lesions with a diameter stenosis of > 80% underwent PCI without FFR evaluation. All PCI procedures were guided by OCT using the MLD-MAX algorithm. At 12 months, the target lesion failure (TLF) rate, a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal MI, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization, was 3.3%. Among the intermediate lesions, PCI was deferred by 70% after the FFR evaluation. Pre- and post-procedural OCT has led to a strategy change in 49.5% and 33.6%, respectively. The study revealed a relatively lower rate of events with FFR and OCT guidance compared to historical data from angiography-guided PCI in patients with diabetes. The strategy of combined use of FFR and OCT in PCI may contribute to improved clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Monkeypox (Mpox) is a major global human health threat after COVID-19. Its treatment becomes complicated with type-2 diabetes (T2D). It may happen due to the influence of both disease-causing common host key genes (cHKGs). Therefore, it is necessary to explore both disease-causing cHKGs to reveal their shared pathogenetic mechanisms and candidate drugs as their common treatments without adverse side effect. This study aimed to address these issues. At first, 3 transcriptomics datasets for each of Mpox and 6 T2D datasets were analyzed and found 52 common host differentially expressed genes (cHDEGs) that can separate both T2D and Mpox patients from the control samples. Then top-ranked six cHDEGs (HSP90AA1, B2M, IGF1R, ALD1HA1, ASS1, and HADHA) were detected as the T2D-causing cHKGs that are associated with the complexity of Mpox through the protein-protein interaction network analysis. Then common pathogenetic processes between T2D and Mpox were disclosed by cHKG-set enrichment analysis with biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, and regulatory network analysis with transcription factors and microRNAs. Finally, cHKG-guided top-ranked three drug molecules (tecovirimat, vindoline, and brincidofovir) were recommended as the repurposable common therapeutic agents for both Mpox and T2D by molecular docking. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity and drug-likeness analysis of these drug molecules indicated their good pharmacokinetics properties. The 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation results (root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, and molecular mechanics generalized born surface area) with the top-ranked three complexes ASS1-tecovirimat, ALDH1A1-vindoline, and B2M-brincidofovir exhibited good pharmacodynamics properties. Therefore, the results provided in this article might be important resources for diagnosis and therapies of Mpox patients who are also suffering from T2D.",

The structural and physicochemical properties of Zn<sub>4</sub>O(BDC)<sub>3</sub> were characterized using FTIR, TGA, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, PXRD, and elemental analysis, revealing its exceptional stability and coordination properties. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns), and MM-GBSA calculations were performed to assess binding affinities and stability. The interactions of Zn<sub>4</sub>O(BDC)<sub>3</sub> with salmon sperm DNA (SSDNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) demonstrated significant anticancer potential, evidenced by binding constant values of 6.0 × 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>-1</sup> and Gibbs free energy changes of -17.93 and -19.61 kcal/mol, respectively, highlighting its ability to suppress tumor cell proliferation. With doxorubicin (DOX) loading and reloading efficiencies of 88% and 87.5%, Zn<sub>4</sub>O(BDC)<sub>3</sub> exhibited superior drug delivery capabilities. The anti-diabetic potential was validated by the formation of human insulin (HI) hexamers with ΔG values of 0.8 ± 0.1 and a significant decrease in absorption intensity (5.8 to 0.05 at 250 nm). Molecular docking studies revealed moderate to high binding affinities (-10.0 to -5.3 kcal/mol) with biomolecular targets, supported by molecular dynamics simulations over 100 ns and MM-GBSA calculations indicating robust stability (ΔG = -33.31 kcal/mol).

        "abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> As a polygenic disorder, Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease developed by many multigenetic factors, of which multiple genes located on different chromosomes contribute to its susceptibility. The <i>KCNJ11</i> gene is involved in the Kir6.2 proteins that help release insulin from the potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells. Many studies have found that <i>KCNJ11</i> polymorphism is significantly associated with the incidence of T2DM. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the association between <i>KCNJ11</i> gene polymorphism and T2DM in the Bangladeshi population. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In a case-control study (<i>n</i> = 697), 326 nondiabetic controls and 371 diabetic subjects (diagnosed based on American Diabetes Association criteria) were recruited for this study. The serum fasting glucose, lipid profiles, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HbA<sub>1C</sub>, and serum insulin level were measured by standard methods. HOMA-B%, HOMA-S%, and HOMA-IR were calculated using HOMA-SIGMA software Version 2.2. A standard formula calculated QUICKI and Secretory-HOMA. The chemical method was used for DNA extraction from whole blood samples. The PCR-RFLP method was used to detect <i>KCNJ11</i> polymorphisms by restriction enzyme (BanII) digestion. As appropriate, data were analyzed using an independent <i>t</i>-test, chi-square, or Fisher exact test. <i>p</i> < 0.05 was considered significant. <b>Results:</b> The frequency of the risk allele K was significantly higher in the T2DM group than control (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.01). The frequency of the KK genotype was higher among the T2DM group (3.77% vs. 1.84%, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and the frequency of the EK genotype was significantly higher among the T2DM than the control group (42.86% vs. 27.91%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The EE genotype was significantly associated with T2DM in the dominant model EE + EK with an OR of 2.06 (95% CI 1.51-2.82, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study showed that rs5219 polymorphism of the <i>KCNJ11</i> gene is a significant risk factor for Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Bangladeshi population.",

We analyzed age-standardized rates (ASR) for prevalence, incidence, mortality, and DALYs of CKD due to T2DM in South Asia(India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal). Join point regression and ARIMAmodels were applied for trend analysis and projections. From 1990 to 2021, prevalence decreased slightly (e.g. India: 5.4% to 5.2%), while mortality increased (e.g.Pakistan: 33.7 to 42.1 per 100,000). Incidence increased across all countries, with Nepal (1.3% increase) and Bhutan (1.7% increase) showing the highest growth.

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a significant risk for diabetes patients, often leading to severe complications. Early and accurate CKD stage detection is crucial for timely intervention. However, it remains challenging due to its asymptomatic progression, the oversight of routine CKD tests during diabetes checkups, and limited access to nephrologists. This study aimed to address these challenges by developing a multiclass CKD stage prediction model for diabetes patients using longitudinal data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. A novel iterative backward feature selection strategy was employed to determine key predictors of the CKD stage. TabNet, an attention-based deep learning architecture, was used to build classification models in complete and simplified categories. The complete model used 31 features, including complex kidney biomarkers, while the simplified model used 15 features readily available from routine checkups. The performance of TabNet was compared against traditional tree-based ensemble methods (XGBoost, random forest, AdaBoost) and a multi-layer perceptron. Model-specific and model-agnostic explainable AI (XAI) techniques were applied to interpret model decisions, enhancing the transparency and clinical applicability of the proposed approach. The TabNet models demonstrated superior performance, achieving 94.06 % and 92.71 % accuracy in cross-validation for the complete and simplified models, respectively, and 91.00 % and 88.00 % accuracy on test sets. XAI analysis identified serum creatinine, cystatin C, sex, and age as the most influential factors in CKD stage classification. The proposed TabNet models offer a robust approach for early CKD severity detection in diabetes patients, potentially improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The global burden of chronic diseases is increasing and becoming a public health issue throughout the world. The use of telenursing is increasing significantly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to treat and prevent chronic diseases. Telenursing is growing in many countries to reduce health care costs, increase the number of aging and chronically ill populations, and increase health care coverage to distant, rural, small, or sporadically populated regions. Among its many benefits, telenursing may help to solve increasing shortages of nurses, reduce distances, save travel time, and keep patients out of the hospital. The objective of this study is to apply the self-management telenursing program and telenursing system developed by the researchers to Bangladesh and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy (improved diabetes control in participants). This is a pilot, quasi-experimental pre- and post-intervention study. Diabetes patients who will attend the Grameen Primary Health Centers (PHCs) in Bangladesh will be enrolled between September 2024 and August 2025. We include patients who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, both sexes, ages 18-75 years old, all types of treatment, willing to participate and give us consent. We exclude patients who have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, diabetes as a secondary cause, complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is less than 7% for the past 1 year with CKD stage 1 or 2, no complications or complications with good control, having enough knowledge (had education before) and implemented good practice regarding diabetes management assessed by the research nurses, and disabled persons who need other person's support for daily living. The sample size was calculated and found 70. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The study protocol got approval from the National Research Ethics Committee of the Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC/NREC/2022-2025/336) on September 08, 2024. The outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of telenursing intervention by controlling HbA<sub>1c</sub>. The project was funded in 2024. The enrollment of the participants started on October 26, 2024, and the required sample (n=70) enrollment was completed in February 2025. Data analysis will be started after completion of data collection and results will be expected to be submitted for publication in 2026. Diabetic patients will acquire disease-specific management skills. Setting and monitoring goals ensures the continuation of the desired behavior and gives the patients control over their lifestyle. After developing self-management skills, patients assess their lab data and lifestyles including diet, and understand their condition so that they can work with their physiological data by acquiring knowledge of both the disease and self-care. By making self-supported decisions, the patients will be able to manage their diet, exercise, and medication. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06632652; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06632652.

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diabetes care cascade and identify the social determinants influencing retention at each stage of care in Bangladesh. Data was extracted from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2022. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was defined as fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or a diagnosis by a healthcare provider. The care cascade comprised three stages: (i) diagnosis, (ii) receiving treatment, and (iii) glycemic control. Logistic regression and Andersen's Behavioral Model were used in the study. Among 2,403 individuals with T2DM, 33.5 % were diagnosed, 24.6 % received treatment, and 9.6 % achieved glycemic control. Losses occurred at diagnosis (66.5 %), treatment (9 %), and control (19.6 %). Women, individuals with higher education, and those in the wealthiest quintile had higher odds of diagnosis. Receiving treatment was significantly associated with wealth and body mass index. Significant gaps were observed at all stages of diabetes care cascade, particularly diagnosis. Strengthening screening, ensuring access to affordable treatment, and improving adherence are essential to enhance glycemic control and mitigating the diabetes burden.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic is associated with lung disease and experimental models suggest that arsenic-induced degradation of the chloride channel CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a mechanism of arsenic toxicity. We examined associations between arsenic exposure, sweat chloride concentration (measure of CFTR function), and pulmonary function among 269 adults in Bangladesh. Participants with sweat chloride ≥ 60 mmol/L had higher arsenic exposures than those with sweat chloride < 60 mmol/L (water: median 77.5 µg/L versus 34.0 µg/L, p = 0.025; toenails: median 4.8 µg/g versus 3.7 µg/g, p = 0.024). In linear regression models, a one-unit µg/g increment in toenail arsenic was associated with a 0.59 mmol/L higher sweat chloride concentration, p < 0.001. Among the entire study population, after adjusting for covariates including age, sex, smoking, education, and height, toenail arsenic concentration was associated with increased odds of airway obstruction (OR: 1.97, 95%: 1.06, 3.67, p = 0.03); however, sweat chloride concentration did not mediate this association. Our findings suggest that sweat chloride concentration may serve as novel biomarker for arsenic exposure, warranting further investigation in diverse populations, and that arsenic likely acts on the lung through mechanisms other than inducing CFTR dysfunction. Alternative mechanisms by which environmental arsenic exposure may lead to obstructive lung disease, such as arsenic-induced direct lung injury and/or increase lung proteinase activity, require additional exploration in future work.",

Research on the relationship between glycemic status and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) and monocytes to lymphocytes (MLR) is limited. This study aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by examining the connection between DM and inflammatory markers within the Asir region. Data from 3545 participants were retrospectively analyzed. The dataset, gathered between 2021 and 2023, comprises 38 laboratory tests obtained from the Future Lab Pioneer database. The study's inclusion criteria focused on diabetes profile tests (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] and fasting blood glucose [FBG]) and manually computed inflammatory markers (NLR and MLR), which were stratified by age and sex. This study demonstrated significant differences in NLR levels compared with FBG levels across all adult age groups and adult female participants (p < 0.0001), as well as among all elderly age groups (p = 0.0006) and elderly women (p = 0.01). MLR levels were significant in all adult age groups (p = 0.04) and in adult women (p = 0.02). When NLR and MLR were compared to HbA1c levels, a significant difference in the mean NLR was found in adult women (p = 0.005). Additionally, the mean MLR levels were significant in all adult age groups (p = 0.04) and adult women (p = 0.02). Although a larger sample size is necessary for this research, the results indicate that NLR and MLR could serve as valuable indicators for evaluating inflammation in people with disrupted glucose metabolism, particularly in adult and female populations.",

However, whether uric acid is independently associated with the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), a major type of cardiovascular disease (CVD), remains debatable, especially across different populations. This study aims to examine the relationship between SUA levels and MI in an adult population group in Bangladesh. The study included 392 participants: 188 with a history of MI in the CVD group and 204 healthy individuals without CVD in the control group. Anthropometric, blood pressure, SUA, and other biochemical parameters were measured. A multivariate regression model was used to assess the relationship between elevated SUA levels and the risk of CVD. The mean level of SUA was significantly higher in the CVD group (7.6 ± 4.5 mg/dL) compared to the non-CVD group (5.3 ± 1.8 mg/dL) (p < 0.001). The prevalence of hyperuricemia was also observed to be higher in the CVD group (46.3%) compared to the non-CVD group (18.2%) (p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed in the levels of blood glucose and lipid profile between the CVD and non-CVD groups (p < 0.001 for all cases). No significant differences were observed in the mean level of SUA or the prevalence of hyperuricemia between the gender groups. When SUA was divided into four quartiles, a significant difference was observed for systolic blood pressure across the quartile groups. After adjusting for potential confounders in the regression models, SUA was found to have a significant association with CVD. Elevated levels of SUA were associated with increased odds of CVD among the study participants.

Although males had significantly higher rates of hypertension (<i>p</i> < 0.001), diabetes (<i>p</i> = 0.008), chronic constipation (<i>p</i> = 0.03), and systolic blood pressure (<i>p</i> < 0.001), females were found to have significantly higher body mass index (23.1 ± 3.1 vs. 21.4 ± 2.9; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and paternal diabetes (9.6% vs. 4.8%; <i>p</i> = 0.004) compared to male. Further, the age-adjusted multivariate LR model found paternal diabetes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.5, <i>p</i> = 0.007) as a potential independent predictor of HS in females compared to males. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.67 (95% CI 0.63-0.70, <i>p</i> < 0.001) with 67.7% sensitivity and 58.2% specificity presents the goodness of fit of the model. Bangladeshi women with a history of paternal diabetes have a 2.1-fold heightened risk of HS than men.",

        "abstract": "Cinnamomum tamala belongs to the Lauraceae family, which has diverse traditional and pharmacological roles for treating toothache, diarrhea, gastrointestinal disorders, vomiting, fever, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and others. This research aims to evaluate its protective effects against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. For this, ethanolic leaf extract of C. tamala (ECT) at different doses was administered via oral gavage with or without the standard hepatoprotective drug silymarin, and liver biochemical and histopathological profiles were checked. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and molecular docking studies were performed to check the possible molecular mechanisms behind its hepatoprotective effect. Results suggest that ECT significantly enhances antioxidant capability with lower animal N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine metabolites. The histopathological slides showed minimum inflammation, inflammatory cell infiltrations, and vascular edematous congestion for the ECT individual and co-administration groups. Computational drug discovery approaches validated these results, and the identified compounds from the GC-MS study were subjected to molecular docking, with the top docking score found against the CYP2E1 protein. In molecular dynamics simulation, 1,3-dioxolane, 2-pentadecyl, and butyl 14-methylhexadecanoate showed more root mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation values than silymarin. In conclusion, ECT and its key compounds, butyl 14-methylhexadecanoate (CID 91693030) and 1,3-dioxolane, 2-pentadecyl (CID 552019), may potentially act against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity in animals.",

        "abstract": "Arsenic (As) is an environmental pollutant that causes endocrine disruption. Diabetes increases the risk of Blackfoot disease, which is a peripheral artery disease caused by chronic exposure to As through drinking water in Taiwan and Bangladesh; however, the mechanism underlying this increased risk remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying vascular damage in hyperglycemic conditions caused by As exposure using in vivo and in vitro studies. We utilized an animal model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes that was exposed to As through drinking water for 8 weeks. Subsequently, blood and organ samples of the animals were collected for follow-up analysis. Further, we cultured endothelial cells that were treated with As treatment in glucose condition and detected their biomarkers. The findings revealed that both the diabetes and diabetes + As groups exhibited insulin resistance, weight gain, and increased plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. The diabetes + As group had lower antioxidant activity, which caused the arteries to exhibit prominent luminal narrowing with increased thickness. In vivo study revealed that glucose + As group-induced cell cycle arrest, a 98.80% increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and decreased cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). However, in glucose + As group, treatment with SP600125 and U10126 treatment decreased ROS production by 80.5% and 84%, respectively, and restored MMP and cell viability. The glucose-regulated protein 78 level increased in the As as well as glucose + As groups. Our findings demonstrate that As exacerbates vascular damage in individuals with diabetes and its associated complications through the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.",

In this cross-sectional study, real-time quantitative PCR with specific Taqman probes was used to determine the genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs121912717 and rs373056577 in 300 unrelated Bangladeshi individuals (Healthy = 144, T2D patients = 156). Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association of genotypic and allelic frequencies of these SNPs with respect to T2D under different inheritance models. Neither allelic nor genotypic frequencies of rs121912717 within APOA1 showed any significant association with T2D. Genotypes with respect to rs373056577 within APOA2 showed significant association with the risk of T2D under co-dominant heterozygous model (GG vs GA) [OR (95 %CI): 2.64 (1.32-5.59), p = 0.008], dominant [OR (95 %CI): 2.31 (1.24-4.49), p = 0.01] and over-dominant [OR (95 %CI): 2.62 (1.31-5.53), p = 0.008] models without adjusting for age, gender and BMI. After adjusting for age, gender and BMI, the A allele of rs373056577 showed significant association with T2D only in the dominant model [OR (95 %CI): 3.20 (1.12-10.51), p = 0.04]. Also, A allele of rs373056577 demonstrated significant association with the risk of T2D compared to allele G with [OR (95 %CI): 2.90 (1.15-8.14), p = 0.03] and without adjusting for confounders [OR (95 %CI): 1.97 (1.14-3.52), p = 0.02]. The genotypic frequency was significantly associated with T2D in codominant, dominant, and overdominant models in male participants when a gender-stratified analysis was conducted for rs373056577. However, when the logistic regression analysis was adjusted for age and BMI, the association was not significant in any of the models with respect to rs373056577 for male participants. On the other hand, gender-stratified regression analyses revealed no significant association with T2D before and after adjusting for age and BMI with respect to both allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs121912717. Individuals with CT genotype of rs121912717 had significantly higher triglyceride levels (322.2 mg/dL) compared to those harboring CC genotype (202.8 mg/dL) with or without adjusting for age, gender, BMI and disease status of the study participants. In conclusion, this study revealed that individuals harboring the allele A of rs373056577 possessed an increased risk of developing T2D and individuals having CT genotype of rs121912717 had increased triglyceride levels. The result of this study needs to be validated in a larger cohort for a more robust assessment.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), a condition affecting over one-third of the U.S. population, heightens the risk of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, and premature mortality. While individual links between heavy metals (HM), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and MetS have been established, the impact when these environmental toxins are combined remains unclear and unexplored. This study investigates how simultaneous exposure to HMs and VOCs influences the risk of MetS. Weighted Quantile Sum regression and Bayesian kernel Machine Regression were performed on data from 6603 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011-2020) to determine the impact of HMs and VOCs detected in urine on MetS. Further analyses were performed for individuals placed in subgroups based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and monthly poverty level index. The analyses reveal that combined exposure to HMs and VOCs is associated with an increased risk of MetS; in particular, exposure to cadmium, tin, N-acetyl-S-(N-methyl carbamoyl)-L-cysteine, and N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-cysteine significantly elevates the risk of developing MetS. Younger adults (18-50 years), men, Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites, and those with a monthly poverty index > 1.3 (higher socioeconomic status) emerged as the most vulnerable groups. These findings emphasize an urgent need to address and tackle the cumulative impact of environmental toxins through a shift in public health efforts to go beyond investigating isolated exposures to address real-world chemical exposures. By understanding these cumulative risks, we can begin to mitigate them and pave the way for more effective interventions, especially for at-risk populations.",

However, weak acoustic signals in PAS systems require optimized resonator designs for enhanced detection sensitivity. Designing such resonators physically is complex, requiring the precise identification of critical parameters before practical implementation. This study focused on optimizing a T-shaped photoacoustic resonator using finite element modeling in a COMSOL Multiphysics environment. By systematically varying the geometric design parameters of the T-cell resonator, a maximum increase in the pressure amplitude of 12.76 times with a quality factor (Q-factor) of 47.5 was achieved compared to the previously designed reference acoustic resonator. This study took a significant step forward by identifying key geometric parameters that influence resonator performance, paving the way for more sensitive and reliable noninvasive glucose monitoring systems.",

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2021, we estimated age-standardized incidence, prevalence, deaths, and DALYs for four major NCDs: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases from 2010 to 2021. Gender and age-specific estimations were conducted across all NCDs, with 95% uncertainty intervals and a decomposition analysis was employed to estimate change in death and DALYs attributable to NCDs. The burden of NCDs in South Asia increased by 3.00% in incidence from 2010 to 2021, while overall prevalence decreased by 1.00%, yet the age-standardized prevalence rate remains above the global rate (91,570 per 100,000 population). Incidences of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases declined by 3.00% and 13.00%, respectively, whereas diabetes and cancer rose by 21.00% and 13.00% in South Asia. Nepal faced the highest environmental impact (23.4% of DALYs), Bangladesh the greatest metabolic impact (25.62%), and India the highest from behavioural factors (23.95%). Population growth and aging were primary drivers of changes in deaths and DALYs across the region. This finding emphasizes the need for targeted public health interventions addressing environmental, metabolic, and behavioral risks for NCDs in South Asia, alongside strategies to support healthy aging and effective disease management across diverse demographic groups.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive impairment has a major impact on health, quality of life and survival and its increasing burden presents a critical global health challenge. Empirical population-based studies of cognitive function and its association with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors among older adults in low-resource setting are rare. This study describes the burden of cognitive impairment and associations with demographic, health and behavioural factors among older adults in rural Bangladesh. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of a random sample of men and women aged 60 years and above in 96 rural villages in Bangladesh. Cognitive function was measured using the Bangla Adaptation of the Mini-mental State Examination (BAMSE), where higher score indicates higher function. Blood pressure, height and weight were measured using standard protocols and fasting glucose and 2-h oral glucose test were used to identify diabetes risk. Interviewer administered survey questionnaires assessed depressive symptoms, anxiety and self-reported health behaviours. Analyses were carried out separately for men and women and examined associations between sociodemographic, health and behaviour factors with BAMSE scores using robust Poisson regression. Data were gathered from 403 (216 female, 187 male) eligible participants. More than 50% of the population had at least mild cognitive impairment and women had lower cognitive scores than men. Younger age, higher education, wealth, and literacy were significantly associated with higher BAMSE scores among women and men. Associations with marital status varied between men and women, with being married having a positive association with BAMSE among women, i.e. higher cognitive function (relative score ratio (95% CI) 1.08 (1.02, 1.15), p = 0.013), but no association among men (0.94 (0.87, 1.02), p = 0.13). No clear associations were observed with diabetes or hypertension, but overweight and obesity were associated with an increased BAMSE score among women (1.10 (1.02, 1.19), p = 0.011) but not men (1.01 (0.94, 1.10), p = 0.70). Moderate and severe depressive symptoms were associated with lower BAMSE scores among men (0.90 (0.82, 0.99), p = 0.037), but not women (0.94 (0.83, 1.06), p = 0.31). Physical activity was associated with a relative increase in BAMSE score (1.08 (1.01, 1.16), p = 0.020) among women, though no association was seen in men (1.01 (0.95, 1.07), p = 0.76). The consumption of betel was associated with lower BAMSE among women (0.94 (0.89, 1.00), p = 0.056), but there was no evidence of association among men (1.01 (0.96, 1.07), p = 0.61). A large proportion of older adults in rural Bangladesh have impaired cognitive function and there are important gender differences in the distribution of cognitive scores and their association with demographic, socioeconomic, health and behavioural factors in this population. Improvement in health and social care systems, taking into account the specific social, economic and gender dimensions of the context, are needed to prevent and manage the burden of cognitive decline in rural Bangladesh.

The escalating global prevalence of diabetes underscores the need for innovative therapeutic interventions. In this article, we critically comment on the study by Wang <i>et al</i>, published in the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i>, which elucidates the therapeutic potential of Plantamajoside (PMS) in type 2 DM (T2DM) management. The authors provide evidence for the mechanism of action of PMS in T2DM models, demonstrating prevention of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells <i>via</i> activation of DNAJC1. This manuscript provides a brief review of the pathogenesis of T2DM, explores the various roles of PMS in disease therapy in addition to the DNAJC-related apoptotic and autophagic functions, critically evaluates the experimental approaches employed by Wang <i>et al</i>, and provides recommendations for advancing future research.",

        "title": "Reasons for discontinuing tirzepatide in randomized controlled trials: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Despite therapeutic benefits, discontinuation of tirzepatide is common in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) due to adverse events (AEs) and other causes. No previous systematic reviews have explored the reasons for discontinuing tirzepatide in the RCTs. To explore the reasons for permanent discontinuation of tirzepatide <i>vs</i> controls [placebo, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ras)] in RCTs. Relevant RCTs were systematically searched using related terms through multiple databases such as MEDLINE (<i>via</i> PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane Central Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception until June 20, 2024. RevMan web was used to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models. Outcomes were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Seventeen RCTs (<i>n</i> = 14645), mostly having low risks of bias, were analyzed. Compared to placebo, the risk of permanent discontinuation of the study drug was substantially lower with tirzepatide 10 mg (RR: 0.69, 95%CI: 0.51-0.93, <i>P</i> = 0.02) and similar with tirzepatide 5 mg (RR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.47-1.17, <i>P</i> = 0.20) and 15 mg (RR: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.68-1.31, <i>P</i> = 0.71). Tirzepatide had identical discontinuation risks when compared to insulin at 5 mg (RR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.75-1.24, <i>P</i> = 0.77) and 10 mg (RR: 1.19, 95%CI: 0.77-1.82, <i>P</i> = 0.44) doses, whereas such risk was higher with tirzepatide 15 mg than insulin (RR: 1.31, 95%CI: 1.03-1.67, <i>P</i> = 0.03). Compared to GLP-1RA, the permanent discontinuation risk was similar with tirzepatide 5 mg (RR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.70-1.37, <i>P</i> = 0.90) but was higher with tirzepatide 10 mg (RR: 1.40, 95%CI: 1.03-1.90, <i>P</i> = 0.03) and 15 mg (RR: 1.70, 95%CI: 1.27-2.27, <i>P</i> = 0.0004). Tirzepatide, at all doses, had higher risks of AE-related discontinuation than insulin; such risks were only greater with higher doses of tirzepatide than with placebo or GLP-1RA. Discontinuation risk due to withdrawal by the study subjects was lower with tirzepatide than with placebo or insulin. Compared to the placebo, tirzepatide (all doses) conferred a lower risk of study drug discontinuation due to other causes not specifically mentioned. The discontinuation risk is not higher in tirzepatide group than in the placebo arm. Many factors other than AEs led to drug discontinuation in the included RCTs.",

        "title": "Efficacy and safety of dexamethasone versus intravitreal aflibercept implants for macular edema: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Macular edema (ME) is a prevalent complication of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) that contributes significantly to vision impairment worldwide. This condition is primarily driven by elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in the use of anti-VEGF agents such as aflibercept and corticosteroids such as dexamethasone implants. However, evidence comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of these two modalities remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injections and dexamethasone implants in ME associated with DR and RVO. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024577212). A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was performed until August 30, 2024. Nine studies, involving 572 eyes, were included in the analysis. Key outcomes assessed included Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Central Retinal Thickness (CRT), and Intraocular Pressure (IOP). A random-effects model was applied to the pooled effect size calculations, and heterogeneity was addressed using sensitivity analyses. Both treatments showed comparable efficacy in improving BCVA and reducing CRT across follow-up intervals. At 3 months, dexamethasone implants demonstrated statistically significant superiority in BCVA improvement (MD = 1.18, 95% CI [0.89, 1.47], P < 0.001) and CRT reduction (MD =  - 62.45 µm, 95% CI [- 85.67, - 39.22], P < 0.001) compared to aflibercept. Similarly, at 12 months, dexamethasone implants maintained greater efficacy in CRT reduction (MD =  - 58.73 µm, 95% CI [- 78.12, - 39.34], P < 0.001). However, dexamethasone implants were associated with an increased IOP at 3 and 6 months (MD = 1.04 mmHg, 95% CI [0.56, 1.52], P < 0.001). No significant differences in IOP were observed between treatments at 12 months. Intravitreal aflibercept injections and dexamethasone implants are effective modalities for the management of ME, with each presenting distinct advantages. Dexamethasone implants minimize the frequency of treatment, while achieving superior outcomes in terms of BCVA and CRT. However, they are also associated with a heightened risk of IOP elevation and cataract formation. Conversely, aflibercept requires more frequent administration, which may result in logistical and financial challenges for patients and health care providers. Therefore, personalized treatment strategies should consider disease severity, comorbidities, and individual preferences. Future research should prioritize patient-centered outcomes, emphasizing quality of life and treatment costs while also investigating condition-specific responses to these therapeutic interventions.",

ICI-PI was defined as pancreatic inflammation post-ICI exposure, diagnosed via radiologic changes or elevated lipase/amylase levels without other underlying causes. The CTCAE grading system was used. The primary objectives were to assess the frequency, severity, serum abnormalities, management, and long-term outcomes. We conducted a proportional single-arm meta-analysis with a random effects model. <b>Results</b>: The analysis included 25 retrospective studies involving 48,704 patients. Tumor types included thoracic/head and neck (38%), skin (26%), genitourinary/gynecological (18%), gastrointestinal (12%), and others (6%). The median age ranged from 56 to 73 years, with a follow-up from 2.5 to 45.9 months. ICI-PI occurred in 3.60% (95% CI: 1.64-6.28%) of patients, with grade ≥ 3 toxicity in 59.45% (95% CI: 35.32-81.37%). The frequency rates of ICI-PI were 1.99% for CTLA4 inhibitors, 5.01% for PD(L)1 inhibitors, and 7.44% for combination ICI therapy (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The median time to onset from treatment initiation ranged from 30 to 390 days, and symptom resolution ranged from 55 to 84 days. Management included corticosteroids (30.20%), intravenous fluids (22.82%), and hospitalization (30.46%). Chronic complications affected 63.54% (95% CI: 29.03-91.56%), including primarily diabetes mellitus (DM 89.45%; 95% CI: 61.88-100.0%) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI 10.55%; 95%: 0.0-38.12%). ICI-PI recurrence occurred in 27.2% of those resuming ICI therapy.

        "abstract": "Data science approaches have been pivotal in addressing public health challenges. However, there has been limited focus on identifying essential data science skills for health researchers, gaps in capacity building provision, barriers to access, and potential solutions. This review aims to identify essential data science skills for health researchers and key stakeholders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as well as to explore gaps and barriers in data science capacity building and share potential solutions, including any regional variations. An online survey was conducted in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, gathering both quantitative and qualitative responses. Descriptive analysis was performed in R V4.3, and a thematic workshop approach facilitated qualitative analysis. From 262 responses from individuals across 54 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), representing various institutions and roles, we summarised essential data science skills globally and by region. Thematic analysis revealed key gaps and barriers in capacity building, including limited training resources, lack of mentoring, challenges with data quality, infrastructure and privacy issues, and the absence of a conducive research environment. Respondents' consensus on essential data science skills suggests the need for a standardised framework for capacity building, adaptable to regional contexts. Greater investment, coupled with expanded collaboration and networking, would help address gaps and barriers, fostering a robust data science ecosystem and advancing insights into global health challenges.",

        "abstract": "The Haribhanga is one of the most renowned varieties of mango native to the Rangpur region of Bangladesh. The study aimed to explore the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological potentialities of the methanolic extract of <i>Mangifera indica</i> (Haribhanga) (MEMI) peel. The antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiarthritic activities of MEMI peel were conducted by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, disc diffusion, and protein denaturation assays, respectively. The extract was administered to STZ-induced diabetic mice for 7 days for the observation of blood glucose, body weight, lipid profile, and liver enzyme levels. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed to identify phytochemicals in the extract. Subsequently, molecular docking was conducted to predict the binding affinity of the identified compounds. The MEMI peel exhibited notable antioxidant potentiality with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.43 ± 0.68 μg/mL and antimicrobial activity against <i>Bacillus cereus</i> with a zone of inhibition of 20.67 ± 1.52 mm. Furthermore, MEMI peel demonstrated substantial antiarthritic activity, with the highest inhibition of denaturation of protein (88%) observed at the highest dose (500 μg/mL). In the in vivo experiments, MEMI peel led to a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i> < 0.05), with a significant decrease in blood glucose (<i>p</i> < 0.001), triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Comparing the diabetic control mice, the MEMI peel substantially decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.001) the high serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Moreover, the extract significantly improved the body weight (<i>p</i> < 0.001) of diabetic mice after 7 days of treatment. GC-MS analysis identified 28 bioactive compounds, primarily fatty acid esters in the MEMI peel. Di-n-octyl phthalate, terpinen-4-ol, 8,11,14-docosatrienoic acid methyl ester, and phenol, 2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-acetate exhibited the most favorable binding potential in molecular docking studies. The results suggest that MEMI peel possesses antimicrobial, antiarthritic, antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, and liver enzyme protective activities as a promising antioxidant.",

        "title": "Disrupting antimicrobial resistance: unveiling the potential of vitamin C in combating biofilm formation in drug-resistant bacteria.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to global health, exacerbated by the protective mechanisms of biofilms formed by drug-resistant bacteria. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by bacteria in biofilms serve as a formidable shield, impeding the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Here, we investigated the potential of vitamin C (sodium ascorbate) to disrupt biofilm formation in drug-resistant bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and studied the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of vitamin C on these bacteria. Out of 117 study isolates, primarily identified as Escherichia coli (n = 52), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 19), and Klebsiella spp. (n = 46), 80 isolates exhibited a Multiple Antimicrobial Resistance (MAR) index greater than 0.2, classifying them as multi-drug resistant (MDR) superbugs. Among these, 58 isolates demonstrated moderate to strong biofilm-forming abilities and were selected for further experiments with vitamin C. The effective concentration of vitamin C inhibiting the growth of most E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates (90%) was estimated at 1.25 mg/ml and 2.5 mg/ml respectively, while for allStaphylococcus spp. isolates, it was 0.325 mg/ml. Vitamin C exhibited a notable anti-biofilm effect against the studied isolates, with biofilm prevention concentrations (BPC) of 0.625, 1.25, and 0.16 mg/ml for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. isolates respectively. Furthermore, when combined with oxacillin or amoxicillin - drugs that were found ineffective, vitamin C significantly reduced the ability of MDR isolates to form biofilms, rendering them susceptible to the drugs' effects and restoring their efficacy. The expression of the recA gene, an early and quantifiable marker for the onset of the SOS response and biofilm production was downregulated after treatment of E. coli with vitamin C. Relative gene expression analysis revealed that ciprofloxacin-induced recA expression was significantly inhibited when MDR isolates of E. coli were treated with vitamin C at a concentration of 0.625 mg/ml, the BPC of vitamin C. Our findings reveal that vitamin C, alone or in combination with ineffective antibiotics, attenuates biofilm formation and restores the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates to antimicrobial agents. This study underscores the promise of vitamin C as a non-lethal disruptor of biofilm-associated antimicrobial resistance. Not applicable.",
