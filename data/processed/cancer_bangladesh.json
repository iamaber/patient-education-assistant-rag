        "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy (RT) for ovarian ablation (OA) in patients with metastatic breast cancer by comparing two RT protocols: 15 Gy in 5 fractions (arm A) vs. 20 Gy in 10 fractions (arm B). For this purpose, the present study enrolled 68 patients, divided equally into two study arms. The patients were followed-up for 24 weeks post-intervention. The primary endpoint was the efficacy of RT in inducing OA, assessed through amenorrhea and hormone levels [follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol]. Toxicities were evaluated using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, and post-menopausal symptoms were assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale. The results revealed that there was no significant difference between the two study arms (A vs. B) in the rate of amenorrhea development and persistence (85.7 vs. 89.5%), and in the achievement of postmenopausal estradiol (91.2 vs. 94.1%) and FSH levels (79.4 vs. 88.2%). Both regimens led to a significant reduction in estradiol levels and an increase in FSH levels compared to baseline levels. No grade ≥3 toxicity was observed. Common postmenopausal symptoms included hot flushes and irritability, with no significant differences between the groups. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that both RT regimens are effective and safe for OA in patients with metastatic breast cancer, with no significant differences in efficacy or toxicity. The findings are particularly relevant in resource-limited settings, underscoring the potential for flexible and shorter treatment regimens in such environment.",

        "abstract": "Little information was available on the general groundwater quality of Bangladesh's Ishwardi Upazila (peri-urban area). In the current study, 35 groundwater samples were collected from randomly chosen deep tube wells to determine the general quality of groundwater by water quality indices and whether it is fit for human consumption. Estimating pH, EC, TDS, and the concentrations of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Fe, Mn, As, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, Zn, and Cu were used to assess groundwater quality. Using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), the Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and As concentrations were determined. HCO<sub>3</sub>-, Fe, and Mn concentrations exceeded Bangladesh drinking water standards (BDWS) for drinking requirements in 100%, 23%, and 54% of samples, respectively. According to the water quality indicator, over 83% of the groundwater samples in the study area are unfit for human consumption. The hazard index (HI) and hazard quotient (HQ) have also been used to measure non-carcinogenic health concerns associated with groundwater drinking. By oral intake, people may be exposed to intolerable non-carcinogenic health risks in the peri-urban region (approximately 91% of samples exceeded the allowable level of HI). Additionally, residents may be at unfavorable risk for cancer due to arsenic (approximately 97% of water samples had levels of As above the permissible limits). Multivariate statistical analyses such as cluster and principal component analysis indicated that inappropriate waste disposal, industrial discharges from the Ishwardi export processing zone (EPZ), and agricultural runoff were potential sources of contaminants in groundwater. The study findings provide information to policymakers addressing groundwater pollution in the peri-urban area of Bangladesh to ensure sound health and socio-economic development of the study area in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The advent of mucosal vaccines that target the primary entry points of many pathogens has revolutionized the field of immunology. Genetically modified lactic acid bacteria (gmLAB), which include genera such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, have emerged as promising vectors for delivering antigens to mucosal surfaces. These gram-positive, non-pathogenic microorganisms exhibit inherent probiotic properties, can survive through the gastrointestinal tract, and efficiently interact with the host immune system. Advances in genetic engineering have enabled the expression of a wide range of antigens in gmLAB that promote systemic and mucosal immunity. Studies have demonstrated that gmLAB-based mucosal vaccines can elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses, providing protective immunity against specific pathogenic infections. In addition, gmLAB vectors offer good safety profiles, stability, and cost-effective production compared to traditional vaccine platforms. Recent studies demonstrated the potential of LAB vaccines in preventing infections caused by viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens and in immunotherapy for treating allergies and cancers. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying gmLAB-based mucosal vaccine delivery, current advancements, challenges, and prospects in recombinant mucosal vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), particularly in the tyrosine kinase domain such as exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation, play a critical role in the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). EGFR is a well-established therapeutic target in the management of NSCLC. In this study, we targeted the mutated EGFR kinase domain (L858R) using its crystal structure (PDB ID: 2EB3) to design EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We curated a library of 687 phytoconstituents from four anticancer plants (Camellia sinensis, Curcuma longa, Ginkgo biloba, and Vitis vinifera) using the IMPPAT database. Kaempferol, morin, and isorhamnetin, all from Ginkgo biloba, emerged as promising candidates. Drug-likeness and ADMET analyses were performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of these compounds. Pharmacophore modeling and bioactivity score analysis were also conducted. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to assess the stability of the EGFR-ligand complexes. The docking studies revealed high binding energies for kaempferol (- 8.5 kcal/mol), morin (- 8.5 kcal/mol), and isorhamnetin (- 8.7 kcal/mol) with the ATP-binding site of EGFR, compared to the reference drug, erlotinib (- 7 kcal/mol). These compounds exhibited superior pharmacokinetic properties, including high gastrointestinal absorption and non-inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity, unlike erlotinib. Toxicity predictions showed mild immunotoxicity for morin and isorhamnetin, with all compounds demonstrating no hepatotoxicity and no inhibition of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 enzymes. Structural analysis highlighted the hydroxyl groups in the selected compounds as key for hydrogen bond (H-bond) formation with EGFR residues, enhancing their inhibitory potential. MD simulations confirmed the stability of EGFR complexes with the selected compounds, showing lower average RMSD values and better convergence compared to the EGFR-erlotinib complex. This research underscores the potential of kaempferol, morin, and isorhamnetin as novel EGFR inhibitors derived from Ginkgo biloba for NSCLC treatment. These compounds demonstrated strong binding affinities, favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and stability in silico. Further in vitro and in vivo validation is necessary to confirm their efficacy against mutated EGFR in NSCLC.",

The PD1 and MTNR1B gene polymorphisms have been extensively studied for their potential role in cancer susceptibility. This study aimed to investigate associations between breast cancer risk and PD1 (rs36084323) and MTNR1B (rs10830963) polymorphisms. A case-control study was conducted with 112 breast cancer patients from Dhaka Cancer and General Hospital, Bangladesh, and 124 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Genotyping of PD1 (rs36084323) and MTNR1B (rs10830963) polymorphisms was performed using the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The genotype distributions for both SNPs adhered to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The PD1 GG genotype was more prevalent in controls, indicating a protective effect, whereas the GG genotype of MTNR1B showed no statistically significant association with breast cancer risk. The recessive model of PD1 (GG vs. AG + AA) demonstrated a lower odds ratio (0.2873), while the recessive model of MTNR1B (2.307) suggested a potential risk. Dominant models for both genes (AG + GG vs. AA for PD1 and CG + GG vs. CC for MTNR1B) showed statistically significant associations with breast cancer susceptibility. The PD1 GG genotype exhibited a significant protective effect against breast cancer, while the MTNR1B CG genotype was associated with reduced risk, but GG showed no correlation.

This study evaluated the relationship between <i>MMP2</i> (rs2285053) and <i>MMP9</i> (rs3787268) gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility to breast cancer in Bangladeshi breast cancer patients. This case-control study included 105 females diagnosed with breast cancer and 108 healthy controls. Following DNA extraction from the blood samples, genotyping was carried out by tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain (ARMS-PCR) reaction and gel electrophoresis. In the case of rs2285053 polymorphism, CT genotype (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.03-4.36), dominant model (OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.08-4.52), overdominant model (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.02-4.31), and alleles (OR = 2.13, CI = 1.08-4.18) were significantly associated with an increased breast cancer risk. For rs3787268 polymorphism, additive model 1 (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05-0.78), additive model 2 (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.06-0.86), and dominant model (OR = 0.22, CI = 0.06-0.81) significantly decreased breast cancer risk in this population. Our results conclude that <i>MMP2</i> (rs2285053) is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, while <i>MMP9</i> (rs3787268) polymorphisms may be correlated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in Bangladeshi females.

Country-specific evaluations are needed to inform policymakers on implementation of hrHPV-based screening for their setting. Following initial implementation in Uganda, Bangladesh and Slovakia focused on underscreened women in the PRESCRIP-TEC project, we investigated the potential cost-effectiveness and affordability of hrHPV-based screening strategies. Country-specific model-based cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted for the three countries, comparing the PRESCRIP-TEC strategy with the existing screening strategy in each setting. Data from initial project implementation informed the relevant model parameters. The PRESCRIP-TEC strategy resulted in disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gains in all three countries. The cervical cancer incidence rate was reduced by a third for Uganda, 15% for Bangladesh and 11% for Slovakia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were UGX 0.56 million per DALY for Uganda (I$ 475), BDT 76 thousand per DALY for Bangladesh (I$ 1698) and EUR 1782 (I$ 3637) per DALY for Slovakia. Substantial additional funding will be required to enable implementation, particularly in relation to the initial start-up costs. The provided estimates can serve to inform policymakers and researchers in the context of implementing hrHPV-based screening in diverse settings.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is characterized by the unchecked proliferation of breast cells. Variations in the metabolism of steroid hormones can influence the risk of this disease by modifying the concentration and the potency of these hormones. The enzyme AKR1C4, primarily found in the liver, is crucial for regulating these hormone levels in the bloodstream. This research examined the relationship between a polymorphic variant (rs17134592) of the AKR1C4 gene and the susceptibility to breast cancer among the Bangladeshi population. A case-control study was conducted with 310 breast cancer patients and 310 healthy individuals from Bangladesh. DNA was extracted using an organic process, followed by genotyping through the PCR-RFLP technique. To validate the accuracy of genotyping results, a subset of PCR products was randomly selected and confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Statistical assessments were conducted to analyze the association of polymorphism, while molecular dynamics simulation and diverse computational methods were employed to predict the structural and functional impacts of the SNP. The results indicate that rs17134592 in the AKR1C4 gene is linked with a heightened risk for breast cancer (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.39, 95% CI = 1.80 to 6.50 for the GG genotype in additive model 2). The recessive model (GG vs. CC + CG) also showed an enhanced risk of susceptibility to breast malignancy (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.78 to 6.08). In the subgroup of post-menopausal women, the risk of developing breast cancer was significantly higher for carriers of the GG genotype, with relative risks of 4.02 and 3.92, in the additive model 2 and recessive model, respectively. However, no significant correlations were observed between these genotypes and tumor grade or size in breast cancer patients. Computational analysis suggested that the L311V mutation (rs17134592) could potentially reduce the stability of the protein. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the L311V mutation introduces notable conformational instability to the AKR1C4 enzyme, potentially impacting its biological functionality and catalytic efficiency. In conclusion, the genetic variant rs17134592 has been identified as significantly correlated with the prevalence of breast cancer in the Bangladeshi population. Computational studies suggest that the L311V mutation in the AKR1C4 gene, corresponding to rs17134592, results in marked conformational instability and changes in enzyme functionality.",

Disrupting the mTOR pathway contributes to uncontrolled cell growth, increased proliferation, and enhanced cell survival, all of which are hallmarks of cancer. The findings imply that the deregulation of the mTOR pathway in cancer provides a compelling basis for therapeutic treatments. Phytochemicals such as flavonoids and polyphenols have been shown to play a key role in suppressing different kinases implicated in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascades. A thorough study of the molecular connections between bioactive substances, mTOR signaling, and autophagy activation can lead to the creation of personalized treatments that work better and have fewer side effects. Finding out how important it is to target the mTOR pathway and how to use bioactive chemicals from plants to treat cancer are both important discoveries that could lead to more precise medicine and the development of effective cancer drugs. Finally, targeting mTOR pathways using plant-derived chemicals may be a promising therapy strategy for cancer. This review tries to summarize putative plant bioactive chemicals that act on malignancies via mTOR signaling pathways.

Each one deals with a particular set of problems at a given organizational level ranging from populations to genes. Any of the models adopted in those articles so far do not account for both epidemiological and molecular levels of carcinogenesis. We have developed a mathematically rigorous system to derive those equations satisfying the basic assumptions of both epidemiology and molecular biology without incorporating arbitrary numerical coefficients or constants devoid of any causal explanation just to fit the empirical data. The dataset we have used encompasses 21 major categories of cancer, 124 selected populations, 108 cancer registries, 5 continents, and 14,067,894 individual cases. We generalized all the epidemiological and molecular data using our derived equations through linear and non-linear regression and found all the necessary coefficients to explain the data. We also tested our equations against non-neoplastic conditions satisfying equivalent mathematical assumptions. Our findings show that the new mathematical framework effectively bridges epidemiological and molecular data on carcinogenesis. Validated across various cancer types and extended to non-neoplastic conditions, this unified approach lays a strong foundation for future integrative cancer research.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, with 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths reported in 2022. This disease mainly affects women in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of cases occur. This study explored how LMICs are responding to the World Health Organization's (WHO) call to eliminate cervical cancer. It looked at cervical cancer rates, the use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, and suggested strategies to fight the disease. The study analyzed the rates of cervical cancer and deaths in LMICs, the effectiveness of HPV vaccination programs, and how well screening efforts are working. To compare data across countries, it used age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 women per year. In 2022, the ASIR was 25.4% in lower income countries and 16.9% in lower-middle-income countries. The ASMR was also higher in lower income countries (18.5%) compared to lower-middle-income countries (10.3%). HPV vaccine coverage remains low in many LMICs, with significant differences between the rates of first and final doses completed. By 2050, the number of new cervical cancer cases is expected to rise. Although the WHO aims to eliminate cervical cancer by achieving 90% HPV vaccination by age 15, 70% screening coverage, and 90% access to treatment, many challenges remain in LMICs. These include weak healthcare systems, poor infrastructure, and a lack of health education. Overcoming these challenges through better vaccine distribution, improved screening programs, and stronger healthcare systems is essential to eliminate cervical cancer.",

        "title": "Planetary Health Consequences of Telecoupled Shrimp Farming.",
        "abstract": "The international demand for shrimp from Bangladesh exhibits a Telecoupled system. Semi-intensive to intensive shrimp farming has changed vast coastal areas into saline zones by altering land use and land cover. While shrimp cultivation significantly contributes to foreign exchange earnings, it also leads to various social and environmental impacts that affect planetary health. This study sees shrimp farming as a result of these Telecoupled dynamics. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining both primary and secondary data to examine its effects on planetary health in Bangladesh's southwestern coastal areas. The findings reveal several important health and social issues associated with shrimp farming. These include (i) scarcity of drinking and household water, (ii) infectious diseases, (iii) non-infectious diseases, (iv) food and nutritional insecurity, (v) antimicrobial resistance and chemical contamination, (vi) mental pressure, (vii) disaster-related health vulnerability, (viii) social conflict, (ix) healthcare inequality, and (x) rural-urban migration. This analysis enhances our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and nature in shrimp farming systems and their evolving impacts on planetary health in southwestern coastal Bangladesh. The study stresses the urgent need for integrated, ecosystem-based agricultural practices to find a balance between economic benefits and sustainable health and environmental outcomes.",

The 2017 WHO resolution on cancer prevention and control highlighted the importance of developing and implementing National Cancer Control Plans (NCCPs). We reviewed the current landscape of NCCPs in 21 countries of the Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance. We found marked variation in plan status across Asia, with frameworks ranging from comprehensive NCCPs to non-communicable disease plans that include cancer to no plans. Over 90% of plans included components for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention or cancer treatment. Air pollution, a critical and growing cancer risk factor in the region, was addressed in only 43% of plans, with most concentrated in middle-income countries. Treatment protocols were included in 91% of plans, but end-of-life care appeared in only 48%. Stakeholder involvement appeared in 86% of plans, but legal and evaluation mechanisms were less common (57% each). Locally adapted, comprehensive strategies addressing the continuum of care, from prevention to survivorship, supported by strong legal and financial governance structures and enhanced regional collaboration are essential for equitable cancer control.",

        "abstract": "The mortality rate and economic burden of infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens are increasingly higher. This frustrating scenario emphasizes the urgent need for developing new antimicrobial drugs. We have previously addressed this problem by studying the antimicrobial activity of two novel iron-halide complexes, Fe(Hampy)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> (iron tetrachloride) and Fe(Hampy)<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>4</sub> (iron tetrabromide). Both compounds showed bactericidal and antibiofilm activities against bacteria with an antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Herein, we used a proteomic approach to investigate the proteomic profile of bacterial cells previously exposed to both iron-halide complexes. For this study, the <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain, BW25113, was used as a model to facilitate the rapid identification of deregulated proteins. Heat map analysis of the common deregulated proteins highlighted that both complexes caused the downregulation of proteins associated with key metabolic pathways, biofilm formation, cell envelope biogenesis and iron ion binding. In addition, a network study suggested that the most influential proteins of the tetrachloride activity were those involved in the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, iron ion homeostasis and carbon/secondary metabolism. This protein-protein interaction analysis also hinted that the main drivers of the tetrabromide activity were proteins involved in translation, ribosomal biogenesis and cell motility. The above results strongly suggested how the presence of different halide ligands could be used to generate compounds with potentially different molecular mechanisms. Importantly, the findings of this study can also be used as a reference to compare with the protein profile of bacteria exposed to future variants of the iron-halide complexes.",

This systematic review assesses AIVT's impact on care quality in primary care and outpatient settings, focusing on seven components: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, patient-centredness, timeliness, equity, and integration. A systematic search of five databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINHAL, Scopus) was conducted for studies published up to September 20, 2024. Studies were included if they assessed the use of AIVT for medical documentation in primary care or outpatient settings, compared to manual or non-AI documentation methods, and reported outcomes relevant to the seven quality components. A narrative synthesis was conducted; meta-analysis was unfeasible due to study heterogeneity. Of 1924 papers, nine studies were included (n = 524 healthcare professionals, n = 616 patients, 1069 consultations). Most (n = 7) were from the USA, with others in Bangladesh and the Philippines. All studies assessing effectiveness, patient-centredness, and efficiency (n = 9, 6, and 5, respectively) reported improvements, including faster documentation, reduced administrative burden, and enhanced patient-provider interaction. Safety findings were inconclusive; three of six studies raised concerns. Four studies highlighted seamless AIVT integration with Electronic Health Records, improving service timeliness. Three studies identified equity issues, referring to limited diversity and controlled simulation settings. AIVT tools enhance documentation efficiency and patient-centred care, but concerns over transcription errors and generalisability warrant further testing in large-scale, diverse real-world settings.

This review discusses the molecular interactions of various substances such as flavonoids, polyphenols, terpenoids, and alkaloids with ligands, receptors, and downstream effectors. Terpenoids like curcumin can combat Notch-mediated medication resistance, while flavonoids like quercetin prevent Notch receptor activation. Alkaloids that directly or indirectly modulate Notch signaling have anticancer effects. Preclinical and clinical investigations have demonstrated the effectiveness of several of these drugs, and several have progressed to clinical trials. The review emphasizes clinical trials to optimize the pharmacokinetics, safety, and therapeutic potential of natural medicines for cancer treatment. Natural bioactive substances targeting the Notch signaling system have the potential to develop cancer treatment. These treatments provide a potential alternative or supplement to current treatments due to their more targeted and less toxic approach to cancer cells.

        "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the most formidable global health challenges, with conventional therapies often limited by off-target toxicity, drug resistance, and the inability to target key oncogenic drivers. In recent years, de novo protein and peptide binder engineering has emerged as an approach to overcome these barriers, offering precise and customizable solutions for cancer diagnosis and treatment. By leveraging computational design, directed evolution, and artificial intelligence, researchers can now engineer binding molecules with high specificity, stability, and therapeutic potential, unconstrained by the limitations of natural protein scaffolds. This review explores methodologies in de novo binder design, from computational algorithms like Rosetta and AlphaFold (although, with limitations such as their accuracy for disordered regions and conformational dynamics) to innovative scaffold optimization strategies. It highlights groundbreaking applications, including direct tumor inhibition, targeted drug delivery, immune modulation, and diagnostic biosensing, while showcasing case studies such as Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) and PD-1/PD-L1 mini-protein inhibitors. Looking ahead, the field promises to improve personalized medicine through tumor-specific binders, synthetic biology circuits, and next-generation delivery systems. As a convergence of biotechnology, computational modeling, and translational medicine, de novo binder engineering represents a powerful frontier in cancer therapy, with the potential to redefine precision oncology and address unmet clinical needs.

CCL18 and EGF are implicated in tumor biology; however, their roles in BRCA remain partly defined. This study investigates their expression profiles, immune associations, prognostic relevance, epigenetic regulation, and molecular networks. <b>Methods:</b> Expression data from TCGA, UALCAN, and GSCA were analyzed to compare CCL18 and EGF levels in BRCA and normal tissues. Immune infiltration was assessed using TIMER, while survival analyses were performed via Kaplan-Meier plotter and TCGA subcohorts, including menopausal status. Promoter DNA methylation was examined using UALCAN. Gene correlation networks and protein-protein interactions were assessed using UALCAN and STRING. <b>Result:</b> CCL18 was significantly upregulated in BRCA tissues, while EGF showed no consistent increase compared to normal tissue. Both genes were strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration. High CCL18 and EGF expression was associated with reduced relapse-free survival in BRCA. Promoter regions of both genes exhibited reduced DNA methylation, supporting their elevated expression in tumors. Interaction analyses revealed distinct immune- and signaling-related gene and protein networks. <b>Conclusion:</b> CCL18 shows strong prognostic and immunological relevance in BRCA, while EGF appears to play a broader oncogenic role.

DAD was categorized as either 'undiagnosed DAD' (meeting symptom criteria on the PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7 but without a prior diagnosis or treatment) or 'diagnosed DAD' (having a prior diagnosis and/or current treatment). Relative to diagnosed DAD, associations with undiagnosed DAD were estimated using logistic regression. The analytic sample included 2,388 women in Bangladesh and 960 women in Nepal with undiagnosed DAD and diagnosed with DAD. The prevalence of undiagnosed DAD was 44.8% in Bangladesh and 60.0% in Nepal. In Bangladesh, in adjusted logistic regression analysis, having a big problem with permission to go to a health facility (Adjusted Odds Ratio-AOR: 1.53, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.21-1.93, p < 0.001), being widowed (AOR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.40-2.99, p < 0.001) and being divorced or separated (AOR: 2.30, 95% CI:1.40-3.77, p < 0.001) were significantly positively associated with undiagnosed DAD. Having secondary or higher education (AOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58-0.97, p = 0.028) was significantly negatively associated with undiagnosed DAD.

This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks. The proposed set of indicators offers a validated foundation for improving NCD care delivery and aligns with efforts to achieve SDG target 3.4.

The principal objective of this study was to investigate the antidiabetic, antilipidemic and antiarthritic effects of methanol (MCR) and ethanol (ECR) extracts and dichloromethane fraction (DCR) of Catharanthus roseus leaves by in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico model. The in-vivo antihyperglycemic activity of C. roseus was explored in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Type- 1 diabetic mice model. MCR, ECR and DCR exhibited a significant ability to lower fasting blood glucose levels and normalized the altered body weight when treatment was carried out for 20 days in a dose-dependent manner. Among the experimental samples, ECR at 200 mg/kg (4.95 ± 0.31 mmol/L) showed greater fasting blood glucose lowering activity than the standard drugs metformin (6.8 ± 0.34 mmol/L), and glibenclamide (5.20 ± 0.29 mmol/L). MCR at 200 mg/kg, likewise significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the blood glucose (5.70 ± 0.12 mmol/L) compared to the control at day 20. The lipid profile (LDL, HDL, TG, and TC) of diabetic mice was significantly reduced by ECR in a biochemical study compared to the control group. The in-vitro antidiabetic study revealed a dose-dependent hypoglycemic potential of the extracts and fraction; where ECR showed the highest α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory effects with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.62 ± 0.02 mg/ml and 0.64 ± 0.01 mg/ml respectively. The antiarthritic activity was assessed by using bovine serum albumin denaturation inhibition assay and the denaturation was found to be inhibited by all extracts and fraction. The MCR and DCR fractions inhibited the denaturation by 70.20% and 62.09%, respectively, at 1600 µg/mL compared to the standard aspirin (81.57%). Moreover, the Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometric (GC-MS) investigation of the extract revealed several bioactive constituents and the in-silico docking study suggested that Ergost- 5-en- 3-ol, (3.beta.)-; Stigmasterol; 9,19-Cyclolanostan- 3-ol, acetate, (3.beta.)-;.gamma.-Sitosterol, and 24-Norursa- 3,12-diene would be the probable lead compounds for hypoglycemic and antiarthritic effect in many potential targets, however, further mechanistic and experimental elucidation is needed to solidify our findings.",

In a nested case-cohort from the CHAIN cohort, we compared aflatoxin exposure at admission and discharge with death or survival in hospital (n=755) or up to 180-days post-discharge (n=585) and with community participants (CP, n=222). Children were stratified into non-wasting, medium-wasting and severe-wasting groups based on mid-upper arm circumference. Serum samples were analysed for an aflatoxin exposure biomarker, the aflatoxin-albumin adduct (AF-alb) using ELISA. Overall, 56% of hospitalised participants tested positive for AF-alb at admission. The AF-alb level was higher in deceased (geometric mean and 95% CI (GM and 95% CI) 5.9 (4.9 to 7.1)) than in survivors (4.2 (3.8 to 4.7)) and CP (3.7 (3.1 to 4.3)) pg/mg alb. AF-alb concentration was higher at admission (4.7, (4.2 to 5.1)) than at discharge (3.7, (3.3 to 4.1)) and in the CP group (3.7, (3.1 to 4.3)) pg/mg alb (p<0.01) and in African vs Asian children (7.4 (6.5 to 8.5) vs 1.9 (1.8 to 2.1)) (p<0.001). Adjusted logistical regression showed no significant association between AF-alb levels and mortality, but after separating the nutrition strata, AF-alb was significantly associated with mortality (highest vs lowest quartile group OR=4.84, p=0.014) in non-wasted children. Moderate to severe malnutrition is a more important risk factor for mortality than aflatoxin in acutely ill children, but aflatoxin exposure may contribute to mortality in non-wasted children. Controlling aflatoxin exposure should be integrated into clinical and public health interventions to reduce mortality in areas with high levels of exposure.

        "abstract": "Precise liver segmentation is critical for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning, serving as a foundation for medical image analysis. However, existing methods struggle with limited labeled data, poor generalizability, and insufficient integration of anatomical and clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Few-Shot Segmentation model with Unified Liver Representation (FSS-ULivR), which employs a ResNet-based encoder enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation modules to improve feature learning, an enhanced prototype module that utilizes a transformer block and channel attention for dynamic feature refinement, and a decoder with improved attention gates and residual refinement strategies to recover spatial details from encoder skip connections. Through extensive experiments, our FSS-ULivR model achieved an outstanding Dice coefficient of 98.94%, Intersection over Union (IoU) of 97.44% and a specificity of 93.78% on the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated its generalizability, with Dice scores of 95.43%, 92.98%, 90.72%, and 94.05% on 3DIRCADB01, Colorectal Liver Metastases, Computed Tomography Organs (CT-ORG), and Medical Segmentation Decathlon Task 3: Liver datasets, respectively. In multi-organ segmentation on CT-ORG, it delivered Dice scores ranging from 85.93% to 94.26% across bladder, bones, kidneys, and lungs. For brain tumor segmentation on BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets, average Dice scores were 90.64% and 89.36% across whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor regions. These results emphasize the clinical importance of our model by demonstrating its ability to deliver precise and reliable segmentation through artificial intelligence techniques and engineering solutions, even in scenarios with scarce annotated data.",

        "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are an emerging environmental contaminant of increasing concern due to their potential adverse effects on human health. While indoor environments represent a significant location for human exposure, data on MP occurrence and characteristics in these settings remain limited, particularly in densely populated urban areas. This study first investigated the abundance, distribution, characteristics, and potential risks of MPs in settled dust collected from classrooms within educational institutions in the megacity of Bangladesh. Microplastics were extracted from dust samples using wet peroxide oxidation. Quantification and morphological characterization (shape, size, color) were performed using stereomicroscopy. Polymer identification was conducted using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDS) was employed to analyze surface morphology and elemental composition. The mean abundance of MPs was 16436.67 ± 8534.06 n/kg, with considerable variability observed across sampling locations. Fibers comprised the predominant shape (89 %), with the 100-500 μm size range being most prevalent (44 %). Black was the most frequently observed color (35.5 %). Polystyrene (PS) was the most abundant polymer type (40.6 %), followed by polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide (PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyurethane (PUR). The pollution load index (PLI) values exceeded 1, indicating significant MP contamination. Other risk assessment indices, including the contamination factor (range: 1.00-6.14) and the Nemerow pollution index (range: 4.40-6.14), suggested moderate to high levels of MP pollution. The polymeric hazard index (269.33-1150.73) indicated considerable to high polymer-associated risks. SEM-EDS analysis revealed the presence of secondary MPs and associated potentially toxic elements (e.g., Hg, Pb, As). Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that both indoor activities and the outdoor environment contribute to MP pollution in classrooms. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) via dust ingestion were 0.39 ± 0.20 particles/day for children and 0.29 ± 0.15 particles/day for adults. Lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) assessments indicated a potential for moderate carcinogenic risk for both exposure groups, with children exhibiting a higher estimated risk. These findings highlight the need for further research to fully characterize indoor MP exposure's sources, pathways, and health risks and develop effective mitigation strategies.",

Folic acid (FA) supplementation enhances one-carbon metabolism (OCM), thus promoting arsenic methylation and facilitating urinary arsenic elimination. Here, we investigate the metabolic profiles linked to arsenic exposure and metabolism based on a FA clinical trial. Arsenic exposure was assessed by the concentrations of blood arsenic (bAs) species: arsenite [InAs<sup>III</sup>], arsenate [InAs<sup>V</sup>], monomethyl- [MMA], and dimethyl- [DMA] arsenicals. Arsenic metabolism was assessed by the relative distribution (%) of these arsenicals in urine. Nontargeted metabolomic profiling was analyzed by LC-HRMS. OCM-related metabolites were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. Metabolomic profiling identified 8 unique metabolites and 812 metabolomic features (FDR < 0.05) associated with bAs (predominantly As<sup>V</sup>), and 66 metabolites and 285 metabolomic features with %uAs (predominantly %uInAs). Metabolic pathways enriched for bAs and %uAs were similar, highlighting phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. A FA-induced %uInAs change was associated with four metabolites, three of which share links to acetyl-CoA metabolism. Of 11 measured OCM metabolites, cystathionine was positively associated with all bAs species. Methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cysteine, choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine were associated with increased As methylation profiles in urine (FDR < 0.05). Collectively, these findings may aid in the discovery of mechanisms underlying arsenic-induced health outcomes and potential targeted interventions.

Early identification of SC plays a crucial role in effective treatment. However, protecting patient data privacy is a major concern in medical research. Therefore, this study presents a smart framework for classifying SC leveraging deep learning (DL), federated learning (FL) and explainable AI (XAI). We tested the presented framework on two well-known datasets, ISBI2016 and ISBI2017. The data was first preprocessed by several techniques: resizing, normalization, balancing, and augmentation. Six advanced DL algorithms-VGG16, Xception, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, MobileViT, and InceptionResNetV2-were applied for classification tasks. Among these, the DenseNet169 algorithm obtained the highest accuracy of 83.3% in ISBI2016 and 92.67% in ISBI2017. All models were then tested in an FL platform to maintain data privacy. In the FL platform, the VGG16 algorithm showed the best results, with 92.08% accuracy on ISBI2016 and 94% on ISBI2017. To ensure model interpretability, an XAI-based algorithm named Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) was used to explain the predictions of the proposed framework.

        "abstract": "Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common infectious diseases and remain a heavy burden, especially in some low-income countries. Although the global burden has decreased over the past three decades, an analysis of the burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever will help inform public health strategies. This study is aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of typhoid and paratyphoid, and the temporal trends while exploring potential associations with socio-demographic development over three decades (1990-2021). Data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2021. For this analysis, we calculated to demonstrate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021. From 1990 to 2021, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever showed declining trends globally and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, including incidence, mortality, and DALYs. For typhoid fever worldwide, new cases decreased by 62.12%, with an EAPC of -3.92 (-4.14, -3.71); deaths decreased by 50.65%, EAPC - 2.83 (-2.99, -2.66), and DALYs decreased by 52.30%, EAPC - 2.82 (-3.00, -2.64). For paratyphoid fever, new cases decreased by 73.15%, with an EAPC of -4.77 (-5.29, -4.26); deaths decreased by 65.44%, EAPC - 3.74 (-4.24, -3.24), and DALYs decreased by 68.42%, EAPC - 3.87 (-4.42, -3.31). For both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, children had the highest morbidity and mortality rates; males had higher rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs than females. However, among older patients, the absolute number of new cases and DALYs was higher in women. The burden is concentrated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, with only South Asia suffering severely from paratyphoid fever. Regarding typhoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of incidence are Burkina Faso (328.48) (SDI: 0.285), Bangladesh (303.14) (SDI: 0.492), and Papua New Guinea (299.45) (SDI: 418) which are in Western Sub-Saharan, South Asia, and Oceania. The top three countries in terms of mortality and DALYs are Bhutan (5.61; 434.23) (SDI: 0.473), Bangladesh (5.06; 382.38), and Burkina Faso (4.64; 352.57). Regarding paratyphoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of mortality and DALYs are the same, including Pakistan (1.05; 72.66), India (0.75; 53.42), and Nepal (0.72; 50.65) (SDI: 0.433), all of which are located in South Asia.",

Ontologies, which are structured frameworks that outline the relationships between concepts in a certain field, offer a crucial foundation for combining different biological data. Novel insights into the construction of a precision medicine approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are given by growing advancements in the area of pharmacogenomics. Affected parts of the central nervous system may develop neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism spectrum, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These models allow for standard and helpful data marking, which is needed for crossdisciplinary study and teamwork. With case studies, you can see how ontologies have been used to find biomarkers, understand how sicknesses work, and make models for predicting how drugs will work and how the disease will get worse. For example, problems with data quality, meaning variety, and the need for constant changes to reflect the growing body of scientific knowledge are discussed in this review. It also looks at how semantic data can be mixed with cutting-edge computer methods such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to make brain disease diagnostic and prediction models more exact and accurate. These collaborative networks aim to identify patients at risk, identify patients in the preclinical or early stages of illness, and develop tailored preventative interventions to enhance patient quality of life and prognosis. They also seek to identify new, robust, and effective methods for these patient identification tasks.

In this study, QDs conjugated with disease-specific antibodies were used to enhance the imaging of oral tissues. A total of 50 oral biopsy samples were analyzed, with 25 samples serving as controls and 25 samples displaying confirmed pathological conditions. Samples were incubated with QD conjugates and imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Signal intensity and target specificity were evaluated using image analysis software. Arbitrary fluorescence intensity values were measured to quantify imaging efficiency. The fluorescence intensity values for pathological tissues labeled with QDs showed a mean of 120 ± 10 arbitrary units (AUs), significantly higher compared to 50 ± 5 AU in control tissues. The use of QDs demonstrated enhanced sensitivity in detecting pathological changes, with a specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 90% in distinguishing diseased from healthy tissues. Additionally, the photostability of QDs ensured consistent imaging results over prolonged observation times. Quantum dot imaging offers a novel, highly sensitive approach to the detection of oral diseases.

The growth of oral cancer cells is thought to be influenced by certain lifestyle choices. Oral squamous cell carcinoma, or SCC-25, cell lines were used in a carefully monitored <i>in vitro</i> investigation. Three sets of cells were created: one for smoking exposure (treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) at concentrations of 10 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL, and 50 μg/mL), one for alcohol exposure (treated with ethanol at concentrations of 1%, 5%, and 10%), and one for control (no exposure). There was also a combined exposure group that comprised both drinking and smoking. An MTT test was used to measure cell viability and proliferation rates at 24, 48, and 72 hours. ANOVA was used for statistical analysis to compare groups. Exposure to ethanol and CSE dramatically decreased cell viability in a way that was dependent on both time and dosage. After 10 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL, and 50 μg/mL, the smoking group's proliferation reduced by 25%, 35%, and 50% after 72 hours, respectively.

As non-invasive diagnostic methods, salivary biomarkers have shown promise in the early diagnosis of OSCC. The purpose of this research is to assess certain salivary biomarkers to ascertain how well they can detect OSCC in its early phases. Ninety participants were split into three groups for a cross-sectional study: 30 OSCC patients, 30 people with oral premalignant lesions (OPLs), and 30 healthy controls. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in unstimulated saliva samples. ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests were used in the statistical analysis to compare the amounts of biomarkers in each group. OSCC patients had a mean IL-6 concentration of 250 ± 25 pg/mL, which was substantially greater than the OPL group's concentration of 100 ± 15 pg/mL and the healthy controls' concentration of 30 ± 5 pg/mL (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Similarly, OSCC patients had higher MMP-9 levels (500 ± 50 ng/mL) than OPL (300 ± 40 ng/mL) and controls (100 ± 20 ng/mL) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The OPL group (600 ± 60 U/L) and controls (300 ± 50 U/L) had lower LDH activity than OSCC patients (850 ± 70 U/L) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). High sensitivity and specificity were shown by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for all three biomarkers in differentiating OSCC from OPL and healthy controls. Salivary biomarkers, including MMP-9, LDH, and IL-6, show great promise for the early, non-invasive identification of OSCC. By integrating these biomarkers into standard diagnostic procedures, OSCC-related morbidity and mortality may be decreased and early diagnosis and treatment results may be enhanced.",

Recurrence of the malignancy is frequent even after the standard treatment, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Drug repurposing offers a cost-effective strategy to identify new treatments, while affinity-based local delivery systems could provide controlled release of therapeutics within the tumor resection cavity. The aims of this study are two-fold. Firstly, to categorize currently available neurological therapeutics according to their charge and suitability for use with affinity-based drug delivery systems. Secondly, to systematically search and evaluate the evidence for anticancer and/or anti-glioblastoma activity for potentially being repurposed/repositioned. The 'neurology/psychiatry' category of the Broad Institute Drug Repurposing Hub (468 compounds) was screened for chemical suitability and anticancer efficacy. Charge, lipophilicity, solubility at pH 7.4 were calculated using Chemicalize. A systematic search for the anticancer efficacy of the charged compounds was carried out via the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Sci-Finder, Ovid via Medline, Cochrane and ClinicalTrial.gov. Among the 468 compounds, 283 were identified as charged at physiological pH. Notably, 146 charged candidates were found to have anticancer activity, of which 91 showed promising activity against at least one type of brain neoplasm. A few compounds, such as chlorpromazine, valproic acid and sertraline were investigated in clinical settings, while most were assessed through in vitro viability studies. The data complied herein should serve as a repository and starting point for future research on repurposing neurological drugs with anticancer properties via electrostatic affinity-based drug delivery systems.",

The key objective is to improve the prediction accuracy through hyperparameter optimization. <b>Methods:</b> In order to achieve this, we have used a metaheuristic algorithm, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and its modified version. The modifications that we introduced in the original WOA algorithm are a piecewise linear chaotic map for population initialization and inertia weight. Both of our algorithms optimize the hyperparameters of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to increase the overall performance. The proposed algorithms were applied to the dataset collected from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Machine Learning Repository to predict the chances of recurrence for DTC. This dataset consists of 383 samples with a total of 16 features. Each feature captures the critical medical and demographic information. <b>Results:</b> The model has shown an accuracy of 99% when optimized with WOA and 97% accuracy when optimized with the modified WOA. <b>Conclusions:</b> Furthermore, we have compared our work with other innovative works and validated the performance of our model for the prediction of DTC recurrence.",

        "title": "Herd immunity and prevention in HPV transmission with exogenous reinfection.",
        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health concern, primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which spreads through unsafe sexual contact. Natural immunity often fails to provide full protection, permitting exogenous reinfection, which plays a key role in the persistence and transmission of HPV. This paper presents and analyzes a deterministic mathematical model of HPV transmission, incorporating exogenous re-infection. We utilized VIA test result data from 2019 to 2023 in Bangladesh to estimate key parameter values. The findings were validated through numerical simulations using MATLAB, and the analytical results demonstrated strong consistency with the numerical outputs. A critical insight is the presence of reinfection-induced backward bifurcation, indicating that targeting primary infections alone is insufficient for eradication, highlighting the need to address exogenous reinfection for effective control. We propose optimal control strategies tailored to resource-limited settings like Bangladesh, where limited vaccine access presents significant challenges, and community-driven education on safe sexual practices is crucial and continuously evolving. The results emphasize that the most effective approach combines targeted prevention with widespread community education, while precision in intervention implementation is essential to prevent reinfection surges that could prolong disease persistence and undermine control efforts. These insights provide a strong foundation for refining intervention strategies and offer valuable guidance for controlling HPV transmission through non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly in resource-constrained settings.",

        "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are essential for individuals' health, well-being, survival, and economic development. A stakeholder-led approach to research prioritisation was essential to guide SRHR-related research in Bangladesh. Accordingly, we conducted a research prioritisation exercise to identify health research priorities related to SRHR in Bangladesh. We adopted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative (CHNRI) method for this study. Five themes - adolescent Health (AH), fertility, gynaecological issues (GI), maternal and neonatal health (MNH), and SRH of key populations (SRHKP) - were selected from the broader field of SRHR. Seventy-six experts submitted 454 research questions (RQs), which were then condensed into 197 unique RQs and distributed to all experts for scoring based on five pre-selected criteria. Weighted and unweighted research priority scores (RPS) and average expert agreement (AEA) were calculated to compile a list of top-ranked RQs. The weighted RPSs for the 197 RQs ranged from 0.944 to 0.623, with a median of 0.848. Among the top 20 list, six RQs belonged to AH, one to Fertility, two to GI, six to MNH, and five to SRHKP. For AH, top ranked RQs included adolescent pregnancy, sexual health education, and mental health. Promoting proper birth spacing among newlywed and underaged married women were top RQs for fertility. GI priorities emphasised early detection of gynaecological cancers, including HPV testing for cervical cancer screening. The MNH research focused on Newborn Stabilizing Units at sub-district hospitals, PPH bundle approaches, and counselling on danger signs to prevent adverse birth outcomes. The top-ranked RQs in SRHKP addressed stigma and discrimination towards key populations (KPs) and their impact on SRH behaviours. There was significant overlap between the top 20 RQs ranked by RPS and AEA. The study emphasises the need for intervention research to address barriers, assess effectiveness, and enhance the uptake of evidence-based and innovative interventions for SRHR in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with increasing incidence rates in developing countries, including Bangladesh. Understanding BC awareness and self-examination practices among young women is essential for enhancing early detection and prevention efforts. This study aims to assess BC awareness, knowledge of risk factors, and the practice of breast self-examination (BSE) among female university students in Dinajpur District, Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 undergraduate and postgraduate female students at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU) from May 12 to June 20, 2024. Data were collected using a self-structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews, which collected information on socio-demographic characteristics, BC awareness, risk factors, and self-examination practices. Descriptive statistics, percentages, and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the data. SPSS (version 26.0) and R software (version 4.0.2) were employed for statistical analysis. The study found that 92.4% of participants had heard of BC, with social media being the primary source of information. Although 88.4% recognized the importance of early detection, only 19.1% practiced BC screening, and 2.8% had undergone mammography. While 51.8% reported awareness of BSE, only 4.8% performed it regularly. Significant barriers to BSE included a lack of knowledge (70.7%) and concerns about effectiveness or privacy. Socioeconomic factors were found to significantly influence BC awareness, with rural students and those from lower-income families exhibiting lower awareness. Additionally, students relying on family income or scholarships had lower awareness compared to those in business. The study highlights a high level of BC awareness among female university students, but significant gaps remain in self-examination practices and practical engagement. Socioeconomic status and income sources are key factors influencing BC awareness. Targeted educational interventions are needed to address these gaps and improve early detection and preventive practices among female university students.",

        "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive among the breast cancer subtypes and poses unique therapeutic challenges due to its distinct characteristics like lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC demonstrates poor survival rate enhanced immunogenic characteristics and a more favorable tumor microenvironment than other breast cancer variants. Also, TNBC patients show elevated levels of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in contrast to non-TNBC patients. Binding of PD-L1 with PD-1 produces an inhibitory signal, resulting in suppression of T-cell. Therapeutic approaches utilizing immunotherapies against PD-L1 exhibit promising outcomes in the treatment of TNBC. Limitations like suboptimal efficacy, inadequate oral bioavailability, and associated immune-related adverse effects of antibody-mediated anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have necessitated the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Thus, small molecules become an alternate option for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. In the present study, we have used virtual screening to identify potential phytochemicals from selected Indian medicinal plants as PD-L1 inhibitors. A total of 953 phytochemicals derived from eleven selected medicinal plants were initially screened through molecular docking using the PyRx tool. Among the 953 identified phytochemicals, the top 20 compounds exhibiting the highest binding affinities in docking study were selected for further analysis. Following comprehensive ADMET analyses, 2 compounds were ultimately identified as suitable candidates for a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. The study identified 4-hydroxychalcone and flavylium from Glycyrrhiza glabra and Catharanthus roseus, respectively as potential PD-L1 inhibitors with enhanced stability relative to the reference molecule. Both compounds also showed enhanced gastrointestinal absorption with no predicted cytotoxic and immunotoxic effects. Consequently, these compounds present promising candidates for novel PD-L1 inhibitor development in TNBC therapy. Further experimental investigations are necessary to facilitate their clinical translation.",

        "abstract": "Accurate nuclei segmentation and classification in histology images are critical for cancer detection but remain challenging due to color inconsistency, blurry boundaries, and overlapping nuclei. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and labor-intensive, highlighting the need for efficient and scalable automated solutions. This study proposes a deep learning framework that combines segmentation and classification to enhance nuclei evaluation in histopathology images. The framework follows a two-stage approach: first, a SegNet model segments the nuclei regions, and then a DenseNet121 model classifies the segmented instances. Hyperparameter optimization using the Hyperband method enhances the performance of both models. To protect data privacy, the framework employs a FedAvg-based federated learning scheme, enabling decentralized training without exposing sensitive data. For efficient deployment on edge devices, full integer quantization is applied to reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results show that the SegNet model achieves 91.4% Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA), 63% Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), and 90.6% Frequency-Weighted IoU (FWIoU). The DenseNet121 classifier achieves 83% accuracy and a 67% Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), surpassing state-of-the-art models. Post-quantization, both models exhibit performance gains of 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively. The proposed framework demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical deployment in cancer diagnosis.",

Therefore, we utilize integrated immuno and bioinformatics approaches in this study to design a peptide vaccine against HIV infection by targeting its complete genome. The complete genome sequence was analyzed, and the potential B and T cells were predicted. Among the predicted epitopes, the promising ones were selected and further used with the adjuvant and linker to formulate a vaccine candidate. The vaccine was modeled, and its activity and stability towards the TLRs were analyzed via docking and dynamics (500ns). The vaccine-generated immune activity and expression via <i>in</i>-<i>silico</i> cloning were also evaluated. A total of 6 B cells, 7 CTL, and 6 HTL were identified as an immunodominant epitope and used for vaccine formulation. These epitopes were fused together via linkers, and their efficiency and constancy were enhanced with Adjuvant, PADRE epitope, and His-tag. Further, the formulated vaccine shows high population coverage and stable features based on the 2D and 3D assessments. The docking investigation demonstrated the strong activity of the vaccine towards the TLR2 and TLR3, having binding affinity − 10.8 kcal/mol-1 and − 15.8 kcal/mol-1, and also disclosed remarkable constancy based on the 500ns simulation period. The vaccine-assisted immune simulation and expression level in the vector revealed a robust immune response towards the host based on the vaccination and a significant expression level. Based on the integrated approach and validation steps, the overall finding suggests that the formulated vaccine may have strongly immunodominant properties and could combat the infection.

        "abstract": "Approximately one-third of global lip and oral cavity cancer (LOC) cases are linked to smokeless tobacco or areca nut (AN) consumption. Over the past 32 y, AN production has significantly increased, accompanied by rising international trade. This study explores the relationship between changes in AN production/import quantities and LOC incidence in regions where consumption is prevalent. LOC incidence rates were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease and GLOBOCAN databases, while AN production and import data were sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database and Hainan province's statistical yearbook. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to evaluated the relationship between AN production or AN imports and LOC incidence rate in AN-producing/importing regions. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the trends of AN production, AN imports, and LOC incidence in AN-producing/importing regions. In 2021, the total AN production of 12 regions (Bangladesh, Bhutan, China mainland, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand) was 5.4 times that of 1990, with an average annual production of 1,177,926 tons. A strong positive correlation (<i>R</i> ≥ 0.8, <i>P</i> < 0.001) was observed between increased production and LOC incidence in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China mainland, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the combined data for all 12 regions. Additionally, among the top 10 countries by average annual AN imports from 2012 to 2021, a positive correlation was observed between their average annual imports and the incidence of LOC in 2022. The findings highlight a positive correlation between large-scale AN production and a rising LOC incidence rate, and AN imports may be associated with a higher incidence of LOC. These results support the need for regulatory measures on AN similar to those used for tobacco to address this growing public health concern.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) remains the most prevalent cancer among women, with high recurrence rates highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study evaluates the chemopreventive potential of daidzin, a dietary isoflavone, as a targeted inhibitor of key oncogenic proteins involved in BC progression. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BC cells and normal samples were identified using the GSE85871 dataset. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and validation using the TCGA cohort were conducted to elucidate daidzin's regulatory impact. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, principle component analysis (PCA), free energy landscape (FEL) analysis, Secondary structure analysis (SSA) and MM-GBSA calculations, including per-residue decomposition, were employed to characterize the binding interactions. Furthermore, the ADMET properties were also conducted for diazin to see the druggability. The analysis revealed 449 upregulated and 644 downregulated genes following daidzin treatment. KEGG pathway enrichment indicated significant downregulation of cancer-associated pathways, including PI3K-Akt signaling, focal adhesion, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Expression and validation analyses confirmed that daidzin effectively targets and inhibits key oncogenes such as KRAS, CCND1, CDH11, and MDM2, which play crucial roles in BC progression and serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Molecular docking demonstrated favorable binding affinities of daidzin to these oncogenic proteins, while MD simulations, PCA, FEL, SSA and MM-GBSA results confirmed stable and favorable interactions, particularly with KRAS, CCND1, and MDM2. Additionally, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) analyses revealed high chemical reactivity of daidzin. Additionally, ADMET profiling confirmed favorable drug-like properties and acceptable pharmacokinetic characteristics of daidzin. Overall, this integrated analysis suggests that daidzin could serve as a promising natural agent for breast cancer chemoprevention by targeting and downregulating essential oncogenes and disrupting critical cancer-associated signaling pathways.",

        "abstract": "Despite the disproportionate burden of cancer morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), little is known about patients' care experiences in these settings. This study assesses which aspects of physician communication and care coordination most influence patients' overall experience with care, and factors associated with patient experience ratings, to inform quality improvement and improve cancer care experiences in LMICs. In a cross-sectional study of 1933 patients with advanced cancer recruited at 10 major public hospitals in seven LMICs in Asia, patients rated their experience with physician communication, care coordination and overall. Physician communication mattered most in patients' assessment of overall experience with care. Patient use of traditional medicine was associated with poorer physician communication ratings (β: -1.38, 95% CI: -2.11 to 0.65), while outpatient care (0.91, 95% CI: 0.24 to 1.57) was associated with higher ratings. Patients who were unsure (-0.77, 95% CI: -1.43 to -0.10) of their cancer stage (relative to aware of late-stage), or indicated financial difficulty (sufficient money to cover their daily needs fairly well (-0.77, 95% CI: -1.50 to -0.04) or poorly (-1.20, 95% CI: -2.30 to -0.09) relative to very well) rated care coordination lower. Patient experience ratings differed by minority group status and cancer severity understanding. Respondents identifying as ethnic minorities who were unsure of their cancer stage rated physician communication significantly higher (1.64, 95% CI: 0.71 to 2.58) than non-minorities aware of their advanced cancer. Non-minorities unsure of their cancer stage rated care coordination significantly lower (-1.00, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.36) than non-minority patients aware of their cancer stage. This study provides new understanding of care priorities among patients with advanced cancer in LMICs. Our findings highlight the importance patients attribute to physician communication and considerations for improving patient-centred communication to support equitable and culturally appropriate care.

However, its therapeutic potential in convulsant management remains largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the anticonvulsant effects of LQB in an In Vivo model and to examine its molecular interactions via In Silico docking simulations. In the In Vivo study, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 80 mg/kg to induce convulsions, and the test animals were treated orally with three doses of LQB (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg), with carbamazepine (CBZ) at 80 mg/kg as a standard drug. The results indicated that LQB at all tested doses significantly (p < 0.05) prolonged seizure latency and decreased convulsion frequency, with the 10 mg/kg dose showing the most significant effects. Furthermore, the combination of LQB (10 mg/kg) and CBZ (80 mg/kg) resulted in a synergistic increase in anticonvulsant activity. In the In Silico study, molecular docking analysis revealed that both LQB and CBZ interacted with the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), a key receptor involved in convulsions, with LQB demonstrating a binding affinity (BA) of -5.4 kcal/mol, which was moderate compared to CBZ's BA. LQB showed potential anti-convulsant activity in PTZ-induced convulsion animals, possibly through blocking sodium channel receptors. Further studies are needed to clarify its mechanisms and clinical potential in convulsion treatment.",

        "abstract": "Cancer cells exhibit significant heterogeneity, making their detection a challenging task. In this study, a unique Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) sensor with a circular core design and curved trapezoidal cladding is presented. It is especially designed to detect cancer cells efficiently. The proposed sensor demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a maximum relative sensitivity (RS) of 99.71% for breast cancer type II cells, along with similarly high sensitivities for cervical, adrenal gland, skin, blood, and breast cancer type I cells. Key performance parameters highlight its accuracy in detecting cancer cells via minute changes in refractive index (RI), including ultra-low confinement loss (CL) of up to 6.69 × 10<sup>-13</sup> dB/cm and effective material loss (EML) as low as 0.00161 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The sensor's high accuracy, rapid response time, and ability to selectively target tumor cells make it a breakthrough in early cancer detection. Moreover, its compact size and potential for easy fabrication enhance its applicability in emergency settings. This cutting-edge approach represents a major advancement in medical technology, paving the way for more efficient and targeted cancer diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Information on the attributable fraction (AF) of cancer in Bangladesh is scarce. We aimed at estimating the AF of tobacco-related cancer in Bangladesh in 2020. Data on prevalence of tobacco use (smokeless, smoking products, and second-hand smoke [SHS]) were derived from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey report (2009), while data on relative risks were derived from meta-analyses and large-scale Indian studies. The GLOBOCAN 2020 database was used to obtain the number of cancer cases and deaths. Concomitant use of both tobacco products was accounted for. Sex-specific and combined estimates were calculated, based on the counterfactual scenario of no exposure to tobacco. Smokeless tobacco was primarily responsible for oral (55.3%), esophageal (37.1%), laryngeal (33.4%) and pharyngeal (31.5%) cancer. Cigarette smoking was responsible mainly for esophageal (40.1%), pancreatic (34.2%) and lung (26.0%) cancer, while bidi caused mainly pharyngeal (49.2%), laryngeal (36.4%) and esophageal (33.3%) cancer. Overall, smokeless tobacco caused 14.6% of cases and 15.1% of deaths, while cigarette smoking caused 11.8% of cases and 15.3% of deaths and bidi smoking 14.1% of cases and 15.8% of deaths. SHS caused 0.6% and 0.8% of cases and deaths respectively. The combined use of tobacco products particularly contributed to esophageal and pancreatic cancers. Tobacco was a major cause of cancer in Bangladesh in 2020, with smokeless and bidi smoking overcoming cigarette's contribution. Its control would greatly reduce cancer burden.",

        "abstract": "The identification of key features and reliable phenotype classification remains pivotal in cancer research, with direct implications for early diagnosis, prognosis, treatment optimization, and cost reduction in healthcare. This study introduces a hybrid model that integrates statistical and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance feature selection and improve classification accuracy for cancer phenotypes. Five well-known statistical tests (LIMMA, SAM, ANOVA, KW-test, and t-test) are employed to identify significant features based on statistical decision markers. The dominant features identified across both binary and multi-class datasets are then used for cancer phenotype classification using various ML methods, including LDA, LR, NB, GPC, KNN, ANN, SVM (with radial, polynomial, linear kernels), and RF. The model's robustness is validated using eight distinct microarray gene expression datasets, combined with various resampling protocols. The results show consistent improvements over previous benchmarks in the literature, with the RF classifier performing better in binary classification tasks and SVM-r demonstrating superior performance in multi-class settings. Additionally, the analysis of the bladder cancer dataset led to the identification of 13 key genes (MYH11, CCN1, FHL1, MYL9, EFEMP1, FILIP1L, RGS2, MATN2, CALD1, TNC, PALLD, ADAMTS9-AS2, and CELF2) that demonstrated strong discriminatory power. These genes were further validated through enrichment in relevant GO terms and KEGG pathways, emphasizing their diagnostic and prognostic significance. Moreover, Gene-TF and Gene-miRNA network analyses highlighted critical regulators, including TFs like CYR61, SMAD4, SOX2, TP63, and AR, along with miRNAs such as hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7c-5p, and hsa-miR-16-5p, underscoring the functional impact of the selected features. In conclusion, the proposed approach effectively generates a streamlined set of optimal features, providing valuable biological insights and laying the groundwork for more accurate and effective tools in cancer diagnosis and prediction.",

This work presents the development of an innovative nano-liposomal formulation and assesses its anticancer efficacy against breast cancer cell lines. A sustainable green extraction method was employed to isolate bioactive compounds from T. cordifolia, followed by the development of a nano-liposomal formulation. Particle size and morphology were assessed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), revealing soft, globular vesicles with an average diameter of ~ 153 nm. GC-MS profiling identified 35 phytoconstituents subjected to molecular docking against topoisomerase IIα to predict anticancer potential. The biological activity of the formulation was validated through MTT assay for cell viability, scratch assay for cell migration, and apoptosis assays in MCF-7 and MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell lines. Immunocytochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of Bcl-2, cytochrome-C, and caspase-3. ROS generation was also quantified to confirm the mechanism of action. In silico analysis identified glucobrassicin as a potent topoisomerase IIα inhibitor (docking score: - 10.2655). The formulation exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, inhibited cell migration, and induced apoptosis in both cell lines. ROS-mediated cell death was associated with increased cytochrome-C and caspase-3 expression and decreased Bcl-2 levels. This study underscores the value of integrating green nanotechnology, computational docking, and functional cell-based assays to identify and characterise the bioactive phytochemicals. The T. cordifolia-based liposomal formulation demonstrated promising anticancer activity and warrants further preclinical evaluation as a candidate for breast cancer therapy.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer still stands to be the foremost contributor to cancer-related incidence and mortality in women globally accounting for about 14% of all female cancer-related deaths worldwide. This research seeks to illustrate the mechanisms and clinical findings of natural products against breast cancer treatment. Required data for this review article was retrieved employing several readily obtainable search databases, including Web of Science<sup>®</sup> (Thomson Reuters, USA), PubMed<sup>®</sup> (U.S. National Library of Medicine, USA), and SciVerse Scopus<sup>®</sup> (Elsevier Properties S.A., USA), taking into consideration certain search terms like \"breast cancer,\" \"natural products against breast cancer,\" and \"Clinically proven natural products in the treatment of breast cancer\" and so on. Several natural products, namely Omega-3 fatty acids, dietary isothiocyanates, curcumin, green tea, flaxseed, limonene, and others, were found to modulate crucial pathways in breast cancer cells. These substances suppressed angiogenesis by downregulating the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promoted apoptosis by activating caspase enzymes, and prevented cell proliferation by controlling cyclin-dependent kinases. Clinical studies demonstrated improved outcomes in patients receiving these natural products with standard treatment procedures. The findings underscore the multifaceted functions of natural products in breast cancer therapy, highlighting their potential to increase the efficacy of conventional treatments while reducing adverse effects. Further exploration of synergistic actions and optimal dosages is needed. Clinically proven natural products represent a potential avenue for breast cancer treatment with their mechanistic insights that facilitate their incorporation into treatment regimens. To maximize clinical applications, future inquiries should center on elucidating the full spectrum of these anticancer functions.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant therapeutic advancements in recent decades, colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to exhibit high rates of mortality and morbidity. Chemoresistance and cancer recurrence remain substantial challenges, underscoring the need for novel treatment approaches. Iron chelation therapy has gained profound interest over the years as a potential cancer treatment, leveraging the increased iron demand by tumors. This review evaluates the effects of iron chelation therapy on CRC progression and the underlying mechanisms. A comprehensive review of in vivo and in vitro studies was conducted to assess the effectiveness of iron chelation therapy in CRC. The literature search covered PubMed, Scopus, Medline (via Web of Science), and EMBASE between January 1995 and March 2024. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have investigated the impact of iron chelators, such as deferoxamine, deferasirox, thiosemicarbazone-based chelators, quilamine-based chelators, and other novel compounds on CRC. Natural plant extracts with iron-chelating properties have also been explored as potential treatments. Most studies indicate that iron chelation can inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells, though some studies suggest cancer-promoting effects. Mechanistically, iron chelation affects several hallmarks of CRC by modulating histone methylation, upregulating NDRG1, and influencing the Wnt/β-catenin and p53 signaling pathways. However, certain iron chelators may inhibit TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and activate the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), potentially accelerating CRC progression. Future exploration of iron chelation therapy in CRC should focus on extensive in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved. A deeper understanding of the genetic and cellular alterations induced by iron chelation will enhance the development of effective therapeutic strategies for CRC.",

        "abstract": "Acromegaly, characterized by persistent hypersecretion of growth hormone (GH), is most often caused by a pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET), though, less often, ectopic GH or GH-releasing hormone secretion from various neoplasms outside the pituitary gland could cause it. Nearly 70% of somatotroph PitNETs are macroadenomas at diagnosis. Transsphenoidal surgery, the most effective treatment modality for acromegaly, could achieve remission in 73%. However, the remission rates could reach 87% if surgery is followed by medical therapy. Due to variable therapeutic responses to surgical and medical therapy, pre-treatment awareness regarding the best therapeutic modality based on clinical, biochemical, radiological, histopathological and genetic parameters would help in accurate pretreatment decision-making. Earlier studies have identified poor prognosis markers like tumor size, tumor invasion, T2-weighted hyperintensity, granulation, and pretreatment GH and/or insulin-like growth factor 1 levels. In a recent study, published by Alvarez <i>et al</i> identified that preoperative PitNET volume is a good predictor of control of acromegaly following surgical treatment and the likelihood of requiring more aggressive additional therapies after surgery. They found that PitNET volume exceeding 3697 mm³ was associated with poorer disease control in patients with somatotroph PitNETs.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-pocket (OOP) cost of cancer treatment has increased substantially globally. In low- and middle-income countries, many patients face financial distress due to cancer. For patients with cancers in Bangladesh, this study aimed to (1) estimate the annual OOP cost of cancers from households' perspective, (2) assess the coping strategies and financial distress, and (3) examine factors associated with OOP cost. We used data from a cross-sectional hospital-based survey conducted in three randomly selected hospitals in Bangladesh. A bottom-up micro-costing approach was used to estimate the OOP cost components. We used the logistic regression model and the generalized linear model to examine the determinants of distress financing and OOP cost, respectively. The average annual OOP cost per cancer patient was US$ 6,504 (range, US$ 959 - 29,681), which was greater than 2 times the average annual household income. About 90% of households faced distress financing due to cancer. Having at least one comorbid condition, cancer stage 2 or higher, households having no elderly people, or having treatment abroad was significantly associated with a higher OOP cost compared to those without the condition. OOP cost of cancer treatment and the proportions of patients with distress financing and financial catastrophe are alarmingly high in Bangladesh. Earlier cancer diagnosis and implementation of Government financial health protection schemes are crucial and urgent to alleviate the enormous economic burden and ensure equitable access to care for the patients.",

But its derivatives' exploration in cancer, specially PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways-based cancer activity not explored yet. This review aims to evaluate the anticancer potential of coumarin derivatives' by exploring their modulatory effects on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway across diverse cancer types. This review adopted a systematic literature approach, emphasizing studies across various cancer types and focusing on coumarin's mechanisms and therapeutic potential. Results reveal that coumarin derivatives suppress PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activity across cancers, such as liver, breast, and colorectal, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 4 µM to > 200 µM in vitro and confirmed effects in vivo. The modulation of other pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, underscores their multi-targeted anticancer action. Despite promising preclinical efficacy, challenges like low bioavailability, potential hepatotoxicity, and systemic toxicity persist. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies suggest that introducing specific functional groups can enhance selectivity, reduce toxicity, and improve therapeutic outcomes. The conclusion reinforces the potential of coumarin derivatives as novel anticancer agents, advocating for structural optimizations and clinical investigations to overcome pharmacokinetic barriers and maximize therapeutic benefits. This exploration offers a strategic perspective on utilizing coumarin-based molecules in advancing cancer therapeutics.",

The current study was conducted at the Department of General Surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Bangladesh from January 2021 to February 2022. In this cross-sectional observational study, 52 patients with histologically established stomach cancer were enrolled. Patient was categorized into two groups (elevated /not elevated CEA and CA19-9 group) after preoperative measurement of CEA and CA19-9 level. About 65.4% of cancers are stage III, 23.1% are stage IV, but stage I tumors account for only 1.9% of all malignancies. In stage I, II, III, IV stomach cancer, CEA increased by 4.3%, 13%, 60.9%, 21.7% and CA19-9 increased by 0.0%, 21.1%, 63.2%, 15.8%. Gastric cancer with raised serum CEA and CA 19-9 level may present as advanced stage. Any extensive surgery in this stage may produce poorer outcome. In GC, CA 19-9 and CEA may be used as monitoring and prognostic tool.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, human papilloma virus (HPV) testing has been added with cytology to aid in detection of high-grade cervical lesions, especially in women aged ≥30 years. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between high-risk HPV (hrHPV) genotype and clinicopathological parameters among the diagnosed patients with both precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. This cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Pathology of Dhaka Medical College and in the collaboration with 'DNA Solution LTD, Dhaka', Bangladesh. The study was conducted over a period of 24 months from July 2018 to June 2020. Following informed written consent, a total of 51 women (18 patients with clinically suspected malignant lesions and 33 with a positive VIA test) were included in this study, and all were subjected to colposcopic examination performed by a gynecologist. Ethical issues were ensured in accordance with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. SPSS version 24.0 was used during data analysis. The average age ±SD of the patients with cervical lesions was 41.86±9.84 years with a range from 25 to 60 years. Approximately half of the participants (n=25, 49.0%) were married for less than 16 years and almost one-tenth were multiparous. Among all cytological and histological findings, hrHPV-16 (n=21, 41.18%) was commonest, followed by hrHPV-18 (n=3, 5.88%) and hrHPV-68 (n=1, 1.96%). Two patients had co-infection with hrHPV (16, 18) and hrHPV (16, 51) in particular. However, the rest 24 cases remained undetected. Among the hrHPV-positive cases (n=27), hrHPV-16 was detected in 5 cases while those were negative for intraepithelial lesions. In cervical swabs, 6 cases of hrHPV-16, 2 cases of hrHPV-18 and one case of co-infection hrHPV (16, 18) were histologically diagnosed as invasive SCC G-II. Among 51 cases, the most common histological diagnosis was CIN I (n=18, 35.3%). hrHPV genotyping was found to be associated with cytological findings and histological diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Patients with hematological malignancies often develop febrile neutropenia (FN) as a complication of cancer chemotherapy. Opportunistic infection, especially invasive fungal infection (IFI) is frequently encountered during the neutropenic phase. With this perspective different anti-fungal agents had been tried as prophylaxis in leukemia. Evaluation of the role of fluconazole was as antifungal prophylaxis in children with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy. This randomized double-blind placebo controlled prospective study was carried out in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bangladesh Medical University (BMU), Bangladesh from September 2016 to August 2017. Total 60 (30 were in fluconazole and 30 were in placebo group) patients of age range from 1 to 18 years were included in this study. Mean age of the patients were 7.08±3.33 years in fluconazole group 6.29±2.79 years in placebo group. Male: Female ratio was 1.14:1. Out of total 60 patients 44 were ALL and 16 AML. Mean duration of neutropenia in fluconazole and placebo group were 13.40±5.75 days and placebo 16.83±5.77 days respectively. Success rate of fluconazole prophylaxis was 25(83.3%). Failure rates of placebo were 40.0%. Duration of empirical antifungal therapy in fluconazole and placebo group differed significantly (p=0.008). Difference of neutrophil recovery achievement in two groups was also significant (p=0.015). The mean duration from AFP to EAF therapy is 17.60±1.51 days and 14.33±5.72 days in patient with fluconazole and placebo group respectively.

        "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a common myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by constitutional tyrosine kinase activation resulting from translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. For its treatment, second line tyrosine kinase inhibitors are often preferred ahead of first line tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with high-risk disease. Historically, prognostic scores - Sokal, Euro and European Treatment Outcome Study (EUTOS) scores were utilized for risk stratification. In 2016, a newer risk scoring system - European Treatment Outcome Study (EUTOS) Long Term Survival (ELTS) score was formulated. European Leukaemia Net recommended ELTS score as the preferred scoring system for CML in 2020. The study stratified CML Chronic Phase patients utilizing all four available risk scoring system. This observational study was conducted among chronic myeloid leukaemia patients at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Bangladesh from June 2020 to April 2021. Fifty CML patients in chronic phase were enrolled in this study using purposive sampling technique. Risk stratification was done using Sokal, Euro, EUTOS and ELTS scores. Among study participants, 14.0% were identified as high-risk cases using ELTS score. Previously used scores - Sokal score, Euro score and EUTOS score identified 32.0%, 8.0% and 10.0% cases as high-risk disease respectively. Sokal and Euro scores had moderate (kappa 0.403 and 0.469 respectively) agreement with ELTS score while EUTOS and ELTS scores had slight (kappa 0.073) agreement. ELTS score should be adopted as the preferred prognostic tool for CML patients.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a challenging clinical entity worldwide. Adenomatous polyps are considered precursors to cancer. Detection and confirmation of mucosal healing of ulcerative colitis require a colonoscopy. For early detection of polyps or ulcers, different screening investigations like colonoscopy, Fecal Immunochemistry Test, gFOBT, CT colonography, etc. are used. Though gold standard colonoscopy has both diagnostic and therapeutic roles, Fecal Immunochemistry Test can detect advanced adenoma or established cancer or mucosal status of Ulcerative colitis. The Fecal Immunochemistry Test is a less expensive technique for the early detection of colonic pathology and is suitable for our demographic. The aim of the study was to observe the frequency and pattern of premalignant and malignant lesions among Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) positive patients. This observational cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2019 to June 2020 among 105 Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) positive patients. The observational cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Colorectal Surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and some private hospitals, Bangladesh. FIT tests were done in ICDDR`B. Among 105 Fecal immunochemical test positive study patients, colonoscopy evaluations were done. Among these, 58 cases (55.2%) revealed different types of polyps. Pedunculated polyps 42(40.0%) were predominant, present in 42(40.0%) of patients. Other than polyps, there were ulcers 14(13.3%), malignant looking growth 3(2.9%), hemorrhoid 13(12.4%) and normal findings in 15(14.3%) cases. The age range was 40-70 years. The mean age was 51.73±7.97 years. Adenomatous polyps and malignancies were 47(44.7%) and 5(4.8%). Advanced adenomas were 11(10.4%) cases. Thirty six (62.1%) polyps were in the left colon. Patients with normal findings, diverticulosis and hemorrhoids had not undergone biopsy. Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) can predominantly detect adenomas, especially advanced adenoma and precursor lesions. The study finding showed that both non-neoplastic, neoplastic polyps and ulcers had occult bleeding. So, they became FIT positive. Though colonoscopy is the gold standard in the detection of polyps, ulcers, or malignant lesions, FIT can be a good supportive tool for screening.",

However, they may grow large and extend into surrounding structures, resulting in neurological and hormonal complications, including visual impairment. The duration of visual involvement will help predict visual outcomes after pituitary surgery and will be helpful for patient counseling. This prospective observational study was conducted in the neurosurgery department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Bangladesh. The patient who fulfilled the selection criteria which included (specific criteria) was enrolled in this study and was divided into two groups according to the Duration of visual symptoms. A total of 24 patients were selected; 12 presented with visual symptoms with less than six months duration; they were included in the first group and 12 patients with more than 6 months duration were included in the second group. Patient data were recorded in a predetermined data sheet. An ophthalmologist examined visual status. Data was processed and analyzed using SPSS version 22.0. An appropriate statistical test for data analysis (Chi-square test and student t-test) was performed. Statistical significance was at p-value <0.05 at a 95% confidence interval level. The age distribution of 24 patients ranged from 17-64 years, with a mean ±SD of age of 36.21±13.7. Males had slightly more preponderance than females in this series, with a male-to-female ratio 1.2:1. All patients presented with visual problems (100.0%). The majority (93.3%) patients presented with headache, 6 patients (25.0%) presented with acromegaly, 1 patient (4.2%) presented with hypothyroid and 3 patients (12.5%) presented with amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Regarding visual acuity symptoms less than 6 months, 58.3% were improved, and 41.7% were not improved. Visual symptoms of more than 6 months duration 25.0% out of 24 eyes improved and 18(75.0%) did not improve post-operatively; we found that visual symptoms of less than 6 months improved better postoperatively (p-value 0.001). This study reveals a significant association between the duration of preoperative visual symptoms and early postoperative visual outcomes in patients with pituitary macroadenoma surgery. Specifically, patients presenting with less than 6 months of visual symptoms showed a marked improvement compared to those with more than six months duration. These findings provide valuable insights for patient counseling and early intervention strategies.",

PCOS usually begins at puberty and manifested by hirsutism, obesity, insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, acrochordons and menstrual irregularities. Aim of the study was to assess the relation between clinical features of PCOS and different hormonal level pattern. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Endocrinology of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Bangladesh from the period of January 2018 to December 2018. Total 108 patients were included for the study. Sample was selected by purposive non randomized sampling. Data were processed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 23.0. Ethical clearance was taken from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MMC. Majority (44.4%) patients belonged to age group 21-30 years with mean age was 23.8±6.2 years. Majority (57.4%) patients were married. Majority (91.7%) patients had hirsutism followed by 40(37.0%) acne, 40(37.0%) acanthosis nigricans, 16(14.8%) weight gain, sub- fertility. In this study 03(2.8%) patients were found underweight, 40(37.0%) overweight and 11(10.2%) were obese. The mean Hirsutism, Modified Ferriman Galway score was found 10.5±2.9 with range from 4 to 20. More than three fourth (75.9%) had oligo menorrhea, 20(18.5%) amenorrhea and 6(5.6%) patients had menorrhagia. Eighty (74.1%) patients had normal thyroid and 28(25.9%) had hypothyroid.

Further, we compared the usability of the PBAS scale with that of the Cancer-related Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-14 (C-DBAS-14) among patients with cancer. The medical records of 252 patients with cancer who visited the Sleep Clinic from August 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The responses of the enrolled patients to the PBAS, C-DBAS-14, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Numeric Rating Scale of pain were collected. The internal consistency reliability of the PBAS scale was excellent (Cronbach's alpha of 0.96). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the two-factor structure of the PBAS for patients with cancer is a good fit for the model (CFI=0.99, TLI=0.99, RMSEA=0.14, SRMR=0.05). The convergent validity of the Korean version of the PBAS in patients with cancer was good, as indicated by its significant association with pain severity (r=0.63, p<0.001), C-DBAS-14 (r=0.33, p<0.001), and ISI (r=0.21, p<0.01).

This study provides a comprehensive overview of the pharmacokinetics (PKs), botanical sources, and therapeutic potentials of DZN, focusing on its mechanistic insights into cancer prevention and treatment. For the study, data were collected from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and other reputable sources. In results, DZN induces oxidative stress, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and cell cycle arrest while inhibiting proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis across various cancer cell lines, including breast, prostate, cervical, hepatocellular, and colon cancers. Its anticancer efficacy is mediated through modulation of key pathways: Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), which promotes inflammation and survival; Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT), essential for proliferation and immune evasion; and Rat Sarcoma virus/Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAS/RAF), a critical regulator of cell growth and chemoresistance. By inhibiting these pathways, DZN enhances apoptosis and chemotherapy sensitivity. Additionally, DZN's pharmacokinetic profile reveals favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, with minimal toxicity in preclinical studies. Its ability to modulate pathways and enhance chemotherapy sensitivity positions DZN as a potential therapeutic candidate. Despite promising preclinical findings, the lack of clinical validation underscores the need for well-designed human trials to confirm its efficacy and safety, paving the way for its translational application in oncology.",

        "title": "Understanding Cancer Risk Among Bangladeshi Women: An Explainable Machine Learning Approach to Socio-Reproductive Factors Using Tertiary Hospital Data.",
        "abstract": "Breast cancer poses a significant health challenge in Bangladesh, where limited screening and unique reproductive patterns contribute to delayed diagnoses and subtype-specific disparities. While reproductive risk factors such as age at menarche, parity, and contraceptive use are well studied in high-income countries, their associations with hormone-receptor-positive (HR+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain underexplored in low-resource settings. A case-control study was conducted at the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH) including 486 histopathologically confirmed breast cancer cases (246 HR+, 240 TNBC) and 443 cancer-free controls. Socio-demographic and reproductive data were collected through structured interviews. Machine learning models-including Logistic Regression, Lasso, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost-were trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, F1-score, and Area Under Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC). To interpret model predictions and quantify the contribution of individual features, we employed Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. XGBoost achieved the highest overall performance (F1-score = 0.750), and SHAP-based interpretability revealed key predictors for each subtype. Rural residence, low education (≤5 years), and undernutrition were significant predictors across subtypes. Cesarean delivery and multiple abortions were more predictive of TNBC, while urban residence, employment, and higher education were more predictive of HR+. Age at menarche and age at first childbirth showed decreasing predictive importance with increasing age for HR+, while larger gaps between marriage and childbirth were more predictive of TNBC. Our findings underscore the value of machine learning coupled with SHAP-based explainability in identifying context-specific risk factors for breast cancer subtypes in resource-limited settings. This approach enhances transparency and supports the development of targeted public health interventions to reduce breast cancer disparities in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is essential for reducing mortality rates and improving clinical outcomes. However, deep learning (DL) models used in healthcare face significant challenges, including concerns about data privacy, domain-specific overfitting, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose BreastSwinFedNetX, a federated learning (FL)-enabled ensemble system that combines four hierarchical variants of the Swin Transformer (Tiny, Small, Base, and Large) with a Random Forest (RF) meta-learner. By utilizing FL, our approach ensures collaborative model training across decentralized and institution-specific datasets while preserving data locality and preventing raw patient data exposure. The model exhibits strong generalization and performs exceptionally well across five benchmark datasets-BreakHis, BUSI, INbreast, CBIS-DDSM, and a Combined dataset-achieving an F1 score of 99.34% on BreakHis, a PR AUC of 98.89% on INbreast, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 99.61% on the Combined dataset. To enhance transparency and clinical adoption, we incorporate explainable AI (XAI) through Grad-CAM, which highlights class-discriminative features. Additionally, we deploy the model in a real-time web application that supports uncertainty-aware predictions and clinician interaction and ensures compliance with GDPR and HIPAA through secure federated deployment. Extensive ablation studies and paired statistical analyses further confirm the significance and robustness of each architectural component. By integrating transformer-based architectures, secure collaborative training, and explainable outputs, BreastSwinFedNetX provides a scalable and trustworthy AI solution for real-world breast cancer diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequent and the fifth greatest cause of death in men. Although there are already therapies for early-stage PCa, their effectiveness in advanced PCa is limited, primarily because of medication resistance or poor efficacy. To find new therapeutic indications or repurpose current medications, this project intends to use computational approaches to investigate possible anti-PCa compounds based on simulated screening of FDA-approved drug bank databases. The techniques used in this study include virtual screening of the drug bank database utilising a matrix or user molecule (Diffractaic acid; DA), integrated network pharmacology, molecular docking, detailed molecular dynamic simulation. The results showed that 18 DA analogues in total were chosen from the drug bank database and put through integrated network pharmacology. The KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that hsa05215: Prostate cancer is one of the most significant PCa enrichment signalling pathways which exhibited 18 protein-protein interactions including PDGFRB, PDGFRA, PPARG, GSK3B, MAP2K1, CREBBP, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, CHUK, PIK3CD, BRAF, PIK3CB, MTOR, AR, PIK3CA, PLAU, CDK2, and MAPK1. Subsequent molecular docking study with the best target protein (PPARγ) showed that the DB14929 molecule formed hydrogen bonds with the Gln273, Arg280, Arg288, and Ser342 residues and exhibited a high binding affinity ( - 10.5 kcal/mol) for the PPARγ agonist against PCa. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulation showed that DB14929 formed a stable protein-ligand complex with RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA values. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour of the PPARγ protein linked to DB14929 in its conformational space was analysed using the PCA technique, demonstrating the excellent conformational space behaviour. Additionally, the free binding energy value of - 57.15 kcal/mol of DB14929 indicated that it could be an agonist of PPARγ of PCa.

        "abstract": "Home to a quarter of the global population, the World Health Organization's South-East Asia Region bears a substantial burden of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Identifying means to eliminate NTDs in these regions has been a flagship priority since 2014, with India, Nepal, and Bangladesh committed to eliminating Kala-azar or Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) sooner or by the end of 2026 (WHO, 2023a). In this context, vanillin-derived molecules are well established in inhibiting several kinases present in cancer cells and have high LD<sub>50</sub> values along with broad therapeutic window. In view of the demand of suitable oral candidate for controlling Leishmania parasitic proliferation in human body here, we are reporting ortho vanillin and l-Alanine amino acid derived ligand molecule t2-{(E)-[(2-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methylidene] amino} propanoate (L) and its Cu(II) conjugates L<sub>1</sub> & L<sub>3</sub> as water-soluble, and nontoxic drug candidates for the treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis. In silico binding study against potential chemotherapeutic target MAP kinase (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, (PDB id: 4QNY) was undertaken and significant binding was shown by these molecules. Both compounds demonstrated significant inhibition of amastigote proliferation. For L. donovani, L<sub>1</sub> exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.544 μgml<sup>-1</sup> and L<sub>3</sub> an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.691 μgml<sup>-1</sup>. Against L. mexicana, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 1.750 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L<sub>1</sub> and 1.748 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L<sub>3</sub>. These results were comparable to the standard reference drug Amphotericin B, which exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.450 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L. donovani and 1.532 μgml<sup>-1</sup> for L. mexicana. The toxicity studies were undertaken against macrophages THP-1 cell lines where the IC<sub>50</sub> value is quite higher in comparison to Amphotericin-B. Additionally, the potential of molecules was checked against PANC-1 cancer cell lines in comparison to normal HPNE cell lines. Both complexes caused double-strand DNA nicks, consistent with the higher cytotoxic activities observed in Cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the cell cycle results also confirmed that L<sub>1</sub> arrested (PANC-1) cells in the G1-S phase of the cell cycle followed by an increase in the sub-G1 phase. L<sub>1</sub>, has shown that the population of late/secondary cellular apoptotic cells increased from 2.35 % to 93.56 %, whereas the population of early/primary apoptotic cells increased from 0.13 % (control) to 12.08 %.

        "abstract": "Environmental radioactivity is significantly elevated by coal combustion, posing risks to communities living near coal-fired thermal power plants (CFTPPs). This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of radiological impacts around the Rampal Thermal Power Plant, a 1320 MW facility located in Rampal Upazila, near the UNESCO World Heritage site of Sundarbans, Bangladesh. Thirty soil samples were systematically collected from distances of 100, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 m from the power plant. The activity concentrations of <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th, and <sup>40</sup>K in soil ranged from 17-31, 29-51, and 350-670 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with a few samples exceeding the population-weighted global averages for <sup>226</sup>Ra (32 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>) and <sup>232</sup>Th (45 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>), and almost all the samples exceeding the average for <sup>40</sup>K (420 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>). The elevated levels of <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th, and <sup>40</sup>K in the soil samples can be attributed to several interconnected factors, including the presence of thorium-rich minerals such as monazite and zircon, granitic geological formations, and anthropogenic inputs like bottom ash discharge from the plant and coal combustion byproducts. While the radium equivalent activity and hazard indices generally fell within safety limits, the higher outdoor and indoor absorbed dose rates, effective doses, and increased lifetime cancer risk raised alarms about potential health threats for nearby residents over time. Moreover, the long-term radiological effects on the Sundarbans ecosystem could disturb its fragile balance, impacting both biodiversity and the local communities that rely on its resources. These results highlight the necessity for further evaluations and remediation efforts to ensure the safe use of these soils in agricultural and construction activities. This research also seeks to develop a radiological distribution map, which will provide crucial baseline data for the forthcoming Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant.",

Although there is no definitive cure, various treatment options exist to alleviate its symptoms. Among these, Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is widely regarded as a primary approach. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of CDT for breast cancer patients with upper limb lymphedema and aims to assess the benefits of this treatment despite the challenges and constraints in resource-limited settings. This observational study was conducted among 42 female breast cancer patients with unilateral upper limb lymphedema attending the Lymphedema Clinic of the Department of Palliative Medicine at Bangladesh Medical University in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Limb volume, skin condition, and clinical signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline. All patients received the intensive phase of Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) for 6 weeks, with follow-up assessments conducted at the 3rd week and the 6th week. A significant reduction in the volume of the affected limbs was observed from baseline to the 6th week, as well as from the 3rd week to the 6th week. Although no statistically significant improvement in skin edema was recorded during this period, visible clinical improvement in skin texture was noted. After receiving CDT and proper skin care, 59.5% of patients regained normal skin on the affected limb. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in self-reported symptoms such as tightness, heaviness, and pain in the affected limb from baseline to the 6th week. Lymphedema management using all components of Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) was found to be effective in reducing limb volume and alleviating the distressing symptoms of patients. Timely referral of lymphedema patients to specialized clinics and initiation of CDT can significantly reduce their ongoing suffering in Bangladesh.",

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed 20 central genes associated with key cancer pathways. Pathway enrichment analysis through KEGG highlighted the involvement of these genes in various cancer-related pathways.

However, in this work, the bark extract of <i>C. religiosa</i> was studied systematically to investigate its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antiproliferative activities, focusing on potential applications in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancer. <b>Study Design and Methods:</b> The dried coarse powder of <i>C. religiosa</i> bark was cold-extracted in methanol and evaporated to dryness. It was then successively fractionated into petroleum ether (PEF), dichloromethane (DMF), and ethyl acetate (EEF) fractions. The Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and AlCl<sub>3</sub> approaches were utilized to evaluate the total phenol and flavonoid contents, respectively, and the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and phosphomolybdenum assays were employed to determine the antioxidant activity of each fraction. The DMF was tested against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by employing the Ellman method, while all fractions were tested for antiproliferative activity against HepG2 and A549 cell lines by MTT assay. <b>Results:</b> The DMF displayed the highest phenolic content (124.8 ± 17.5 mg gallic acid equivalent/g of dry extract) and flavonoid content (211.1 ± 4.8 mg quercetin equivalent/g of dry extract). In the phosphomolybdenum assay, its antioxidant IC50 value was 25 ± 1 µg/mL. Additionally, the DMF fraction exhibited significant inhibition activity against AChE and BChE, with IC50 values of 455 ± 1 and 450 ± 1 μg/mL, respectively. In terms of anti-proliferative activity, the DMF exhibited an IC50 value of 29.2 µM against the HepG2 cell line, while the EAF showed IC50 values of 24.7 µM in the A549 cell line. <b>Conclusion:</b> The potent activity of <i>C. religiosa</i> as an antioxidant, along with its significant inhibition of AChE and BChE, positions it as a promising candidate for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using STRING, and hub genes were identified via three ranking algorithms (degree, MNC and closeness centrality). Feature selection methods (Pearson correlation, recursive feature elimination) were applied to extract key gene subsets. Machine learning models (SVM, NB and RF) were trained on GSE100363 and validated on GSE139682 to assess predictive performance. Biomarkers were further validated using the GEPIA database. A total of 146 DEGs were identified, including 39 upregulated and 107 downregulated genes. Eleven hub genes were identified, with SLIT3, COL7A1 and CLDN4 strongly correlated with GBC. Machine learning results confirmed their diagnostic potential. The study highlights NTRK2, COL14A1, SCN4B, ATP1A2, SLC17A7, SLIT3, COL7A1, CLDN4, CLEC3B, ADCYAP1R1 and MFAP4 as crucial genes associated with GBC.

        "abstract": "Pinostrobin (PIN), a natural flavonoid found in Boesenbergia rotunda, Alpinia zerumbet, and other botanicals, has shown promising anticancer potential due to its multitargeted mechanisms and favorable safety profile. This review consolidates current evidence on PIN's anticancer properties, focusing on its molecular mechanisms, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and therapeutic potential. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar to identify preclinical studies on PIN's bioactivity, PK, and toxicity. PIN exerts potent anticancer effects by inducing ROS-mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest via p21 upregulation and cyclin D1 suppression, and reducing proliferation and inducing cytotoxicity. It also inhibits metastasis by targeting migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis. PK data reveal good intestinal absorption and metabolic transformation primarily, although limited solubility and brain penetration remain challenges. Toxicity studies show no adverse effects at therapeutic doses (≤ 100 mg/kg), with selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells and protective antioxidant effects in normal tissues. Beyond oncology, PIN also exhibits several pharmacological properties. PIN's ability to target key cancer pathways, along with its low toxicity and broad pharmacological potential, makes it a strong candidate for adjuvant therapy. The novelty of this study is its integrated analysis of PIN's anticancer mechanisms, PK, and safety, along with proposed strategies to bridge the gap toward clinical application. Clinical trials remain essential to confirm its efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain among the most challenging malignancies to treat due to therapy complexity, adverse events, and dose-limiting toxicities, which often result in treatment failure. NSCLC, in particular, has a high mortality rate attributed to late-stage diagnosis and therapeutic resistance. Anoctamin 1 (ANO1), a calcium-activated chloride channel, has been implicated in cancer progression and is an emerging therapeutic target. In this study, we identified vitexicarpin, a flavonoid isolated from Vitex trifolia, as a novel ANO1 inhibitor with anticancer potential. Vitexicarpin inhibited ANO1 channel function, reduced ANO1 protein levels, decreased cancer cell viability, and induced apoptosis in CRC and NSCLC cell lines. Importantly, vitexicarpin exhibited minimal hepatotoxicity and negligible hERG channel inhibition, supporting its safety profile. Collectively, our findings suggest that vitexicarpin is a promising candidate for the treatment of CRC and NSCLC through selective inhibition of ANO1.",

        "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85-90% of global lung cancer cases and causes over 1.7 million deaths annually worldwide. Despite therapeutic advancements, existing treatments remain expensive and are often associated with significant side effects, underscoring the need for alternative drug candidates. Natural compounds offer promising prospects as safer and more affordable therapeutic options for NSCLC. Toxicodendron succedaneum, a medicinally important plant species from the family Anacardiaceae, contains a diverse phytoconstituents with potential anticancer activity. Investigating these bioactive compounds may uncover therapeutic potential to facilitate NSCLC drug discovery. In this study, a comprehensive structure-based drug design approach was employed to identify drug candidates targeting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) receptor. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ADMET analysis, MM/GBSA calculations, and DFT assessments, two lead compounds: rhusflavone ( - 10.9 kcal/mol) and hinokiflavone ( - 9.9 kcal/mol), were identified, both revealing favorable drug-likeness and toxicity profiles. MD simulation spanning 500 ns timescale confirmed the structural stability of the identified leads, further corroborated by principal component analysis (PCA) and Gibbs free energy landscape (FEL) evaluations. Rhusflavone emerged as the most promising candidate, with a free binding energy of - 57.15 ± 5.28 kcal/mol. DFT analysis revealed enhanced molecular reactivity of the lead compounds upon transitioning from the free to the bound states. These results could contribute to the development of novel lung anticancer drugs, warranting further in vitro and in vivo validation.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), a commonly diagnosed malignancy, is one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To effectively lower the death rate from this disease, it is essential to create public health methods, including developing new biomarkers that facilitate screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response prediction. CRC-derived Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle that transport functional molecules like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and noncoding RNA), and other metabolites, which act as molecular cargos to facilitate transportation. Exosomes generated and secreted from cancer cells are key biomarkers for early, noninvasive cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response, with their biogenesis in CRC offering molecular insights. Their expression varies across time, tissues, and disease stages. Thus, the development of innovative and effective techniques for isolating and detecting exosomes holds great potential for tumor diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and developing techniques (MSC-derived exosome, DC-derived exosome, engineered exosome, etc.) and their contents to improve the specificity and efficacy of therapies for patients with CRC. This review explores the features and formation of CRC-derived exosomes, highlighting their diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance through a comprehensive analysis of exosome extraction, identification, purification, and documented biological roles in existing literature.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is Asia's most prevalent cancer, accounting for the highest global patient share. A significant number of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Asia exhibit mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although clinical outcomes are improving with newer therapies, challenges persist in the effective management of EGFR mutant (EGFRm) NSCLC. Given the substantial disease burden, understanding the current diagnostic and treatment patterns for EGFRm NSCLC from an Asian perspective is essential. This expert opinion presents recommendations from Asian experts on molecular testing and treatment of first-line and second-line EGFRm NSCLC. The recommendations aim to optimize patient outcomes by providing a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management, considering the high prevalence of EGFR mutations in the Asian population. The experts discussed and recommended approaches for optimal management of EGFRm NSCLC. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing is recommended to be included in the reimbursement scheme, and the turnaround time of testing should be shortened, considering the high burden of the disease in Asia. The panel recommended careful selection of patients for osimertinib+chemotherapy or lazertinib+amivantamab based on safety and efficacy profile, patient age, and disease status. While the panel agreed that osimertinib+chemotherapy is acceptable for these patients, dose adjustment and careful patient selection are recommended to optimize safety outcomes. For lazertinib+amivantamab, measures to mitigate adverse events such as the use of pre-medication with steroids, prophylactic anticoagulants, and dose modification are recommended. For patients progressing on one of the combination regimens, experts recommended repeat NGS testing and continued treatment with chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Nanotechnology has been advancing drug delivery systems (DDSs) for decades. Nanoparticle DDSs, in which nanometric carriers deliver drugs to the target site, are highly valued for cancer treatment. In this study, based on nanoemulsion technology, gel-in-water (G/W) nanoemulsion was developed by using an organogel, i.e. 12-hydroxystearic acid and castor oil, followed by encapsulation of the model anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) within the nanogel droplets. The G/W was prepared using ultrasound and stabilized with a nonionic surfactant. The enhanced permeability and retention of G/W were investigated by encapsulating coumarin-6 and comparing it with an oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion. Temporal changes in tissue distribution of both nanoemulsions were used to assess the effect of gelation on drug distribution. Regardless of the tissue type, the extraction efficiency of G/W was lower compared to O/W. The fluorescence intensity of coumarin-6 in G/W was higher compared to O/W. The size of G/W nanoparticles affects lung distribution and blood retention. PTX-loaded G/W (PTX-G/W) nanoparticles effectively treated colon cancer <i>in vivo</i>.

        "abstract": "Cyanidin and its glucosides are anthocyanins belonging to the class of flavonoid phytochemicals. These pigments give fruits and vegetables their typical reddish-purple nuance, and their peculiar chemical features result in a remarkable ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species and other mutagens. Thus, both cyanidin and its glycosides were proposed as candidates for chemoprevention, as anticancer agents, and as adjuvant therapies. Indeed, the compounds were investigated through various <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of colon, breast, kidney, prostate and liver cancer, and glioma. Cyanidin and its derivatives have been found to inhibit key signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-<i>κ</i>B, which can reduce cancer cell growth, induce apoptosis, and suppress metastasis. In the first part of the review, the chemical properties of cyanidin and its glycoside analogues will be discussed. Then, an overview of <i>in vitro</i> evidence on activity will be presented, followed by a report on preclinical and clinical data together with comments on the mechanisms involved. Eventually, the aspect of pharmacokinetic properties, bioavailability, and formulation will be dissected. Overall, the review indicates that cyanidin and its derivatives could be effective anticancer agents but also calls for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their bioactivity. Despite promising results, resolving issues like stability, absorption, and targeted distribution is crucial to maximize their therapeutic potential. More research is needed to develop innovative cyanidin-based formulations for efficient cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care aims to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with life-limiting illnesses through effective pain management with opioids. Despite its global importance, opioid use in palliative care faces significant challenges, particularly in resource-poor settings like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, opioid use is notably low, with disparities between urban and rural areas. Cultural stigmas, strict regulations, and inadequate healthcare provider training further obstruct effective pain management. This study aims to explore the challenges healthcare providers face regarding opioid use in both hospital and home-based palliative care settings. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using face-to-face semistructured interviews with 135 licensed healthcare providers from August to September 2022. The respondents, predominantly young (57% aged 20-39) and female (68.9%), primarily manage late-stage cancer patients (98.5%), with pain (100%) being the primary symptom treated. Morphine syrup is commonly used (68.1%), whereas oxycodone and buprenorphine are unavailable. Side effects such as deep sedation (43.7%) and addiction (34.1%) highlight the need for careful monitoring. Limited awareness (10.4%) of national opioid policies results in inconsistent practices (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Prescribing restrictions (60.7%) and dispensing rights issues contribute to operational challenges, affecting patient access to pain management. Misconceptions about palliative care (32.6%) and inter-departmental non-cooperation (38.5%) hinder patient referrals (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and continuity of care. Inconsistent awareness of opioid policies causes varied practices and attitudes. Addressing referral challenges and prescribing restrictions requires interdisciplinary solutions, enhanced education, better policy dissemination, and standardized guidelines for effective palliative care opioid management.",

        "title": "Awareness about cervical cancer and its socio-economic determinants among adults in Bangladesh: Results from a nationwide cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health issue now and is the second leading cancer among women in Bangladesh, caused primarily by Human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite effective vaccination and screening methods, awareness and access to preventive methods are limited in developing regions. This nationwide study aims to explore socio-economic and cultural factors affecting cervical cancer awareness in Bangladesh and generate evidence-based recommendations for tailoring suitable health promotion strategies for the country. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to evaluate cervical cancer awareness among adults aged 18 years and above. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed for this research, keeping in mind the local sociocultural contexts. Face-to-face interviews were conducted after getting the participants' consent and making sure they understood all the questions. After checking for data quality and consistency, responses of 2,151 participants were finally retained. The collected data was analyzed using STATA (Version 17) statistical software. The majority (80.15%) of the participants were aware of cervical cancer, with healthcare workers being the primary source of information. Higher awareness rates were noted among married individuals (80.88%), urban dwellers (83.24%), those with more education (average 11.96 ± 4.36 years), individuals with higher income (88.17%), and those belonging to nuclear families (82.86%). Healthcare professionals had significantly greater awareness (98.91%) compared to other occupations. Participants undergoing regular health checkups were more informed and the association was statistically significant (87.03%, p < 0.001). Univariate and multiple logistic regression models revealed that each additional year of education increased the probability of being aware by 16-20%. Men had significantly lower odds of being aware compared to women (Adjusted Odds Ratio AOR = 0.41, β = -0.895, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.70, p = 0.001 in the multiple logistic regression analysis). Similarly, respondents not cohabitating with their spouse were less aware than those who were living with partners (AOR = 0.47, β = -0.750, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.81, p = 0.006). Income levels conversely influenced awareness level, participants from the highest income group (earning 35,001-50,000 BDT) had 47% lower odds (AOR = 0.53, β = -0.629, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.80, p = 0.002) of awareness compared to the lowest income group (earning ≤20,000 BDT). Despite the widespread awareness of cervical cancer among most Bangladeshi adults, there remains a notable gap, particularly among certain demographics. Since the study identified healthcare workers, social media, and mass media as major sources of information, targeted educational campaigns through media channels and outreach activities by healthcare workers might effectively enhance nationwide awareness of cervical cancer.",
