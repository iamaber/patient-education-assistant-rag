        "abstract": "Donor human milk is recommended for the nutritionally vulnerable preterm infant; however, there is conflicting or limited information on how the pasteurization techniques used on donor milk influence its nutritional and immune properties. Additionally, prior pasteurization studies were often not reflective of the volume and equipment used in milk bank settings, limiting their generalizability. Evaluate the impact of Holder pasteurization-performed in a milk bank setting and using standardized preanalytical handling techniques-on the energy, macronutrients, human milk oligosaccharides, vitamins, minerals, and antimicrobial protein content of human milk. Fifty matched pairs of raw and Holder-pasteurized milk samples that were collected and pasteurized in a milk bank setting provided the sampling frame. Each pair was from a unique, approved milk bank donor to the Mothers' Milk Bank of North Texas. A total of 29 nutrients and bioactive factors were assessed using a variety of analytical methods. There was evidence of minimal losses (<15%) in copper, calcium, thiamine, and nonprotein nitrogen, moderate losses in immunoglobin A concentrations (35%), and extensive losses in lactoferrin (>80%). Holder pasteurization has minimal to no impact on energy and essential nutrients in donor milk, including macronutrients, human milk oligosaccharides, B vitamins, and minerals. Moderate to extensive loss of antimicrobial proteins warrants research into alternative preservation techniques.",

        "abstract": "This study analyzes the media coverage of HPV vaccines in Taiwan from 2005 to 2018, with a focus on adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) media guidelines and the influence of election cycles on reporting patterns. A content analysis of 911 articles from four major newspapers revealed peaks in 2008, 2014, and 2018 election years, coinciding with vaccines policy rollouts. Most articles (78 percent) appeared in national news sections, with medical professionals cited in 36.3 percent of cases. Coverage primarily emphasized vaccine policy (36.3 percent) and health education (36.4 percent), with 83 percent of articles portraying HPV vaccination positively and 88 percent explicitly endorsing it. However, only 42 percent adhered to WHO's media communication guidelines, and headlines often misaligned with article content. These findings highlight the media's advocacy role during key political and public health events, while underscoring the need for improved journalistic practices to ensure accurate, guideline-consistent vaccine communication.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) is a serious health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries, primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly genotypes 16 and 18. Other risk factors include smoking, early sexual activity, and long-term oral contraceptive use. Early detection through cervical cytology and HPV testing is vital for effective prevention. This study aimed to analyze the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in HPV-positive women at a Tehran teaching hospital, focusing on HPV genotypes and their association with CIN. We conducted a cross-sectional study of HPV-positive women who underwent Pap smear testing, HPV genotyping via real-time PCR, and colposcopy with biopsies of suspected lesions. Risk factors like smoking and alcohol consumption were evaluated, and statistical analyses were performed, including ordinal logistic regression. Among participants, 52.4% had abnormal CIN: CIN I (31.1%), CIN II (11.4%), and CIN III (10.0%). HPV-16 was the most prevalent genotype (43.7%), significantly associated with severe CIN outcomes (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88, 95% CI), followed by HPV-18 (OR = 1.87, 95% CI). Smoking increased the risk of severe CIN (OR = 1.53, 95% CI), while older age and later age at sexual debut correlated with better CIN outcomes. HPV-16 and smoking are major predictors of severe CIN, highlighting the need for targeted interventions such as HPV vaccination and smoking cessation, along with regular screenings to lower cervical cancer risks. Additional research is required to evaluate the persistence of different HPV genotypes and their progression to CIN and cervical cancer.\"",

        "abstract": "International guidelines recommend the administration of two doses of pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccination for people with chronic liver disease to prevent severe complications. We aimed to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage and mortality in adults with chronic liver disease in England. We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected medical record data from the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel network. We included people aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with chronic liver disease between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2022. The primary outcome of interest was hepatitis A vaccination. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage was calculated using the number of vaccinated people with chronic liver disease as the numerator and the chronic liver disease population in the RSC dataset as the denominator. We compared individual characteristics by vaccination status using descriptive statistics. We used a multistate survival model to estimate the transition probabilities between four states: (1) diagnosis of chronic liver disease; (2) first hepatitis A vaccination; (3) second hepatitis A vaccination; and (4) death. 664 571 individuals aged 18 years or older with chronic liver disease were identified from the RSC sentinel network population, of whom 625 079 individuals were included in our analysis. Of 625 079 individuals with chronic liver disease, 13 875 (2·2%) had received a first hepatitis A vaccination, 3007 (0·4%) had received a second dose, 732 (5·3%) of 13 875 vaccinated individuals died, and 101 065 (16·5%) of 611 204 individuals without vaccination died during the study period. Adjusting for death as a competing risk, vaccination was more likely among younger age quintiles (hazard ratio 5·46 [95% CI 5·13-5·81]), non-smokers (1·59 [1·54-1·65]), residents of urban areas (1·28 [1·21-1·35]), individuals with higher socioeconomic status (1·06 [1·03-1·10]), and individuals with a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; 1·71 [1·64-1·78]). Individuals with a history of harmful alcohol use (0·36 [0·32-0·39]), type 1 diabetes (0·46 [0·36-0·57]), chronic kidney disease (0·63 [0·57-0·70]), or mental disorders (0·66 [0·64-0·69]) were less likely to be vaccinated. The lowest risk of mortality was in people with chronic liver disease of infectious or autoimmune aetiology and in people with MASLD. Hepatitis A vaccine uptake among people with chronic liver disease in England is low, with disparities by age, location (urban vs rural), and socioeconomic status. Steps should be taken to reduce the inequalities in vaccine administration. GlaxoSmithKline's Investigator Sponsored Studies Program.",

        "title": "Circulating Antibody's Role During Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, and Beyond for Rabies: A Review.",
        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Since the introduction of Pasteur's rabies vaccine in 1885, rabies prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) have been widely administered globally under the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, 124 documented cases of PEP failure had been reported worldwide between 1980 and 2023. Additionally, sporadic media reports from China showed occasional PEP failures between 2017 and 2024. Rabies remains a serious public health problem in over 150 countries and regions. <b>Methods:</b> In this review, we summarize PEP procedures recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the WHO. We also analyze potential contributing factors to PEP failure, propose a concept of circulating antibodies, and discuss their roles in PEP. Furthermore, we summarize key guidelines for clinical trial design from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and China's Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), as well as the latest developments in monoclonal antibody (cocktail) therapies. <b>Results:</b> Adherence to core PEP practices, such as wound cleansing, infiltration of wounds with immunoglobulin (mAbs), and administration of vaccines, and broader societal involvement are crucial for preventing rabies infection in most cases. For high-risk exposures or immunocompromised individuals, the provision of circulating antibodies through high-dose human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) or mAbs is of utmost importance for preventing PEP failure. <b>Conclusions:</b> Early, high-concentration circulating antibodies are important for preventing PEP failure. Addressing the global issue of rabies requires involvement of the entire society. Only through collective efforts can we tackle this neglected disease and achieve WHO's goal of \"zero by 30\".",

        "abstract": "Yellow fever (YF) is an acute hemorrhagic zoonotic disease that causes severe liver damage, renal failure, and hemorrhagic shock. No antiviral treatment is available; thus, vaccination is a critical preventive measure. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) revised the guidelines regarding the need for booster vaccination for YF with the rationale that a single vaccination provides sufficient long-term immunogenicity, no studies have evaluated long-term immunity in Japanese adults who received a single dose of YF vaccine. This study evaluated the long-term persistence of immunogenicity in Japanese adults vaccinated with the YF vaccine. This observational study enrolled Japanese adults who received a single YF vaccination >5 years previously. Blood samples were collected after confirming eligibility for the study. The serum levels of anti-yellow fever virus (YFV)-neutralizing antibodies were measured using the 50% plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>). The 65 participants comprised 35 males and 30 females, with a median age at vaccination of 34 years. The time between YF vaccination and registration was between 5 and 26 years. All participants remained seropositive even after a long time. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the time elapsed since YF vaccination and PRNT<sub>50</sub>. Our results indicate that a single dose of YF vaccine provides adequate long-term immunity in Japanese adults and that booster vaccinations are not routinely required. These findings strongly aid in the development of travel medicine guidelines and the optimization of vaccination strategies by reducing the usage of medical resources and simplifying the health requirements for travelers.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The Hippo pathway, via Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue regeneration. Aberrant YAP1 activation is linked to tumor progression and immune evasion in various cancers, including breast carcinoma, despite conflicting evidence on its prognostic value. Preclinical studies have explored drugs targeting YAP1-TEAD interactions, but therapeutic application is limited. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: This study included 50 patients with locally advanced breast cancer, who were assessed by a multidisciplinary tumor board and underwent neoadjuvant treatment per tumor subtype and clinical guidelines. Eligibility required both pre-treatment core biopsy and post-treatment surgical resection samples. Due to the absence of residual tumor in some patients achieving complete pathological response, post-treatment tissue was available and analyzable in 30 patients. YAP1 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining patterns. ROC analysis identified a cutoff for YAP1 expression, defining tumors with ≥70% nuclear and ≥80% cytoplasmic staining. <i>Results</i>: YAP1 expression had a significant relationship with tumor subtype (<i>p</i> = 0.001), being most frequent in HER-2-positive tumors (55.6%) and least frequent in luminal tumors (11.1%). YAP1 positivity significantly predicted axillary pathological complete response (pCR) (<i>p</i> = 0.01). In YAP1-positive patients, 77.8% achieved axillary pCR compared to 31.7% in YAP1-negative patients, though the YAP1 status and breast pCR association were insignificant (<i>p</i> = 0.07). The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that higher Ki-67 values were significantly associated with positive YAP1 expression (<i>p</i> = 0.028). In contrast, there was no association between ER, PR status, age, and tumor size. Following treatment, there was a statistically significant change in YAP1 expression, with nuclear staining decreasing (<i>p</i> = 0.004) while cytoplasmic staining increased (<i>p</i> = 0.002). YAP1 was significantly linked to axillary pCR, HER-2 status, and Ki-67. <i>Conclusions</i>: Post treatment, nuclear YAP1 decreased, whereas cytoplasmic expression increased, showing a localization shift. These results suggest that YAP1 may predict treatment response and become a future therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "Rectal cancer management necessitates a rigorous multidisciplinary strategy, emphasizing precise staging and detailed risk stratification to inform optimal therapeutic decision-making. Obtaining an accurate histological diagnosis before initiating treatment is essential. Comprehensive staging integrates clinical evaluation, thorough medical history analysis, assessment of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and thorax. High-resolution pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing dedicated rectal protocols, is critical for identifying recurrence risks and delineating precise anatomical relationships. Endoscopic ultrasound further refines staging accuracy by determining the tumor infiltration depth in early-stage cancers, while preoperative colonoscopy effectively identifies synchronous colorectal lesions. In early-stage rectal cancers (T1-T2, N0, and M0), radical surgical resection remains the standard of care, although transanal local excision can be selectively indicated for certain T1N0 tumors. In contrast, locally advanced rectal cancers (T3, T4, and N+) characterized by microsatellite stability or proficient mismatch repair are optimally managed with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which combines chemoradiotherapy with oxaliplatin-based systemic chemotherapy. Additionally, tumors exhibiting high microsatellite instability or mismatch repair deficiency respond favorably to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The evaluation of tumor response following neoadjuvant therapy, utilizing MRI and endoscopic assessments, facilitates individualized treatment planning, including non-operative approaches for patients with confirmed complete clinical responses who comply with rigorous follow-up. Recent advancements in molecular characterization, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy highlight a significant evolution towards personalized medicine. The effective integration of these innovations requires enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration to improve patient prognosis and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Despite widespread vaccination, pertussis remains a significant health concern, especially for infants and young children. Severe pertussis can lead to severe complications, but the specific risk factors, particularly immunological markers, are not fully understood. This retrospective case analysis was conducted from January to December 2023 at the Department of Infection, Tianjin Second People's Hospital. Data were collected from 249 children with pertussis (209 common and 40 severe cases) who met the inclusion criteria. Clinical and immunological parameters were compared between severe and common pertussis groups. Lasso regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify independent risk factors, and a nomogram prediction model was constructed and validated. Key findings included demographic and clinical differences between severe and common pertussis, such as higher rates of pneumonia, longer hospital stays, and delayed vaccination in the severe group. Immunological differences showed that children with severe pertussis had altered levels of humoral and cellular immune markers. Risk factors for severe pertussis included premature birth, incomplete vaccination, high white blood cell count, and altered lymphocyte profiles. The nomogram prediction model showed excellent performance with a C-index of 0.899 and strong discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.899). Decision curve analysis demonstrated substantial clinical utility. This study highlights the clinical and immunological markers that contribute to severe pertussis in children. The nomogram prediction model developed provides a reliable tool for early identification of high-risk children, improving clinical decision-making and potential outcomes for pertussis management.",

        "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is a commonly used treatment modality for cancer with a growing list of oncologic indications. Ototoxicity is a potential immune-related adverse event of ICB treatment, but the risk of hearing loss after ICB remains unknown. This retrospective chart review sought to identify individuals who received ICB and had available audiometric data before and after treatment in order to identify clinically meaningful changes in hearing. This single center, institutional chart review examined hearing function data in patients who underwent audiometry before and after ICB treatment. Measures included pure tone thresholds, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), tympanometry, and word recognition scores. Ototoxicity was assessed using the American Speech-Language-Hearing-Association (ASHA) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv5.0) guidelines where applicable. We identified twelve individuals with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) who received neoadjuvant ICB on a clinical trial. Eleven of twelve (92%) patients (8 male, 4 female, age 41-79 years) did not meet criteria for hearing threshold changes. One patient demonstrated a 10 dB shift at two consecutive frequencies in one ear, meeting the minimum ASHA criteria for significant change. Speech audiometry and tympanometry identified no differences in speech understanding or middle ear function pre-and post-treatment. Variations in DPOAE amplitudes were noted, potentially indicating early outer hair cell damage despite stable audiometric thresholds. In this small data set of newly diagnosed advanced-stage HNSCC, there appears to be a low incidence of significant hearing changes following neoadjuvant ICB treatment. Larger, prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed to evaluate late-onset ototoxicity. Cancer survivors treated with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade for advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) appear to have a low risk of acute hearing loss based on this study. While significant changes in hearing thresholds were not observed, subtle alterations in cochlear outer hair cell function were detected, suggesting the importance of long-term monitoring to capture potential delayed effects on hearing. This insight helps reassure patients about the immediate ototoxic risks while highlighting the need for continued vigilance in hearing assessment during follow-up.",

        "abstract": "A panel of clinicians, subject-matter experts, and guideline methodologists convened by the Alzheimer's Association conducted a systematic review and formulated evidence-based recommendations for using blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD) within specialized care settings. The scope focuses on individuals with objective cognitive impairment, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, who are undergoing evaluation by providers trained and experienced in memory disorders, where AD is the suspected underlying etiology. The panel conducted a systematic review to assess the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs in detecting AD pathology. The BBMs of interest included plasma phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) tests measuring the following analytes: p-tau217, ratio of p-tau217 to non-p-tau217 ×100 (%p-tau17), p-tau181, p-tau231, and ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40. The reference standard tests included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), or neuropathology. The panel applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and the GRADE evidence-to-decision (EtD) Framework to develop its recommendations. The key recommendations in this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) are: (1) BBM tests with ≥90% sensitivity and ≥75% specificity can be used as a triaging test and (2) BBM tests with ≥90% sensitivity and specificity can serve as a substitute for amyloid PET imaging or CSF AD biomarker testing in patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care for memory disorders. The panel cautions users of this guideline that there is significant variability in diagnostic test accuracy and many commercially available BBM tests do not meet these thresholds, especially using a single cutoff. Additionally, these tests do not serve as a substitute for comprehensive clinical evaluation by a healthcare professional and should be used only as part of a full diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment presenting to specialized care settings, and with careful consideration of pretest probability of AD pathology. This CPG provides performance-based, brand-agnostic recommendations for the use of BBMs in the diagnostic workup of suspected AD within specialized care settings. By linking recommendations to a systematic review and associated living updates, and using a robust and transparent methodology, the guideline ensures scientific rigor, adaptability, and sustained relevance as evidence evolves. Clinicians are encouraged to stay informed about emerging paradigms-such as biomarker combinations or ratios and multi-threshold testing-that may further refine the diagnostic accuracy of BBMs as the field evolves.",

This study aimed to evaluate the extent of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination and explore the influencing factors among healthcare providers in western China, in order to inform decision-making regarding the reduction of stigma and discrimination intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2023 and July 2024, and 24,646 (with a response rate of 98.6%) healthcare providers completed the survey using a concise and standardized instrument, including sociodemographic and work-related characteristics, healthcare institutional policies and guidelines, attitudes and opinions about people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV), as well as discriminatory behaviors. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to assess the influencing factors of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers. The proportions of healthcare providers expressing concerns about dressing wounds and drawing blood were 65.1% and 60.3%, respectively. Approximately 40% of the participants believed that most PLHIV did not care if they infected others and had multiple sexual partners. Healthcare providers experienced more secondary stigma and discrimination in the provision of services to PLHIV than direct stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. 67.1% of the respondents agreed that PLHIV should be allowed to have babies if they wish. 71-98% indicated that their institutions had related policies and guidelines to protect HIV/AIDS patients from discrimination. HIV/AIDS-related discriminatory behaviors were higher among healthcare providers who had lower levels of education and training, worked in private or infectious disease hospitals or hospitals with inadequate policies, provided face to face services to PLHIV, and had higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes (P < 0.05). HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers were prevalent in western China. The factors identified in the study which were associated with higher HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination may provide valuable insights for mitigating these negative associations, and more coordinated and multifaceted approaches and interventions need to be implemented to effectively reduce HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings.",

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) in pediatric patients often results in corticosteroid (CS) dependency, with many individuals developing resistance to conventional treatments such as anti-TNF agents. Vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting α4β7 integrin, has shown promise in adult populations, but data on its efficacy and safety in children and adolescents are limited. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab in treating UC in pediatric patients. The PRISMA statement's guidelines were followed in conducting this systematic review. Up until December 2024, a thorough search was carried out using keywords associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), vedolizumab, and pediatric populations in the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed. Case series of children and adolescents (less than 18 years old) with UC or unclassified IBD who were treated with vedolizumab were included in the research. Data on clinical response, mucosal healing, corticosteroid-free remission, clinical remission, and adverse events were extracted. Descriptive statistics were used in the statistical analysis. A total of 14 papers were considered in the current evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of vedolizumab. Nearly one-third (36%) of patients with UC/IBD-U experienced clinical remission at 6 weeks, half of the patients at 14 weeks (50%), and 48% and 53% of patients at 22 weeks, respectively. Forty-five percent of patients maintained clinical remission after 1 year. Less than 8% of UC/IBD-U patients experienced serious side effects, while 15%-34% of patients experienced mucosal healing. Vedolizumab exhibits promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile in treating pediatric UC, with a sizable portion of patients achieving both clinical and corticosteroid-free remission. However, due to the limited sample sizes and lack of investigations, more randomized controlled trials and long-term research are needed to confirm these findings and develop more reliable clinical guidelines for its use in children and adolescents with UC. This means that even if the initial findings are promising, additional and better testing is required to ensure that vedolizumab is both effective and safe for young patients with UC. The PROSPERO registration number for this systematic review is CRD420250651513.",

        "abstract": "Moderate to severe psoriasis has been reported as an independent risk factor for IgA nephropathy (IgAN). IgAN is characterized by episodic microscopic hematuria, which can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Managing therapeutic interventions for psoriasis patients requiring dialysis due to ESRD presents significant challenges. We present a case of severe plaque psoriasis in a patient concurrently diagnosed with IgAN who is dependent on hemodialysis. Over the past two months, his condition has worsened without any identifiable triggers. Physical examination revealed generalized scaly plaques on the scalp, trunk, and extremities, resulting in a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score of 19.2. Laboratory tests confirmed end-stage renal insufficiency, with no other abnormalities detected. Consequently, the patient was prescribed subcutaneous secukinumab following a standard regimen. He achieved complete resolution of symptoms after eight weeks of treatment and experienced no recurrence during a one-year follow-up. His kidney-related parameters remained stable during secukinumab therapy. To summarize, this case report discusses a patient with severe psoriasis who also has concurrent IgAN and ESRD, successfully treated with secukinumab. It reinforces the rapid efficacy and enduring safety of secukinumab in managing psoriasis in hemodialysis-dependent patients with IgAN comorbidity. Zeno Fratton et al has reported that an interleukin (IL)-17A/F inhibitor effectively treats moderate-to-severe psoriasis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, further studies are necessary to develop evidence-based guidelines for biologic selection within this vulnerable population.",

This region accounted for 85% of the nation's documented diphtheria cases. This study examined the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and mortality outcomes of cases diagnosed between February 2022 and April 2024. Data were collected through the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS), and case definitions followed WHO guidelines. Case fatality rate (CFR) was calculated, and a logistic regression model was used to assess mortality-related risk factors, reporting adjusted odds ratios (AOR). A total of 18,320 cases were analysed, with the outbreak showing a bimodal distribution. The primary peak occurred in August 2023, followed by a smaller secondary peak in early 2024. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 4.5%. Patients who were not vaccinated had more than double the likelihood of death compared to fully vaccinated individuals (AOR 2.45; 95% CI: 2.05, 2.94, p < 0.0001; logistic regression). Similarly, patients without vaccination documentation also had greater odds, with more than 87% increase likelihood of mortality compared to fully vaccinated individuals (AOR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.68, p < 0.0001; logistic regression). Our study reinforces previous reports of the weakening preventive health delivery systems in resource constrained settings, particularly after the disruptions caused by the COVID 19 pandemic leading to the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases, such as diphtheria. These highlight the need for improved vaccination coverage and surveillance systems. This research did not receive any external funding.",

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed and Medline, without restrictions on language or year of publication. This was complemented by an exploration of the scientific grey literature, including expert reports and guidelines from professional societies. Studies were selected using the following keywords: antibiotic treatment, urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, bacteriuria, pyelonephritis, cystitis, immunodeficiency, diabetes, renal transplant, neurogenic bladder, cirrhosis, pregnancy, and antimicrobial resistance. All abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed. The synthesis of the findings was subsequently evaluated by members of the CIAFU expert committee, who formulated the most consensual recommendation possible. Across the reviewed literature, no clear benefit was identified in screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in immunocompromised patients. It is not recommended to screen for or treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in immunocompromised patients, except in specific, well-established scenarios. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria does not reduce infection risk; rather, it increases the likelihood of adverse effects and contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance, with its associated morbidity and mortality.",

Treatment is not curative, and patients remain at risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment guidelines have generally restricted antiviral therapy to individuals with high HBV DNA and elevated ALT or hepatic fibrosis, often requiring longitudinal testing that can be scarcely available in resource-limited settings. Consequently, fewer than 3% of people living with HBV infection are receiving antiviral therapy. Guidelines from China and WHO recently broadened access criteria to antiviral therapy, but there are people who fall outside these guidelines who could still benefit from treatment initiation. The pathological processes induced by HBV infection are still active in these patients. We present the benefits and risks of expanding treatment eligibility.

Early identification of patients at risk for cardiac irAEs is crucial, and echocardiographic parameters may serve as valuable predictors. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive utility of echocardiographic indices in assessing cardiac irAE risk in Japanese patients receiving ICI therapy. This retrospective study analyzed patients treated with ICIs at the University of Fukui Hospital between November 2015 and October 2018. Cardiac irAEs were defined according to the ESC guidelines. Among 73 patients, six (8%) developed cardiac irAEs, with no fatalities. Echocardiographic assessment before ICI initiation revealed that patients who later developed cardiac irAEs had significantly lower ejection fractions (EFs) (p < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that left ventricular end-systolic diameters (LVDs) (area under the curve: AUC = 0.660) and EFs (AUC = 0.797) had moderate predictive value for cardiac irAEs. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a higher probability of cardiac irAEs in patients with LVDs and EFs beyond specific thresholds (p < 0.01). Poisson regression analysis indicated a decreasing risk of cardiac irAEs over time after ICI initiation. Baseline echocardiographic parameters, particularly LVDs and EFs, can be useful predictors of cardiac irAEs in patients receiving ICI therapy.

Recent evidence suggests that dietary salt influences immune diseases by modulating Th17 differentiation. This study assessed the impact of dietary salt on Th17-driven inflammation in patients with compensated cirrhosis and explored its effects on liver injury in mouse models.MethodsA non-drug, open-label, non-randomized study involved 37 patients with compensated cirrhosis, who were given personalized guidelines to reduce salt intake over three months. Changes in Th17-driven inflammation and liver function markers were assessed at baseline and after salt restriction. In parallel, the impact of a high-salt diet on hepatic CD4+ T cells was analyzed in mouse models of acute liver injury and fibrosis. ResultsHigh salt intake was associated with Th17-mediated inflammation and correlated with markers of impaired liver function in these patients. Importantly, moderating salt intake through a personalized nutritional intervention was sufficient to reduce CD4+ T cell- mediated inflammation. Furthermore, analysis of RNA-seq data revealed enrichment of salt-induced Th17 gene signatures in both liver tissue and peripheral cells from patients with liver disease. Similarly, mice fed a high salt diet showed hepatic enrichment of Th17 cells and exacerbated liver fibrosis upon injury. Mechanistic studies revealed that high sodium conditions activated NF-κB and induced IL-6 production in hepatocytes, which may promote Th17 responses.ConclusionDietary salt exacerbates Th17-driven inflammation and contributes to cirrhosis progression.

While cell proliferation and adhesion mechanisms are well-characterized, the contribution of vesicle trafficking to glioma progression remains underexplored. This study aimed to characterize proteomic changes across glioma grades. We performed untargeted, quantitative proteomic profiling of glioma tissues across WHO grades I-IV using a combination of Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-11plex labeling and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Tissue samples were processed using filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) and analyzed using a µPAC reverse-phase HPLC system coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer. Protein identification and quantification were conducted through database searching and validated against stringent quality control criteria. We identified over 4,400 proteins across samples, revealing dynamic, grade-specific shifts in vesicle trafficking. Grade II gliomas showed upregulation of exocytic proteins (e.g., synaptotagmin, syntaxin, clathrin) and suppression of dynamin, suggesting enhanced vesicular secretion. Grade III tumors exhibited the opposite trend-marked downregulation of exocytic components with concurrent activation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Grade IV gliomas displayed a hybrid profile, with partial reactivation of exocytic machinery alongside sustained endocytic activity, indicative of vesicular plasticity. This study highlights the synaptic vesicle cycle as a progressively remodeled pathway in glioma biology.

Understanding factors influencing GM career choices is critical for recruitment. However, the reform's impact on career decision-making remains unclear. This study examined factors influencing GM career choices following the introduction of the new specialty certification and identified challenges in this field. A secondary analysis of national survey data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's questionnaire (2018-2020) for clinical training graduates examined post-training career intentions of specializing in GM, focusing on factors influencing choices such as demographics, education, and training contexts. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted with post-training GM preference as the dependent variable. The results are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among 16,674 complete responses, 59% of the 229 individuals initially interested in GM actually pursued it post-training. Positive factors included regional quotas (aOR 3.10, 95% CI 1.12-8.56), ≤ 1 month GM rotation (aOR 3.39, 95% CI 1.03-11.14), > 2 months community medicine (CM) rotations (aOR 13.35, 95% CI 2.40-76.58), desire for primary care skills (aOR 4.85, 95% CI 2.01-11.73), and community contribution aspirations (aOR 6.88, 95% CI 2.75-17.21). The most influential negative factor was perceived ease of specialization maintenance (aOR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.12). Among 16,445 individuals who preferred other specialties, 86 switched to GM. Extended GM rotations (1<-≤2 months: aOR 3.54, 95% CI 2.06-6.09; >2 months: aOR 7.41, 95% CI 4.56-12.04) increased the likelihood of switching. Academic interest (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.58) and perceived ease of maintaining specialization (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.54) were negative factors. GM rotations may positively influence career choices, with longer CM rotations potentially increasing interest. Establishing clear career paths and educating resident physicians about the academic characteristics of GM remain challenging despite its recognition as a specialty.",

        "abstract": "Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy caused by autoantibody-mediated ADAMTS13 deficiency. Historically, splenectomy was used for multiply relapsing iTTP in clinical remission to lessen risk of relapse and as treatment for plasma-refractory or plasma-dependent iTTP. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on two questions related to splenectomy for iTTP: (1) In patients with relapsing iTTP, what is the effect of splenectomy on iTTP relapse rate? (2) In patients with plasma-refractory or plasma-dependent iTTP, what proportion of patients achieve clinical remission after splenectomy? Three electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Scopus) were searched for keywords related to TTP and splenectomy, and screening was completed following PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-three studies were included, representing 62 patients (205.8 years of follow-up) who underwent splenectomy for relapsing iTTP and 57 patients (173.9 years of follow-up; not reported in 3 studies) who underwent splenectomy for plasma-refractory/dependent iTTP. In patients who underwent splenectomy for relapsing iTTP, there were 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.66 - -0.95) fewer iTTP episodes annually after compared to before splenectomy. For patients who underwent splenectomy for plasma-refractory/dependent iTTP, the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 - 0.93). Only two studies included any patients who received rituximab. There is low quality evidence to support the use of splenectomy for multiply relapsing iTTP to decrease relapse rate and for plasma-refractory/dependent iTTP to achieve remission, noting that most of the evidence precedes the routine use of rituximab in iTTP.",

However, there is no documented information on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of severe malaria and dengue. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the association between malaria & dengue and previous COVID-19 infection among the adult population of Mangalore Taluk and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of malaria & dengue. This case-control study was conducted among 293 participants who were positive for either malaria or dengue from November 2022 to August 2024. Data were collected using a proforma which contained sections on demographic details, clinical profile and comorbidities, history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination status. The participants were categorised into having severe disease and mild to moderate disease based on operational definitions. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29. Chi-square test was done, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary Logistic Regression analyses were used and odds ratios were estimated. A total of 293 participants were included in the study with a mean age of 36.7 (SD:14.8) years. Among them, 23.9% (n = 70) had malaria and 76.1% (n = 223) had dengue. Out of those who had malaria, 30% (n = 21) developed severe illness, whereas among those who had dengue 35.8% (n = 80) developed severe dengue. Overall, 58.4% (n = 171) were in the age group of > 30 years. In total, 98.1% (n = 52) of the participants with dengue fever with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe dengue, (aOR:55.93 (95% CI:7.17-435.92) p < 0.001) compared to those without. Similarly, 85.7% (n = 12) of the participants with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe malaria (aOR: 263.7 (95% CI: 34.9-1987.4) p < 0.001) compared to those and these differences were found to be statistically significant. In addition, those participants belonging to lower socio-economic classes had higher chances of developing severe dengue than those belonging to the upper socio-economic class (p < 0.001*). Those with a prior history of COVID-19 infection had higher chances of developing severe malaria and dengue than those without a history of COVID-19 infection.",

        "abstract": "Eclampsia is traditionally considered a complication of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). However, atypical cases occur without preceding HDP, and their pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the clinical features of eclampsia with and without prior HDP diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed 31 singleton pregnancies with eclampsia diagnosed at nine Japanese perinatal centers between 2007 and 2023. Cases were classified into two groups: eclampsia preceded by HDP (n = 14) and eclampsia not preceded by HDP (n = 17). Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and perinatal outcomes were compared. Of the 31 cases of eclampsia, 17 (57%) were not preceded by HDP, while the remaining cases had been diagnosed with HDP prior to the onset of eclampsia. In the eclampsia not preceded by HDP group, compared to the eclampsia preceded by HDP group, the BMI was significantly lower (22.07 ± 2.05 vs. 25.60 ± 6.19 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.047), the gestational week at delivery was significantly later (median 40.0 [32.0-41.0] vs. 37.5 [26.0-41.0] weeks, P = 0.020), and the proportion of male neonates was significantly higher (58.8% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.024). When comparing the onset periods-antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum-the eclampsia not preceded by HDP group exhibited the highest number of cases during the intrapartum period, with 9 cases, while the eclampsia preceded by HDP group showed the highest number during the postpartum period, with 8 cases. Furthermore, in the eclampsia not preceded by HDP group, the white blood cell count was significantly higher immediately after onset (20,626 ± 7,956 vs. 14,687 ± 5,664 /μL, P = 0.039). Atypical eclampsia without preceding HDP shows distinct clinical features, including later gestational age at onset, higher intrapartum incidence, and elevated inflammatory markers. These findings suggest a need for further investigation into alternative pathophysiological mechanisms and tailored clinical strategies for such cases.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory infections are a major cause of mortality among young children and adults, particularly the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. Many respiratory infections, including influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal disease, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have available vaccines and antiviral agents. However, vaccine coverage rates remain low. Experts representing a broad spectrum of medical specialties from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) made evidence-based recommendations on treating patients considered high risk for respiratory infections, highlighting gaps in current practices and suggesting strategies for improved communication between healthcare professionals and patients. To effectively manage respiratory infections, the experts emphasized the importance of adhering to guidelines, considering all vaccines and antiviral treatments, and strictly following vaccination schedules. Early testing upon recognition of symptoms was also encouraged. Improving vaccine uptake was considered crucial and could be achieved by educating patients about disease prevention through vaccines and the role of antiviral treatments for COVID-19. Addressing knowledge gaps and combating vaccine hesitancy among both patients and healthcare professionals were also essential steps. Recommendations for future initiatives include healthcare professionals educating the public on precautionary measures to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. Additionally, the experts agreed that clinical management guidelines for chronic diseases should be updated to include preventative strategies such as vaccines, prophylaxis, and counselling. Monitoring the performance of healthcare facilities using key performance indicators is also recommended to ensure effective management and continuous improvement of vaccination programs. Patient populations in the UAE who are considered at high risk of serious disease from respiratory infections have diverse medical needs and may access healthcare across a wide range of settings and specialisms. Therefore, it is vital that all healthcare professionals across specialisms who may engage with these individuals are able to provide appropriate advice on managing the risk through vaccination, prompt testing, and treatments as needed.",

        "abstract": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most common medications used for depression in postpartum and lactating people, who experience increased depression risk. However, there is a limited understanding of peripartum SSRI impacts on maternal neurobehavioral responses, and particularly those of sertraline, the most prescribed SSRI in United States (US) pregnancies. We administered C57Bl/6 females sertraline via a non-invasive, naturalistic approach (167 mg/L drinking water) from 2 weeks pre-conception through lactation (PND21) or for an equivalent duration in nonpregnant controls. We assessed behavior and molecular brain changes intrapartum and postpartum at ~1 year of age. Chronic sertraline reduced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Pregnancy itself decreased anxiety-like and hedonic behaviors. RNA sequencing of maternal brain revealed only 52 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in frontal cortex with sertraline. These DEGs over-represented functions related to immunity. In contrast, sertraline altered 962 targets in maternal hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, with DEGs overrepresenting neurotransmission and neurodegeneration. We then discontinued sertraline and aged animals to approximately 1 year to test neurodegenerative phenotypes. Having one prior litter, regardless of peripartum sertraline, improved aged females' spatial learning and memory. Sertraline, regardless of postpartum status, improved working memory. Further, we found buffering of neurodegeneration-related gene network changes and increased excitatory synapse density in the hippocampus after peripartum sertraline. Peripartum sertraline alters maternal neurobiology and behavior in pregnancy and beyond, with long-term benefits to neurodegenerative processes. Pregnancy also exerts its own, lasting effects on learning and memory. These findings might be exploited in the future to abrogate neurodegenerative disease.",

To assess healthcare professionals' (HCPs) prescribing behaviors, comfort levels, and challenges when advising patients, focusing on discrepancies between clinical guidance documents and SmPC/PIL. Online survey entitled PRAISE (Perception of healthcare providers Regarding Antirheumatics in pregnancy and breastfeeding: advice, Information and patient perSpEctives) and disseminated through HCPs groups and social media. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 414 HCPs globally. Respondents were divided into prescribers (<i>n</i> = 336) and non-prescribers (<i>n</i> = 78) based on their self-reported role in prescribing antirheumatic medications to pregnant or breastfeeding patients with RMDs. The survey covered demographics, clinical experience, confidence in prescribing, use of clinical guidelines, and experiences managing conflicting information between guidelines and SmPC/PIL. Prescribers were more likely than non-prescribers to feel comfortable discussing medication safety during pregnancy. Most prescribers found clinical guidance documents useful, with 48% rating them as \"very useful\" and 38% as \"extremely useful.\" In case of conflicting information between clinical guidance documents and SmPC/PIL, 58% of HCPs reported that it caused confusion and tension in patient-doctor relationships, and almost 20% of them are \"likely\" or \"very likely\" to discontinue ongoing treatment. Clear communication and shared decision-making were the most common strategies used to address patient concerns. HCPs often face significant challenges when advising patients with RMDs on the use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Conflicting information between clinical guidance documents and SmPC/PIL can disrupt patient-doctor relationship and lead to treatment discontinuation, with potential consequences on maternal disease control. Improved alignment between clinical guidance documents and the SmPC/PIL could enhance patient care and prevent confusion among HCPs and patients.",

We use multivariable regression to examine whether and to what extent antenatal care, pregnancy and post-pregnancy care of the 'exposed' mothers and children were adversely impacted as compared to those who were 'unexposed'. The 'exposed' mothers were less likely to receive two tetanus injections, and iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy, and were less likely to stay in medical facility for 48 hours post-delivery as recommended by the government guidelines. More critically, 'exposed' children had lower probability of receiving immunizations due at birth, 6-weeks, 10-weeks, and 14-weeks, with the magnitude of decline increasing for successive immunizations. The impacts were even more adverse in rural areas as reflected in heterogeneity analysis. COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns adversely affected MCH services in India, and even more so in rural India.

ICIs can cause rheumatic-immune related adverse events (Rh-irAEs) such as inflammatory arthritis and myositis. Few case reports detail Rh-irAEs and their management in the pediatric population. Our objective was to assess the familiarity of pediatric rheumatologists (PRs) worldwide with Rh-irAEs, gauge confidence in managing these conditions, and identify knowledge gaps to guide future educational efforts. We circulated an online survey to 2084 PRs via the \"Dr. Peter Dent Pediatric Rheumatology Bulletin Board.\" Responses were collected from June 2024 to September 2024. We collected data on practitioner demographics, knowledge of ICIs and Rh-irAEs, confidence in managing Rh-irAEs, and preferred educational resources. Sixty-nine participants responded, of which 55 (80%) were PRs from academic centers. Despite global distribution, 56 (81%) responses came from North America. Thirty-four (49%) respondents were not aware of ICIs and their related mechanisms, indications, and side effects, and 40 (58%) were not familiar with irAEs. Fifty-five (80%) had never managed a patient with Rh-irAEs. Among those who had (14/69, 21%), the median number of cases managed was 2.0 (IQR 0.0). Thirty-nine respondents were \"not confident at all\" managing Rh-irAEs, 34 were \"not confident at all\" managing pre-existing autoimmune diseases (PAD) in ICI users, and 46 were \"not confident at all\" advising oncology colleagues on initiating or discontinuing ICIs in the context of Rh-irAEs or pre-existing autoimmune diseases (PAD). No respondents felt \"completely confident\" managing these conditions. Participants identified knowledge gaps in long-term management, acute management, and recognition and diagnosis. Forty-three indicated the need for pediatric-specific clinical guidelines. Of the 14 respondents with clinical experience treating Rh-irAEs, treatment varied, with 4 using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 3 using prednisone, and 4 combining prednisone with methotrexate. Long-term management also varied, with 5 using methotrexate, and 3 using tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Significant knowledge gaps and a lack of confidence exist among PRs managing ICI-related Rh-irAEs. As ICI use increases in pediatric oncology, PRs' exposure to Rh-irAEs will follow. Targeted educational programs and clinical guidelines may be valuable to address these gaps.",

We assayed serum from select patients enrolled in ADvocate1 and ADvocate2 to determine the impact of lebrikizumab on circulating biomarkers and pathways relevant to atopic dermatitis (AD) and to assess the correlation between key biomarkers and clinical measures of improvement. At baseline, IL-13, CC motif chemokine ligand (CCL)13, CCL17, CCL22, total immunoglobulin (Ig)E, IL-5, and periostin were elevated in patients with moderate-to-severe AD versus healthy controls (p < 0.001). Baseline Eczema and Area Severity Index (EASI) and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores were significantly correlated with IL-13, IL-5, CCL13, CCL22, and CCL26. Lebrikizumab induced rapid and progressive reductions in CCL13, CCL17, CCL22, and periostin at weeks 4, 16, and 52 compared with baseline (p < 0.05). AD-associated pathways linked to cytokine signaling were significantly improved at weeks 4 and 16. Improvements in EASI, IGA, and the Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale were correlated with reductions in CCL13, CCL17, CCL22, CCL26, and periostin across all time points.

Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed, as indicated by the incidence of disease falling to less than one case of tetanus per 10 million person-years and approximately one case of diphtheria per 1 billion person-years in the U.S. population. Here, we compare the success of the tetanus and diphtheria vaccination programs to that of other common childhood vaccines and review an evidence-based approach to adult booster vaccination schedules. These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population. Moreover, updating the current vaccination program to remove adult decennial booster doses will not only harmonize the U.S. recommendations with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) but may also further improve the risk:benefit ratio for vaccination while providing up to $1 billion annually in healthcare savings.",

Pearson correlation analysisof measles seroprevalence by birth year revealed a strong negative and statistically significant relationship (r=-0.964, p < 0.001). When analyzed by place of birth, the lowest measles seroprevalence was observed in the Eastern Marmara region (34.5%). Our study emphasizes the substantial number of young healthcare workers who are still vulnerable to measles, posing a potential risk during outbreaks. Early screening and vaccination of medical students against vaccine-preventable diseases are essential during their education. This proactive strategy not only protects individuals but also strengthens herd immunity.",

        "abstract": "Childhood immunization is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. Despite global efforts, Nigeria faces persistently low immunization uptake with significant regional and socioeconomic disparities. This study investigated the prevalence, regional disparities, and sociodemographic determinants of full immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Nigeria. This secondary analysis utilized data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS), focusing on 2453 mothers with children aged 12-23 months. Full immunization coverage was defined per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis, and multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of coverage. Only 26% of children were fully immunized nationwide. Marked regional disparities were observed, with the North West (13%) and North East (18%) exhibiting the lowest rates, while the South East (42%) and South South (41%) had the highest. Multivariable analysis revealed that maternal education, household wealth, and region of residence were significant predictors. Children of mothers with higher education were more likely to be fully immunized (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.10-3.18, p = 0.022), as were those from the richest households compared to the poorest (AOR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.95-5.25, p < 0.001). Children in the South East (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.16-3.46, p = 0.013) and South South (AOR: 1.73, 95% CI: 0.99-3.02, p = 0.052) also showed significantly higher odds of full immunization compared to the North West. Full immunization coverage in Nigeria remains critically low, driven by pronounced regional and socioeconomic inequities. Targeted interventions focusing on improving maternal education, expanding equitable healthcare access in underserved regions, and providing financial support to low-income families are essential. Policy efforts must prioritize these vulnerable groups to enhance child health outcomes and achieve universal immunization coverage in Nigeria.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are the leading cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality. Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA), regulate gene expression, stress response, and immune functions in cancer. While increasingly implicated in CRC progression, their prognostic significance in CRLM remains unknown. This study investigates the abundance and prognostic value of genomic (ge) and mitochondrial (mt) tRFs in CRLM. Tumor samples from CRLM patients who underwent curative liver resection between January 2012 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) quantified ge- and mt-tRF expression in tumor tissue. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary outcome. Associations between tRF expression and EFS were evaluated using Cox regression, spline modeling, and network analysis. Among 588 screened samples, 40 met eligibility criteria (18 females [45%], median age 64 [42-79]). A total of 432 tRFs were identified, with ge-tRFs (67%) more abundant than mt-tRFs (33%). Spline regressions classified tRFs into ten prognostic groups. High ge-tRF abundance was predominantly associated with unfavorable EFS (FDR < 0.2; 94%), while mt-tRFs were significantly (p < 0.001; χ<sup>2</sup> test) more often linked to favorable EFS (FDR < 0.2; 26%). Network analysis of tRF abundance correlations revealed higher intra-mitochondrial network density compared to the intra-genomic tRF network. No significant structural differences were observed between prognostically significant vs. non-significant or favorable vs. unfavorable tRFs. Key tRF candidates, including tRHalve3-His-CAU and tRNAleader-Gln-UUG (mt-tRFs), as well as tRFmisc-Tyr-GTA (ge-tRF), remained independent prognostic markers after adjusting for clinical covariates. This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of tRF expression in CRLM, identifying distinct prognostic roles for ge- and mt-tRFs. While ge-tRFs correlated with poor prognosis, several mt-tRFs were linked to favorable outcomes, highlighting their potential as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, while in Egypt, it is considered the 14th major contributor to female tumors. To assess nursing staff attitude regarding prevention of cervical cancer. A descriptive cross-sectional study framework was executed in Mansoura University Hospital and six other buildings (psychiatry, burns, outpatient, special medicine, convalescence and radiation building), Mansoura city, Egypt, among 414 nursing staff who were chosen by using the convenience sampling technique. A structured interview questionnaire consisting of two parts was used to gather data from June 2024 and continued until the end of November 2024. Univariate analysis for descriptive data and bivariate analysis through the chi-square test were performed. The current research revealed that 76.3% of the studied nursing staff had a positive attitude toward the prevention of cervical cancer, while 69.3% of them agreed that cervical neoplasm is a highly preventable disease, and 71.7% of them agreed that cervical neoplasm is curable if detected early. Also, there was a statistically significant positive association between educational level and attitude (p < 0.001) and a statistically significant positive association between marital status and attitude (p < 0.031). Also, there was a statistically significant positive association between vaccination against HPV and positive attitude (p < 0.001), while there was a statistically significant positive association between positive attitude and cervical cancer screening (p < 0.012). It is concluded that more than three-quarters of nursing staff demonstrated a positive attitude toward cervical cancer prevention, underscoring the need for continued educational interventions.

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains one of the main causes of female mortality, especially in middle- and low-income countries, despite efforts towards the implementation of global vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV). The aim of this study was to review and compare the most recently published international guidelines providing recommendations on cervical cancer screening strategies among average and high-risk women. Thus, a comparative review of guidelines by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC), the Cancer Council Australia (CCA), and the European Guidelines (EG) was conducted. There is an overall agreement regarding the suggestions made for women younger than 21 and those older than 65, with all guidelines stating against routine screening, with the exceptions of CTFPHC and CCA that expand the age group to up to 70 and 75 years, respectively. Continuation of screening in older women is also suggested in those with a history of a precancerous lesion and those with inadequate screening. Most guidelines recommend routine screening at 30-65 years, while the WHO advises that screening should be prioritized at 30-49 years. HPV DNA testing is the method of choice recommended by most guidelines, followed by cytology as an alternative, except for CTFPHC, which refers to cytology only, with self-sampling being an acceptable method by most medical societies. Agreements exist regarding recommendations for specific groups, such as women with a history of total hysterectomy for benign reasons, women with a complete vaccination against HPV, individuals from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities and women with multiple sexual partners or early initiation of sexual activity. On the other hand, the age group of 21-29 is addressed differently by the reviewed guidelines, while differentiations also occur in the screening strategies in cases of abnormal screening results, in women with immunodeficiency, those with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrole and pregnant women. The development of consistent practice protocols for the most appropriate cervical cancer screening programs seems to be of major importance to reduce mortality rates and safely guide everyday clinical practice.",

        "title": "Functional Foods in Modern Nutrition Science: Mechanisms, Evidence, and Public Health Implications.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, functional foods have garnered increasing scientific and public health interest due to their potential to confer physiological benefits beyond basic nutritional value. International bodies such as EFSA, FDA, and WHO define functional foods as those containing bioactive components that may contribute to the prevention and management of chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. The evolving paradigm of \"food as medicine\" reflects a broader shift in nutritional science towards proactive, health-oriented dietary strategies. This article provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary overview of functional foods by examining their biological mechanisms, clinical evidence, public health significance, regulatory frameworks, and future prospects-particularly in the context of advances in personalized nutrition and nutrigenomics. A thorough literature review was conducted, drawing from recent peer-reviewed studies and guidelines from key health authorities. The review highlights the roles of specific compounds such as probiotics and prebiotics in modulating the gut microbiome, flavonoids and polyphenols in anti-inflammatory processes, omega-3 fatty acids in cardiometabolic regulation, and vitamins and minerals in supporting immune function. While an expanding body of clinical trials and meta-analyses supports the health benefits of these compounds-including reductions in LDL cholesterol, improved insulin sensitivity, and mitigation of oxidative stress-the integration of functional foods into everyday diets remains challenging. Socioeconomic disparities and limited health literacy often impede their accessibility and widespread adoption in public health practice. Functional foods represent a promising component of prevention-focused modern healthcare. To maximize their impact, a coordinated, evidence-based approach is essential, involving collaboration among healthcare professionals, nutrition scientists, policymakers, and the food industry. Looking forward, innovations in artificial intelligence, microbiome research, and genomic technologies may unlock novel opportunities for the targeted and effective application of functional foods in population health.",

        "abstract": "The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 had a profound global impact. While many individuals recovered from COVID-19, some developed long-lasting symptoms that significantly disrupted daily life. The WHO defines this condition as post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). Common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnoea, sleep disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Increasing evidence suggests that PCC is a multifactorial condition, shaped not only by biomedical but also psychological and social factors. This article presents the protocol of the Basel Long COVID Cohort Study (BALCoS), which aims to improve understanding of PCC by capturing clinical, functional and psychosocial aspects through repeated assessments over the course of 1 year. BALCoS is a prospective, single-site cohort study. Inclusion criteria include either a probable or confirmed history of SARS-CoV-2 infection with persistent symptoms consistent with the WHO definition of PCC, sufficient German language skills and age ≥18 years. At baseline, we collected detailed information on previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptom history, reinfections, COVID-19 vaccination status and pre-existing medical conditions. The study includes standardised psychometric assessments, physical performance tests, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), neurocognitive testing and blood sample collection. Assessments are scheduled at baseline and at 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up. All participants complete psychometric assessments at each time point. Blood samples are only collected at baseline. Neurocognitive testing and physical performance measures are collected at baseline and 12-month follow-up for in-person participants only. Participants who are unable to attend in person complete a remote version of the study, excluding these in-clinic assessments. EMAs are initiated the day after each time point and consist of eight questions over 10 consecutive days. The study is exploratory in nature, with a target sample size of 120 participants. BALCoS is part of the Horizon Europe Long COVID project, a multinational interdisciplinary research consortium integrating mechanistic, clinical and interventional studies. The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Northwest and Central Switzerland (BASEC-ID: 2023-00359) and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05781893). All participants provide written informed consent. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications. NCT05781893.",

        "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS), which can lead to severe physical or cognitive disability and neurological deficits, is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology and pathogenesis of MS remain unclear; nonetheless, it is asserted that its cause is complex, with genetic predisposition playing a significant role. In this study, our aim was to analyze the relationship between MS and HLA-DRA (rs3135388 and rs3135391), HLA-DQA1 (rs9272346) and IL-6 (rs1800795 and rs1900796) gene polymorphisms, which play an important role in inflammation and immune response. The study included 100 healthy controls and 98 MS patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze variations in rs3135388 and rs3135391 in the HLA-DRA gene, rs9272346 in the HLA-DQA1 gene, and rs1800795 and rs1900796 in the IL-6 gene following DNA isolation from peripheral blood. Statistical techniques were applied to assess the outcomes. The results showed a significant difference in IL-6 (rs1800796) G/C (p = 0.024) between the patient and control groups when genotypes and allele distributions were analyzed. HLA-DQA1 (rs9272346) and HLA-DRA (rs3135388 and rs3135391) variations did not substantially differ between the two groups. Similarly, no significant difference was found between the two groups in VitD, B12 and folic acid parameters, and there was no relationship between these parameters and genotypes. There is evidence suggesting a significant association between IL-6 (rs1800796) polymorphisms and MS. IL-6 (rs1800796) GC genotype may be associated with disease susceptibility or risk.

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high incidence and mortality. The challenge remains to construct reliable prognostic prediction models and to further elucidate the key molecular mechanisms of tumor progression. To address this, we performed WGCNA based on 120 immune cell expression profiles from GEO sources to obtain a collection of monocytes/macrophages-related genes. The prognostic model was constructed by univariate survival analysis and LASSO regression analysis. Then, the prognostic model was validated by Multivariate Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and ROC analysis. In this prognostic model, we identified that PLIN2 has a potential value for CRC prognosis. PLIN2 expression in monocytes/macrophages was verified by scRNA-seq datasets and spatial transcriptome datasets, and PLIN2 was found to promote macrophage transformation to M2 subtype. Clinical specimens and tissue microarrays confirmed the differential expression and prognostic value of PLIN2 in CRC patients. Functional experiments demonstrated that PLIN2 gene overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells and significantly facilitated tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we revealed that CD36 is a potential downstream target gene of PLIN2. The CD36 inhibitor Sulfo-N-succinimidyl Oleate significantly reversed PLIN2-induced proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT activity of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that PLIN2 could interact with CD36. PLIN2 stabilized CD36 protein expression by inhibiting the proteasomal degradation pathway, thereby promoting CD36-mediated EMT activity. Overall, our study highlights that the PLIN2/CD36 axis regulates EMT activity and CRC progression, suggesting that interventions in this signaling pathway may offer a promising therapeutic approach to CRC progression. Schematic diagram elucidating the role of PLIN2 in CRC by Figdraw. FA is transported into the cell via CD36-mediated endocytosis. In CRC cells, PLIN2 promotes stability of CD36 and interacts with CD36 to activate the EMT process. However, the CD36 inhibitor SSO inhibits the binding of FAs to CD36 and attenuates its endocytosis, thereby reversing the PLIN2-mediated EMT process. Ultimately, the PLIN2-induced enhancement of CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion is attenuated by the CD36 inhibitor SSO.",

To map longitudinal CSF amyloid, tau, and cognitive trajectories along the clinical spectrum of AD and amyloid-negative controls. This longitudinal cohort study included participants with a minimum of 2 CSF samples from Alzheimer Centrum Amsterdam cohorts across the AD clinical spectrum (ie, abnormal amyloid levels at first visit, in different clinical stages) and cognitively normal controls with initially normal CSF markers from November 2003 to July 2019. The maximum follow-up period was 19.5 years (median [IQR], 2 [0-3] years). Data were analyzed from March 2024 to May 2025. AD biomarkers (ß-amyloid [Aß]1-42 to Aß1-40 ratio, total tau [t-tau], and phosphorylated tau [p-tau]) detected in serially collected CSF. CSF AD biomarkers were measured with Lumipulse G600II. Cognition was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and delayed memory recall component of the of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Analysis was conducted using linear mixed models, including random intercepts and slopes, adjusting for age, education level, and sex. Each model included an interaction term of time and clinical stage to study stage-specific slopes. Biomarker conversion rates per clinical stage were studied by comparing biomarker status between visits. The sample included 197 individuals (103 male [52.3%]), including 83 controls (mean [SD] age, 63 [8] years), 31 individuals with amyloid positivity who were cognitively unimpaired (mean [SD] age, 67 [9] years), 30 individuals with amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI; mean [SD] age, 67 [7] years), and 53 individuals with amyloid-positive dementia (mean [SD] age, 65 [8] years). Aβ1-42/1-40 ratios decreased in controls (β [SE] = -8.55 × 10-4 [1.87 × 10-4]; P < .001) and the amyloid-positive cognitively unimpaired group (β [SE] = -1.05 × 10-3 [3.14 × 10-4]; P < .001), and remained low in amyloid-positive MCI and dementia groups. There were 10 controls (12.0%) who reached abnormal amyloid over a mean (SD) of 4.8 (3.4) years. In controls, CSF t-tau (β [SE] = 8.49 [2.55] pg/mL per year; P = .002) and p-tau (β [SE] = 1.36 [0.41] pg/mL per year; P = .001) levels increased over time, and levels also increased for those in the amyloid-positive cognitively unimpaired (t-tau: β [SE] = 17.24 [4.58] pg/mL per year; P < .001; p-tau: β [SE] = 3.10 [0.72] pg/mL per year; P < .001) and amyloid-positive MCI (t-tau: β [SE] = 30.80 [5.99] pg/mL per year; P < .001; p-tau: β [SE] = 4.40 [0.93] pg/mL per year; P < .001) groups, with t-tau increasing further in the dementia group (β [SE] = 24.97 [7.80] pg/mL per year; P = .002). Longitudinal increases in p-tau and t-tau were steeper in the amyloid-positive cognitively unimpaired and MCI groups than in controls, with 10 controls (12.0%) reaching abnormal p-tau and 12 controls (14.5%) reaching abnormal t-tau levels. Delayed recall declined most in the amyloid-positive cognitively unimpaired group (β [SE] = -0.31 [0.07]; P < .001) and was associated with CSF amyloid levels (β [SE] = 102.29 [47.30]; P = .03).

        "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae can be responsible for severe infections, especially in patients with primary antibody deficiencies like selective anti-polysaccharide antibodies deficiency (SPAD). The reference method recommaned by the World Health Organization for assessment of anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (PCPs) IgG antibodies is a standardized serotype-specific ELISA (WHO-SSA), but this manual method is time-consuming and limit the number of evaluated PCPs. We aim to evaluate the performance values of a multiplex assay based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL-plex). A panel of 164 sera from 82 patients sampled before and 4-8 weeks after immunization by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) were assessed by the reference WHO-SSA (7 to 13 serotypes) and by an 18-plex ECL assay (18 serotypes). All patients had normal serum Ig/subclasses levels and were classified as good (n = 43) or poor responders (n = 39, i.e. SPAD patients) according to the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology's (AAAAI) current guidelines. We observed excellent correlations between the two methods for anti-PCPs titers against 7 serotypes (r = 0.88 [95% CI: 0.87-0.90], n = 124 sera) and 13 serotypes (r = 0.87 [0.87-0.89], n = 40 sera). Using the AAAAI's guidelines for interpretation, the test performance of the 18-plex ECL assay for SPAD diagnosis showed a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 84%, positive and negative predictive values of 84% and 95%, respectively. The percentage of agreement was 89% between the SSA and the 18-plex ECL assay. The 18-plex ECL assay is a reliable, rapid, and simple method for evaluating anti-PCPs response and screening for SPAD diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Adrenal insufficiency is a known complication of both immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and resection or ablation of the adrenal glands. In the modern era of immunotherapy, more frequent assessment of the adrenal hormonal axis is performed after initiation of ICIs in order to monitor for such complications. The interpretation of these laboratory tests, such as elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), in patients who receive ICIs and undergo adrenalectomy or adrenal ablation provides an additional set of diagnostic challenges that are not well described. We present a case series of four patients who had elevated ACTH without clinical (symptoms) or biochemical (decreased cortisol) evidence of adrenal insufficiency, a pattern suggesting a compensatory increase in ACTH. This highlights an emerging phenomenon and diagnostic challenge in the monitoring of the adrenal axis in patients undergoing adrenalectomy or ablation alongside ICI therapy, emphasizing the need for close follow-up and thorough investigation to rule out adrenal insufficiency in such patients.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatic heart diseases (RHDs) impose a substantial global burden, primarily affecting individuals under 25 years of age in low- and medium-income countries (LMICs) and poor and marginalized groups in high-income countries.[123] The underlying cause is a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, which triggers an immune-mediated attack on the heart and joints. Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is treatable, its occurrence and complications remain high in impoverished areas.[4] Variations in social structure contribute to differences in the incidence and progression of the disease, even in affluent regions.[5] Administering anesthesia to this patient population presents significant challenges, particularly when early management has been inadequate due to limited medical care and follow-up. Literature shows evidence for anesthetic management of different types of RHDs, mostly focusing on mitral and aortic valvulopathies.[67] This review synthesizes literature from databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed searches from the year 2000 to date, focusing on anesthesia management strategies and the challenges posed by ARF and RHD. Specific topics covered include the diagnosis and management of ARF, acute complications, perioperative care for patients with RHD, and unique considerations for different valvular pathologiesWith this review, we aim to discuss the available evidence, current World Health Organization (WHO) and societal guidelines in the context of perioperative medical and anesthetic management, hemodynamic challenges, and postoperative courses. An emphasis on basic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) training is made in this review as the current era of diagnostics and therapeutics is increasingly reliant on echocardiography.",

Despite recommendations, vaccination rates remain suboptimal, particularly in completing the two-dose series. This study evaluates the impact of an electronic medical record (EMR)-based intervention on postpartum MMR and varicella vaccination rates.A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two urban tertiary care centers. Nonimmune postpartum patients with public insurance who delivered between January 2021 and June 2022 and February 2023 and October 2024 were included in the pre- and postintervention groups, respectively. The intervention, implemented in April 2023, modified the mandated postpartum checklist in the EMR to include measles immunity status and emphasize the necessity of completing the two-dose series for MMR and varicella. The primary outcome was the completion rate of the two-dose series, with secondary outcomes assessing provider adherence and patient acceptance. Statistical analyses included chi-squared and <i>t</i>-tests to compare pre- and postintervention cohorts.A total of 468 patients were included (220 preintervention and 248 postintervention). MMR series completion significantly increased from 2.3 to 34.9% (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Varicella series completion showed a nonsignificant upward trend from 27.0 to 36.5% (<i>p</i> = 0.112). Provider adherence improved, with fewer missed opportunities to offer the second dose at the postpartum visit (49.6 vs. 32.9%; <i>p</i> = 0.004 for MMR). Patient declination rates remained stable.Integrating vaccination reminders into the EMR significantly improved postpartum MMR series completion. While varicella rates showed a modest increase, persistent provider follow-up and patient education remain crucial. Future efforts should focus on addressing systemic barriers and enhancing patient outreach to further optimize postpartum vaccination completion. · EMR checklist improved MMR series completion rates.. · Varicella series completion showed modest improvement.. · Provider adherence to vaccine guidelines increased.. · Barriers to postpartum vaccine completion still exist..",

        "abstract": "Given that maintaining the health of teachers and students is of the utmost importance, this study explored potential predictors of U.S. teachers' decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, an evidence-based public health measure. The present study explored whether teachers' demographics (i.e., gender, race, age, and grade taught), personal characteristics (i.e., awareness and nonjudgmental orientation as components of mindfulness, and anxiety), and state characteristics (i.e., gubernatorial party) were associated with their decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Five hundred sixteen Kindergarten-12th grade teachers from across the U.S. participated in April 2022. Results from stepwise generalized linear mixed effects models indicated that teachers who were women (vs. men), White (vs. teachers of color), and younger (vs. older) were less likely to be vaccinated. Awareness skills were associated with greater odds of vaccination, whereas a nonjudgmental orientation and anxiety were associated with reduced odds of vaccination. This study provides insight into demographic, personal, and state-level influences associated with teachers' decision to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Findings highlight the importance of targeted efforts to increase adherence to public health guidelines so that schools can reopen swiftly and safely in future public health crises.",

        "abstract": "We systematically appraised studies investigating factors associated with ICANS development after CAR-T cell therapies in adults with hematological malignancies and estimated ICANS prevalence. We conducted a systematic review (SR) in 4 databases following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for studies published from 2010 to December 2024. We estimated ICANS prevalence with exact binomial and score test-based 95% confidence intervals. We applied the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation to stabilize variances within random-effects models using the Metaprop command in Stata. Sixteen studies (14 retrospective, n = 135, and 2 prospective, n = 300) were included in this SR. The sample comprised adults with various hematological malignancies who received anti-CD19 anti-BCMA. Some clinical factors seem to be associated with ICANS incidence and severity. In retrospective studies, the pooled prevalence was 41% (95% CI: 31%-51%) for all grades of ICANS and 20% (95% CI: 13%-28%) for grade ≥3 ICANS. In prospective studies, the pooled prevalence was 51% (95% CI: 45%-56%). Approximately half of hematological patients undergoing CAR T therapy develop ICANS. Although some factors may contribute to the development of ICANS, limited studies and samples, the retrospective nature of the majority of studies, and the discordance among the results preclude certain risk factors conclusions. Nurses play a pivotal role in post-treatment monitoring in the early detection and management of ICANS, given their direct and continuous patient interaction. Increasing nurses' awareness of potential risk factors for ICANS can enhance their vigilance and effectiveness in managing this condition.",

Hyperinflammation progresses with aggravation of brain damage and deterioration in clinical status. The study aimed to demonstrate a valuable, easy-to-obtain, and inexpensive parameter for prognostic assessment by comparing the Pan-immune Inflammation Value (PIV), Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), and CALLY scores in patients with ischemic stroke. In this retrospective single-center cohort study, the files of patients who were followed up with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the tertiary intensive care units. Multivariate regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves(ROC) were used to detect the association between PIV, SII, and CALLY on in-hospital mortality and their superiority over each other in predicting mortality in ischemic stroke patients. Of 1,039 patients, 453 died, resulting in an overall survival rate of 56.4%. In the multivariate analysis, high APACHE II scores and low albumin levels remained independent risk factors. ROC curves showed that PIV, SII, and CALLY exhibited good predictive values, with AUCs of 0.921, 0.887, and 0.930 (95% CI: 0.903-0.936, 0.855-0.896, 0.913-0.945; p < 0.001). A pairwise comparison of the data based on AUC values indicated a significant difference between SII and both PIV and CALLY (p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant difference was found between PIV and CALLY (p = 0.385). The PIV, SII, and CALLY indices serve as accessible and reliable prognostic biomarkers that can enhance personalized treatment strategies and improve clinical decision-making in patients with ischemic stroke.",

In these Evidence-Based Guidelines, we provide key treatment recommendations for both patients with newly diagnosed MM and those with relapsed and/or refractory MM, including guidance for the use of established drugs as well as contemporary immunotherapies. Novel approaches for the management of patients with SMM focus on those who might require early intervention.

Existing guidelines recommend disease management, but they are not fully implemented in a clinical setting. Evidence regarding best practice and real-world effectiveness is limited. A nationwide multicentre clinical effectiveness trial is being performed between 2023 and 2027, involving 99 secondary hospitals in urban and rural areas in China. It is an open-label, adjudicator and assessor-blinded, parallel group, cluster randomised pragmatic trial. Hospitals are randomly allocated to standardised management (SM) or usual care. A total number of 3456 stable patients with COPD who are symptomatic (individuals in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group B) or have exacerbation risk (individuals with one moderate exacerbation history in Group A and individuals in Group E) using GOLD 2023 ABE classification will be enrolled. In the SM group, an integrated intervention comprising five components will be delivered using a physician and nurse model. These are: (1) long-term inhaled maintenance therapy, (2) periodic inhaler technique assessment and symptom monitoring, (3) annual pulmonary function testing, (4) COPD education session and (5) health behaviour adoption (smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation). In the control group, patients will receive routine care. The primary goal is to assess the real-world effectiveness of guideline-directed disease management on exacerbation prevention, with moderate-to-severe exacerbation as the primary outcome and hospital admission, mortality, health status and COPD self-management as secondary outcomes. It is the first pragmatic trial undertaken of this form in a developing country. It is anticipated that it will provide a feasible and effective COPD management model that can inform guidelines and be rolled out into secondary and primary care, with modification, to ensure standardised COPD care nationwide.

        "abstract": "Histiocytoses represent a group of diverse rare disorders characterized by the abnormal accumulation of cells derived from the mononuclear phagocyte system in various tissues and organs. The mononuclear phagocyte system includes monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and specialized tissue-resident phagocytes. These cells are essential for both innate and adaptive immunity and preserving tissue homeostasis. Several classifications of histiocytoses by the Histiocyte Society (1987, 1997, 2016) and WHO (2018, 2022) and an International Consensus Classification (2022) are generally acknowledged. The WHO 2022 classification clarifies these heterogeneous disorders by dividing them into three major groups. Cutaneous involvement in histiocytosis is often polymorphous, making clinical decision more challenging. Cutaneous histiocytoses can occur either as primary cases or as a manifestation of a multisystemic disease. In support of the standard pathology report, immunohistochemical staining is warranted. The exact etiopathogenesis of histiocytoses remains poorly understood, and various associations with malignancies, including visceral and hematologic cancers, as well as autoimmune diseases and infections (Borrelia burgdorferi) are still under review. One of the most recent advancements in this field is the discovery of somatic mutations in the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, particularly BRAF mutations. Oncogene-induced senescence-associated BRAF mutations have been described in Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease. Targeted therapies with BRAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib and vemurafenib have shown promising results. MEK inhibitors, like trametinib and cobimetinib, have demonstrated efficiency regardless of the BRAF mutation status. Local treatments of cutaneous histiocytosis include topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, alkylating agents, phototherapy, steroid injections, and laser therapies. Despite the current advances in pathogenesis and treatments, cutaneous histiocytosis stands as a challenging and heterogeneous group of disorders, and treatment guidelines are warranted.",

While risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) and adverse TB outcomes in HIV-infected adults are well-documented for mortality estimation, understanding mortality risks among HIV-infected children and adolescents, especially in the era of test and treatment and universal ART for all HIV-infected persons, remains limited. This study aimed to estimate the mortality rate among TB and HIV-co-infected children in Sub-Saharan African countries using SRM. We systematically searched relevant studies from seven international electronic databases. Articles were searched using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Article searching included six electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE (N = 1287), Scopus (N = 447), Web of Science (N = 174), Science Direct (N = 749, Cochran (N = 57), and Google Scholar and research repository bases searching (N = 42). The quality of primary studies was evaluated using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The pooled mortality rate was estimated using a weighted inverse variance random-effect meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and estimated using I2 statistic. This document is registered in Prospero (CRD420251012913). In this SRM, 16 individual studies were included. During the co-infected mortality screening of 5,098 participants, 657 deaths were reported after co-treatment started. The pooled mortality burden was estimated at 12.96% (95% CI: 8.94 to 16.98, I2 = 92.6%, P = 0.001). The majority of TB co-infected cases were newly diagnosed after ART started. The final weighted inverse variance random-effect regression indicated WHO stages III and IV (pooled HR = 4.34), poor/ fair ART adherence (pooled HR = 3.11), missed Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) (pooled HR = 3.07), hemoglobin levels ≤ 10 mg/dL (pooled HR = 2.84), bedridden functional status (pooled HR = 3.19), below threshold CD4 count (pooled HR = 1.80), and missed cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) (pooled AOR = 1.58) were predictors of premature death during co-infection. In this review, the overall pooled burden of mortality in HIV-infected children in SSA countries was high compared with the End TB Strategy target estimation. Significant predictors of mortality included WHO clinical stages III and IV, poor or fair ART adherence, missed Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), and hemoglobin levels ≤ 10 mg/dL. Therefore, counseling on antiretroviral therapy adherence should be strengthened; early screening and treating of anemia, screening and scaling up of IPT, critical ART drug, and nutritional counseling should be done during regular visits for caregivers to prevent premature deaths among children, youths, and adolescents during co-infection in SSA.",

        "abstract": "Studies on multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common hematologic malignancy, have shown inconclusive results regarding the role of exercise in treatment. This study evaluated the relationship between physical exercise and MM treatment outcomes. In the 5T-MM mouse model, tumor-bearing mice underwent treatment that included bortezomib and dexamethasone alongside 6 weeks of low- or moderate-intensity treadmill aerobic training. Tumor burden and survival data were recorded. Additionally, a retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 MM patients undergoing maintenance therapy at West China Hospital from 2013 to 2024. Patients were categorized based on their adherence to the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity guidelines, and progression-free survival and progression-free survival in maintenance therapy were analyzed. In the mouse model, the combination of dual-drug therapy and exercise improved outcomes, extending survival by more than 10 days. Aerobic exercises reduced regulatory T cells and increased NK cells in the peripheral blood of mice. In the exercise group of mice, myokines IL-15 and irisin were up-regulated, implying both myokines could contribute to the regulation of anti-MM immunity. In the patient study, patients who met the WHO physical activity recommendations demonstrated significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) and progression-free survival in maintenance treatment (PFSm). Overall, appropriate aerobic exercises may benefit some MM patients, suggesting a potential for exercise as an adjunct in MM treatment.",

        "abstract": "Surgical resection is considered the most effective therapeutic method for pulmonary aspergilloma (PA), while the necessity of postoperative antifungal therapy remains controversial. Previous studies have several shortcomings such as retrospective design and inadequate follow-up durations. In this study, we aim to address these evidence gaps by evaluating the effects of postoperative antifungal therapy on both Aspergillus infection recurrence and drug-related side effects. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial. Eligible patients with PA who underwent surgical resection at our institute were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either a 3-month course of voriconazole (VRZ) tablet postoperatively or symptomatic treatment alone. Participants were evaluated for Aspergillus infection recurrence and drug-related side effects every 3 months for 2 years. Ultimately, 36 patients in the VRZ group and 14 patients in the control group were included in the analysis, with balanced baseline characteristics between groups. After a median follow-up of 27 months, no recurrence of Aspergillus infection was observed in either group. Symptomatic improvements (e.g., hemoptysis and white sputum) were comparable between groups. Although serum IgG level significantly increased by 2.22 g/L after VRZ treatment (p < 0.001), other parameters indicating immune activity (CD4<sup>+</sup>%, CD8<sup>+</sup>%, CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> ratio, IgA, IgM and Aspergillus-specific IgG) and pulmonary function showed no significant intergroup differences at the final follow-up. Regarding safety, VRZ intervention was associated with a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase level (20.9 ± 6.2 U/L to 26.5 ± 7.8 U/L, p = 0.023). Hypokalemia incidence was numerically higher in the VRZ group (21.4% vs. 0, p = 0.530), though not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrated that postoperative antifungal therapy did not reduce Aspergillus recurrence rate but posed potential safety risks. For immunocompetent patients undergoing complete resection without intraoperative fungal spillage, routine postoperative antifungal agents are not recommended.

        "abstract": "To clarify the association between daily sitting time and accelerated aging in women, and explored that systemic immune-inflammation index and creatinine together play an important mediating effect throughout the process. A total of 5578 women during 2007 to 2010 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was utilized in this study. Phenotypic age calculation, logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic spline model, and subgroup analysis were employed to investigate the association between daily sitting time and accelerated aging as well as its influencing factors. The threshold effect analysis identified 7 h as the inflection point. For every hour of sitting above the inflection point, the risk of accelerated aging will increase by 12.00%. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, compared to women who spent less than 4 h being sedentary during the day, the risk of accelerated aging increased 49.0%, 77%, 110% in the women spent 4 ~ 6 h (OR = 1.49, 95%CI 1.18,1.88, p = 0.0008), 6 ~ 8 h(OR = 1.77, 95%CI 1.36, 2.28, p < 0.001) and at least 8 h(OR = 2.10, 95%CI 1.70, 2.61, p < 0.001) respectively. Restricted cubic spline models validated nonlinear associations between the systemic immune-inflammation index, creatinine, and accelerated aging (p for nonlinearity < 0.001). Parallel mediation analysis found that although systemic immune-inflammation index and creatinine had significant mediating effects (p < 0.001) in the process of daily sitting time leading to accelerated aging, and they were a parallel double mediation effect. Prolonged sitting time is significantly associated with accelerated aging, systemic immune-inflammation index and creatinine levels play important mediating roles in this process.",

        "abstract": "Presymptomatic or asymptomatic immune system signals and subclinical physiological changes might provide a more objective measure of early viral upper respiratory tract infections (VRTIs) compared with symptom-based detection. We aimed to use multimodal wearable sensors, host-response biomarkers, and machine learning to predict systemic inflammation following controlled exposure to a live attenuated influenza vaccine, without relying on symptoms. WE SENSE study is a single-centre (McGill University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada), prospective controlled trial that recruited healthy adults aged 18-59 years who had not received or were not planning to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine or any other vaccine during the study period. We excluded participants with any infectious symptoms within 7 days before screening. We collected physiological and activity data (eg, heart rate, breathing rate, and acceleration) through continuous monitoring with a smart ring (Oura ring Gen 2, Oura Oy, Finland), smart watch (Biobeat watch, Biobeat Technologies, Israel), and smart shirt (Astroskin-Hexoskin shirt, Hexoskin, Canada) along with high temporal resolution systemic inflammatory biomarker mapping over 12 days (7 days before inoculation and 5 days after). We frequently tested participants both before and after inoculation via PCR for respiratory pathogens, and monitored them via apps for symptoms and free-text annotations. Machine learning algorithms predicting systemic inflammatory surges were trained (35 participants), validated (ten participants), and tested (ten participants) using gradient-boosting techniques. Between Dec 10, 2021, and Feb, 28, 2022, we enrolled 56 participants, of whom 55 had available data; all 55 participants continuously wore the Oura ring, 54 participants wore the Astroskin-Hexoskin shirt, and 50 wore the Biobeat watch. 27 (49%) participants were female and 28 (51%) were male; 31 (56%) participants were White, eight (15%) were Asian, four (7%) were Black, two (4%) were Latino or Hispanic, and ten (18%) did not disclose. We used model 2, which included handpicked features from the Oura ring night-time data, as the candidate model because it was built on the lowest number of features (more practical). This model predicted inflammatory surges with receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0·73 (95% CI 0·71-0·74) for real-time prediction and 0·89 (0·87-0·90) for a 24-h tolerance prediction window (24h-tol) using night-time data from the Oura ring. Incorporating both night-time and daytime data from the Astroskin-Hexoskin shirt yielded ROC-AUC values of 0·73 (0·71-0·75) for real-time and 0·91 (0·90-0·92) for 24h-tol along with improved precision (ie, specificity [0·83, 0·79-0·87] and F1 score [0·65, 0·58-0·71]). The model based on symptoms alone had lower performance, with ROC-AUC values of 0·66 (0·63-0·68) for real-time and 0·79 (0·77-0·82) for 24h-tol. Systemic inflammatory biomarkers coupled with physiological data from wearable biosensors provided rich and objective data from which to train machine learning algorithms to predict systemic inflammation from a low-grade influenza challenge. This approach outperformed symptom-based detection and has the potential to improve detection of VRTIs such as influenza and decrease time to detection, even among asymptomatic people.

This study aimed to examine the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of parents by vaccine literacy and hesitancy and to assess the relationship between attitudinal, behavioral, and experiential factors and parents' vaccine literacy and hesitancy. A cross-sectional survey was administered in 2022 to US adults aged ≥ 18 (N = 692) who self-identified as parents/guardians of children aged < 18. Parents were asked questions about their experiences assessing information on pediatric vaccinations, their information-seeking and decision-making practices, interactions with healthcare providers (HCPs) regarding pediatric vaccines, beliefs about vaccine efficacy and safety, trust in scientific and medical information from various sources, perceptions of the danger and severity of vaccine-preventable diseases, and the benefits and convenience of vaccination. High vaccine literacy was defined as being moderately or extremely familiar with the vaccines a child should receive. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as being somewhat or very hesitant, or not sure, about childhood immunizations (i.e., shots). An exploratory factor analysis reflected 7 discrete underlying variables describing self-reported behaviors, beliefs, and experiences regarding childhood vaccination. Vaccine literacy and hesitancy were associated with parents' gender, race/ethnicity, education level, and urbanicity. Factors associated with increased vaccine literacy were positive interactions with HCPs (OR 2.24, P < 0.001), active information-seeking behavior (OR 1.88, P < 0.001), positive beliefs about vaccines (OR 1.39, P = 0.001), and beliefs about vaccination requirements (OR 1.21, P = 0.041). Trouble understanding information from HCPs was associated with decreased vaccine literacy (OR 0.80, P = 0.025). Factors associated with decreased vaccine hesitancy were positive beliefs about vaccines (OR 0.41, P < 0.001), minimal concerns over childhood vaccines (OR 0.46, P < 0.001), and positive interactions with HCPs (OR 0.76, P = 0.002). Increased hesitancy was associated with negative beliefs about vaccines (OR 3.26, P < 0.001) and trouble understanding information from HCPs (OR 1.44, P < 0.001). Greater vaccine literacy levels and less vaccine hesitancy correlated with positive parental beliefs about vaccines and positive interactions with HCPs. Challenges in comprehending HCP-delivered information were correlated with lower literacy and greater hesitancy.",

This single-center, retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. It included data from 9,744 consecutive women-7,083 (72.7%) Turkish citizens and 2,661 (27.3%) migrants-who underwent singleton caesarean sections between March 2018 and March 2023. The primary outcome was the change in monthly utilization rates of neuraxial anaesthesia (NA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives included caesarean section urgency and neonatal outcomes. During the study period, there was an increasing trend in the number of caesarean sections performed using NA among Turkish citizens and migrants (relative ratio [RR] 1.003, P < 0.001 and RR 1.005, P < 0.01, respectively). Both groups showed a significant immediate increase in the usage rate of NA at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (RR 1.095, P < 0.001 and 1.134, P < 0.001, respectively). The introduction of vaccination had no effect on the use of NA (RR 0.970, P = 1.004, and RR 1.000, P = 0.99, respectively). The significant between-group difference in the pre-pandemic usage rate of NA diminished following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no significant between-group difference observed after vaccination (93.3% vs. 90.9%., P = 0.006, 98.4% vs. 97.1%, P = 0.0; 95.4% vs. 95.2%, P = 0.801, respectively). Category-1 caesarean section events increased throughout the study period (471(10.7%) before COVID-19, 321(17.0%) during the first year, and 700 (20.2%) after vaccination; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of composite adverse neonatal outcomes (stillbirths, Apgar 5-min score < 7) among the three time periods (89(2.0%), 41(2.2%), and 49(1.4%); P = 0.065). During the COVID-19 pandemic, our study revealed a continuation of the upward trend in the use of NA for caesarean sections.",

Using a population-based approach, we examined COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people living with and without HIV in Ontario, Canada. A retrospective population-based matched cohort study was conducted using provincial clinical and health administrative data from December 14, 2020 to August 31, 2022. Community-dwelling adults living with HIV aged ≥19 years were matched one-to-one with a person without a diagnosis of HIV based on age, sex, geography, and immigration status. To identify predictors of vaccine uptake, modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors accounting for geographical clustering was used. To estimate vaccine uptake comparing the HIV and non-HIV cohorts, conditional Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to estimate crude and adjusted risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Among 20,903 people living with HIV, most (85.4%) had received ≥2 COVID-19 vaccine doses, with 64.7% receiving a third dose and 24.3% receiving a fourth dose. Disparities in uptake of ≥3 doses by sex were observed (males vs females: 68.5% vs 50.9%). Predictors of receiving ≥3 doses among people living with HIV included older age, male sex, and receipt of a recent influenza vaccine. Men living with HIV were more likely to receive ≥3 doses compared with men living without HIV, whereas women living with HIV were less likely than women living without HIV to receive ≥3 doses. Uptake of the first two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was high among people living with HIV in Ontario, Canada, however, disparities in uptake of ≥3 doses remain, especially by sex. Continued monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine uptake is crucial to informing immunization programs, policies and guidelines for people living with HIV in Canada.",

We aimed to explore how GPs had implemented this health policy into practice. From 11 May to 22 June 2023, we distributed a self-administered online questionnaire to 3,284 GPs through the newsletter of the Danish Organisation of General Practitioners (PLO). Analyses included frequencies and statistical logistic regression analyses. A total of 55 GP responded. Those who were knowledgeable about the guidelines were significantly more likely to ask adults (OR = 4.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-7.9) and children (odds ratio (OR) = 4.7; 95% CI: 1.4-16.1) about vaccination status and infectious diseases (OR = 5.0; 95% CI: 3.6-19.3) as part of a general health assessment. GPs experienced language barriers and a lack of knowledge about refugee health as obstacles to implementing the guidelines. GPs also found that Ukrainian refugees had a high need for interpreters and lacked the competencies needed to navigate healthcare services. Lastly, GPs expressed that intersectoral cooperation and referral possibilities were lacking.

Pregnant individuals face higher risks of severe respiratory illness from seasonal influenza due to physiological changes in pregnancy. Seasonal influenza infection in pregnancy is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, which correspond to illness severity. Recognizing the pregnant population as a high-risk group, national and global public health agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, recommend influenza vaccination in pregnancy. Early testing with available commercial tests and prompt antiviral treatment are critical interventions to decreasing morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "Endocrine resistance is a major challenge in treating patients with ER+ /HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC) necessitating a switch from endocrine therapy to more toxic therapies. Mutations in ESR1 constitute a key mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy in ER+ /HER2- BC. Therapies that overcome endocrine resistance are needed. Palazestrant is a novel oral complete estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist (CERAN) and selective ER degrader (SERD) belonging to a new class of ER-targeting agents that completely blocks estrogen-induced transcriptional activity, regardless of ESR1 mutation status. This first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 dose-escalation/expansion study was designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of palazestrant in patients with ER+ /HER2- MBC with disease progression on prior treatment. Adults with ER+ /HER2‒ MBC who received ≥ 1 prior line of endocrine therapy for advanced disease and ≤ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease were eligible. Patients received once-daily oral palazestrant (30-300 mg) in 28-day cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity. This study enrolled 146 patients. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at doses up to 300 mg/day palazestrant. Confirmed partial responses were observed with 60 and 120 mg/day palazestrant. Both doses showed similar and tolerable safety profiles, favorable pharmacokinetics, and steady-state plasma concentrations above the predicted threshold for complete ER inhibition. Greater clinical benefit at palazestrant 120 mg/day (46%) versus 60 mg/day (19%) led to selection of 120 mg/day as RP2D and study expansion dose. At 120 mg/day, the median progression-free survival was 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.5-7.1) overall and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.8-NE) among patients with cancers with ESR1 mutations. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were grade 1-2. The most common TEAEs were nausea (62.8%), vomiting (29.1%), and fatigue (25.6%). The most common grade ≥ 3 TEAE was transient neutropenia (10.5%) managed by dose interruption and reduction. Palazestrant demonstrated a manageable safety profile, with antitumor activity observed in patients with heavily pretreated cancers with wild-type and ESR1-mutated BC. These data support the ongoing phase 3 study evaluating palazestrant in patients with ER+ /HER2 - MBC. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04505826 . Registered August 6, 2020.",

        "title": "Integrated proteomics and transcriptomics analysis reveals key regulatory genes between ER-positive/PR-positive and ER-positive/PR-negative breast cancer.",
        "abstract": "Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is characterized by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR), it is generally associated with less aggressive clinical features and more favorable prognostic outcomes, primarily due to the effectiveness of endocrine therapy. However, the loss of PR expression has been correlated with endocrine resistance and poorer prognosis. To date, there is limited research elucidating the underlying mechanisms distinguishing ER-positive/PR-positive from ER-positive/PR-negative breast cancer. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with these two subtypes and to propose recommendations for precision therapy. Fresh tumor tissues from ER + /PR + patients (n = 5) and ER + /PR- patients (n = 5) were subjected to proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Transcriptomic data were obtained from the TCGA database, encompassing 937 breast cancer patients divided into three subgroups: ER + /PR + (n = 627), ER + /PR- (n = 112), and ER-/PR- (n = 198). Clinical characteristics and prognostic data were collected to analyze disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) across the three subtypes. Differential expression data for both transcripts and proteins were extracted, and Cox regression along with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression were applied to identify key regulatory genes. A risk scoring formula was employed to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curves, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), immune cell infiltration analysis, and OncoPredict drug sensitivity predictions were conducted to provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and clinical treatment strategies for this patient cohort. The accuracy of this model was further validated using external GEO datasets (GSE21653, GSE20685, and GSE42568). Additionally, we collected data from 97 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our center between January 2021 and December 2023, assessing their response to chemotherapy using the Miller-Payne score. In the TCGA database, patients with ER + /PR- breast cancer exhibited poorer 5-year DSS and OS compared to those with ER + /PR + status (DSS: P = 0.038; OS: P = 0.052), which was similar to those with ER-/PR- status (DSS: P = 0.47; OS: P = 0.77). 186 differentially expressed proteins (110 up-regulated and 76 down-regulated) were identified based on proteomic analysis. After COX regression and Lasso regression, five key differential genes with prognostic and diagnostic value of ER + /PR + and ER + /PR- patients were finally included, that is HPN, FSCN1, FGD3, LRIG1, and TBC1D7. HPN, FSCN1 and FGD3 can be regarded as a tumor suppressor gene. And LRIG1, and TBC1D7 can be regarded as a risk-associated gene. Patients with high-risk scores had significantly lower survival probabilities compared to those with low-risk scores. Additionally, there were differences in functional pathway enrichment analysis (galactose_metabolism, glycolysis_gluconeogenesis, jak_stat_signaling_pathway, pentose_phosphate_pathway, et al.) and immune cell infiltration (CD8 T cell, Macrophages M1, et al.) between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that the low-risk patients may be more sensitive to endocrine drug like fulvestrant, while high-risk patients may be more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine. Of the 97 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our center, the proportion of patients achieving Miller-Payne (MP) score 4 and 5 was higher in ER + /PR- patients (44%) compared to ER + /PR + patients (9.8%). We confirmed that ER + /PR- breast cancer patients exhibited worse survival compared with ER + /PR + patients. Five key regulatory genes were identified and potential mechanisms and biological pathways were discovered, our prediction of drug sensitivity offers new insights for developing precise pharmacological treatment strategies for ER + /PR- breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has emerged as the first-line standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, obvious survival benefits in patients with peritoneal metastatic gastric cancer remain elusive. The combination of anti-angiogenic agents and immunotherapy has shown synergistic effects. However, currently there are no relevant reports on the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic agents and chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer peritoneal metastatic. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective clinical study in four independent healthcare facilities, enrolling advanced gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastatic who received immunotherapy in combination with anti-angiogenic agents and chemotherapy between January 2020 and March 2023. All patients were treated with triple combination regimen for at least two and up to eight cycles before being adjusted for immunotherapy and targeted therapy. This study observed overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF), as well as an exploratory analysis of the impact of ascites and peritoneal metastases on the prognosis of all patients. This study enrolled 30 eligible patients in the final analysis cohort. The median TTF and OS were 7.03 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.17-9.89] and 13.33 months (95% CI: 10.96-15.71), respectively. The 6-month and 12-month OS rates were 83.0% and 53.0%, respectively. The objective response rate (ORR) was 58.3%, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 83.3% in 12 patients who were evaluated for response with at least one measurable lesion. Exploratory subgroup analysis revealed that the median TTF and OS in the subgroup without ascites were significantly better than those in the subgroup with ascites, with a median TTF of 9.03 vs. 4.63 months (χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.579, P = 0.003), and median OS of 17.83 vs. 11.87 months (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.155, P = 0.013). Conversely, the extent of peritoneal metastasis had little effect on TTF and OS. The common adverse reactions were leukopenia (46.67%), neutropenia (43.33%), fatigue (36.67%), anemia (36.67%), decreased appetite (36.67%), thrombocytopenia (33.33%), and hypertension (33.33%). No new safety signals were observed. The combination of immunotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, and chemotherapy demonstrated therapeutic potential with a manageable safety profile in patients with peritoneal metastatic gastric cancer. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the inherent limitations of retrospective analyses and need to be validated through prospective randomized controlled trials to establish clinical efficacy and optimize patient selection criteria.",

        "abstract": "To improve the prediction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this study categorized the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) into two types: immune-activated (IA), characterized by a high CD8 + score and high PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS), and non-immune-activated (NIA), encompassing all other conditions. We aimed to develop an MRI-based radiomics model to predict TIME types and validate its predictive capability for ICIs efficacy in HCC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The study included 200 HCC patients who underwent preoperative/pretreatment multiparametric contrast-enhanced MRI (Cohort 1: 168 HCC patients with hepatectomy from two centres; Cohort 2: 42 advanced HCC patients on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy). In Cohort 1, after feature selection, clinical, intratumoral radiomics, peritumoral radiomics, combined radiomics, and clinical-radiomics models were established using machine learning algorithms. In cohort 2, the clinical-radiomics model's predictive ability for ICIs efficacy was assessed. In Cohort 1, the AUC values for intratumoral, peritumoral, and combined radiomics models were 0.825, 0.809, and 0.868, respectively, in the internal validation set, and 0.73, 0.759, and 0.822 in the external validation set; the clinical-radiomics model incorporating neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, tumor size, and combined radiomics score achieved an AUC of 0.887 in the internal validation set, outperforming clinical model (P = 0.049), and an AUC of 0.837 in the external validation set. In cohort 2, the clinical-radiomics model stratified patients into low- and high-score groups, demonstrating a significant difference in objective response rate (p = 0.003) and progression-free survival (p = 0.031). The clinical-radiomics model is effective in predicting TIME types and efficacy of ICIs in HCC, potentially aiding in treatment decision-making.",

        "abstract": "In the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia, First Nations people with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are infected with a unique sub-genotype, C4, which contains mutations linked to progressive fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This cohort study aimed to investigate disease progression in C4 sub-genotype infection and estimate how many untreated individuals may benefit from antiviral therapy with broadening treatment indications. Included individuals were part of Hep B PAST, a co-designed program to improve the cascade of care for people living with CHB in the NT. Disease phase and cirrhotic status were determined algorithmically using clinical and laboratory data at two time points. Loss of HBV antigens was assessed longitudinally. Treatment need was assessed cross-sectionally in the cohort at study completion. Key outcomes were estimated rates of HBsAg/HBeAg loss in sub-genotype C4 infection and quantification of how many untreated individuals qualify for therapy under current Australian and expanded global treatment guidelines. HBsAg and HBeAg loss occurred at a rate of 1·04 and 8·06 events/100 person-years respectively (7342·6 and 545·6 years follow up). 783 people living with CHB were included (40% female, median age 48 years). Of these, 16% had cirrhosis (an additional 6% having FibroScan > 7 kPa, meaning 22% had cirrhosis or significant fibrosis) and 25% were prescribed antivirals. Only 6·7% of untreated individuals were treatment eligible under current guidelines. Using the 2024 World Health Organisation guidelines, this increased to 50% due mostly to fibrosis and population prevalence of diabetes. Despite advanced liver disease in people living with CHB in the NT, rates of antigen loss in sub-genotype C4 hepatitis B infection are similar to other genotypes. Further work is needed to understand drivers of cirrhosis and significant fibrosis in this population.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, driven by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), has transformed natural language processing. Prompt engineering plays a key role in guiding model outputs effectively. Our primary objective was to explore the possibilities and limitations of a custom GPT, developed via prompt engineering, as a patient education tool, which delivers publicly available information through a user-friendly design that facilitates more effective access to cervical cancer screening knowledge. The system was developed using the OpenAI GPT-4 model and Python programming language, with the interface built on Streamlit for cloud-based accessibility and testing. It initially presented questions to testers for preliminary assessment. For cervical cancer-related information, we referenced medical guidelines. Iterative testing optimized the prompts for quality and relevance; techniques like context provision, question chaining, and prompt-based constraints were used. Human-in-the-loop and two independent medical doctor evaluations were employed. Additionally, system performance metrics were measured. The web application was tested 115 times over a three-week period in 2024, with 87 female (76%) and 28 male (24%) participants. A total of 112 users completed the user experience questionnaire. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between age and perceived personalization (p = 0.047) and between gender and system customization (p = 0.037). Younger participants reported higher engagement, though not significantly. Females valued guidance on screening schedules and early detection, while males highlighted the usefulness of information regarding HPV vaccination and its role in preventing HPV-related cancers. Independent evaluations by medical doctors demonstrated consistent assessments of the system's responses in terms of accuracy, clarity, and usefulness. While the system demonstrates potential to enhance public health awareness and promote preventive behaviors, encouraging individuals to seek information on cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, its conversational capabilities remain constrained by the inherent limitations of current language model technology. Although custom GPTs can not substitute a healthcare consultations, these tools can streamline workflows, expedite information access, and support personalized care. Further research should focus on conducting well-designed randomized controlled trials to establish definitive conclusions regarding its impact and reliability. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "Toxoplasmosis could potentially be transmitted via blood transfusions from asymptomatic donors to patients with beta-thalassemia major (BTM) who regularly receive transfusions. Nevertheless, screening for toxoplasmosis prior to blood donation has not been implemented, representing a significant gap in transfusion safety protocols. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of anti-<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> antibodies in BTM patients undergoing blood transfusion. The current case-control study was conducted among 270 patients and 90 controls in Southeastern Iran, from September to December 2024. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to detect anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgG and IgM antibodies in serum samples. A binomial logistic regression model was employed to analyze the association between toxoplasmosis and its determinants. The seropositivity rate for anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgG antibodies was 9.3% (25/270) in the patients and 8.9% (8/90) in the controls. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.45–2.41; <i>p</i> = 0.916). Anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgM antibodies were detected in the patients with a seropositivity rate of 1.5% (4/270). In the controls, the seropositivity rate for anti-<i>T. gondii</i> IgM antibodies was 0.0% (0/90). None of the participants’ characteristics were found to be associated with the infection. Anti-<i>T. gondii</i> antibodies were detected at relatively low seroprevalence rates in both patients and controls. The presence of toxoplasmosis in these patients highlights the critical need for appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of infection, as the population appears to be mostly non-immune. It is essential to implement routine screening of blood for specific antibodies against <i>T. gondii</i> before transfusions in these patients to mitigate the risk of infection. This is the first study assessing the seroprevalence of <i>T. gondii</i> antibodies among patients with BTM in Southeastern Iran.

All patients diagnosed with advanced HCC who received systemic therapy with atezolizumab bevacizumab as the first- or second-line therapy were included in the study. Data were collected retrospectively from two comprehensive cancer centres between September 2020 and May 2024 by accessing the medical records. As per the IMBrave 150 trial, patients were given atezolizumab 1200 mg and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks. Demographic details, adverse events, and radiological data were collected. We included one hundred and four patients with a median age of 67 years. Majority of the patients had a compensated cirrhosis (n = 77; 74%), while Child Pugh class B cirrhosis was observed in 19 patients (18%), and class C cirrhosis in 3 patients (3%). The median OS was 14.8 (95% CI; 6.8 - 22.9) months and median PFS in the whole cohort was 6.2 months (95% CI; 2.5 - 9.9) monthsGlobally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks sixth in incidence and third among cancer-related dea. The real-world OS and PFS rates were lower than those of the IMBrave trial, most likely because 43% of our patients did not meet the inclusion criteria. We conclude that the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is a safe and effective option for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients with manageable toxicities.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) load and the survival or safety of immunotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains ambiguous. A multicenter study involving patients with advanced HCC who are treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and entecavir from December 2019 to 2023 was conducted. Patients were categorized based on HBV-DNA levels to evaluate correlations with progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. A total of 162 patients participated in the study. Among HCC patients with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), median PFS was not significantly better for patients with HBV-DNA levels ≤ 2000 IU/ml compared to levels > 2000 IU/ml (4.60 months vs. 3.90 months, p = 0.17). Similarly, median OS did not differ between the two groups (10.53 months vs. 8.17 months, p = 0.14). Patients with undetectable baseline HBV-DNA had better PFS than those detectable (5.03 months vs. 3.70 months, p = 0.03), but there was no significant difference in OS (11.80 months vs. 8.00 months, p = 0.10). Furthermore, the incidence of hepatic impairment was not correlated with the baseline HBV - DNA load (6.1% vs. 7.9%, p > 0.05). The status of HBV DNA exerts an influence on the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing immunotherapy, and this influence is independent of the viral load. HCC patients with undetectable HBV DNA tend to have more favorable short - term survival outcomes. For patients who have received effective antiviral therapy, elevated levels of HBV DNA should not be used as an exclusion criterion for immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Hypothermia, defined as a core body temperature below 35 °C, is a common yet underappreciated complication among trauma patients. It leads to coagulopathy, impaired immune response, and higher morbidity, with mortality rates rising by 25% after its onset among severely injured trauma patients. This study sought to determine the factors associated with hypothermia and its response to resuscitation among major trauma patients at St. Francis Hospital Nsambya. This was a prospective observational study among 99 adult major trauma patients admitted to the emergency department at St. Francis Hospital Nsambya between November 2022 and April 2023. Patients were consecutively enrolled upon arrival and their temperatures were taken using the Braun infrared tympanic thermometer. A pretested data abstraction tool collected information on demographics, injury characteristics, and pre-admission events. The primary outcome was the prevalence of hypothermia. Data analysis was conducted using STATA Version 17.0, employing multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with hypothermia. A total of 99 trauma patients were included in the study, of which 39(39%) were hypothermic on hospital arrival. The majority were males, 78(78.8%) aged 26 to 45 years, 49(49.5%) (range: 27-52). Blunt trauma was the most common mechanism of injury 9(86.9%), followed by penetrating injuries 9(9.1%). Hypothermia was associated with age (Adjusted Odds Ratios [AOR]: 19.94, CI: 1.6-248.65, p = 0.02), body region injured (AOR = 6.28, CI: 1.6-27.75, p = 0.015), ambient temperature (AOR = 0.09, CI: 0.01-0.6, p = 0.012), and warm clothing (AOR = 0.05, CI: 0.01-0.39, p = 0.004). After 30 min of resuscitation, most patients had transitioned from a hypothermic state to a normothermic state, according to initial temperature measurements. This resuscitation involved keeping the patients warm using blankets and external warming devices and administering heated intravenous fluids. Hypothermia affected 39% of major trauma patients, with advanced age and injured regions as key associations. Routine temperature monitoring, especially for older patients and those with extremity injuries, is essential. Hospitals should implement standardized hypothermia prevention protocols, ensure adequate warming equipment, and train healthcare providers in early detection and management. Further research is needed to optimize warming techniques and resuscitation strategies in trauma care.",

Immunotherapy has shown promising outcomes and greatly extended survival in individuals with advanced stomach cancer. To improve the immunotherapy response in patients with GC, it is necessary to discover new molecular targets. The associations among G protein subunit gamma transducin 1(GNGT1) expression, clinicopathological features, and prognosis were assessed via the UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier databases. The CIBERSORT algorithm in R software and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis(ssGSEA) were used to analyse the proportions of infiltrating immune cells in the high-expression group and the low-expression group.GNGT1 expression was substantially greater in GC tissues than in normal tissues, and patients with GC who had high GNGT1 expression had worse clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes. Immunohistochemistry(IHC) experiments on stomach adenocarcinoma(STAD) samples confirmed the aberrant expression of GNGT1 and its association with a poor prognosis. Subsequent investigations revealed substantial negative correlations between GNGT1 and tumour mutational burden(TMB), microsatellite instability(MSI), immune cell infiltration, immune cell gene marker expression and immunological checkpoint expression in patients with STAD.GNGT1 is a reliable biomarker in patients with GC that also has an immunomodulatory function in this disease and may accelerate GC development by suppressing the infiltration of T cells, dendritic cells, M1 macrophages and B cells.",

        "abstract": "In 2022, one year after the extension of HPV vaccination to adolescent boys in France, we conducted a qualitative study to explore how French general practitioners (GPs) approach gender-neutral vaccination. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were carried out with private GPs, and a thematic analysis was performed. Thematic saturation was reached at the twelfth interview. Overall, GPs expressed strong support for gender-neutral vaccination, perceiving it as a way to reduce gender-based discrimination and stigmatization. However, important differences emerged in their practices. Recommendations to girls consistently emphasized individual protection against cervical cancer (n = 15), while recommendations to boys (10 out of 15) more often focused on protecting future female partners or referenced risks for men who have sex with men (MSM), rather than emphasizing male-specific cancer risks. Among these GPs, six reported difficulties recommending HPV vaccination to boys, directly linked to the types of arguments they felt were required. Half conveyed inaccurate information, often associating HPV infection exclusively with MSM. These findings highlight gaps in the French approach relative to international guidelines and suggest the influence of gender bias in recommendation practices. Strengthening gender-awareness training and public health messaging may help support more equitable and effective HPV vaccination strategies.",

Their importance is amplified in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, who are more susceptible to acute infections such as influenza, pneumococcus, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pertussis, and herpes zoster. These individuals face an increased risk of severe infections, exacerbations, hospitalizations, and mortality. Vaccination against influenza, pneumococcus, and SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduces these adverse outcomes. Evidence also supports the use of vaccines against RSV, pertussis, and herpes zoster in this population. In specific cases, tailored immunization strategies are warranted. The Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) strongly advocates for systematic vaccination in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. This document provides clear and up-to-date recommendations based on the available evidence to support clinical practice and standardize vaccination strategies.

        "abstract": "COVID-19 continues to cause substantial health burden, particularly among vulnerable populations. Vaccines remain a vital tool in preventing severe disease outcomes. As the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve; therefore, updates may be needed to closely match COVID-19 vaccine composition to predominant circulating lineages to confer optimal protection. In this cohort from a substudy of an ongoing phase 2/3 trial, 102 healthy adults (18‒55 and > 55 years of age, n = 51 each) were vaccinated with Omicron KP.2-adapted BNT162b2. Serum neutralizing titers against Omicron KP.2, JN.1, and KP.3 were assessed before and through 1 month after vaccination. Immunogenicity in KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 recipients was compared with participants who received JN.1-adapted BNT162b2 in an earlier cohort of this substudy. Local reactions and systemic events through 7 days and adverse events (AEs) through 1 month are reported. One month after vaccination, KP.2-adapted BNT162b2-elicited neutralizing titers against Omicron KP.2, JN.1, and KP.3 were numerically higher than those induced by JN.1-adapted BNT162b2. Geometric mean fold rises from before to 1 month after vaccination were numerically higher in those who received KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 compared with those who received JN.1-adapted BNT162b2 (9.4 vs. 6.8 for KP.2; 7.8 vs. 5.7 for JN.1; 9.2 vs. 7.0 for KP.3). Percentages of participants with seroresponses were numerically higher against KP.2 after KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 than JN.1-adapted BNT162b2 (75% vs. 65%) and similar against JN.1 and KP.3 for both vaccines (69% vs. 67% for JN.1; 74% vs. 73% for KP.3). Local reactions and systemic events were all mild to moderate in severity, AEs were infrequent, and no serious AEs or AEs leading to withdrawal were reported. Collectively, these immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability data support administration of KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 to protect against contemporaneous circulating lineages. NCT05997290.",

        "abstract": "Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell-treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5-21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.",

A total of 44 patients with MG were enrolled in the study, divided into two groups based on the treatment they received: the MG-TX group (14 MG patients who underwent thymectomy) and the control group (30 MG patients who received drug treatment alone). Patients were assessed at baseline (0 months), 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. The levels of T lymphocytes subtypes (CD3+, CD4+, CD8 + T cells, and the CD4+/CD8 + ratio), immunoglobulins and complements levels (IgG, IgM, IgA, C3 and C4), and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF-α) were measured and compared between the two groups. At baseline, both the MG-TX and control groups exhibited similar levels of immune markers. Following thymectomy, there was a significant decrease in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8 + T cell levels at 1 month, which remained stable throughout the study period. At 12 months, the CD4 + levels in the MG-TX group were significantly lower than in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Additionally, the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower in the MG-TX group at both 6 months and 12 months (<i>P</i> < 0.01 and <i>P</i> < 0.001, respectively). No significant changes in immunoglobulin and complement levels were observed in either group throughout the study. For cytokines, IL-2, IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF-α levels decreased significantly at 1-month post-treatment (<i>P</i> < 0.001). At 3 months, INF-γ levels in the MG-TX group remained higher than in the control group (<i>P</i> < 0.001), but stabilized by 6 months and 12 months. IL-4 levels significantly increased at 1 month post-treatment (<i>P</i> < 0.001), but at 12 months, the control group had higher IL-4 levels than the MG-TX group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Thymectomy in MG patients results in a long-term decrease in T lymphocyte levels and a shift in the CD4/CD8 ratio. The procedure also induces transient changes in cytokine levels, which stabilize after 3 months. These findings suggest that thymectomy has a lasting impact on cellular immunity and cytokine secretion, with potential implications for immune system function and the risk of infections in MG patients.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have reported that women with epilepsy who are taking antiseizure medications have an increased risk of Neural Tube Defects. Periconceptual folic acid supplementation potentially prevents two-thirds of cases. International guidelines recommend that women at increased risk of a pregnancy complicated by a Neural Tube Defect who could become pregnant should start high-dose (5 mg daily) oral folic acid at least three months before conceiving. The purpose of the study was to examine supplementation in women taking antiseizure medications who delivered a baby weighing >499 g during the ten years 2013-2022 in a large maternity hospital. The hospital's computerized database contains standardized maternal clinical and sociodemographic details which were entered at the first antenatal visit in the obstetric records. The data on all women with epilepsy taking antiseizure medications was anonymized before coding. In the ten years, 75,869 women delivered a baby weighing >499 g. Of the deliveries, 632 (0.83%) were to women with epilepsy. Of these, 250 (0.33%) were taking antiseizure medications when they presented for antenatal care. The most frequently prescribed medications were lamotrigine <i>n</i> = 98 (33.8%) and levetiracetam <i>n</i> = 89 (30.7%). Monotherapy was prescribed in 211 (84.4%) women and polytherapy in 39 (15.6%). Three (1.2%) women took no folic acid before or after conception and 59 (23.6%) only took it after conception. Of the 188 (75.2%) who took folic acid before conception, 164 (65.6%) took high-dose 5 mg and 24 (9.6%) took low-dose 0.4 mg. No maternal characteristics were associated with taking high-dose folic acid before conception. Compliance with the national guidelines in the 16 women taking valproate was 30.8% compared with 76.0% for the other 234 women taking medications (<i>p</i> < 0.03). Compliance in the 211 women receiving monotherapy was 72.5% compared with 25.6% in the 39 women receiving polytherapy (<i>p</i> < 0.03). Two-thirds of women taking antiseizure medications complied with national guidelines on high-dose periconceptual folic acid supplementation. A particular concern is the suboptimal compliance in women prescribed valproate and polytherapy, which are two cohorts at higher risk of a neural tube defect. These findings need to be communicated to women with epilepsy in their reproductive years and their doctors. Of 75,869 women delivered over 10 years, 250 (0.33%) were on medications for epilepsy at presentation34.4% of women taking medications did not start high dose folic acid before conception23.6% of women did not start folic acid until after conceptionCompliance with recommendations was lowest in women prescribed valproate or polytherapyNo maternal characteristics were identified which were associated with suboptimal compliance.",

Pubmed, EMBASE and MEDLINE searches were performed from inception till 25 May 2025 for case reports/series of the use of JAK inhibitors to treat checkpoint inhibitor induced immune adverse events. Five EMA licenced JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baritinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib and ruxolitinib) were included in addition to peficitinib. The 11 FDA approved checkpoint inhibitors were included. Published Case reports, case series and cohort data included 104 patient's. Most patients received tofacitinib (82%). Pembrolizumab monotherapy represented the most common immune checkpoint inhibitor. The commonest cancers were Lung (20%), followed by gastric (17%) and metastatic melanoma (16%). The indication for JAK inhibitor therapy for irAE's was predominantly myocarditis (70%), followed by myositis (33%) and hepatitis (24%). Tumour progression was observed in 38% of patients, with 14% remaining in remission. Across all patients, 4% died due to progression of their cancer.

        "abstract": "<b>Background.</b> Liver cancer is the only cancer in Australia with rising incidence and mortality rates, despite the potential for early detection through surveillance of high-risk individuals. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of primary liver cancer, has curative treatment options available if detected early. Six-monthly HCC surveillance is recommended for people with liver cirrhosis and was proposed for inclusion in the 2023 Cancer Council Australia <i>Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance for People at High Risk in Australia</i>. To evaluate the proposed 2023 guideline recommendation, we developed Policy1-Liver, a novel mathematical model of liver disease, HCC, and surveillance. We then assessed the health and economic implications of 6-monthly HCC surveillance in Australia via ultrasound, with or without alpha-fetoprotein. <b>Methods.</b> Policy1-Liver was calibrated to existing data sources on liver disease, HCC, and health care costs in Australia. We assessed the impact of 6-monthly routine HCC surveillance with ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing as well as a range of other sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios such as varying surveillance adherence and intervals to assess potential future modifications to surveillance. <b>Results.</b> We estimated that 6-monthly HCC surveillance, with or without alpha-fetoprotein, can increase early-stage diagnoses to up to 81% and reduce HCC mortality by 22% in people with cirrhosis. We estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,423 per quality-adjusted life-year for 6-monthly surveillance with ultrasound alone compared with no surveillance. <b>Conclusions.</b> These findings support guideline-recommended 6-monthly HCC surveillance with ultrasound, affirming its health benefits and cost-effectiveness, and demonstrate the potential to improve cost-effectiveness by refining surveillance intervals and improving early-stage HCC survival. Supporting implementation of the surveillance guidelines will play a key role in improving HCC mortality rates in Australia. Routine surveillance can improve the likelihood of early-stage detection of liver cancer, improving survival.Our modeling found that routine HCC surveillance with ultrasound would be cost-effective for people with liver cirrhosis in Australia.These findings can inform guidelines and investment in liver cancer control for high-risk patients.",

        "abstract": "Vitiligo is the most common depigmentation disorder affecting around 1% of the population worldwide. Currently, no national or international registry for patients with vitiligo exists. Individual dermatologists maintain a descriptive database of such patients, which involves patients in one centre. In addition, such single centre registries do not aim to establish short- and long-term safety (pharmacovigilance) and effectiveness of vitiligo therapies. As an initial step for the development of a national UK registry for vitiligo patients, development of a pilot multi-centred registry in the UK is needed. This pilot study is being developed in collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD). VIRTUAL-UK (VItiligo RegisTry for adUlts And children) assesses treatment effectiveness and safety as well as treatment impact on quality of life in children and adults with vitiligo, who receive phototherapy, novel topical and/or systemic immuno-modulatory therapies. Such a registry will ultimately inform treatment guidelines, provide pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic research data, help answer questions on skin cancer risk for vitiligo patients who receive prolonged phototherapy courses, especially regarding high cumulative exposures in children with less deeply pigmented skin, and help to identify those patients likely to experience rapid disease progression, ultimately improving and personalising patient care. With novel topical and oral immunomodulatory therapies having just entering vitiligo clinical practice, the timing is ideal to harness the high-quality data collection offered by the UK NHS.",

        "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the most common malignant tumors, with gradual increase in its annual morbidity and mortality. But most cases are diagnosed in the late stage. For stage II-III cancer, clinical guidelines recommend surgery following neoadjuvant radiation therapy at ≥6 weeks after the last radiotherapy is completed. However, radiotherapy may impair intestinal mucosal barrier function, especially the biological and immune barriers, accompanied by perioperative complications. This study was conducted to investigate the changes, repair patterns, and potential mechanisms in patients after radiotherapy. This study detected inflammatory factors in postoperative intestinal mucosal tissue and serum, as well as metabolites in saliva samples, and collected hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained pathological images in CRC patients who had received and did not receive radiotherapy. The results showed that after radiotherapy, there were significantly impaired intestinal mucosal tissue structure; obviously elevated inflammatory factors in intestinal mucosal tissue and blood; as well as upregulation/downregulation of metabolites in saliva samples. In conclusion, findings in this study may provide potential reference for predicting the recovery of intestinal mucosa and selecting the optimal timing for surgery after radiotherapy. In addition, this study will benefit the understanding and reduction of perioperative complications caused by intestinal barrier damage.",

        "title": "Maternal Vaccination as an Integral Part of Life-Course Immunization: A Scoping Review of Uptake, Barriers, Facilitators, and Vaccine Hesitancy for Antenatal Vaccination in Ireland.",
        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Maternal vaccination is a critical primary preventive approach and an integral part of life-course immunization strategy, influencing the infection-associated morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, foetuses, and young infants. Despite clear guidelines for the administration of vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap), influenza, and COVID-19 during pregnancy, maternal vaccination rates remain suboptimal in Ireland as per the National Immunisation Office of the Health Service Executive (HSE). <b>Aim:</b> This review explores the prevailing status, uptake factors, and maternal immunization-specific vaccine hesitancy in Ireland. <b>Method</b>: A scoping review was conducted, searching nine electronic databases, including the Irish health research repository Lenus. The search strategy utilised a Population-Concept-Context framework (pregnant women-vaccine uptake/hesitancy-Ireland). Key factors identified and categorised according to the 5A framework: access, affordability, awareness, acceptance, and activation. <b>Results</b>: Searches yielded 2457 articles, and 12 eligible studies were included for review. Influencing factors were identified in each of the 5A dimensions, with the majority relating to acceptance and awareness. Positively associated factors included healthcare provider (HCP) recommendation and knowledge of vaccine safety. Potential antenatal barriers were maternal lack of knowledge of vaccine-preventable illness severity, infection risks, and vaccine safety concerns. A pregnant woman's primary motivation for antenatal immunization was protection of her infant; however, the reluctance of HCPs to prescribe all recommended antenatal vaccines, inadequate immunization-specific discussion during antenatal consultations, and suboptimal knowledge of pregnancy-specific vaccine safety hampered potential positive influences. The Irish national immunization policy was a facilitator of affordability. Activation can be achieved through public health awareness campaigns and interdisciplinary promotion of maternal vaccination uptake. <b>Conclusions</b>: Maternal vaccination uptake in Ireland remains suboptimal, and a coordinated, targeted approach updating HCP recommendations, enhancing maternal awareness, and highlighting vaccine safety in pregnancy would be required to meet the life-course immunization goals recommended by WHO. By adopting a life-course immunization approach for healthy living, with maternal vaccination as the pivotal central point, vaccination programmes could close immunity gaps at various life stages.",

        "title": "Seronegative Sicca Syndrome: Diagnostic Considerations and Management Strategies.",
        "abstract": "Seronegative sicca syndrome encompasses patients who present with xerostomia and/or keratoconjunctivitis sicca but lack anti-SSA/SSB antibodies and do not fulfill current classification criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Despite symptom overlap with pSS, these individuals remain diagnostically and therapeutically unclassified. This review studies the clinical, immunological, and pathological spectrum of seronegative sicca, highlighting its heterogeneity and the limitations of antibody-centric diagnostic frameworks. Histopathologic findings in some seronegative patients-including focal lymphocytic sialadenitis-mirror those seen in pSS, suggesting underlying immune-mediated glandular damage. In others, nonspecific or normal biopsy findings suggest non-immune mechanisms. New evidence of immune activity, such as elevated cytokines (BAFF, IFN-α), and novel autoantibodies (SP-1, CA-VI), further supports the concept of subclinical autoimmunity in a subset of these patients. Clinically, they often face significant burden, including dryness, fatigue, and pain, yet remain excluded from most research cohorts, therapeutic trials, and clinical guidelines. Their management is often individualized, relying on symptomatic therapies rather than immunomodulatory agents. The lack of validated diagnostic criteria and prognostic markers compounds the uncertainty surrounding disease evolution, as some patients may later seroconvert or develop systemic features. To address these gaps, a paradigm shift is needed-one that embraces the spectrum of sicca syndromes, incorporates advanced immunophenotyping, and allows inclusion of seronegative patients in research and care algorithms.",

        "title": "Treating IgA Nephropathy: Looking at the Future Without Forgetting the Past.",
        "abstract": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is an inflammatory glomerular disease caused by the production of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1), which induces the formation of autoantibodies and IgA immune complexes (IgAICs) that are ultimately deposited in the mesangium. This event triggers mesangial cell proliferation, cytokine release and complement activation, and both glomerular and interstitial damage, eventually leading to kidney function decline. Persisting proteinuria is the most relevant marker of disease progression. Systemic corticosteroids (CSs), a powerful anti-inflammatory approach, have shown kidney protective effects in early trials involving patients with IgAN at risk of progression with persistent proteinuria. However, later studies raised concerns regarding severe adverse events associated with high doses of methylprednisolone and questioned the long-term benefits. As a result, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommended limiting CS therapy to selected patients who accepted the high risk of adverse events. The treatment landscape shifted when reduced doses of methylprednisolone, combined with Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis, demonstrated similar kidney protection compared to full methylprednisolone doses with fewer adverse events. An innovative approach involves a targeted budesonide formulation acting on Peyer's patches, the main site of Gd-IgA1 production. This treatment showed benefits comparable to systemic CSs, with valuable limitations of adverse events. Several new drugs targeting key pathogenetic events of IgAN are under investigation, with promising results published in recent months. These new therapies target B cell activation (and subsequent Gd-IgA1 production), the complement cascade triggered by IgAIC deposition and the endothelin system, a key amplifier of kidney damage that contributes to the chronicity of IgAN.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Postnatal immunisation is critical for maternal and child health, particularly in low-income countries. Despite international efforts, maternal awareness and access to care remain limited. Understanding the drivers behind postnatal immunisation services is critical for improving neonatal and maternal healthcare interventions. <b>Methods:</b> A tertiary healthcare facility's postpartum mothers who were seeking immunisation services participated in a prospective cross-sectional electronic survey. Convenience sampling was used to select respondents, who then answered a structured electronic questionnaire intended to obtain information on immunisation practices. To evaluate important trends and correlations, data was analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. A factor analysis was performed using the principal component analysis method, eigenvalue criteria, communalities, and confirmatory factor analysis. The study adhered to the STROBE guidelines. <b>Results:</b> We found that postnatal mothers' good immunisation practices were influenced by their adherence to immunisation schedules (% variance: 56.407; Eigenvalue: 7.33), and significant satisfaction with communication (% variance: 8.338; Eigenvalue: 1.084); giving a cumulative variance explained of 64.745% of the total variance of variables under study. However, suboptimal practices include limited resource availability, poor record maintenance, insufficient support for side effects, a lack of support from healthcare providers, and a decline in immunisation recommendations, all of which had Eigenvalue <1 and insignificant percentage of variance contribution to the total variance explained. We developed a two-factor model of postnatal immunisation practices, focusing on adherence and effective communication. The model showed high loadings and adequate fit indices (χ<sup>2</sup>(34) = 91.333, <i>p</i> < 0.001; CFI = 0.945; TLI = 0.927; RMSEA = 0.071; SRMR = 0.042), good evidence of internal consistency (<i>α</i> = 0.823-0.877), and composite reliability (<i>ω</i> = 0.832-0.877). <b>Conclusions:</b> The study recommends a comprehensive approach to increasing newborn vaccine coverage, which includes health education, improved service delivery, and culturally sensitive communication strategies. Future research should focus on digital health interventions, community-based initiatives, and policy-driven postnatal care.",

To develop consensus statements derived from evidence and expert opinion on management of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, an expert panel was convened by European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. The expert panel developed a list of questions which are of general interest for clinicians and readers with backgrounds in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. Six questions were selected. For each question, systematic literature searches were undertaken. We considered most study types, including clinical trials, observational studies with or without a control group, systematic reviews, case series, and case reports. Detailed inclusion criteria were defined for each research question using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome format.

        "abstract": "The proportion of the elderly population in India is expected to double by the year 2050. Number of deaths because of lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) caused by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> are substantial in adults aged >70 years. Pneumococcal diseases are vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Vaccination is safe, effective, and economical protection against infections. However, adult vaccination in India is uncommon. One way to increase it would be to educate the adults accompanying their family to vaccination visits, and improve the adult vaccination rates. In this cross-sectional study, we intend to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of pediatricians to understand the barriers to pneumococcal vaccination in adults in India. The study was a descriptive, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey in which 650 pediatricians were invited to participate. The survey consisted of structured questions sent to the participants in Microsoft Form through emails. The responses were collected, analyzed, and compared for final interpretations using SPSS software. Of the total 500 pediatricians who consented to study participation, one-third (39.6%) of pediatricians would recommend pneumococcal vaccination to adults >60 years accompanying the children, and 33.2% of the pediatricians reported that they vaccinate adults only when presented with a prescription or advised by the adult's treating physician. Most pediatricians (72.1%) reported that among their patients they would give the highest priority for pneumococcal vaccination in adolescents with chronic lung and heart diseases, and 70.4% of the pediatricians reported that only about one in five families (5-20%) consulting with them are aware of adult vaccination other than the COVID-19 vaccine. Pediatricians (80%) gave the highest priority to \"low awareness regarding pneumococcal disease in adults,\" while only 30.4% of the pediatricians had taken the pneumococcal vaccination. The study objectively identifies barriers to pneumococcal vaccination in adults in India from the pediatrician point of view. There is a lack of awareness among pediatricians about adult vaccination recommendations. National guidelines among pediatricians for adult vaccination, including data on vaccine safety, efficacy, and disease burden, would help pediatricians in counseling adults for vaccination. Per the pediatricians, patient-level barriers to vaccinations are poor awareness and understanding of both adult pneumococcal disease and vaccination, along with affordability.",
