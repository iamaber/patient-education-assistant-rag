        "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, particularly among adults aged 45 years and older. Self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) is an evidence-based intervention that can help patients manage hypertension outside of the clinical setting. We conducted a needs and assets assessment to identify (1) health center adopters and implementers and (2) barriers and facilitators to SMBP adoption and implementation in six community health centers in Texas. Data sources included: (1) needs and assets assessment surveys and semi-structured interviews; (2) site visits with participating health centers; and (3) detailed meeting notes and logs. Leaders and administrators from the participating health centers completed a self-administered 56-item survey. We computed descriptive statistics for survey data. For open-ended survey responses, interview data, and meeting notes, team members labeled the reported and observed barriers and facilitators to program implementation. Barriers to SMBP adoption and implementation included staffing shortages, limited funding to procure blood pressure devices, and perceived challenges reaching patients and maintaining engagement in an SMBP program. Facilitators included existing hypertension management guidelines, health center familiarity with SMBP programs, and the use of non-physician team members in hypertension management programs. Adopters included leadership professionals and administrators, and implementers included healthcare providers, and non-physician team members. Findings inform our understanding of SMBP program adoption, implementation, and importantly, how to best allocate resources to incorporate SMBP programs into clinical workflows.",

        "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by recurrent wheals and/or angioedema without an identifiable trigger. Despite advances in therapy-including biologics such as omalizumab-suboptimal treatment adherence remains a major challenge, often resulting in poor symptom control and diminished quality of life. The objective of this study is to evaluate the existing literature on adherence in CSU and identify evidence-based strategies for improving long-term treatment engagement. A systematic literature search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed for articles published between 2000 and 2024 using the terms \"chronic spontaneous urticaria,\" \"chronic urticaria,\" \"chronic idiopathic urticaria,\" \"compliance,\" and \"adherence.\" Eligible studies reported original data on adherence-related factors in CSU. Each study was categorized to World Health Organization (WHO) adherence dimensions: social/economic, healthcare system, condition-related, therapy-related, and patient-related. Risk of bias assessment was conducted for each study included in the final selection. The search followed PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024627967). Twenty-one studies (totaling 18,500 patients) met inclusion criteria. Common barriers included lack of preventative medication use, inconvenience, forgetfulness, dissatisfaction with healthcare providers, and logistical challenges in accessing in-office biologic administration. Patients previously treated with immunosuppressants had a poorer response to omalizumab, which may contribute to nonadherence due to perceived lack of efficacy. External factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to nonadherence by reducing clinic visits and access to specialist referrals. Higher education level and employment were significantly associated with improved adherence. Proposed strategies include simplifying treatment regimens, enhancing patient education about CSU chronicity, providing telehealth or home medication administration options, and offering financial or social support programs. Multiple interrelated barriers contribute to treatment nonadherence in patients with CSU, underscoring the need for multifaceted, patient-centered interventions. Clear communication, simplified regimens, and supportive resources may enhance adherence and help achieve improved long-term clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Guidelines support the switch to a two-drug regimen (2DR) in virologically suppressed people with HIV (PWH) on a three-drug regimen (3DR). Randomized clinical trials have not included clinical outcomes in study endpoints. We provide estimates of 3-year clinical risk by means of a target trial emulation using the data of a large cohort of PWH in Italy. PWH from the Icona Foundation Study who were virologically suppressed (HIV-RNA ≤50 copies/mL) for ≥6 months on a 3DR on or after November 2014, were enrolled (database closure on July 31, 2024). PWH were classified according to therapeutic strategies: switching to 2DR (protease inhibitors or dolutegravir plus lamivudine or dolutegravir plus rilpivirine) or remaining on 3DR (any combination). The primary endpoint was the time to the first clinical composite event (cardiovascular disease [CVD], cancer [AIDS and non-AIDS related], or death). We calculated the difference in 3-year risk between therapeutic strategies, estimated using a weighted non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator. 7672 participants entered the analysis: 629 (8.2%) switching to 2DR and 7043 (91.8%) remaining on 3DR. Over the 3-year follow-up, 408 events were registered (64 CVD, 234 cancer, and 110 deaths). The 3-year adjusted risk estimate was 2.55 (95% CI 1.72, 5.33) in 2DR vs. 4.69 (95% CI 4.48, 6.17) in 3DR. The difference (-2.15% [95% CI -3.56%, -0.20%]) in favor of 2DR was mainly driven by events of non-AIDS related cancer and mortality. This study provides evidence that virologically suppressed PWH can be safely switched to 2DR, and may slightly reduce the 3-year risk of a composite clinical outcome.

        "abstract": "To examine the associations between prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-related biomarkers and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in male patients with diabetes. This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2001 and 2010, including 1,681 male diabetic patients (409 of whom had DKD). Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, race, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were employed to evaluate the relationships between total PSA (TPSA), free PSA (FPSA), and the FPSA/TPSA ratio with DKD. Dose-response curves and subgroup analyses were performed to further assess these associations. Elevated levels of TPSA, FPSA, and the FPSA/TPSA ratio were significantly associated with an increased risk of DKD. In fully adjusted models, the highest tertiles of TPSA (OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.43-2.56) and FPSA (OR = 2.69, 95% CI 2.00-3.60) demonstrated the strongest associations. The FPSA/TPSA ratio exhibited a linear dose-response relationship with DKD (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.60-2.91), whereas TPSA and FPSA showed non-linear threshold effects. Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent findings across populations. PSA-related biomarkers may serve as potential indicators for early diagnosis and risk stratification of DKD. Further validation studies and mechanistic investigations are necessary to optimize clinical interventions and improve renal outcomes in diabetic patients.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate how nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) impacts the progression and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). This retrospective study enrolled patients diagnosed with PBC. NAFLD patients were identified according to the 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines. The primary outcome measured the percentage of patients achieving a complete biochemical response as defined by the Paris criteria, while secondary outcomes included non-invasive fibrosis scoring systems and a transplantation-free survival risk model. Statistical analyses employed independent samples Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, with significance set at a two-tailed P-value of less than 0.05. Among 363 patients diagnosed with PBC, 87 (24.0%) were also diagnosed with NAFLD. Biochemical response rates did not differ significantly between patients with only PBC and those with concurrent PBC and NAFLD (P>0.05). However, after one year of ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment, significant differences were observed in aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) score between PBC patients with and without NAFLD (APRI: 0.35 vs. 0.47, P = 0.02; FIB-4 score: 1.95 vs. 2.53, P = 0.01). The GLOBE score revealed that patients with both PBC and NAFLD had higher 5-, 10-, and 15-year liver transplant-free survival rates compared to those with only PBC (81.9%, 58.3%, and 38.0% respectively, all P < 0.05). Patients with concurrent PBC and NAFLD do not significantly impact the biochemical response to UDCA but may improve the degree of liver fibrosis and long-term prognosis.",

        "abstract": "As hypertension and diabetes emerge as co-morbidities among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), the need for robust epidemiological research to inform policy and action is imperative. Proper reporting and handling of missing data are crucial in such studies to avoid loss of statistical power and precision and generate unbiased results. We aimed to assess the reporting and handling of missing data in published studies of co-morbid hypertension and diabetes among PLWH. We searched in PubMed for cross-sectional studies of co-morbid hypertension and diabetes among PLWH published worldwide between January 1990 and June 2023. We extracted data on reporting of missing data (quantity, type, where it occurred, and any bias assessment) and how it was handled. Of 2179 records identified, 154 studies were included among which 53 (34.4%) reported missing data, primarily within exposure variables such as CD4 count and viral load. Only 19 of these studies (37.7%) cited reasons for missingness, predominantly attributed to lack of documentation and non-response. Out of the 24 (45.5%) studies that detailed how they handled missing data, the majority (16 studies; 30.2%) used complete case analysis. Only 5/53 studies (9.43%) adopted multiple imputation methods. The potential biases introduced by missing data were acknowledged in only 12/53 (22.6%) studies. The reporting and handling of missing data in hypertension and diabetes studies among PLWH are currently suboptimal. Enhanced understanding of why data is missing and choosing appropriate methods to address it is paramount to reduce potential biases. Adopting and adhering to comprehensive guidelines for managing missing data is a pressing need and will ensure that more accurate results are better represented in PLWH population.",

        "abstract": "The number of patients with heart failure is steadily increasing in parallel with the aging of the population in Japan. This study aimed to assess the level of satisfaction with the latest treatments, identify the factors influencing satisfaction, and investigate the current guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) practice for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) among cardiologists in Japan. Respondents were categorised into two groups based on their level of satisfaction with the current treatment for HFrEF. Those who responded \"(1) Not satisfied,\" \"(2) Somewhat dissatisfied,\" or \"(3) Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\" encompassed the dissatisfied group. Conversely, those who responded \"(4) Somewhat satisfied\" or \"(5) Satisfied\" comprised the satisfied group. A total of 203 valid responses were collected from cardiologists in Japan in a survey conducted between December 27, 2023, and January 30, 2024. These respondents were divided into two groups based on their satisfaction with the current HFrEF treatment: those who were dissatisfied (n = 92) and those who were satisfied (n = 111). The demographics of the respondents in the two groups revealed no differences. However, the dissatisfied group reported a significantly higher proportion of patients under their care who were considered refractory to treatment than the satisfied group (p = 0.015). Although the dissatisfied group was more likely to indicate that patients' heart failure (HF) underlying characteristics influenced their treatment more (4.15 vs. 3.90, p = 0.045), the satisfied group was significantly more likely to indicate that domestic (4.38 vs. 4.13, p = 0.021) and international (3.85 vs. 3.60, p = 0.039) guidelines influenced their HF treatment practices. Sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor prescription related to increased satisfaction (odds ratio, 2.199; 95% confidence interval, 1.102-4.392; p = 0.025). Approximately 50% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the current pharmacological treatment of patients with chronic HFrEF, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors were prescribed less frequently and that patient management tended to be guided more by individual symptoms and underlying HF characteristics rather than strict adherence to GDMT. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors was significantly associated with higher treatment satisfaction, particularly among physicians who adhered more closely to current GDMT recommendations.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a global health and socioeconomic burden. Telemedicine has been more widely used since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be an effective strategy to mitigate the rising costs associated with AD. This study aimed to assess technology readiness among older adults at risk of developing dementia, with the goal of informing the design and delivery of technology-based approaches in AD prevention research. Cognitively unaffected older adults (n = 226) from the CHARIOT PRO Substudy were invited to complete the CHARIOT Technology Questionnaire (CTQ). CTQ assessed technology experiences and attitudes, including 'technology readiness' via the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). Female participants scored, on average, lower TRI (M = 27.50, SD = 6.87) compared to males (M = 29.50, SD = 6.02). Furthermore, age predicted levels of technology readiness. Exploratory factor analysis determined two factors: \"Technology Competence\" (Factor 1) and \"Technology Trepidation\" (Factor 2). Gender differences were found for \"Technology Competence\" (but not \"Technology Trepidation\"), and age predicted \"Technology Trepidation\" (but not \"Technology Competence\"). Differences in gender, age, \"Technology Competence\", and \"Technology Trepidation\" may highlight those who need additional study and/or support in remote-based AD dementia prevention trials. COVID-19 has accelerated our adoption of 'digitalisation' in AD dementia research. A deeper understanding of the barriers to technology readiness may help inform future AD research studies.

        "abstract": "In 2022, nearly 2.3 million new cases of breast cancer were reported globally, with less than half of these cases originating from Asia. Despite the relatively low incidence of breast cancer in most parts of Asia, the mortality-to-incidence ratio remains high. Low-income countries lack resources for breast cancer screening, whereas high-income countries fail to fully benefit from national breast screening programs because of the underutilization of preventive healthcare services. There is a notable difference in the age distribution of breast cancer cases between Asian and Western populations, with the prevalence peaking approximately a decade earlier in Asian women and most commonly affecting those aged 40-50 years. Existing literature on breast cancer trends, screening guidelines, and clinical practices in Asian countries, particularly regarding regional variations and healthcare system differences, is relatively sparse. Gaining a deeper understanding of how different Asian countries are implementing breast cancer screening in response to the rising incidence of the disease can help identify tailored strategies for early detection, ultimately contributing to a reduction in breast cancer-related mortality.

        "abstract": "Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) is regarded as a subtype of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Hence, extending progression-free survival (PFS) is crucial for enhancing the prognosis of VRL patients. Nevertheless, a lack of standard treatment options currently exists for VRL. This systematic review aims to explore the most optimal treatment strategy. The methods for this systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines and followed a protocol registered on the PROSPERO registry. A search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus up to October 14, 2023, using predefined search terms. Primary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR), while secondary endpoints comprised overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Thirty-seven studies comprising 801 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled CRR was 85%, and the ORR was 93%. The pooled 1-year PFS was 83%, and the 2-year PFS was 58%. The 1-year OS was 92%, and the 2-year OS was 80%. The combined median PFS was 22.87 months, and the median OS was 51.19 months. Survival analysis of the extracted data showed significant associations between PFS and OS with systemic therapy (p = 0.00098 and p = 0.0091) and multi-strategy combination therapy (p = 0.0081 and p = 0.007); however, age, gender, and bilateral involvement exhibited no significant relationship (p > 0.05). In conclusion, while existing treatment strategies have led to higher remission rates and longer OS for VRL patients, PFS remains suboptimal. The primary focus of future clinical and basic research will be to explore effective treatment strategies for controlling disease recurrence or progression. This meta-analysis was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42023400305).",

Serum ASPase activity (SAA) can be modified and even abolished by host immune responses; therefore, current treatment guidelines recommend to monitor SAA during treatment administration. The SAA monitoring schedule needs to be carefully planned to reduce the number of samples without hampering the possibility of measuring pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters in individual patients. Complex modelling approaches, not easily applicable in common practice, have been applied in previous studies to estimate ASPase PK parameters. This study aimed to estimate PK parameters by using a simplified approach suitable for real-world settings with limited sampling. <b>Methods</b>: Our study was based on 434 patients treated in Italy within the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial. During the induction phase, patients received two doses of pegylated ASPase and were monitored with blood sampling at five time points, including time 0. PK parameters were estimated by using the individually available SAA measurements with simple modifications of the classical non-compartmental PK analysis. We also took the opportunity to develop and validate a series of limited sampling models to predict ASPase exposure. <b>Results</b>: During the induction phase, average ASPase activity at day 7 was 1380 IU/L after the first dose and 1948 IU/L after the second dose; therapeutic SAA levels (>100 IU/L) were maintained until day 33 in 90.1% of patients. The average AUC and clearance were 46,937 IU/L × day and 0.114 L/day/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The database was analyzed for possible associations of PK parameters with biological characteristics of the patients, finding only a limited dependence on sex, age and risk score; however, these differences were not sufficient to allow any dose or schedule adjustments. Thereafter the possibility of further sampling reduction by using simple linear models to estimate the AUC was also explored. The most simple model required only two samplings 7 days after each ASPase dose, with the AUC being proportional to the sum of the two measured activities A(7) and A(21), calculated by the formula AUC = 14.1 × [A(7) + A(21)]. This model predicts the AUC with 6% average error and 35% maximum error compared to the AUC estimated with all available measures. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a direct estimation of PK parameters in a real-life situation with limited and variable blood sampling schedules and also offers a simplified method and formulae easily applicable in clinical practice while maintaining a reliable pharmacokinetic monitoring.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid increases of older population and growing demand for longevity worldwide, frailty has become a major hurdle to sustaining healthy aging. As residential areas are the primary domains of mobility for older adults, the neighborhood environment is a crucial factor for their daily living and physical activity. This study aims to investigate whether replacing sedentary behavior with physical activity and having a supportive neighborhood environment are associated with frailty status in older adults. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with 2,650 participants aged 70-84 years from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS). The main explanatory variables included self-reported physical activity, sedentary behavior (SB), and perceived neighborhood environment. Frailty as the response variable was defined using the Fried frailty phenotype. Multinomial regression was performed to analyze the outcome. The Isotemporal Substitution Model (ISM) was applied to examine the effects of replacing sedentary behavior with physical activity. The frailty status of participants was categorized as 45.3% robust, 47.3% pre-frail, and 7.6% frail. Accessibility factor was associated with a decreased risk of being pre-frail (odds ratio (OR): 0.750, 95% CI: 0.673-0.836) and frail (OR: 0.654, 95% CI: 0.541-0.789) compared to being robust. According to ISM, substituting 10 min of SB with any type of physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of pre-frailty [if 10 min of SB was replaced by 10 min of walking (OR: 0.972, CI: 0.960-0.985)] and frailty [if 10 min of SB was replaced by MVPA (OR: 0.877, CI: 0.836-0.921); or by walking (OR: 0.852, CI: 0.814-0.891)]. Replacing SB with walking and improving neighborhood accessibility were significantly associated with reduced risk of being pre-frail or frail. These findings highlight the importance of considering these factors when designing age-friendly environments for older adults.",

        "title": "Advancing equity in cervical cancer screening for sexual and gender minoritized people assigned female at birth (SGM AFAB) in the United States: recommendations from healthcare equity leaders.",
        "abstract": "Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) people, including but not limited to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people assigned female at birth (AFAB), experience a greater burden of cervical cancer relative to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. However, they face pronounced systemic barriers to regular cervical cancer screening. Although evidence-based clinical guidelines play an integral role in the implementation of preventive measures, existing United States (U.S.) cervical cancer screening guidelines do not consider the specific experiences, needs, and contexts of SGM AFAB people concerning cervical cancer outcomes nor cervical cancer screening. Thus, it is imperative to determine how cervical cancer screening guidelines can be revised to better address the unique and specific cervical cancer prevention needs of SGM AFAB people in the U.S. We conducted virtual key informant interviews to elicit recommendations for advancing SGM health equity in developing and implementing cervical cancer screening guidelines from healthcare equity leaders (N = 18), including half with expertise in SGM AFAB people's healthcare. Interviews were analyzed using a template-style thematic analysis approach to develop themes and sub-themes. Healthcare equity leaders provided three key recommendations for advancing SGM health equity in the development and implementation of U.S. cervical cancer screening guidelines. Healthcare equity leaders recommended prioritizing community and person-centered strategies, including engaging SGM communities in the development of the guidelines and using SGM-affirming approaches in their implementation. Revising language that (re)produces harmful normative and exclusionary assumptions about gender and sexuality in the context of cervical cancer screening guidelines was also recommended. Lastly, leaders recommended a range of strategies to mitigate systemic barriers to cervical cancer screening among SGM AFAB people, including collecting and utilizing representative data on SGM AFAB people's needs, experiences, and contexts to develop the guidelines and ensure cultural responsiveness in the delivery of cervical cancer screening to SGM AFAB people across healthcare systems. This study's findings can contribute to improving and advancing health equity in cervical cancer screening for SGM AFAB populations through the community-centered development of inclusive, evidence-based guidelines and their person-centered implementation in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis, defined as the growth of endometrial-like tissues outside the uterus, is a common disease among women. Numerous in vivo rodent models of endometriosis have been developed to explore multiple aspects of this poorly understood disease. Heterologous models utilize human endometrial tissues engrafted into immunocompromized mice, while homologous models engraft rodent endometrium into immunocompetent mice or rats. Heterologous models of endometriosis more closely replicate the human disease; however, the murine humoral immune response must be suppressed to prevent rejection of the xenograft tissue. Although the innate immune system remains intact, suppression of the humoral response leads to a markedly different local and systemic immune environments compared to humans. Despite this limitation, experiments using heterologous models have contributed significantly to our understanding of endometriosis establishment and progression, the pre-clinical effectiveness of various therapeutic strategies, and genetically modifiable host factors that contribute to disease. Unfortunately, a lack of harmonization of the models used by different laboratories has impeded the reproducibility and comparability of results between groups. Therefore, the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) formed an international working group of experts in heterologous models of endometriosis to develop guidelines and protocols that could contribute to unifying experimental approaches across laboratories. Nine critical variables were identified: (i) mouse strain; (ii) human tissue type; (iii) hormonal status of the human tissue donor; (iv) human tissue preparation; (v) method and location of tissue placement; (vi) hormonal status of the recipient animal; (vii) whether or not mice were engrafted with human immune cells; (viii) endpoint assessments; and (ix) number and type of replicates. Herein, we outline important considerations for each major variable and make recommendations for unification of approaches. Widespread adoption of harmonized protocols and implementation of standardized documentation and reporting should further improve the reproducibility and translation of experimental findings both within and between laboratories.",

        "abstract": "Under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR), we aimed to develop broad, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines to aid health professionals managing patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the region. A working group of 35 members comprising rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patient research partners from 18 APLAR countries was convened. The working group conducted systematic literature reviews to derive the quality of evidence via GRADE methods in supporting the efficacy and safety of classes of therapeutic agents for the management of active PsA, its comorbidities, and screening for specific infection concerns in the region. Recommendation statements on the principles of management and the best use of therapeutic drugs were developed. Consensus within the working group was achieved. An external voting panel, five from each of the 18 APLAR countries, was convened to confirm further agreement on the recommendation statements. The main literature review included 178 articles from clinical trials for PsA. Additional articles on the evidence for managing comorbidities, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and screening for chronic hepatitis B and latent tuberculosis were reviewed. The working group discussed and reached consensus on eight management principles and 16 recommendation statements for managing PsA. Endorsement from an external voting panel (n = 90, response rate 80%) was achieved. These first recommendations for the management of PsA patients in the APLAR regions were developed based on the best available evidence and region-specific considerations through discussion among rheumatologists, dermatologists, and patients, with strong agreement from an external expert panel.",

This cross-sectional study involved 1,084 students from Nanyang Medical College, aged 18 to 21 years. The students completed the OSDI and SPEED questionnaires to assess dry eye symptoms. The correlation between the scores of the two questionnaires was analyzed to assess criterion validity. Based on the OSDI scores, a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine the area under the ROC curve and the cut-off point for evaluating the diagnostic threshold of the SPEED questionnaire. The Cronbach's alpha values for the OSDI and SPEED questionnaires were 0.943 and 0.911, respectively. Notably, only 281 participants (25.92%) completed all 12 questions in the OSDI questionnaire, whereas all participants completed the SPEED questionnaire without omitting any questions. The mean SPEED scores Full were 3.71, 11.57, 13.84, and 19.72 for each subgroup. Posthoc testing revealed statistically significant differences between all groups (P < 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between the OSDI score, the SPEED score, and the SPEED score Full, particularly between the SPEED score and the SPEED score Full. In comparison to the OSDI questionnaire, the SPEED questionnaire demonstrates a favorable response rate, reliability, and validity in differentiating dry eye symptoms among Chinese college students. It may be more appropriate for diagnosing dry eye and conducting epidemiological studies within this population.",

        "abstract": "The persistence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and/or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings remains a critical issue that urgently requires attention to effectively control HIV/AIDS epidemic. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination and explore the influencing factors among healthcare providers in western China, in order to inform decision-making regarding the reduction of stigma and discrimination intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2023 and July 2024, and 24,646 (with a response rate of 98.6%) healthcare providers completed the survey using a concise and standardized instrument, including sociodemographic and work-related characteristics, healthcare institutional policies and guidelines, attitudes and opinions about people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV), as well as discriminatory behaviors. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to assess the influencing factors of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers. The proportions of healthcare providers expressing concerns about dressing wounds and drawing blood were 65.1% and 60.3%, respectively. Approximately 40% of the participants believed that most PLHIV did not care if they infected others and had multiple sexual partners. Healthcare providers experienced more secondary stigma and discrimination in the provision of services to PLHIV than direct stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. 67.1% of the respondents agreed that PLHIV should be allowed to have babies if they wish. 71-98% indicated that their institutions had related policies and guidelines to protect HIV/AIDS patients from discrimination. HIV/AIDS-related discriminatory behaviors were higher among healthcare providers who had lower levels of education and training, worked in private or infectious disease hospitals or hospitals with inadequate policies, provided face to face services to PLHIV, and had higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes (P < 0.05). HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers were prevalent in western China. The factors identified in the study which were associated with higher HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination may provide valuable insights for mitigating these negative associations, and more coordinated and multifaceted approaches and interventions need to be implemented to effectively reduce HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings.",

Thalidomide is the primary treatment for ENL in Brazil, but peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a significant adverse effect. Genetic variants in SERPINB2 and PKNOX1 genes have been implicated in the predisposition to develop thalidomide-induced peripheral neuropathy (TiPN) in patients with multiple myeloma. This study evaluated the prevalence of the polymorphisms in SERPINB2 and PKNOX1 in ENL patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of ENL patients from southern Brazil to assess the presence of genetic variants of SERPINB2 and PKNOX1. Forty-seven patients with ENL were included. The prevalence of SERPINB2 (rs6103) was 66% for the C allele and 34% for the G allele, and the prevalence of PKNOX1 (rs2839629) was 75% for the A allele and 25% for the G allele. There was significantly relevant presence of the PKNOX1 (rs2839629) A allele in patients with ENL (p < 0.001). In the case of patients with PN, the presence of the C genotype for rs6103 (SERPINB2) was 85% in homozygosity and 77.3% in heterozygosity; and the presence of the A genotype for rs2839629 (PKNOX1) was 84% in homozygosity and 80% in heterozygosity. Polymorphisms in SERPINB2 and PKNOX1 were identified in patients with ENL, with emphasis on PKNOX1.

        "abstract": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is highly prevalent among older adults and often leads to significant physical, social and psychological consequences. Understanding these lived experiences is essential for developing effective, person-centred interventions that address not only the physiological but also the emotional and social dimensions of UI. A qualitative systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted to identify original studies that explored older adults' experiences with UI. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched up to 30 November 2024. Eligible studies employed qualitative methods or mixed-methods designs with a clear qualitative component, examined participants aged 60 or older with any type of UI and focused on their perceptions, coping mechanisms or lived experiences. Meta-ethnography guided the synthesis of first-, second- and third-order constructs. Thirty-two studies were included. Five interlinked themes emerged: (i) normalisation of UI as a part of ageing, (ii) stigma and concealment, (iii) adaptive self-management strategies, (iv) barriers and critical triggers for help-seeking and (v) identity disruptions and relational strain. A central concept of 'resigned agency' was identified, where individuals acknowledged the burden of UI yet deferred help-seeking, navigating the condition through self-regulation and quiet endurance. Older adults with UI often enact a form of resigned agency, balancing silent acceptance with personal coping strategies while delaying or avoiding formal care. For future work, interventions (such as destigmatising conversations and support) should be developed to address both individual illness representations and the social contexts that shape them, including stigma, cultural norms and healthcare responsiveness. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42024614673).",

        "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancer, with a 5-year survival of 8-10%. Approximately 50% of cases present with metastases at time of diagnosis, with the liver representing the most common site. International guidelines recommend palliative chemotherapy for metastatic disease, yet several studies report prolonged survival after surgery or locoregional therapy in selected patients with both synchronous and metachronous liver metastases (LM). Despite the numerous attempts to define selection criteria of patients with LM from PDAC who would benefit most from surgery, evidence is contradictory. This article aims to describe underlying principles of paradigm shift in multimodal management of hepatic oligometastatic PDAC, providing a summary of the published series with respect to morbidity, mortality and survival outcomes. Upfront resection of both primary tumor and synchronous LM should be avoided, since it does not imply prolonged survival compared to that of patients with liver oligometastatic PDAC candidate to chemotherapy. Resection or radiofrequency ablation of metachronous liver lesions can be an option in case of small metastases amenable of minor resection. Management of liver oligometastatic PDAC after neoadjuvant therapy can be performed in case of good response to chemotherapy after accurate restaging. Yet, duration of neoadjuvant therapy or entity of biological response are some issue still undefined in this setting. Ongoing trial may overcome limitations of retrospective studies, as well as molecular biology can help to better understand tumor behavior and tailor the surgical approach on cancer genetic signature.",

A retrospective data analysis was conducted on 21 patients diagnosed with HCC at Yibin First People's Hospital, between February 2021 and July 2022. These patients met the eligibility criteria and underwent TACE followed by RFA. After the first TACE, patients received maintenance therapy with Sintilimab and Lenvatinib until the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, disease progression, or demise.

Tumor recurrence and metastasis occurred in 15 patients (71.43%), oligoprogression in 8 patients (38.90%) and extensive progression in 7 patients (33.33%), which were associated with the median OS duration of NR and 26.03 months (95%CI 17.48-34.59), respectively (P = 0.024). In terms of treatment safety, 95.24% (20 cases) of patients experienced treatment-related adverse events (AEs), mainly mild to moderate severity. Notably, 10 patients (47.62%) encountered at least one grade 3 or higher AEs, leading to treatment discontinuation in 2 patients due to severe side effects. The clinical efficacy and safety of Sintilimab plus Lenvatinib in combination with TACE followed by RFA has been shown to be promising in the treatment of unresectable HCC. These results suggested that this combined treatment strategy may be an effective therapeutic approach. Furthermore, patients with oligoprogression after initial treatment exhibited a more favorable prognosis, indicating a need for further exploration and validation by studies with larger sample sizes.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a prevalent and severe pregnancy-related complication, for which effective intervention targets remain limited, posing significant risks to maternal and fetal health. This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic target genes through genetic analyses. Specifically, we utilized cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes derived from blood samples obtained from the eQTLGen consortium as exposure data. Subsequently, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to explore causal associations between these druggable genes and PE. Functional enrichment analysis, Summary-data-based MR (SMR), and colocalization analysis were employed to validate the identified genes. MR results revealed 17 druggable genes significantly associated with PE after multiple testing correction (FDR < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes are involved in key biological processes such as leukocyte proliferation and activation, immune response regulation, and the metabolism of water-soluble vitamins. Additionally, they were found to participate in several critical signaling pathways, including the complement and coagulation cascades, the renin-angiotensin system, and folate biosynthesis. SMR and colocalization analyses further confirmed the causal relationships between PE and five genes-TESK2, LNPEP, CD320, NELL2, and SF3B3. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing data supported the association between the expression levels of TESK2, CD320, and SF3B3 and the development of PE. This study provides preliminary evidence identifying several potential genetic targets that may help reduce the risk of PE from a genomic perspective. These findings offer novel scientific insights and research directions for future drug development and the optimization of therapeutic strategies aimed at managing and preventing PE.",

        "abstract": "The COVID 19 pandemic led to significant disruptions in health services, including immunisation programs, which contributed to a major post-pandemic diphtheria outbreak in Kano State, Nigeria. This region accounted for 85% of the nation's documented diphtheria cases. This study examined the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and mortality outcomes of cases diagnosed between February 2022 and April 2024. Data were collected through the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS), and case definitions followed WHO guidelines. Case fatality rate (CFR) was calculated, and a logistic regression model was used to assess mortality-related risk factors, reporting adjusted odds ratios (AOR). A total of 18,320 cases were analysed, with the outbreak showing a bimodal distribution. The primary peak occurred in August 2023, followed by a smaller secondary peak in early 2024. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 4.5%. Patients who were not vaccinated had more than double the likelihood of death compared to fully vaccinated individuals (AOR 2.45; 95% CI: 2.05, 2.94, p < 0.0001; logistic regression). Similarly, patients without vaccination documentation also had greater odds, with more than 87% increase likelihood of mortality compared to fully vaccinated individuals (AOR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27, 2.68, p < 0.0001; logistic regression). Our study reinforces previous reports of the weakening preventive health delivery systems in resource constrained settings, particularly after the disruptions caused by the COVID 19 pandemic leading to the resurgence of vaccine preventable diseases, such as diphtheria. These highlight the need for improved vaccination coverage and surveillance systems. This research did not receive any external funding.",

        "abstract": "The era of universal treatment for HIV has seen high rates of disengagement from antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs and re-engagement after interruptions, with modeled estimates of non-naïve initiators > 50% in many places. Most re-engagers are reluctant to admit prior antiretroviral exposure, and non-self-reported data on proportions reinitiating are scarce. We conducted a sequential, mixed-methods study to explore the proportion of people who present for initiation with evidence of prior ART use and understand why many are reluctant to admit prior exposure in South Africa. We enrolled a sequential sample of adults presenting to initiate ART or re-initiate ART after an interruption > 3 months and collected (1) self-reported previous treatment experience; (2) electronic medical record (EMR) evidence of prior ART clinic visits; (3) baseline blood tests for metabolites of tenofovir diphosphate; and (4) laboratory records indicating prior ART-related tests. Interviews were conducted with clients who self-reported no prior ART use but had evidence of metabolites. Among 89 enrolled participants (median age 32.5, 62% female), 21 (24%) self-reported previously taking ART > 3 months prior to enrolment. An additional 19 (21%) who did not self-report prior exposure had EMR or laboratory evidence of prior ART use, for a total of 40 (45%) clients with known prior treatment exposure at initiation. Sensitivity of self-report was 40% (95% CI: 25-57%), EMR 43% (27-59%), metabolite testing 45% (29-62%), and laboratory records 73% (56-87%). Interviewees (n = 11) reported opting to present as naïve because they perceived that disclosure of prior disengagement would cause delays accessing treatment, require additional documentation, and elicit negative responses from healthcare workers. Study limitations included short duration of metabolite detectability, inability to link individuals within the EMR to discern ART experience at other facilities, and lack of baseline viral load testing. At least 45% of clients initiating ART in South Africa have prior treatment experience, but only a third of re-initiators voluntarily reveal this. Laboratory records yielded the most accurate results for ascertaining prior treatment exposure. As numbers re-engaging in HIV care after a treatment interruption increase, understanding reluctance to self-report ART experience and exploring opportunities to overcome barriers are critical for preventing repeated interruptions. The protocol was registered on July 12, 2022 on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05454839).",

        "abstract": "Although 90% of the global adolescent population resides in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), cross-national mental health research has primarily focused on high-income countries. This systematic review aims to examine cross-national studies, including LMICs, focusing on adolescent mental health and psychosocial problems. Peer-reviewed articles comparing adolescent mental health or psychosocial issues across countries were included if published in English and based on observational study designs. Six databases were searched from inception to January 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using the JBI tool and additional cross-national quality criteria. A narrative synthesis was conducted following the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis guidelines. The search identified 172 studies including data from over 12 million adolescents across 166 countries. The most used international survey was the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study, and most studies employed cross-sectional designs with school-based, self-reported questionnaires. Adolescent mental health research involved 166 countries, while 52 countries were not represented in any of the studies. The inclusion of LMICs in cross-national research increased over time. Internalising problems and bullying were well-researched topics, but studies on externalising behaviours were limited. The number of publications increased over time, particularly after 2020. Variations by income level were observed, with traditional bullying more prevalent in LMICs. This review provides important insights into global patterns and gaps in adolescent mental health research. It highlights the need to address methodological heterogeneity, including the use of validated and culturally adapted measures, comprehensive reporting of sampling procedures, sample sizes, response rates and greater attention to generalisability. In addition, the targeted inclusion of under-represented regions is essential to addressing global disparities and informing effective interventions. CRD42024505077.",

Our study aims to assess the predictive significance of baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and CEA level changes on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer patients. A systemic literature search was conducted in three digital repositories-Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library-to obtain studies linking CEA with clinical results in cancer patients receiving ICIs from the year of inception of each database until 20 August 2024. Studies were included if they involved cancer patients treated with ICIs, assessed the prognostic significance of baseline CEA levels or CEA level changes, and reported at least one outcome metric, including overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), pathological complete response (pCR), or objective response rate (ORR). Duplicate studies were identified and removed using Covidence software following Cochrane collaboration guidelines. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was applied to evaluate study quality. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for OS and PFS, as well as odds ratios (ORs) for DCR, pCR, and ORR, were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analysis included 27 studies, comprising a total cohort of 3662 patients. The findings revealed that cancer patients receiving ICIs with lower CEA levels had significantly improved OS (HR: 1.84, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and PFS (HR: 1.64, <i>p</i> < 0.001), along with higher DCR (OR: 1.81, <i>p</i> = 0.001), ORR (OR: 0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and pCR (OR: 0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to those with elevated CEA levels. Additionally, a reduction in CEA levels during immunotherapy was significantly associated with prolonged OS (HR: 0.507, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and PFS (HR: 0.501, <i>p</i> < 0.001), as well as increased ORR (OR: 2.39, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and DCR (OR: 2.94, <i>p</i> < 0.001).

        "abstract": "Recently, Newborn screening (NBS) has been expanded worldwide to include lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) and adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) due to the importance of early diagnosis and early treatment. In Japan, NBS for LSDs, termed expanded NBS, was first implemented in Kumamoto prefecture in 2006 as pilot study. NBS for ALD was subsequently introduced in Aichi prefecture and Gifu prefecture in 2021. Expanded NBS for LSDs and ALD has become more widespread in Japan. In light of this current situation, we considered it is necessary to clarify the usefulness of expanded NBS, prevalence of each disease, challenges encountered. Therefore, we reported the current implementation status of expanded NBS in Japan. A survey was conducted among physicians responsible for expanded NBS in each target region Japan. The target regions were those that implemented NBS for LSDs and/or ALD for more than one year. The survey items included: the entity conducting expanded NBS, the facilities conducting the tests, the target areas, medical institutions for close examination such as detailed biochemical analysis and/or genetic sequencing, and treatments, types of target diseases, fee for NBS, sample collection methods, testing method, and quantitative data on expanded NBS, retesting, and diagnoses in each area. Responses were received from nine regions and an organization (CReARID). The total number of 733,838 newborns were screening, with 101 diagnoses: 75 cases of Fabry disease, 10 of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) II, 8 of Pompe disease, 5 of Gaucher disease, 2 of MPS I, 1 of ALD, respectively) were diagnosed. More cases were diagnosed with the target disease than the estimated prevalence. In contrast, the positive predictive value was low and false-positive rates was elevated, particularly for PD, MPS II, and ALD, have been attributed to pseudodeficiency alleles and methodological differences. Moreover, variant of unknown significance (VUS) in the ABCD1 gene was detected in many of the patients with suspected ALD. In Japan, Expanded NBS for LSDs and ALD has become more widespread.

        "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory arthropathy presenting with multiple manifestations, including peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and skin psoriasis (PSO). Immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapies, including biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARD), are common effective treatments for PsA; however, discontinuation is reported and contributing factors remain unclear. To describe the probability of persistence and time to discontinuation (including switch) of b/tsDMARD therapy in both b/tsDMARD-naive and -experienced patients with PsA within 12 months following initiation of a new b/tsDMARD. Secondary objectives included (1) describing the factors associated with b/tsDMARD persistence or nonpersistence and (2) assessing maintenance dose changes among patients with PsA initiating the anti-IL17A agents secukinumab (SEC) or ixekizumab (IXE). SEC and IXE were of particular focus owing to the variability in their dosage recommendation guidelines at the time of this study. This observational cohort study used Merative MarketScan data and included patients initiating a new prescription of b/tsDMARD treatment for PsA, with a diagnosis of PsA between January 1, 2017, and June 30, 2021. The primary outcome was persistence, defined as days of b/tsDMARD therapy use from index date to 12 months of continuous index treatment, or first occurrence of b/tsDMARD discontinuation/switch. Associations between patient characteristics and outcomes were explored using Cox regressions, with descriptive dose analyses exploring proportions of patients with specific starting/maintenance b/tsDMARD doses. 7,037 adult patients with PsA were included: 26.7% with PsA only and 73.3% with PsA+PSO at baseline. The 12-month probability for persistence of b/tsDMARD treatment was 51.2% (95% CI, 49.5%-52.9%), with an 8.3-month mean length of persistence. Treatment persistence probability at 12 months was 52.7% (50.8%-57.7%) for patients with PsA+PSO and 47.0% (43.7%-50.3%) for patients with PsA only. Treatment persistence probability at 12 months was 51.4% (49.6%-53.2%) for the b/tsDMARD-naive subgroup and 49.8% (45.5%-54.1%) for the b/tsDMARD-experienced group. Female sex and a baseline codiagnosis of fatigue were associated with an increased probability of nonpersistence, whereas codiagnosis of PSO was associated with decreased probability of nonpersistence. In the dosing analysis, of the patients initiating SEC therapy included in the analysis, 60.4% were prescribed a starting maintenance dose of 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 34.1% were prescribed a starting maintenance dose of 150 mg Q4W. Of patients initiating IXE therapy included in the analysis, 84.4% were prescribed an 80-mg Q4W starting maintenance dose and 10.4% were prescribed a 160-mg Q4W starting maintenance dose. The findings of this study provide relevant insights into tailoring b/tsDMARD therapy to maximize clinical benefit and potentially identify patients with the greatest unmet need.",

The 1-, 2- and 3-year OS rates were significantly higher in the cTACE plus TCC group than in the cTACE group (83.2% vs 54.3%, 63.1% vs 30.1%, 37.7% vs 18.1%; p = 0.008), with a significantly longer median OS (29.0 vs 15.0 months; p < 0.001). Regarding the 1-, 2- and 3-year PFS rates, HCC patients in the cTACE plus TCC group also demonstrated significantly higher rates (66.3% vs 34.4%, 35.8% vs 18.8%, 31.8% vs 15.6%; p = 0.014) and had a longer median PFS (16.0 vs 8.0 months; p < 0.001) compared with cTACE group. All treatment-related AEs were tolerated. For patients with unresectable HCC, TACE combined with TCC cocktail was well tolerated and significantly improved clinical outcomes. Trial registration The trial was registered at https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=27493 as ChiCTR1800016335 on 25th May 2018 named an open-label, multicenter, randomized, prospective clinical trial of thalidomide based triple oral regimen for low-dose maintenance therapy after TACE in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "title": "Revisiting the association between transportation noise and heart disease reported in the World Health Organization Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Whilst the link between long-term exposure to transportation noise and cardiovascular disease has been discussed for several decades, there are still uncertainties in the exact quantitative relationship between the two. A systematic review and meta-analysis that informed recommendations in the World Health Organization Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region included studies published up to 2015. Since then, there has been a rapid increase in publications from epidemiological studies exploring the risk over a larger noise exposure range, and with more precise exposure assignment. Given the influential nature of the WHO Guidelines, we investigated whether the inclusion of studies published up to December 2023 changes the quantitative relationship. We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between transportation noise (road, rail, and aircraft) and heart disease, specifically ischaemic heart disease (ICD-10 I20-25), atrial fibrillation (ICD-10 I48) and heart failure (ICD-10 I50). We followed the same methodology (search terms, inclusion criteria, risk of bias evaluation and assessment of the quality of evidence) of the WHO systematic review. Pooled effect estimates were calculated for road, railway, aircraft and mixed noise sources using random effects models. For road traffic noise we investigated potential sources of between-study heterogeneity using meta-regression. We also explored the potential effect of noise exposure assignment precision on the effect estimates. Fifty-three studies were included in the systematic review: 85 % investigated associations for road, 23 % for rail and 30 % for aircraft noise exposure. The papers spanned 15 countries, with the majority (87 %) of studies investigating populations within European countries. In total 35 studies were included in the meta-analyses for heart disease incidence, 28 for mortality and five for prevalence. We found positive associations between long-term exposure to road traffic and aircraft noise and heart disease incidence (relative risk (RR) = 1.02 [95 % confidence interval (CI),1.01 to 1.04]; RR = 1.03 [0.99 to 1.07], per 10 dB increase in L<sub>den</sub>, respectively) and between long-term road, rail and aircraft noise exposure and heart disease mortality (RR = 1.03 [ 1.01 to 1.05]; RR = 1.02 [1.02 to 1.03]; RR = 1.07 [1.01 to 1.14], per 10 dB increase in L<sub>den</sub>, respectively). The pooled estimates for aircraft noise were attenuated when we excluded small-area studies from the analysis (RR = 1.00 [0.99 to 1.01] for incidence and RR = 1.03 [0.98 to 1.07] for mortality). When combining all sources of transport noise, we found similar pooled effect estimates for heart disease incidence (RR = 1.03 [1.01 to 1.04]) and mortality (RR = 1.03 [1.02 to 1.05]) per 10 dB L<sub>den</sub> increase in long-term noise exposure. The starting point for these exposure response relationships was between 32 to 45 dB L<sub>den</sub>, depending on the source and outcome. All exposures are at the most-exposed façade. We found suggestive evidence that effects estimates could be higher in studies focused on older adults and in studies using the most precise exposure assignment (noise calculated at the residential address with floor height), although further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The epidemiological evidence on the association between transportation noise and heart disease has increased rapidly since the publication of the WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines in 2018, although the effects of noise from railway and aircraft remain relatively understudied. When including newer studies, we found different exposure response relationships for road traffic noise, and associations between railway and aircraft noise and heart disease mortality. Our results have implications on quantitative health risk assessments that inform policy and decision making. Caution is needed if applying our results to populations and settings outside Europe. Future epidemiological studies should aim to use precise exposure assignment calculated at the residential address, rather than estimating from spatial grids with a coarse spatial resolution.",

        "abstract": "Children with cancer frequently experience fatigue that affects their quality of life, yet current management practices remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess health care professionals' (HCPs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding fatigue management in pediatric oncology. We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of pediatric hematology-oncology HCPs in the United States of America and Canada to assess fatigue education, management practices, barriers to fatigue management, and perspectives on future clinical trials for fatigue.. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression. A framework approach was used to analyze qualitative data from open-ended survey response items. In total, 528 HCPs completed survey: 49% oncologists, 27% nurses, and 23% nurse practitioners. Only 29% and 32% of HCPs attended educational events on fatigue and screened patients for fatigue primarily through verbal assessments during outpatient settings, respectively. Although 91% of HCPs emphasized importance of assessing fatigue, only 18% were familiar with fatigue management guidelines, and only 1% followed them. Commonly recommended fatigue interventions included sleep hygiene (91%), physical exercise (82%) and rest (78%). Themes for improving fatigue management included enhancing education for HCPs and patients, implementing routine fatigue screening, and disseminating guidelines and fatigue management resources. Barriers to effective fatigue management were insufficient education, lack of routine screening, and limited access to fatigue screening tools. Most HCPs (94%) supported future clinical trials for fatigue management, and 86% preferred these trials to test non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue management. Most HCPs acknowledge the importance of assessing fatigue, but significant gaps remain in education, routine screening, and guideline implementation. Addressing barriers such as insufficient education and limited access to resources is essential for improving fatigue management practices.",

        "abstract": "Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a promising avenue for treating pulmonary degenerative disorders due to its remarkable capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into various cell types. However, concerns regarding undesired differentiation and tumorigenicity have raised questions about the safety and efficacy of cell-based therapy. The aim of the present systematic review study was to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of stem cell secretome in mitigating three pulmonary degenerative diseases, including Acute Lung Injury (ALI), Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). A comprehensive search was carried out on international databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase, using related keywords according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-2020) guidelines. Of 1541 retrieved studies, 136 articles were included in the present systematic review. The therapeutic effects of stem cells are primarily attributed to their paracrine secretions, specifically bioactive molecules known as the secretome, which includes exosomes and extracellular vesicles. Secretome-based therapy shows great promise in maximizing the healing potential of stem cells. However, several challenges and limitations hinder its widespread application, including scalability issues, delivery challenges, difficulty in controlling dosage, and the lack of standardized production protocols. As it is a novel therapeutic approach, its complex composition, mechanism of action, and variability in responses from the body, as well as long-term safety, remain unknown and pose challenges that necessitate further investigation and well-designed clinical trials. The secretome exerts its protective and therapeutic effects by regulating various processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, macrophage polarization, growth factor signaling pathways, immune cell activation, TGF-β signaling pathways, angiogenesis, structural attenuation, fibrosis resolution, pulmonary functional improvement, and alveolarization.",

        "abstract": "Research in high-income countries has established the health benefits of physical activity (PA), but evidence from low- and middle-income countries, including China, where PA patterns vary from those in high-income countries, remains limited. Moreover, previous research, mainly focused on specific diseases, failing to fully capture the health impacts of PA. We investigated the associations of PA with 425 distinct diseases and 53 causes of death using data from 511,088 participants aged 30-79 years in the China Kadoorie Biobank. Baseline PA was assessed using a questionnaire between 2004 and 2008, and usual PA levels were estimated using the resurvey data in 2013-2014. Cox regression was employed to estimate the associations between PA and outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders. During a median follow-up time of 12 years, 722,183 incident events and 39,320 deaths were recorded across 18 chapters of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Total PA was significantly and inversely associated with incidence risks of 14 ICD-10 chapters, specifically 65 diseases and 19 causes of death, with the highest quintile group of PA showing a 14% lower disease incidence and 40% lower all-cause mortality compared with the lowest group. Of these diseases, 54 were not highlighted in World Health Organization PA guidelines. Dose-response analyses revealed L-shaped associations for most PA types, except moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA, which showed a U-shaped relationship. In this population, physical inactivity accounted for 12.8% of PA-related deaths. The findings underscore the broad health benefits of PA across a variety of body systems and the significant disease burden due to inactivity in China, highlighting the urgent need for PA promotion.",

        "title": "Socioeconomic and sociodemographic differences in the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on self-rated health and mental well-being: results from a cross-sectional study in Germany.",
        "abstract": "Although the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrably led to an increase in health inequities, only a few studies have analyzed their underlying mechanisms by taking into account socioeconomic status and sociodemographic differences at the same time. Similarly, only few studies have explored the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on inequities in living conditions, health-related risks, and coping resources. This study aims to address these gaps by exploring the complex associations of socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors with changes in life circumstances, pandemic-related experiences, self-rated health, and well-being among adults living in Germany. A total of 2,123 adults (women: 49.8%, men: 50.2%) living in Germany participated in the cross-sectional online study ExCo:Well between July and August 2022. The survey included questions on socioeconomic status, sociodemographic factors, social circumstances, resources and burdens, as well as health outcomes. The data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Our results show significant disparities in self-rated health and mental well-being based on socioeconomic status. For sociodemographic differences, the results are mixed, with only women consistently showing worse health outcomes than men. Immigration status played a limited role. Although measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic more commonly affected the life and work conditions of more privileged participants, socioeconomically disadvantaged participants experienced higher burdens and had fewer coping resources. Logistic regression analyses showed that health inequities decreased when resources and burdens were considered. By covering the whole period of the COVID-19 pandemic, our data allow for an overall assessment of this critical time as well as a better understanding of mechanisms underlying health inequities. Our findings suggest that more important than the number of government-induced social changes is their quality and their potential to negatively impact material and social livelihoods in the long run. To improve health equity, tailored social security and health promotion interventions need to be systematically integrated in pandemic or crisis response plans.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between remnant cholesterol and diabetes is a critical issue in the fields of health and public health. Currently, the relationship between remnant cholesterol (RC) and diabetes is a highly researched and trending topic. The aim of this study was to investigate association between RC and diabetes in US individuals. The secondary objective of this study was to explore the potential dose-response relationship between the exposure RC and diabetes. Our study utilized all available continuous data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2013 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between RC and diabetes. The association between RC and diabetes was assessed using smoothing splines generated by generalized additive models. Additionally, a threshold effect analysis of the relationship between RC and diabetes was conducted. Analysis of 6,875 eligible adults (derived from an initial cohort of 7,780 after exclusions for missing diabetes/cholesterol data) revealed a significant threshold effect at 19 mg/dLof remnant cholesterol (RC) for diabetes prevalence. Participants with RC < 19 mg/dL exhibited substantially elevated diabetes odds in both unadjusted (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.57-2.06; P < 0.001) and fully adjusted models (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.30-1.64; P < 0.001), whereas RC ≥ 19 mg/dL demonstrated no significant association (adjusted OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.88-1.25; P = 0.96). Quartile analysis confirmed a robust dose-dependent relationship: compared to Quartile 1 (RC ≤ 12 mg/dL; reference), diabetes odds progressively increased to OR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.37-2.16)​for Quartile 2 (13-18 mg/dL), OR = 2.32 (95% CI: 1.86-2.91) for Quartile 3 (19-26 mg/dL), and OR = 3.42 (95% CI: 2.77-4.21)​for Quartile 4 (27-80 mg/dL), with significant trend persistence after multivariable adjustment (P < 0.001). These associations remained significant despite substantial demographic variations across RC quartiles, including differences in age (P < 0.001), sex distribution (P < 0.001), and racial/ethnic composition (P < 0.001). This cross-sectional analysis observed that elevated RC levels were significantly associated with higher prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 20-80 years, with a threshold value of 19 mg/dL for increased association strength. The findings support RC as a metabolic marker associated with prevalent diabetes with a threshold value of 19 mg/dL for strengthened association.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate decision-making patterns among international experts regarding breast cancer regional node irradiation (RNI), using an objective, consensus-driven approach. Twenty-one international radiation oncology experts were invited to participate in a consensus-based evaluation of RNI recommendations. Participants provided responses to clinical scenarios involving early-stage breast (cN0) cancer with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB)-positive findings (pN1a) without completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Decision-making parameters, including patient age, tumour characteristics, and biological risk factors were analysed. Of the 21 experts, 19 completed the evaluation. Responses included 22 different decision-making criteria and demonstrated considerable variability in decision-making, even after simplifying treatment options. Consensus was most frequently observed in high- and low-risk cases, with comprehensive RNI or omission of RNI being recommended, respectively. However, for intermediate-risk scenarios, no clear agreement was reached reflecting different clinical considerations and assessment of risk factors. Due to many randomised studies investigating different risk factors that do not always coincide, breast cancer experts rely on a wide variety of criteria to recommend RNI for pN1(sn) breast cancer, leading to heterogeneity in decision-making. With this work we aim to raise awareness of this challenge to provoke revision of current guidelines and expert-based recommendations.",

Hyperuricemia, a central factor in the pathogenesis of gout, is becoming increasingly common among adolescents, particularly males, and is associated with various health risks, including joint pain, CKD, metabolic disorders, and premature death. Despite the seriousness of this issue, there is a lack of specific guidelines addressing adolescent and hyperuricemia gout management. The working comprising 26 clinician pediatricians, rheumatologists, and endocrinologists, all experienced in the clinical presentation and management of gout and hyperuricemia, was convened to develop a consensus. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE published from 1 January 1960 to 31 May 2024. Two rounds of Delphi surveys for each recommendation were conducted among all group members via electronic questionnaire. Adolescent-onset gout is characterized by a pronounced genetic predisposition and distinct environmental influences, with a significant number of cases reporting a positive family history. We issued three consensus statements with five recommendations including the criteria, the urate-lowering treatment, and flare therapy principles for hyperuricemia and gout in adolescents. This consensus statement comprehensively delves into the critical clinical challenges associated with gout and hyperuricemia in the adolescent population, emphasizing the pressing requirement for improved detection and management strategies to support a demographic that may be underserved by the healthcare system.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in late December 2019, has significantly altered the dietary and oral health-related habits and lifestyles of nearly every age group within the global population. The purpose of this research is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dietary behaviors, daily oral hygiene practices and caries risk among children, adolescents, and young adults from diverse regions within Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional analytical study spanning multiple regions of Saudi Arabia was carried out to assess the effects of COVID-19 on dietary habits, oral hygiene practices, and caries risk across various age groups within the Saudi population. A total of 655 participants were included in the study after providing informed consent. Data collection was performed using a questionnaire divided into four sections: personal and demographic information, socioeconomic information, oral hygiene practices, and dietary habits, both prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. There was a notable increase in the caries experience rate, which escalated from 26.1% before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to 45.0% during the pandemic (P < 0.001). The findings suggest a significant shift in the dietary practices of children and adolescents when comparing the two timeframes. Specifically, there was a marked rise in meal frequency (P < 0.001), snacking patterns (P < 0.001), and the consumption of sugary products like candies, chocolates, milk, and coffee (P < 0.001) during the pandemic. Furthermore, the percentage of children and adolescents brushing their teeth three times a day plummeted from 47.8% before the pandemic to a mere 4.3% during it (P < 0.001). The proportion of individuals using fluoride toothpaste also experienced a decline, falling from 15.9% before the pandemic to 5.2% during this crisis (P < 0.001). The study illustrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially changed the dynamics of dental caries and oral health, resulting in an increased risk of caries and a worrying decline in daily oral hygiene practices. Additionally, there has been a significant drop in the application of topical fluoride via toothpaste. These findings point to the critical importance of personalized dental care during public health crises to alleviate negative effects and ensure the maintenance of oral health.",

Heart failure (HF) poses a substantial epidemiological threat with increasing incidence and mortality worldwide. However, the relationship between CTI and HF has not been extensively investigated. Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2010, 21,974 participants ≥ 20 years were included. HF diagnosis was based on self-reported medical history. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates. Smooth curve fitting analyzed dose-response relationships, while subgroup analyses explored effect heterogeneity. The research cohort comprised 21,974 individuals (631 HF cases, 21,343 non-HF). HF patients exhibited significantly higher CTI levels (p < 0.001), and a positive correlation with HF prevalence was observed (p < 0.001). Consistent positive associations were maintained across subgroups, with no significant interactions detected. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated adjusted ORs for HF per 1-unit CTI increase of 1.492 (model 1, unadjusted) and 1.279 (model 3, fully adjusted). Quartile analysis revealed a progressive increase in prevalent HF with higher CTI levels, and model 3 confirmed a nonlinear dose-response relationship (p < 0.001) with a threshold at 11.657. CTI is positively associated with the presence of HF in US adults, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for HF prevention and treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "To determine the recent incidence of paediatric Acute Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis in Far North Queensland and associated co-occurring clinical conditions. Paediatric inpatient unit. Patients admitted to Hospital under 14 years of age meeting diagnostic criteria for APSGN between January 2015 and January 2020. Single centre, retrospective observational analysis. Data and clinical information was extracted from electronic medical records. Case definitions were as specified in the Northern Territory guidelines for APSGN. APSGN (n = 61) or probable APSGN (n = 4) was found in 65 of the 86 identified cases. Fifty-five APSGN cases were identified as being Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, with the remaining 10 cases identifying as other ethnic groups. Mean annual incidence (0-14 years) was 27/100 000 person years. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander population incidence was 104/100 000 person years. Recurrent skin infection was noted in the majority of cases. Nineteen cases were lost to follow up; of these, 15 were from rural regions. A high incidence of childhood APSGN is present in Far North Queensland, with First nation's children overrepresented. This further adds to the national body of data on the disease, highlighting the necessity of an amplified response addressing the disease burden of group A Streptococcus and its main drivers, social disadvantage and remoteness. There is a need for enhanced surveillance and monitoring of the chronic sequelae of APSGN. Opportunities exist to amalgamate follow-up practices across the region, and there is a need to enact reporting of the disease in Queensland.",

        "abstract": "General medicine (GM) was formally recognized as a specialty in Japan in 2018 to address the need for primary care. Understanding factors influencing GM career choices is critical for recruitment. However, the reform's impact on career decision-making remains unclear. This study examined factors influencing GM career choices following the introduction of the new specialty certification and identified challenges in this field. A secondary analysis of national survey data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's questionnaire (2018-2020) for clinical training graduates examined post-training career intentions of specializing in GM, focusing on factors influencing choices such as demographics, education, and training contexts. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted with post-training GM preference as the dependent variable. The results are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among 16,674 complete responses, 59% of the 229 individuals initially interested in GM actually pursued it post-training. Positive factors included regional quotas (aOR 3.10, 95% CI 1.12-8.56), ≤ 1 month GM rotation (aOR 3.39, 95% CI 1.03-11.14), > 2 months community medicine (CM) rotations (aOR 13.35, 95% CI 2.40-76.58), desire for primary care skills (aOR 4.85, 95% CI 2.01-11.73), and community contribution aspirations (aOR 6.88, 95% CI 2.75-17.21). The most influential negative factor was perceived ease of specialization maintenance (aOR 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.12). Among 16,445 individuals who preferred other specialties, 86 switched to GM. Extended GM rotations (1<-≤2 months: aOR 3.54, 95% CI 2.06-6.09; >2 months: aOR 7.41, 95% CI 4.56-12.04) increased the likelihood of switching. Academic interest (aOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.58) and perceived ease of maintaining specialization (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.54) were negative factors. GM rotations may positively influence career choices, with longer CM rotations potentially increasing interest. Establishing clear career paths and educating resident physicians about the academic characteristics of GM remain challenging despite its recognition as a specialty.",

        "abstract": "Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dysregulation of lipid droplet homeostasis is a significant factor affecting microglial inflammatory responses, but the mechanisms underlying lipid droplet imbalance in PD are currently unclear. Here, we report a subtype of microglia characterized by high expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) through single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis and machine learning algorithms, linking lipid metabolism to PD neuroinflammation. The results of multiple loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicate that ACSL1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promotes lipid droplet accumulation to exacerbate microglial activation and dopaminergic neurons death. Mechanistically, activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) leads to the enrichment of ACSL1 on the endoplasmic reticulum, which generates acyl-CoA that are channelled for lipid droplet biogenesis. Additionally, high expression of ACSL1 promotes activation of TBK1 through Nrdp1-mediated K63 ubiquitination of TBK1, which triggers the amplification of the aforementioned biological effects. Moreover, NF-κB directly binds to the ACSL1 promoter and positively regulates its transcription, resulting in increased ACSL1 expression in microglia. Our findings suggest that manipulating lipid droplet biogenesis by modulating ACSL1 may be a potential strategy for treating neuroinflammation in PD patients.

        "abstract": "Albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) is closely associated with the prognosis of many critical illnesses. However, the prognostic value of ACAG in sepsis-associated liver injury (SALI) is poorly understood. We explored the association between ACAG and patient prognosis in individuals diagnosed with SALI. Data from patients with SALI admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2008 and 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. ACAG was calculated based on the first measurement of the anion gap and albumin level within 24 h of admission. The optimal cutoff value for ACAG was established using R statistical software. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to compare mortality risks between the two groups, while multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to examine the association between ACAG and mortality risk in SALI patients. To assess a potential dose-response relationship, restricted cubic splines (RCS) were applied. Lastly, subgroup analyses were carried out to investigate the correlation between ACAG levels and prognosis across different patient populations. A total of 443 critically ill patients with SALI were included in the lower (n = 342) and higher ACAG (n = 101) groups based on ACAG levels. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding age, sex, or ethnicity (P = 0.12, 0.84, and 0.85, respectively). However, patients in the higher ACAG group exhibited a greater propensity for developing respiratory failure. The rates of ICU, in-hospital, 14-day, 28-day, and 90-day mortality were significantly elevated in the higher ACAG group (all P < 0.001). Higher ACAG levels were significantly associated with an increased mortality risk at multiple time points (all P < 0.001). ACAG levels and mortality showed a significant linear relationship. The impact of ACAG on mortality risk remained consistent across subgroups defined by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory failure, with no significant interactions observed (all P for interaction > 0.05). ACAG serves as a significant independent predictor of mortality risk in patients with SALI. ACAG predicts both short-term mortality risk (such as ICU mortality) and long-term mortality risk (such as 90-day mortality). ACAG may serve as a valuable tool for prognostic assessment in patients with SALI with broad applicability.",

        "abstract": "The number of residents at high altitude is high globally, yet few studies have been conducted on the association between altitude and incident frailty. We evaluated the prospective association and dose-response relationship between altitude and frailty among Chinese older adults. We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) from 2013 to 2018, enrolling 4065 participants aged ≥ 60 years at baseline. Frailty was assessed using a frailty index (FI) containing 29 health deficit indicators constructed. Cox proportional hazard regression and linear mixed model were used to analyze the association of altitude with frailty. Restricted Cubic Spline regression was used to assess the dose-response relationship between them. After a median follow-up of 61 months, 1076 (26.5%) frailty events were documented, including 137 (32.2%) in the middle and 939 (25.8%) in the low altitude group. The FI in the middle altitude group was higher than that in the low altitude group at three waves (baseline = 2013, wave 1 = 2015, and wave 2 = 2018 years). The risk of incident frailty was increased by 24% (HR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.03-1.48) in the middle altitude group compared to the low altitude group. The FI increased with increasing altitude. The RCS revealed an increased risk of developing frailty at altitudes above 2,000 m. Exposure to high altitude is associated with an elevated risk of incident frailty. which suggested that early intervention with high-altitude residents can delay frailty.",

This study assessed the treatment patterns and outcomes of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy in a real-world setting. This was an observational, multi-centre retrospective chart review of women in the UK with HR+, HER2- ABC/MBC treated with abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy during 07/2021 to 05/2022 with [Formula: see text]3 months' follow-up data. Data were summarised using descriptive analyses. Kaplan-Meier methods estimated time to progression (TTP) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). One hundred seventy-four adult women from 9 institutions were included. Median patient age at abemaciclib initiation was 65.2 years. Best tumor response was recorded in 78.2% (n = 136) of patients; 0.7% had complete response, 27.9% had partial response, 59.6% had stable disease and 11.8% had disease progressed.

We hypothesize that radiation therapy might reduce variations in chemotherapeutic efficacy caused by fibrosis-induced blood flow disparities, as we explored the relationship between CH-EUS patterns and the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) in resectable pancreatic cancer (PC). Patients with resectable PC who underwent CH-EUS followed by NACRT were retrospectively analyzed. The CH-EUS enhancement pattern was evaluated in the vascular and perfusion phases and classified according to vascularity: Group A, hypovascular in both phases; Group B, isovascular and hypovascular in the vascular and perfusion phases, respectively; and Group C, isovascular in both phases. The relationships between the CH-EUS vascular pattern and the histological response according to the Evans classification to NACRT, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Of the 48 enrolled patients, 31, 11, and 6 were classified into Groups A, B, and C, respectively. There was no significant difference in histopathological differentiation (p = 0.314) or the efficacy of NACRT (p = 0.282) among the groups. In addition, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of median RFS or OS, although it was longer than previously reported.

        "abstract": "Depression is strongly associated with a range of subsequent diseases. To elucidate key mechanistic pathways for targeted interventions, this study aimed to determine the main disease networks associated with depression as well as their underlying genetic determinants. We developed a novel three-dimensional network approach which refines disease association verification by incorporating regularized partial correlations, and facilitates robust identification and visualization of disease clusters (i.e., groups of depression-associated diseases with high within-group connectivity) through both non-temporal (illustrating by x-axis and y-axis) and temporal (by z-axis) dimensions. We applied this approach to a matched cohort of 54,284 middle aged patients diagnosed with depression and their 496,005 age- and sex-matched unexposed individuals from the Swedish national registers and validated our findings in a cohort from the UK Biobank. Additionally, we conducted genetic analyses, including polygenic risk score (PRS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), using genetic data from 10,754 depression patients in the UK Biobank. Our analysis of the Swedish cohort identified nine reliable disease clusters consisting of 85 component diseases associated with depression, of which six clusters with 30 diseases were successfully validated using the UK Biobank cohort. These were clusters characterized by central nervous system (CNS) diseases, respiratory system diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and mental disorders. PRS analysis revealed a dose-response relationship between genetic liability to depression and the susceptibility for subsequent disease clusters, while GWAS identified eight genome-wide significant loci in four of the clusters. Overall, our novel three-dimensional disease network approach identified six robust disease clusters after depression across two large cohorts, each with shared and cluster-specific genetic underpinnings. These findings warrant further research on genetic-based risk prediction and the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at health improvement for patients with depression.",

Systematic review and meta-analysis. MEDLINE and Embase, searched from January 2020 to December 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing remdesivir with placebo or standard care in patients with COVID-19, with a primary focus on cardiac safety. We included RCTs that evaluated the safety of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19 . Eligible studies were those that compared remdesivir with placebo or standard care in adult patientsCOVID-19 . Inclusion criteria emphasised safety outcomes, particularly CAEs, as primary endpoints. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-Harms guidelines. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. A random-effects model was used for data synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess the certainty of evidence. The primary outcome was the incidence of any CAEs, defined as a composite of all reported cardiac-related harms. Secondary outcomes included specific CAEs such as arrhythmias, heart failure and myocardial disorders. We identified 1698 studies, of which seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 4566 participants. The RoB was assessed across multiple domains, with four RCTs showing low risk and three showing moderate risk in specific areas. Pooled analysis revealed no significant association between remdesivir use and CAEs (RR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.04, p=0.118). Subgroup analyses showed consistent findings across different patient demographics and comorbidities. GRADE assessment indicated moderate certainty for overall CAEs, low certainty for arrhythmias and heart failure (due to imprecision and study-level bias), and very low certainty for myocardial disorders (due to small sample size and indirectness). Contrary to preliminary concerns and case reports, our meta-analysis found no evidence of a statistically significant association between remdesivir and CAEs among patients with COVID-19 . These findings provide reassurance to clinicians regarding the safety profile of remdesivir in this patient population, supporting its use as an antiviral therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and to clarify whether remdesivir may have a neutral or potentially protective effect on cardiac outcomes. CRD42022383647.",

The effects of HMAs plus venetoclax on treatment response and its prognostic value were compared with intensive chemotherapy (IC) and HMAs combined with low-intensity chemotherapy. Intensive chemotherapy independently predicted a worse treatment response (IC vs. HMA + venetoclax, OR = 0.183, 95% CI 0.048-0.693, p = 0.012) and inferior overall survival (OS) (IC vs. HMA + venetoclax, HR = 3.316, 95% CI 1.332-8.255, p = 0.010). After 15 patients with favorable cytogenetics or mutations were excluded, the HMA + venetoclax combination still outweighed IC with respect to treatment response (IC vs. HMA + venetoclax, OR = 0.063, 95% CI 0.012-0.332, p = 0.001) and OS (IC vs. HMA + venetoclax, HR = 3.072, 95% CI 1.216-7.758 p = 0.018) in patients with an adverse risk according to 2022 European Leukemia Net guidelines. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation independently predicted superior OS (HR = 0.234, 95% CI 0.088-0.626, p = 0.004). Additionally, in patients receiving HMAs combined with venetoclax, the G646fs variant of the ASXL1 mutation was associated with a lower complete remission or with an incomplete hematological recovery rate (4/7 vs. 2/19, 42.9% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.026) and worse event-free survival (median, 14.0 months vs. not reach, p = 0.045). HMAs and venetoclax could benefit newly diagnosed younger patients with ASXL1-mutated AML.",

        "abstract": "Conducting clinical research in response to infectious disease outbreaks presents unique challenges. In a previous review, we identified a range of political, economic, administrative, regulatory, logistical, ethical and social (PEARLES) challenges and proposed solutions to effective implementation of outbreak research responses. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an update to explore if solutions recommended had been implemented, or new challenges identified. We searched seven databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, Embase, and PsycINFO, Scopus, Epistemonikos, Google Scholar) and grey literature from 01/06/2018 to 28/09/2023 for studies presenting PEARLES challenges/solutions to epi/pandemic research responses. Of 12,652 records, 191 were included. Our review identified many persisting challenges, particularly the lack of international research co-ordination, pre-planned research strategies, and limited research infrastructure in resource deprived settings. While some solutions were implemented, many remain recommendations e.g. pre-prepared regulatory guidelines and protocols, research infrastructure investment and international research coordination. Our data shows an urgent need to address challenges identified, implement and evaluate recommended solutions, to strengthen global health security to new and (re-) emerging epidemics and pandemics.",

        "abstract": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection continues to cause enormous damage in the world despite the multiple strategies developed for the response. That's why the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has adopted an acceleration strategy for this response with a view to eliminating HIV/AIDS by the year 2030. Nevertheless, access to screening, which remains underserved in Cameroon, is the first pillar on which actions must be taken to achieve this objective. This study aimed to identify factors associated with low HIV testing in Maroua 1 Health District (MHD1). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 808 participants aged 15 to 65 years living in the Maroua 1 Health District between September and December 2022. Data were collected by means of a non-probabilistic survey using a structured questionnaire sutured into socio-demographic characteristics, socio-cultural factors, and factors linked to the healthcare system. These factors were assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis, and associations were established by calculating Odds ratios, confidence intervals, and P-values. Statistical significance was declared at P < 0.05. The results showed that the study participants had a mean age of 32.7 years (SD ± 11) and males (57.18%) outnumbered females (42.82%). A total number of 383 (47.40%) participants had already taken a screening test, and 97 (12%) had done so in the last 12 months. Furthermore, it was noted that being a man (AOR = 2.79; CI = 1.83-4.31; P-value < 0.001), young (AOR = 7.95; CI = 4.02-16.2; p -p-value < 0.001), single (AOR = 1.97; CI = 1.19-3.27; p-value = 0.02), informal education (AOR = 5.25; CI = 2.26-12.45; p-value < 0.001 ), having low knowledge about HIV (AOR = 8.77; CI = 4.60-17.24; p-value < 0.001), having a stigmatizing opinion (AOR = 2.46; CI = 1.36-4.38; p-value < 0.001), not being in a relationship with a partner (AOR = 1.70; CI = 1.04-2.79; p-value = 0.03), never been sensitized by a health worker (AOR = 1.82; CI = 1.21-2.75; p-value = 0.001), and not visiting a health facility during the last 12 months (AOR = 1.75; CI = 1.06-2.75; p-value = 0.02) were associated with low screening. This study identified several factors associated with low HIV testing rates in the Maroua 1 health district in Cameroon, including male gender, young age, celibacy, lack of education, low HIV knowledge, stigmatizing attitudes, absence of a stable partner, lack of awareness by health care workers and low use of health services. Addressing these factors in HIV testing interventions is essential to achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets and eliminating HIV by 2030. Targeted public health policies and improved access to testing services are needed to combat the epidemic in this region.",

        "abstract": "Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT) has shown encouraging short-term outcomes in patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but data on long-term survival remain limited. This study compared the therapeutic efficacy, safety, and 2-year survival outcomes of NICT versus surgery alone. We retrospectively analyzed patients with locally advanced resectable ESCC who underwent either NICT followed by surgery or upfront surgery alone. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 188 patients were included, with 60 receiving NICT and 128 undergoing surgery alone. The NICT group achieved better 2-year DFS (76.7% vs. 57.0%, P = 0.021) and OS (86.7% vs. 68.0%, P = 0.0053), with similar rates of postoperative complications (40.0% vs. 37.5%, P = 0.742). No ≥ grade 3 postoperative complications occurred in the NICT group, while three cases (2.3%) were observed in the surgery-alone group. Pathological responses to NICT included 28.3% complete response (pCR) and 61.7% major response (MPR). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 20.0% of NICT patients, with no grade ≥ 4 events. Patients achieving pCR or MPR had significantly better survival outcomes than non-responders. Survival outcomes were similar between 2-cycle and > 2-cycle NICT regimens. ECOG performance status, coronary artery disease, and treatment modality were identified as independent prognostic factors. NICT followed by surgery demonstrated favorable pathological response and 2-year survival outcomes in locally advanced ESCC, supporting its potential as a neoadjuvant strategy pending further prospective validation.",

Imaging is essential for evaluating residual disease status, overcoming sampling errors inherent with other MRD modalities. The accuracy of whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) has led to its incorporation into MM diagnostic imaging guidelines. We report here on the prospective iTIMM trial (image-guided theranostics in MM; NCT02403102), designed to evaluate imaging residual disease using contemporary, functional WB-MRI as per MY-RADS protocol. In iTIMM, 70 MM patients planned to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation ASCT in newly diagnosed MM or at first relapse, underwent WB-MRI before start of induction and at day 100 post-ASCT. Patients with residual disease post-ASCT (RAC2 or higher) had shorter progression-free survival (median 24 months, 95% confidence interval (CI): 19-41 vs. 42 months, 95% CI: 37-not evaluable (NE), log-rank p = 0.013; hazard ratio (HR) 2.09 (95% CI: 1.15-3.78) and overall survival (median 47 months, 95% CI: 30.9-NE vs. NE (95% CI: NE-NE), p = 0.002, HR = 5.45 (95% CI: 1.67-17.87) than those without (RAC1).

        "abstract": "Depression is a prevalent disorder with significant health impacts. Physical activity is known to protect against depression, but its effects may vary in populations with disrupted sleep patterns, such as weekend catch-up sleepers, which refers to participants who sleep longer on weekends than on weekdays. This study examines the dose-response relationship between physical activity and depression in this population. Data from 1,906 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2021-2023) were analyzed. Physical activity was measured in MET-minutes per week, and depression was assessed using the PHQ-9. Multivariate linear regression, restricted cubic spline, and two-part linear regression models were employed. In the adjusted model, physical activity showed a negative trend with depression, though this association did not reach statistical significance in the fully adjusted model. Stratified analyses revealed stronger associations in women (OR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.99, P = 0.0329) and individuals aged 40-60 years (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.97, P = 0.0237). A threshold effect was observed, with physical activity below 2.48 MET-min/1000-wk showing a negative association with depression (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.85, P = 0.0006). Beyond this threshold, the relationship changed. A nonlinear relationship between physical activity and depression was identified in weekend catch-up sleepers, with moderate activity levels (2.48 MET-min/1000-wk) offering the greatest mental health benefits, particularly in women and individuals aged 40-60 years.

        "abstract": "Enhancing the mental health literacy of students stands out as a crucial factor in mitigating social harm within society. This randomized controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of a mental health literacy program called the \"Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide,\" consisting of six modules (1) Understanding mental health and mental illness, (2) Stigma of mental illness, (3) Information about specific mental illnesses, (4) experiences of mental illness, (5) seeking and receiving support, and (6) the importance of positive mental health. Which was introduced in the first secondary schools in the southeastern region of Iran in 2023. There were 40 teachers and 562 students from 20 schools involved in the study and randomly divided in two groups of intervention and control groups. The levels of mental health literacy, knowledge, and attitudes towards mental illness were measured using a questionnaire in two control and intervention groups, both before and after the mental health curriculum was implemented. A two-day training workshop was initially conducted for the intervention group teachers to familiarize them with the mental health curriculum. Following this preparation, the teachers introduced and implemented the mental health literacy curriculum in their classrooms for the students. The results of the study showed that the intervention group showed notable improvements in mental health literacy, with mean scores rising from 81 ± 6.80 to 98 ± 9.23, while the control group had no significant change (p < 0.001). Similar significant gains were observed in mental health knowledge and attitudes (p < 0.001). Mental health knowledge scores increased from 11.12 ± 4.31 to 18.42 ± 3.28, and scores on mental disorders improved from 19.76 ± 5.26 to 22.60 ± 3.83, with no significant changes in the control group (p < 0.001). Also, the results showed that after adjusting the influencing factors (gender, teacher, number of children in the family), mental health literacy (p < 0.001), mental health knowledge (p < 0.001), attitude to mental illness/disorders (p < 0.002) had a significant effect.

The extent of engagement in critical care trials in Australia and New Zealand is unknown, following introduction of national guidelines in 2016. To assess the extent of patient and family engagement in adult critical care research studies endorsed by the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group (ANZICS CTG). Prospective studies endorsed between January 2017 - December 2023 or previously endorsed and still recruiting during this period were included. The study design included a two-stage process: 1) retrospective independent assessment of patient and family engagement in study protocols, progress reports, and manuscripts and 2) prospective self-reported survey of study principal investigators and project managers to understand priority of engagement, types of activities, barriers and facilitators. Both stages assessed engagement using a modified version of an existing tool developed by the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group (CCCTG) Patient and Family Partnership Committee. The Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and Public 2 (GRIPP2) tool was also used in Stage 1. Stage 1: Retrospective analysis using CCCTG and GRIPP2 tools. Of the 35 studies reviewed in Stage 1, patient and family engagement was infrequently reported [reported in eight protocols submitted to ANZICS CTG for endorsement (8/35, 23%), reported in one trial progress report (1/34, 3%) and in one protocol publication (1/17, 6%), and not reported in the ten primary trial publications (0/10, 0%)]. Stage 2: Survey responses using CCCTG tool. Twenty-eight of 35 studies (80%) had at least one survey response. Respondents for 20 of these studies (20/28, 71%) reported undertaking some form of patient and family engagement. The most common facilitator of engagement was staff engagement experience (12/28, 43%), and lack of resources (12/28, 43%) was identified as a key barrier. This study identified low rates of reported patient and family engagement in clinical trial protocols and manuscripts via independent appraisal, compared to a high self-reported rate of engagement activities, among studies endorsed via ANZICS CTG.

        "abstract": "Despite longstanding oyster cooking recommendations, outbreaks associated with cooked oysters still occur. A survey of U.S.-based restaurants was conducted to investigate common cooking practices, including steaming, baking, and roasting. Target restaurants were identified using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and surveyed through live phone interviews and online. The questionnaire included open- and closed-ended questions for restaurant staff, including chefs and managers, with topics covering customer and serving quantities, source of purchase, common cooking methods, cooking time and temperature combinations, and the use of thermometers. A total of 105 complete responses were collected from California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington. On a weekly basis, the majority of restaurants served 1-1,000 customers with 1-500 dozen oysters. The most frequently used cooking methods were frying (46%), followed by baking (36%), steaming (30%), and then roasting (23%). On average, baking was performed at a temperature of 185 ± 64°C for 9 ± 4 minutes, roasting at 207 ± 54°C for 8 ± 6 minutes, and steaming for 5 ± 3 minutes, with no correlation being found between cooking time and temperature for either technique. Additionally, 57% of the surveyed restaurants did not use thermometers when cooking oysters. This study highlights the variations in oyster cooking practices in U.S. restaurants, emphasizing the need to assess the effectiveness of different cooking techniques through quantitative microbial risk assessment of the most common pathogens in oysters. This will help improve food safety guidelines and minimize health risks associated with the consumption of partially cooked oysters.",

To raise awareness, we present representative cases and virological data from different specialties across three German university hospitals. Following a nationwide survey by the AGIHO in March 2024 indicating increased PB19V infections, we conducted a retrospective, multi-center descriptive study across Munich, Cologne, and Magdeburg. Anonymized clinical and virological data from 2022 to 2024 were collected, including patient demographics, underlying diseases, and diagnostic findings. Acute PB19V infection was defined by real-time quantitative PCR-based detection of PB19V DNA in any specimen. Clinical manifestations of acute PB19V infections can range from severe anemia and pancytopenia in hematologic patients, to fetal hydrops in pregnant women, and systemic inflammatory symptoms in patients with chronic conditions. In 2024, the Max von Pettenkofer Institute in Munich conducted 936 PB19V PCR tests. A marked increase in positive cases was observed in early 2024, with positivity rates of 16% in Q1 and 18.2% in Q2, compared to an annual positivity rate of 2.3% in 2023. Similar trends were seen at the University Hospitals Cologne and Magdeburg. Most infections were acute with high viral loads. Most cases originated from pediatric, gynecologic, and hematologic departments, highlighting particularly vulnerable patient populations. This resurgence in symptomatic PB19V infections, likely driven by pandemic-related shifts in immunity and exposure, underscores the need for heightened clinical awareness, early testing in high-risk populations, and sustained surveillance to anticipate future outbreaks.",

Cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey. Dental clinics throughout Japan. Dentists at the participating clinics. Questionnaires were sent to 1,700 dental care facilities in July 2020, and responses were collected until September 2020. The survey gathered data on clinic characteristics, provision of on-site antimicrobial dispensing, choice of antimicrobials, and knowledge regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and infective endocarditis (IE). Descriptive epidemiology and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with on-site dispensing of penicillins and their use as the first-choice antimicrobial. Responses were obtained from 342 (response rate: 20.1 %) dentists from dental clinics. While 93.9% of respondents were aware of the term \"AMR,\" only 20.8% were familiar with Japan's National Action Plan on AMR. AMR countermeasures were implemented in 79.4% of clinics, but 58.4% of respondents lacked awareness of IE guidelines. In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, \"adherence to IE guidelines\" (odds ratio: 2.56, <i>P</i> = .001) and \"clinic stocks ≥2 antimicrobials\" (5.02, <i>P</i> = .002) were positively associated with on-site dispensing of penicillins.

        "title": "Conducting the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2023 in Malaysia with focus on methodology and main findings on non-communicable diseases.",
        "abstract": "The National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS), which focuses on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), their risk factors and healthcare demand, is a cross-sectional, nationwide, population-based survey conducted every four-year cycle since 2011. NHMS 2023 was the 7th cycle of NCDs, their risk factors and healthcare demand, which aimed to monitor trends in diseases and healthcare utilisation. This article outlines the methodology, sociodemographic characteristics, and overall findings from the population surveyed in 2023 regarding NCDs, their risk factors, and various health-related topics. This survey utilised a two-stage stratified random sampling design and encompassed fifteen main scopes, with sample sizes calculated to meet the specific requirements of each scope. Conducted from July to September 2023, it involved the random selection of 499 enumeration blocks(EBs) by the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) across all states and federal territories in Malaysia. The step resulted in the selection of 5,988 living quarters (LQs). Data collection methods included validated questionnaires administered through face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires, alongside clinical assessments and blood investigations using calibrated devices. To ensure the high quality of the collected data, we implemented stringent quality control measures. Furthermore, we applied complex sampling analyses to ensure that the findings accurately represented the population in Malaysia. The survey received responses from 13,616 individuals out of the 5,006 LQs that were successfully visited, resulting in an overall response rate of the survey of 83.2%, which includes individuals aged 5 years and above. A substantial segment of the population lived in urban regions, comprising 77.6% of the total. About half of the population consisted of males (51.9%), Malay (54.6%), and individuals who had attained secondary education (54.2%). Additionally, 20.0% of the population were within the age range of 30 to 39 years. The weighted prevalence of diabetes was 15.6%, hypertension 29.2%, hypercholesterolaemia 33.3%, overweight and obesity 54.4%. Depression among adults was 4.6%, while mental health problems among children were reported at 16.5%. The current tobacco smokers prevalence was 19.0%, and 29.9% of adults in Malaysia were physically inactive. The known asthma prevalence among adults was 6.2%, while the current asthma among children was 3.4%. Additionally, 37.7% of adults experienced sleep insufficiency. The results indicate that the higher proportion of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia, particularly among the young age group, and the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, as well as mental health problems,  are making the healthcare system deal with more non-communicable diseases, complications, and problems. The methodology of this survey is robust for a population-based study. We took comprehensive steps to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The findings indicate an urgent need for targeted public health interventions to address the escalating health issues. By focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies, we can mitigate the impact of NCDs on the healthcare system and improve overall population health.",

        "abstract": "The study aimed to explore the acceptability of reducing the frequency of asymptomatic <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (Ct) and <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (Ng) screening among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM)(Although the term GBMSM is used for convenience, the study also includes nonbinary people who were assigned male at birth who have sex with men.). Additionally, it sought to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing such changes and to develop potential interventions that could support a shift in current screening guidelines. This qualitative study explored stakeholder perspectives on reducing screening frequency and identified potential interventions that could support future guideline changes of this kind. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 GBMSM and 8 professional stakeholders. Data were thematically analysed using the Capabilty, Opportunity, Motivation - Behaviour (COM-B) and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). TDF domains were mapped to behaviour change techniques to inform intervention development. Candidate interventions were refined based on acceptability, practicability, effectiveness, affordability, side effects, equity. Overall, GBMSM stakeholder responses to discontinuing asymptomatic Ng and Ct screening tended to be negative, while professional stakeholder opinions were mixed. Reducing the recommended screening frequency to 6 monthly was generally more acceptable to both groups. Barriers and facilitators to guideline changes included issues of knowledge and trust, social influence and identity, context and resources, concerns about consequences and emotional responses and habit. Ten candidate interventions were suggested. These involve providing information, social support, behavioural substitutions and feedback as well as facilitating discussions to resolve concerns. Any reduction in the recommended frequency of asymptomatic screening will encounter a range of interrelated barriers, including knowledge gaps, social influences and emotional factors. We identified evidence-based interventions that could improve acceptance and minimise unintended consequences. Future research should incorporate stakeholder workshops to refine these strategies.",

        "abstract": "Metabolic disorders play a significant role in determining the length of hospital stay following hip fracture surgery in elderly patients. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct an in-depth investigation into the relationship between stress-induced hyperglycemia-one of the manifestations of metabolic disorders-and hospitalization duration in this patient population. This retrospective cohort study analyzed medical records of patients who underwent hip fracture surgery at a tertiary medical institution between January 2017 and November 2024. LASSO regression identified covariates for multivariate logistic regression. Propensity score matching minimized bias. Standardized mean differences assessed group balance. Logistic regression, restricted cubic splines, and dose-response analyses examined associations between blood glucose levels and LOS. Subgroup and threshold analyses evaluated robustness. A total of 1,279 patients were included, with 673 (52.6%) having persistent preoperative hyperglycemia. The mean age was 74.7 ± 9.6 years, with 39.7% male and 60.3% female. Persistent hyperglycemia was significantly associated with prolonged LOS. Multivariate logistic regression showed a 12% increase in LOS for each unit increase in preoperative glucose (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.18). Propensity score matching confirmed this association, with a significant linear trend (P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed interactions with gender, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Preoperative blood glucose levels are significantly associated with prolonged LOS in elderly hip fracture patients, showing a nonlinear dose-response relationship. Each 1 mmol/L increase in glucose raises LOS risk by 12%, with stronger correlations in females and diabetics. Timely intervention is critical above 6.16 mmol/L.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, which generate human-like responses based on extensive data, are becoming important tools in healthcare by providing information on health conditions, treatments, and preventive measures, acting as virtual assistants. However, their performance in aligning with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for providing answers to complex clinical questions on lumbosacral radicular pain is still unclear. We aim to evaluate AI chatbots' performance against CPG recommendations for diagnosing and treating lumbosacral radicular pain. We performed a cross-sectional study to assess AI chatbots' responses against CPGs recommendations for diagnosing and treating lumbosacral radicular pain. Clinical questions based on these CPGs were posed to the latest versions (updated in 2024) of six AI chatbots: ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity. The chatbots' responses were evaluated for (a) consistency of text responses using Plagiarism Checker X, (b) intra- and inter-rater reliability using Fleiss' Kappa, and (c) match rate with CPGs. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA/MP 16.1. We found high variability in the text consistency of AI chatbot responses (median range 26%-68%). Intra-rater reliability ranged from \"almost perfect\" to \"substantial,\" while inter-rater reliability varied from \"almost perfect\" to \"moderate.\" Perplexity had the highest match rate at 67%, followed by Google Gemini at 63%, and Microsoft Copilot at 44%. ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4o, and Claude showed the lowest performance, each with a 33% match rate. Despite the variability in internal consistency and good intra- and inter-rater reliability, the AI Chatbots' recommendations often did not align with CPGs recommendations for diagnosing and treating lumbosacral radicular pain. Clinicians and patients should exercise caution when relying on these AI models, since one to two-thirds of the recommendations provided may be inappropriate or misleading according to specific chatbots.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the workload and staffing study of hospital cancer registries conducted in 2024 was to update previous studies of workload and staffing guidelines. The population studied was composed of hospital cancer registries. Potential respondents for this study were hospital registry leads identified in the National Cancer Registrars Association (NCRA) membership database and their cancer registry staff. An online survey was sent to lead registrars along with directions for forwarding a separate cancer registrar survey to their staff. Postsurvey interviews were conducted with 11 experts in the field to review findings and discuss the future of the cancer registry workforce. There were 237 responses to the registry lead survey (RLS) and 290 responses to the cancer registrar survey (CRS). Results indicated a 22% increase in the mean budgeted full-time equivalents (FTEs) from 2019 in 2022; yet filled FTEs decreased slightly from 2019 to 2022. Registry leads reported that nearly half of their staff need additional training in data analysis and were very concerned about recruiting qualified staff, providing adequate compensation, and funding additional positions. Caseload continued to be the main predictor of staffing needs, as in the previous study. In staffing models, we found that for single-institution registries, for every 1,000 cases, staffing should increase by 1.8 to 2.1 FTEs. For multi-institution registries, staffing should increase by 1.6 to 1.9 FTEs for every 1,000 cases. Postsurvey interviewees were concerned about industry-wide vacancies and worker burnout. They mentioned contributing factors such as low wages, lack of recognition, isolated work, the lack of credentialed registrars, and pending retirements. They stressed that technological innovations and automation will not eliminate the registrar's role but will change it. These changes in registrar work may create more specialization in the role such as in data analytics and acting on real-time data and reporting. These changes may also create new career paths that would attract future students and workers to the cancer registry profession. Findings from this study may be useful for hospital registries to benchmark their own workload and staffing and to cancer registry organization leaders in planning for the future.",

There are limited data on the effect of thrombolysis-to-puncture time (TTP) on outcomes in patients with AIS undergoing IVT plus EVT. We selected 1,104 patients receiving IVT + EVT for anterior circulation LVO stroke from 2 prospective nationwide registries (259 cases from ANGEL-ACT in China: November 2017 to March 2019, 845 cases from German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment in Germany: June 2015 to December 2019). Based on the TTP, eligible patients were divided into 4 groups (≤30 min, 31-50 min, 51-70 min, and >70 min). The radiologic and clinical outcomes (e.g., successful recanalization [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b-3] at final angiogram, modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0-2 at 90 days, any intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], and symptomatic ICH within 24 hours) among the 4 groups were compared by χ<sup>2</sup> tests for trend and using multivariable logistic regression models. In the 4 groups from ≤30 min to >70 min, 226, 282, 230, and 366 patients were included, respectively. An increased TTP was associated with a lower chance of successful recanalization (<i>p</i> = 0.016) and mRS score 0-2 (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Compared with the group of ≤30 min, the group of >70 min was less likely to achieve successful recanalization (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.89) and the groups of 50-70 min and >70 min had a reduced probability of mRS score 0-2 (adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.78; adjusted OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85). No significant differences were found for any ICH or symptomatic ICH among the 4 groups after adjustment with potential confounders. Delay from thrombolysis to puncture should be minimized when considering bridging IVT before EVT for patients with AIS due to anterior circulation LVO.

        "abstract": "Macrosomia, a critical perinatal complication, is closely linked to maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the extent to which GDM status modifies the association between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and macrosomia, particularly across demographic subgroups, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify glycemic status-specific risk thresholds and explore subgroup interactions in a large prospective cohort. In this prospective cohort study, 34,031 women initiating antenatal care before 14 weeks of gestation were enrolled at a tertiary hospital in Central China (2013-2019). Participants were stratified by GDM status and pre-pregnancy BMI categories. Multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, and interaction analyses evaluated associations between BMI and macrosomia (birth weight ≥ 4,000 g), adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical covariates. Macrosomia incidence was markedly higher in GDM (6.2%) vs. non-GDM pregnancies (3.6%). Adjusted models revealed a steeper dose-response gradient in GDM: each 1-unit BMI increase conferred 24% higher odds (aOR: 1.24 [95% CI 1.20, 1.28]) in GDM vs. 13% (aOR: 1.13 [1.11, 1.15]) in non-GDM. Obesity amplified risk 6.80-fold (aOR: 6.80 [4.02, 11.51]) in GDM vs. 4.70-fold (aOR: 4.70 [3.12, 7.10]) in non-GDM. RCS models identified nonlinear trajectories in both GDM and non-GDM pregnancies (reference level: 22.94 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for GDM and 25.10 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for non-GDM). Significant interactions were observed in GDM pregnancies, and the association between pre-pregnancy BMI values and macrosomia was stronger in women < 35 years (aOR: 1.29 vs. ≥35 years, aOR: 1.15), primigravida (aOR: 1.61 vs. multigravida, aOR: 1.18), primiparous (aOR: 1.36 vs. multiparous, aOR: 1.18), and female infants (aOR: 1.29 vs. male, aOR: 1.20). In non-GDM pregnancies, only parity (primiparous, aOR: 1.08 vs. multiparous, aOR: 1.19) and gravidity (primigravida, aOR: 1.05 vs. multigravida, aOR: 1.19) modified the pre-pregnancy BMI-macrosomia relationship. GDM status modifies pre-pregnancy BMI-associated macrosomia risks, with distinct thresholds and subgroup vulnerabilities. These findings necessitate glycemic status-specific clinical guidelines and precision interventions targeting high-risk subgroups. Universal preconception weight optimization remains pivotal for non-GDM populations.

Serotype 12 is generally considered to be of low virulence and is typically associated with subclinical infections. However, we describe four atypical serotype 12 field strains recovered from severe clinical outbreaks in Chile. These strains exhibited an unusual toxin gene profile (apxIICA, apxIIICA, apxIBD, apxIIIBD), suggesting the ability to produce both ApxII and ApxIII toxins. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that these atypical strains carry the capsule genes of serotype 12 but the LPS biosynthesis genes of serotype 15, indicating a hybrid genomic structure. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that they cluster separately from classical serotype 12 strains and are closely related to other atypical strains from Japan, USA, and Canada. Experimental infection in pigs demonstrated significantly increased virulence of the atypical Chilean strain compared to the reference strain of serotype 12, with higher clinical scores, severe lung lesions, and atypical serological responses against serotypes 3/6/8/15/17. These findings challenge the traditional view of serotype 12 as low-virulence and highlight the need for improved diagnostic approaches that incorporate both capsule and LPS profiling.

        "abstract": "Given the limited treatment options recommended for cancer of unknown primary (CUP), especially the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ICIs and identify associated genomic biomarkers in these patients. This retrospective, multicenter, real-world analysis included individuals with oncologist-confirmed CUP cases treated with ICIs across four hospitals in China. Clinical outcomes, safety and biomarkers were analyzed. Between January 2016 and November 2023, 124 patients were enrolled. Of these, 117 patients underwent combination therapy, predominantly ICIs with taxane-platinum based chemotherapy (54.84%), while 7 received monotherapy. After a median follow-up of 18.6 months, the median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 23.20 and 38.86 months, respectively. According to ESMO guideline, patients were stratified into favorable (n = 41) and unfavorable subset (n = 83). The favorable subset demonstrated significantly longer PFS and OS than the unfavorable subset (median PFS NR vs. 9.7 months, P < 0.001; median OS NR vs. 23.73 months, P < 0.001). There are 31 patients in our cohort whose PD-L1 detection results are available, while 25 patients was eligible for TMB assessment. Better clinical efficacy of ICIs was apparent for tumors with a higher PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 20) and a greater tumor mutation burden (> 12 mutations/Mb). Multivariate analyses revealed that higher ECOG performance status, the presence of visceral metastasis, and KRAS mutation were independently associated with inferior PFS and OS. Immune-related adverse events occurred in 49 (39.52%) patients, with one developing grade 3 pneumonia. The application of ICIs showed encouraging efficacy with an acceptable safety profile, suggesting its potential as an additional therapeutic option for CUP patients. Identifying predictive markers for ICIs response remains essential to enhance therapeutic strategies in CUP management.",

        "title": "Dissecting the genetic basis of response to salmonid alphavirus in Atlantic salmon.",
        "abstract": "The development of effective disease management strategies is crucial for the assurance of welfare and sustainability of the aquaculture industries. Pancreas disease (PD) is a major challenge faced by Atlantic salmon aquaculture with viral outbreaks resulting in substantial production losses and raising significant welfare concerns for farmed salmon populations. Previous research has identified several quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with PD resistance accounting for a substantial additive genetic component. However, pinpointing the underlying causal variation remains challenging, partly due to the location of the QTL within duplicated regions of the Atlantic salmon genome that share high sequence similarity. The present study leverages the latest advancements in Atlantic salmon genomics in order to uncover the genetic landscape underlying PD resistance and identify genomic variation with putative functional impact on disease response. Association mapping and haplotype analysis of fish challenged with salmonid alphavirus (SAV3), either through peritoneal injection or infectious cohabitation, confirmed the presence of a major QTL region on chromosome Ssa03. Additionally, another QTL on Ssa07 was detected, linked to infection-specific response. Transcriptomics analysis of the genes overlapping the Ssa03 QTL region revealed significant expression differences among three tandemly duplicated gig1-like genes, whereas allele-specific expression analysis detected several SNPs with putative functional impact on the particular genes. Use of long-read sequencing and construction of disease-associated haplotypes identified more complex variation in the region, offering a detailed exploration of the genetic architecture underlying PD resistance. Finally, integration of the regulatory landscape of Atlantic salmon during response to viral infection improved genomic resolution, providing novel insight into the potential causal variation underlying pancreas disease in Atlantic salmon. This study provides a detailed investigation of the genetic architecture underlying PD resistance in farmed Atlantic salmon. Using advanced genomic resources, three copies of the gig1-like gene were identified as likely causal candidates for a major QTL associated with PD resistance. Additionally, genomic variations with potential functional impact on gig1-like expression were uncovered. These findings hold promise for application in developing effective disease management strategies in Atlantic salmon aquaculture.",

We explore how individual and lifestyle factors influence these risks by shaping gut microbiome composition. 1001 healthy participants from all Spanish regions provided personal and dietary data at baseline, six, and twelve months, yielding 2475 responses. Gut microbiome data were analyzed for 500 healthy participants and 321 IBD patients. Our findings reveal that adherence to national dietary guidelines-characterized by diets rich in nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables-was associated with greater microbial diversity and reduced IBD-related dysbiosis. Finally, we observed variations in dietary patterns and microbiome diversity and composition across age groups, genders, regions, seasons, and transit time. This study is among the first to uncover dietary intake associated with IBD-related dysbiosis and to propose an interactive website for participants ( https://manichanh.vhir.org/POP/en ).",

        "abstract": "To analyze the trend in Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) utilization in recent years and to assess its current clinical profile and surgical indications in glaucoma management. A retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System, evaluating AGV surgeries performed from 2010 to 2022. To characterize current AGV use, a subset of 156 eyes that underwent surgery in the past five years was analyzed. Clinical variables, including age, gender, glaucoma type, intraocular pressure (IOP), IOP-lowering medications, and visual field status, were collected from patients aged ≥ 18 years. Temporal trends, surgical indications, and their evolution were examined. A total of 519 AGV implantations were included. AGV utilization increased from 15.2% of all glaucoma surgeries in 2010 to 27.5% in 2019 but significantly declined thereafter, reaching 6.9% in 2022 (p = 0.001). Among the 156 eyes in the recent subset, 93 had refractory glaucoma, which showed the most pronounced decline in AGV procedures and the poorest surgical outcomes. Eyes with sulcus-placed or aphakic lenses, uveitis, or neovascular glaucoma experienced a less marked reduction in AGV implantation rates. These cases presented with higher baseline IOP but exhibited less glaucomatous damage and a better response to AGV implantation. AGV implantation has significantly declined over the past five years, particularly in refractory glaucoma. This trend may be attributed to the increased adoption of subconjunctival bleb-forming surgeries and to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this overall decline, AGV continues to be primarily employed in cases of secondary glaucoma.",

        "abstract": "The social isolation measures implemented during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 have had lasting effects on public health and well-being. In response, a growing body of discourse has emerged to examine the long-term impacts of the pandemic on human health and welfare. Addressing these complex challenges requires innovative, interdisciplinary approaches grounded in a conceptual framework that integrates perspectives from both the social and natural sciences. At the intersection of human-animal-green space interactions, the One Health framework has become a prominent driver of holistic health research. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on how this framework has been applied to investigate the interconnected health and well-being outcomes associated with these dynamics. To fill this gap, the present study conducted a systematic scoping review to identify patterns, gaps, and key themes in the literature, while outlining priorities and considerations for future research. Following standardized PRISMA guidelines, the review employed clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, along with dual-reviewer screening and data extraction procedures. A total of 29 studies were included, all of which directly or indirectly utilized the One Health framework. These studies were categorized into two primary thematic areas: (1) the role of green spaces in promoting human health in the post-pandemic context, and (2) emotional interactions between humans and animals during the pandemic. A notable trend in the literature is the incorporation of the Sense of Coherence as a key dimension of health and well-being within the One Health framework, highlighting the potential of human-dog-green space interactions to contribute meaningfully to salutogenic health processes. The limited number of studies identified also reflects the current underrepresentation of well-being as a core pillar within established One Health research. Based on existing evidence, this review provides a foundational reference for researchers seeking to explore health and well-being through a One Health perspective. It offers guidance for future investigations into the synergistic effects of human-dog-green space interactions on well-being, and proposes data-driven interventions and policy recommendations to address both general health outcomes and the prolonged effects of COVID-19.",

The study registered in the PROSPERO database adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from inception to June 2024-23 studies included in the meta-analysis. A total of 1853 participants aged 29.8-45 years old were included in the meta-analysis. The human studies reporting the effect of intraovarian PRP injection on ovarian reserve indicators were included in the meta-analysis. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook or the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The primary outcomes were serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), Estradiol, and antral follicle count (AFC), number of retrieved oocytes, metaphase II (M2) oocytes, and pregnancy and live birth rates. The pooled analysis of the included studies showed that intraovarian PRP injection significantly increased oocyte number (WMD: 0.97, 95% CI 0.58, 1.35, P < 0.001), M2 oocyte number (WMD: 0.80, 95% CI 0.33, 1.27, P < 0.001), AFC (WMD: 1.64, 95% CI 0.90, 2.38, P < 0.001), and AMH levels (WMD: 0.12 ng/mL, 95% CI 0.07, 0.17, P < 0.001) in women with POR. Besides, in women with POI, PRP injection significantly improved AFC (WMD: 1.33, 95% CI 1.19, 1.47, P < 0.001) and serum levels of FSH (WMD: - 15.68 IU/mL, 95% CI - 24.12, - 7.24, P < 0.001), AMH (WMD: 0.29 ng/mL, 95% CI 0.08, 0.49, P = 0.006), and LH (WMD: - 9.87 IU/mL, 95% CI - 15.23, - 4.51, P < 0.001). The meta-analysis revealed a pregnancy ratio of 0.21 and a live birth ratio of 0.18 in women with poor ovarian reserve after PRP injection. In women with POI, the figures were marginally lower, recorded as 0.138 for pregnancy and 0.10 for live birth, respectively. PRP may serve as an alternative therapy for POI and POR; however, further investigation is required to validate its efficacy and determine suitable candidates.",

This study examined the mediating role of resilience in the associations between PTG and both depression and anxiety among NPC survivors. A total of 773 NPC survivors were recruited through convenience sampling at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China). Participants completed a self-administered structured questionnaire measuring sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), posttraumatic growth (PTGI), and resilience (CD-RISC10). Mediation analyses were performed using structural equation modeling. The average time since cancer diagnosis was 2.68 (SD = 1.80) years, with 55.0% diagnosed for over 2 years. Among the participants, 44.2% reported mild to severe depressive symptoms, and 35.3% reported mild to severe anxiety. Higher PTG was significantly associated with lower symptoms of depression (β = -0.23, p < 0.001) and anxiety (β = -0.19, p < 0.001). Additionally, greater resilience was associated with reduced symptoms of depression (β = -0.37, p < 0.001) and anxiety (β = -0.33, p < 0.001). Further, resilience fully mediated the relationship between PTG and both anxiety (86.50%) and depression (74.13%). PTG and resilience are negatively associated with depression and anxiety in NPC survivors, with resilience acting as a complete mediator in these relationships.",

        "abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) causes acute febrile illness and can lead to complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital disorders. As arbovirus outbreaks increase, vaccination becomes a crucial preventive strategy. Currently, no commercial vaccines are available for ZIKV, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and bodily fluids, underscoring the need for a safe vaccine that induces both systemic and mucosal immune responses. In this study, we present a ZIKV vaccine candidate utilizing virus-like particles (VLPs) technology combined with variant-specific surface proteins (VSP) from Giardia lamblia. Previous research demonstrated that these VSP act as effective adjuvants and are resistant to gastrointestinal degradation, expanding administration possibilities via orogastric routes in addition to the conventional subcutaneous route. To develop the immunogen, we engineered retrovirus-derived VLPs decorated with the ZIKV envelope glycoprotein (ZIKV-E) as the target antigen, incorporating VSPs on their surface. Immunocompetent Balb/c mice were immunized with VSP-VLPs ZIKV-E via oral and subcutaneous routes. Immune characterization revealed robust systemic and mucosal humoral responses, as well as a specific cellular activation. Moreover, a significant neutralizing capacity of serum antibodies was observed. These findings highlight the potential of the vaccine candidate to elicit a targeted immune response, achieved through different administration methods.",

Consistently and increasingly active individuals had around 20-40% lower risk of all-cause mortality and 30-40% lower risk of CVD mortality; however, the associations with decreasing PA patterns were less evident. Time-varying and cumulative/average PA illustrated similar inverse associations between higher PA levels and all-cause and CVD mortality. The associations were weaker and less robust for cancer mortality. Non-linear dose-response associations suggested risk reductions in all-cause and CVD mortality for meeting PA guidelines, but consistent/increasing PA below the guidelines also provided health benefits.

        "abstract": "Community-acquired pneumonia is the leading global cause of infection-related death. A subset of patients with pneumonia develops aberrant immune responses, resulting in harmful inflammation, tissue damage and significant mortality. Immunomodulatory therapies aim to blunt this dysregulated immune response and reduce resultant injury. No consensus exists on the use or impacts of immunomodulatory therapies in the management of community-acquired pneumonia. This protocol describes the methods we will use to undertake a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the effects of immunomodulatory therapies on the mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. We will undertake a systematic review and network meta-analysis investigating the use of immunomodulatory therapies in community-acquired pneumonia. Our protocol has been developed and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines and prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024565301). The primary objectives of this work are to compare the impact of immunomodulatory therapies on 28-day and 90-day mortality in adult patients admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. The secondary objectives of this work are to identify any differences in the effectiveness of these immunomodulatory therapies in managing community-acquired pneumonia of differing aetiology and severity.We will conduct a literature search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Global Health for all relevant articles until 30 June 2024. All observational, interventional and epidemiological studies published in English will be included, and each type of study design will be examined separately. All studies will have their titles and abstracts independently screened by two reviewers, followed by a full article eligibility review and data extraction. A third reviewer will adjudicate any disagreements. Data extracted will include, but not be limited to, the study design, country in which it was undertaken, patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, cause of CAP, severity of CAP), details regarding the immunomodulatory therapy and dosing used and the 28-day and 90-day mortality of each study arm. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Exposure tool for non-randomised studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomised control trials. The quality of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations for network meta-analysis framework. A quantitative synthesis of data is planned for 28-day and 90-day mortality rates.We will fit a random-effects network meta-analysis model that includes random effects for between-study heterogeneity and for inconsistency. This will be done using the metafor package for R. We will use a contrast-based approach, modelling estimated treatment effects using reference treatments. In the case of the primary objective, this will be the log odds ratio (OR) of mortality in one treatment compared with another.Each type of study design will be examined separately. Treatments using the same immunotherapy at different doses may be grouped if appropriate. This will be a systematic review of published literature; therefore, ethical approval is not required. To ensure communication of our findings, we will publish our results in a peer-reviewed journal and present our findings at appropriate local, national and international meetings. CRD42024565301.",

This study investigates the relationships between leisure-time, occupational, and transportation-related PA, along with sedentary behavior, and CKD prevalence in a nationally representative U.S. adult cohort. We analyzed 24,950 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2012. PA and sedentary behavior were assessed <i>via</i> validated questionnaires. Participants were classified based on adherence to physical activity guidelines (≥150 min/week). Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic splines were used to evaluate dose-response and non-linear associations. We found that meeting PA guidelines for total, leisure-time, and occupational PA was independently associated with lower odds of CKD (OR [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.73-0.93], 0.86 [0.76-0.97], and 0.85 [0.76-0.96], respectively). No significant association was observed for transportation-related PA. Sedentary behavior exceeding 6 h/day was associated with higher CKD prevalence. These associations were more pronounced in women, and dose-response patterns were evident across PA domains. This large-scale cross-sectional study identifies robust, domain-specific inverse associations between PA and CKD prevalence, particularly among women. Findings support stratified behavioral interventions targeting leisure and occupational activity domains, alongside sedentary behavior reduction, to mitigate CKD burden. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm causal pathways.",

While familial clustering of autoimmune MG (fMG) has been described, its prevalence and clinical characteristics remain uncertain. This study aimed to characterize autoimmune fMG cases in an Israeli cohort and describe global data through a systematic literature review. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of MG patients treated at Rabin Medical Center from 2000 to 2022. The clinical and demographic features of autoimmune fMG cases-defined by compatible clinical, serological, and electrophysiological features-were compared to those of sporadic MG. Additionally, a systematic review of published autoimmune fMG cases was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Among 281 MG patients, 16 patients (5.7%) from eight families met criteria for autoimmune fMG. Compared to sporadic MG, fMG cases had a significantly younger age of onset (median 44.5 vs. 58 years, p = 0.04) and more frequently presented with severe generalized disease (MGFA class IV-V, 43.8% vs. 15%, p = 0.008). The antibody profiles, sex distribution, ocular involvement, and comorbid autoimmune diseases did not differ significantly. All fMG patients responded to immunotherapy. The systematic review identified 73 additional fMG cases, with similar trends toward earlier onset and generalized presentation. Patients with fMG in our cohort had higher rates of severe initial presentation (43.8% vs. 16.4%, p = 0.03) and underwent thymectomy less frequently (19% vs. 49.3%, p = 0.03). Autoimmune familial MG occurs in 5-6% of MG cases and is associated with a younger onset and more severe initial presentation compared to sporadic MG, but shows similar long-term treatment response. These findings suggest that genetic factors may contribute to disease susceptibility and phenotypic expression in familial MG, highlighting the need for further research into the underlying genetic and immunological mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been recognized as a valuable tool for achieving 'reification of clinical diagnosis' of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the reliability and validity of MRI results are often compromised by genetic, environmental, and clinical heterogeneity within test samples. Here, we combined MRI with other clinical findings using multimodal MRI fusion algorithm to construct a data-driven, bottom-up diagnostic approach. The covariation patterns between the multimodal MRI features and differential expression of exosomal microRNA (miRNA) were identified on a subset of 70 MDD patients and 71 healthy controls (HCs) (served as a training set) as classification features, whereas data from the other 45 MDD patients and 43 HCs served as a test set. Furthermore, longitudinal data from 28 MDD patients undergoing antidepressant treatment for six months were utilized to validate the identified biomarkers, and related signaling pathways were initially explored in depression-like mice. Plasma exosome-derived miR-151a-3p levels were found to be significantly lower in MDD patients compared to HCs and correlated with abnormal changes in functional MRI (fMRI) metrics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), visual cortex, and default mode network, etc. Then, these multimodal MRI features associated with miR-151a-3p expression distinguished MDD patients from HCs with high classification accuracy of 92.05% in support vector machine (SVM) model, outperforming the diagnostic rate when only multimodal MRI features with intergroup differences were entered (70.45%). Furthermore, 10 out of 28 MDD patients exhibited a clinically significant response to the treatment (a reduction of over 50% in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) score). The significant upregulation of plasma exosomal miR-151a-3p levels and changes of fMRI indicators were also observed in these 10 patients after treatment of six months. Animal experiments have shown that reducing the expression of miR-151-3p in ACC induces depression-like behaviors in mice, while elevating hsa-miR-151a-3p expression in ACC alleviates the depression-like behaviors of mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Our study proposed an innovative diagnostic model of MDD by combining the plasma exosome-derived miR-151a-3p expression with its associated multimodal MRI patterns, potentially serving as a novel diagnostic tool.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant disparities in vaccine distribution, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential tool to optimize vaccine distribution planning and scheduling. However, its ethical implications, including equity, transparency, bias, and accessibility, remain underexplored. Ensuring ethical AI implementation in vaccine distribution is crucial to addressing health equity challenges worldwide. This study aims to assess the ethical implications of AI-assisted vaccine distribution planning and scheduling in LMICs during pandemics. It seeks to evaluate AI's role in ensuring equitable vaccine access, analyze ethical concerns associated with its deployment, and propose an ethical framework to guide AI-based vaccine distribution strategies. Our multiphase qualitative research approach will combine a systematic scoping review, a witness seminar with key stakeholders (health care professionals, AI developers, policymakers, and bioethicists), and a meta-synthesis of findings. The scoping review will follow PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, focusing on studies from 2019 to 2023. The witness seminar will provide firsthand insights into AI's ethical impact on vaccine equity. Thematic content analysis and qualitative coding will be used for data interpretation, with findings integrated into a policy-driven ethical framework. This study received institutional ethical approval in October 2023. Recruitment commenced in mid-August 2024 through email requests to prospective participants, and recruitment for the witness seminar (focus group discussion) is still ongoing, with 7 expert participants confirmed. Data collection is projected to conclude by August 2025. Preliminary literature analysis from the scoping review is ongoing, and qualitative data analysis from the witness seminar is scheduled for September 2025. The final results and proposed ethical framework are expected to be published in early 2026. By examining the ethical implications of AI in vaccine distribution, this research will provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, health care organizations, and AI developers. The findings will contribute to the discourse on responsible AI deployment in health care worldwide, ensuring transparency, fairness, and inclusivity in pandemic response strategies.

        "abstract": "Healthy aging is associated with a decline in cognitive and motor functions, affecting daily activities and quality of life. Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with behavioral training may be a promising intervention against this decline. However, individual response variability may obscure group-level effects and mislead conclusions about tDCS efficacy. Quantifying this variability is crucial for accurately assessing stimulation effects and understanding individual response factors, like age. Yet, no study has quantitatively compared tDCS variability across age groups. This systematic review and meta-analysis examine age-related variability in cognitive and motor responses to tDCS. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed and Cochrane for studies directly comparing young and healthy older adults under similar experimental conditions. Across 19 studies comprising 390 older adults (mean ± SD age: 67 ± 5 years) and 384 young adults (mean ± SD age: 24 ± 3 years) receiving transcranial direct current (tDCS), we quantified behavioral variability using the log-transformed coefficient of variation ratio (lnCVR). Results revealed substantially higher response variability in healthy older compared to young adults during active tES (21 %, lnCVR<sub>active</sub> = -0.24 [-0.43, -0.04], p = 0.02), but not during sham conditions (lnCVR<sub>sham</sub> = -0.18 [-0.42, 0.05], p = 0.13). These findings provide the first quantitative evidence that advanced age increases behavioral tDCS response variability, highlighting the need to develop personalized tDCS approaches to optimize their efficacy in older populations.",

        "abstract": "Economic crises significantly affect mental health across individuals, families, and communities, with children and adolescents being especially vulnerable. Financial stress, parental distress, and family conflict can disrupt development and increase emotional, behavioural, and cognitive difficulties. This review uses Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory to examine how economic hardship influences youth mental health through interconnected individual, familial, and societal systems. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar for studies (2015-2025) addressing economic hardship and mental health in children, adolescents, and parents. Inclusion required original research in English or French, with low or moderate risk of bias assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and its cross-sectional adaptation (NOS-CSS). Of 7104 records, 66 studies met criteria. Findings were grouped into three domains: mental health outcomes, child development, and the parent-child relationship. Financial hardship was consistently linked to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and substance use, often in a dose-response pattern. Socioeconomic disadvantage worsened access to care and outcomes, especially among the unemployed, less educated, women, and minorities. Youth exposed to economic strain showed higher rates of self-harm and suicide risk. Developmental impact, cognitive, emotional, and physical, was mediated by maternal mental health, parenting, nutrition, and environmental stress. Parental warmth and developmental knowledge emerged as protective factors. Bronfenbrenner's framework illustrates how economic crises affect child mental health across ecological layers. Coordinated responses addressing parenting, healthcare access, policy, and early-life support are essential to mitigate long-term harm in vulnerable populations.",

        "abstract": "Estimands are increasingly used in randomised trials to clarify research objectives. The ICH E9(R1) addendum sets out five attributes necessary to describe a well-defined estimand. However, the addendum was primarily developed for individually randomised trials. There is growing recognition that estimand descriptions for cluster randomised trials, where groups of individuals are randomised, may require specification of additional considerations. We conducted a Delphi study to assess stakeholder views on additional items for inclusion in a consensus extension of the ICH E9(R1) for cluster randomised trials. We invited experts in estimands and cluster randomised trials to participate in a modified Delphi process to identify critical items for describing estimands in cluster randomised trials. The research team generated an initial list of eight items and definitions. Across three Delphi rounds, panellists scored items, suggested additional items, and provided open-ended rationales for responses. The consensus threshold was set as ≥70% of respondents rating an attribute as \"essential\" (i.e., score of ≥7 on a 9-point Likert scale) and <15% of respondents rating the item as \"not important\" (i.e., a score of ≤3). Seventy-three (52%) invited individuals participated in Round 1. Response rates were 85% in Round 2 and 95% in Round 3. Panellists included largely statisticians (62, 85%) and clinical trialists (18, 25%). After Round 1, one additional item was added for Round 2 inclusion. After Round 3, five items met consensus criteria: how individuals and clusters are weighted, population of clusters, exposure time of clusters and individuals to the intervention, whether treatment effects are marginal or cluster-specific, and handling of cluster-level intercurrent events. This Delphi identified expert consensus around the importance of several key items for defining estimands in cluster randomised trials. These results can inform the development of consensus guidance outlining the set of attributes to describe when defining estimands for cluster randomised trials.",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis, defined as the growth of endometrial-like tissues outside the uterus, is a common disease among women. Numerous in vivo rodent models of endometriosis have been developed to explore multiple aspects of this poorly understood disease. Heterologous models utilize human endometrial tissues engrafted into immunocompromized mice, while homologous models engraft rodent endometrium into immunocompetent mice or rats. Heterologous models of endometriosis more closely replicate the human disease; however, the murine humoral immune response must be suppressed to prevent rejection of the xenograft tissue. Although the innate immune system remains intact, suppression of the humoral response leads to a markedly different local and systemic immune environments compared to humans. Despite this limitation, experiments using heterologous models have contributed significantly to our understanding of endometriosis establishment and progression, the pre-clinical effectiveness of various therapeutic strategies, and genetically modifiable host factors that contribute to disease. Unfortunately, a lack of harmonization of the models used by different laboratories has impeded the reproducibility and comparability of results between groups. Therefore, the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) formed an international working group of experts in heterologous models of endometriosis to develop guidelines and protocols that could contribute to unifying experimental approaches across laboratories. Nine critical variables were identified: (i) mouse strain; (ii) human tissue type; (iii) hormonal status of the human tissue donor; (iv) human tissue preparation; (v) method and location of tissue placement; (vi) hormonal status of the recipient animal; (vii) whether or not mice were engrafted with human immune cells; (viii) endpoint assessments; and (ix) number and type of replicates. Herein, we outline important considerations for each major variable and make recommendations for unification of approaches. Widespread adoption of harmonized protocols and implementation of standardized documentation and reporting should further improve the reproducibility and translation of experimental findings both within and between laboratories.",

        "abstract": "Insects are widely recognized as a valuable source of protein and solution to food security, particularly in developing countries like Uganda. This study documents the local knowledge and practices of edible insects consumed and perception and attitudes towards edible insects by different ethnic groups in northern Uganda. This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2023 to January 2024 in the districts of Adjumani, Nwoya, Oyam and Zombo in northern Uganda, where 600 questionnaires which comprised of both closed and open-ended questions were administered to randomly selected respondents (60% female, 40% male) in 24 villages spread across four ethnic groups (Acholi, Langi, Alur and Madi). We aimed to find out, whether differences exist in the types of edible insects consumed and which ones were preferred based on ethnicity, age, gender and education level. Our study revealed that eleven edible insect's species belonging to two orders (Orthoptera and Isoptera) and four families-Tettigoniidae, Termitidae, Gryllotalpidae and Acrididae were consumed as food among the Acholi, Alur, Madi and Langi. These species include: Ruspolia differens, Locusta migratoria, Kraussaria angulifera, Macrotermes subhyalinus, Macrotermes bellicosus, Macrotermes michaelseni, Pseudacanthotermes militaris, Syntermes spp. soldiers, Lanista varelai and Gryllotalpa africana. L. varelai, locally known as 'Ocene-labolo' in Acholi, is reported as edible insect for the first time. Additionally, one unidentified edible insect, locally known as 'Mumu' in Alur or 'Lakwinyekimo' in Acholi, was reported to be used as food. Preference for edible insects varied among the ethnic groups, with R. differens being the most preferred among Alur (85%) and Acholi (41%). Conversely, M. subhyalinus (33%) and M. bellicosus (64%) were the most popular among the Langi and Madi, respectively. The respondents had positive perception on edible insect's consumption as an alternative protein source (98%) to conventional protein source, particularly for insects that were already known to be eaten in the study areas. The high diversity of utilized edible insects identified in our study area and the responses indicate that entomophagy is a common practice in the region. Therefore, along with being an important delicacy and traditional foods, edible insects can improve household nutrition status by providing an alternative protein source to alleviate food insecurity and malnutrition among rural communities.",

Hyperinflammation progresses with aggravation of brain damage and deterioration in clinical status. The study aimed to demonstrate a valuable, easy-to-obtain, and inexpensive parameter for prognostic assessment by comparing the Pan-immune Inflammation Value (PIV), Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), and CALLY scores in patients with ischemic stroke. In this retrospective single-center cohort study, the files of patients who were followed up with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke in the tertiary intensive care units. Multivariate regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves(ROC) were used to detect the association between PIV, SII, and CALLY on in-hospital mortality and their superiority over each other in predicting mortality in ischemic stroke patients. Of 1,039 patients, 453 died, resulting in an overall survival rate of 56.4%. In the multivariate analysis, high APACHE II scores and low albumin levels remained independent risk factors. ROC curves showed that PIV, SII, and CALLY exhibited good predictive values, with AUCs of 0.921, 0.887, and 0.930 (95% CI: 0.903-0.936, 0.855-0.896, 0.913-0.945; p < 0.001). A pairwise comparison of the data based on AUC values indicated a significant difference between SII and both PIV and CALLY (p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant difference was found between PIV and CALLY (p = 0.385). The PIV, SII, and CALLY indices serve as accessible and reliable prognostic biomarkers that can enhance personalized treatment strategies and improve clinical decision-making in patients with ischemic stroke.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare workers (HCWs) often face mental resilience challenges during public health emergencies, including disease outbreaks. On September 20, 2022, the Uganda Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of Sudan virus disease (SVD). We assessed the level and factors associated with workplace resilience among HCWs working at the epicenter of the SVD outbreak in Mubende and Kassanda districts, Uganda. In March 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among all HCWs (clinical and non-clinical) who served in three facilities directly involved in the SVD response between September 20, 2022─January 23, 2023 (the outbreak period) in Mubende and Kassanda Districts. Risk perception was assessed using 12 statements with a 4-point Likert-type scale. We assessed resilience using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). Resilience was categorized as either resilient or not resilient. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with resilience. Of 429 eligible HCWs, 400 (93%) participated in the study, and all completed the survey. Mean age was 35 years (range: 20-58); 222 (56%) were male and median work experience was 8 years (range: 1-38). One hundred and ten (28%) were support staff and 72 (18%) were nurses; 344 (86%) worked > 40 h per week. Overall, 23% (95%CI: 9-25%) were resilient. Most participants (89%) reported fear of contracting SVD and concern about workplace stigma if infected. Higher resilience was associated with age > 40 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1; CI = 1.3-3.5), work experience > 10 years (AOR = 2.2; CI = 1.1-4.7), working > 40 h per week (AOR = 6.8; CI = 2.1-23), and receiving SVD-specific counseling (AOR = 3.3; CI = 1.7-6.5). Most HCWs at the SVD outbreak epicenter had low resilience, largely related to fear of infection and stigma. Older age, longer work experience, and access to psychological counselling were associated with higher resilience. Providing targeted mental health support and reducing workplace infection concerns could help strengthen HCW resilience in future outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "Selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient with potent antioxidant properties, may modulate cardiometabolic health through multiple physiological pathways, including redox regulation and the modulation of inflammatory responses. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between serum Se levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) as early indicators of endothelial dysfunction in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). A total of 191 patients aged 20 to 50 years, diagnosed with MetS, were included in the study. In addition to glucolipid metabolic parameters, serum levels of Se, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were assessed. Ultrasonography was applied to measure the CIMT among the participants. The mean serum levels of TNF-α (p-trend = 0.037), MCP-1 (p-trend = 0.005), and VCAM-1 (p-trend = 0.002) revealed decreasing trends with increasing quartiles of serum Se. Similarly, a significant decrease in the mean CIMT was observed in the participants with increasing quartiles of serum Se (p-trend < 0.001). Serum Se levels were inversely correlated with TNF-α (r = -0.24, p < 0.001), MCP-1 (r = -0.30, p < 0.001), VCAM-1 (r = -0.34, p < 0.001), and CIMT (r = -0.47, p < 0.001). In conclusion, we observed significant inverse relationships between serum Se levels and pro-atherogenic and pro-inflammatory biomarkers, as well as the mean CIMT, in patients with MetS. Se supplementation may represent a targeted nutritional strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with MetS who have low serum Se levels.",

Toripalimab demonstrates significant potential in treating esophageal cancer, with favorable response rates and survival outcomes. However, the high incidence of adverse effects highlights the need for supportive care and ongoing research. While based on limited sample sizes and single-arm studies that may introduce bias and affect generalizability in this review, we provide valuable preliminary insights into toripalimab's potential, highlighting the need for larger randomized trials to build on these findings.",

        "abstract": "Real-world data on Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment and outcomes in Latin America are limited. The B-HOLISTIC study (2010-2013) retrospectively assessed treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with stage IIB-IV classical HL receiving frontline chemotherapy (frontline cHL) or relapsed/refractory HL (RRHL) in regions outside Europe and North America. This subgroup analysis presents findings from patients enrolled from treatment centers in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with RRHL. Other endpoints included overall survival (OS), best clinical response, and treatment patterns. In Latin America (frontline cHL: 344; RRHL: 92), the most common frontline regimen was ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). In patients with RRHL receiving salvage chemotherapy (92.4%), common regimens were ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, cisplatin) and ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide). Overall, 68.2% of eligible patients with RRHL underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT). Median PFS and OS in the RRHL group was 20.2 and 87 months, respectively; the 5-year PFS rate was 27.1%. Survival outcomes were improved in patients who underwent SCT than those without SCT. Median PFS and OS in the cHL group were not reached. These data demonstrated that while real-world HL treatment in Latin America was consistent with guidelines during the study period, clinical outcomes were suboptimal compared with developed regions. This emphasizes the need for novel therapies and improved progression to SCT in this patient population. These findings may offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for future studies in this region. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03327571, registered October 31, 2017.",

        "abstract": "A synthesis and appraisal of the recommendations for biomarkers in practice guidelines concerning sepsis is required to consolidate evidence-based practice. We generated an evidence gap map (EGM) on the use of biomarkers for managing adults with sepsis. Scoping review. MEDLINE, Guidelines International Network, Pan American Health Organization, Trip Database and UpToDate were searched from 2016 to March 2025. Guidance documents (GD) that searched at least one literature source and provided clinical recommendations for the use of biomarkers for the management (diagnosis and prognosis, including treatment response) of adults with sepsis. Two reviewers independently applied the eligibility criteria and extracted data. We used the AGREE-II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) tool to assess the GD quality. GDs that scored ≥50% on the AGREE-II 'Rigour of development' domain were considered robust. We also applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system to evaluate if the recommendations were strong or conditional. We found 10 GDs, with only half (4/8) having a robust methodology. There were 31 recommendations concerning biomarkers. Among these, 24 (77.4%) recommendations were about single biomarkers, with lactate (23; 74.2%) and procalcitonin (8; 25.8%) most frequently recommended. Biomarker testing focused on prognosis in 28 (90.3%) recommendations. Overall, 16 (51.6%) recommendations were graded strong and 13 (42.0%) were conditional, which we displayed in an EGM. The methodology of GDs concerning adult sepsis was poor. Our review calls for more prudent use of biomarkers in specific prognostic scenarios and in combination with standard clinical assessments. Enhancing the methodological quality of future GDs is essential to generate more valid and robust recommendations for optimising patient care.",

        "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hemoglobinopathy marked by hemolytic anemia, VOEs, and multiorgan complications. Mitapivat, an oral Pyruvate Kinase (PK) activator, has emerged as a potential disease-modifying therapy. This systematic review assessed the efficacy and safety of Mitapivat in individuals with SCD. A systematic literature search was conducted from different search engines from inception. The review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO [CRD420251000061]. RCTs and NRSIs evaluating Mitapivat monotherapy were included. ROB was assessed. A narrative synthesis was undertaken due to heterogeneity. One RCT and two NRSIs involving 156 participants were included. Reduced annualized Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOE) rates compared to placebo by 51.6% (50 mg) and 70.0% (100 mg). Statistically significant hemoglobin response was observed in 46.2%-56% of participants. Increased markers of hemolysis and reduced transfusion requirements in Mitapivat groups were reported. However, SAEs were low, in 8%-19% of Mitapivat recipients. Preliminary evidence suggests Mitapivat demonstrates potential to reduce VOEs, improve hemoglobin levels, and decrease hemolysis with an acceptable safety profile. However, small sample sizes, lack of functional outcomes, and limited follow-up warrant cautious interpretation. Further large-scale RCTs are needed to validate these findings and establish a long-term benefit-risk balance.",

Qualitative study using Yarning methods. Yarning circles were conducted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on Awabakal and Worimi country in December 2023. Twenty-nine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participated in Yarning circles held at three locations across Awabakal and Worimi country. Community participants felt that the need for equitable and culturally safe NLCSP pathways is critical, with the NLCSP implementation plan and associated guidelines requiring multiple modes of health promotion, flexible eligibility that is equitable, alternative referral pathways to overcome barriers to access, and screening pathways and processes that are culturally responsive and community led. The NLCSP provides a timely opportunity to improve health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. To achieve this, it is essential that the NLCSP is tailored to the needs of each community in accessing preventive health care and upholds rights to self-determination.",

        "abstract": "To identify and summarize clinical factors influencing the efficacy and safety outcomes of CAR-T cell therapies in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) through a systematic literature review. We performed a systematic literature review to identify factors impacting the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapies in DLBCL. Articles were searched in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases. Key outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), complete response rate (CRR), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), best overall response (BOR), and safety measures (e.g., Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome [ICANS], and Cytokine Release Syndrome [CRS]), were extracted according to PRISMA guidelines. A total of 712 articles were identified, with 185 selected for full-text screening. Ultimately, 79 articles met inclusion criteria. Exclusions were primarily due to the absence of relevant outcome data or publication type. This review highlights several factors that may influence the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapies in DLBCL, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), International Prognostic Index (IPI) score, disease histology, Ann Arbor disease stage, and elevated LDH levels. The findings of this review can assist clinicians in refining treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes in DLBCL by incorporating these key influencing factors.",
