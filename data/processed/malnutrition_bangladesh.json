        "abstract": "Linear growth faltering and stunting in children is associated with inflammation of small gut. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase prevents gut inflammation from subclinical bacterial infection that becomes impaired in the presence of neuraminidase-3 (Neu3) activity. We investigated if total Neu3 in children at 15 months can predict their linear growth at later ages (at 18, 21, and 24 months). We collected data from 189 children enrolled in the Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Study (MAL-ED) birth cohort study in Bangladesh. We determined total Neu3 activity in stool samples at 15 months of age and measured its association with length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) at 18, 21, and 24 months of age, in addition to their socio-demographic conditions using bi-variate and multivariable linear regression analyses. We found that total Neu3 at 15 months was negatively associated with the LAZ-score at 18 (regression coefficient -0.004, 95% CI -0.006 to -0.001, p < 0.01), 21 (-0.003, 95% CI -0.006, -0.001, p < 0.01), and 24 (-0.004, 95% CI -0.006, -0.001, p < 0.01) months of age after adjusting the covariates. In conclusion, total neuraminidase-3 in stool is a significant predictor of linear growth in young children and would be key in early detection of linear growth faltering and stunting.",

        "title": "Key Stakeholders' Perspectives on Acute Malnutrition Management Programs for Children Under Five in Bangladesh: Qualitative Insights.",
        "abstract": "Acute malnutrition (AM) in children under five is a significant global health concern. Community-based management of AM (CMAM) with provision of specially formulated foods (SFFs) is recommended for treating moderate (MAM) and uncomplicated severe (SAM) cases in outpatient settings. Integrating nutrition counseling and cooking demonstrations (NC&CD) into CMAM programs can improve caregiver knowledge and practices. In our parent trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of enhanced NC&CD without SFFs on MAM management. This study examines perceptions and understanding of CMAM among parents, healthcare providers (HCPs), and policymakers in both CMAM and no-CMAM areas. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants who were reflective and willing to share their experiences with the research team. Data collection involved 30 focus group discussions (FGDs), 34 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with parents, 28 key informant interviews (KIIs) with HCPs in Cox's Bazar, and 16 KIIs with policymakers in Dhaka. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo, guided by the concepts of the theoretical framework. Parents and HCPs generally valued CMAM for its SFFs, while parents in the MAM trial's intervention arm preferred NC&CD with incentives. Policymakers largely supported combining SFFs with NC&CD, though some advocated for NC&CD alone as a feasible approach. Challenges identified included workforce shortages, policy gaps, and insufficient prioritization. One-third of HCPs in CMAM areas and most HCPs and parents in no-CMAM areas favored NC&CD. The study highlights the need to continue NC&CD-based CMAM programs with incentives and recommends integrating NC&CD into CMAM guidelines to enhance caregiver awareness. Additionally, increased manpower, policy advocacy, strong government leadership, and preventive nutrition initiatives are warranted to ensure the sustainable effect of CMAM in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Double burden of malnutrition (DBM) is a complex nutritional phenomenon, where an individual or a household simultaneously face two contradictory forms of nutritional adversities. Studies on assessing the prevalence, trends, and determinants of DBM at household in Pakistan are scarce, so this study measured the prevalence, trends, and determinants of DBM at household level using nationally representative datasets. <b>Methods:</b> Data of last two waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Pakistan conducted in 2012-2013 and 2017-2018 were used to assess the DBM prevalence, trends, and determinants at the household level. Data of mother-child dyads aged between 15 and 49 years and 0 and 59 months was included, while data with incomplete anthropometry or anthropometric outliers was excluded. <b>Results:</b> Across two survey periods, there has been a significant decrease in pediatrics stunting from 45% to 37.3%, while a rapid proliferation of maternal obesity from 45% to 52.3% was reported. Similarly, the prevalence of DBM at household level was 17.3% in 2012-2013, which increased to 18.9% in 2017-2018. Among different provinces of Pakistan, Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) have significantly higher prevalence of DBM at household than Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). Factors such as child age, birth order, and socioeconomic status were significantly associated with DBM in Pakistani households. <b>Conclusion:</b> DBM in Pakistan is a complex and chronic challenge, which affects almost one-fifth of households. There is need to urgently address the issues of DBM and to improvise nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions to curtail the issues pertaining to DBM at household.",

        "abstract": "Chronic exposure to aflatoxins is associated with liver cancer, impaired child growth, and compromised immune function. The Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network cohort was established to identify risk factors for mortality in acutely ill children admitted to nine hospitals in four African and two South Asian countries. We examined the role of aflatoxin exposure in inpatient and post-discharge mortality. In a nested case-cohort from the CHAIN cohort, we compared aflatoxin exposure at admission and discharge with death or survival in hospital (n=755) or up to 180-days post-discharge (n=585) and with community participants (CP, n=222). Children were stratified into non-wasting, medium-wasting and severe-wasting groups based on mid-upper arm circumference. Serum samples were analysed for an aflatoxin exposure biomarker, the aflatoxin-albumin adduct (AF-alb) using ELISA. Overall, 56% of hospitalised participants tested positive for AF-alb at admission. The AF-alb level was higher in deceased (geometric mean and 95% CI (GM and 95% CI) 5.9 (4.9 to 7.1)) than in survivors (4.2 (3.8 to 4.7)) and CP (3.7 (3.1 to 4.3)) pg/mg alb. AF-alb concentration was higher at admission (4.7, (4.2 to 5.1)) than at discharge (3.7, (3.3 to 4.1)) and in the CP group (3.7, (3.1 to 4.3)) pg/mg alb (p<0.01) and in African vs Asian children (7.4 (6.5 to 8.5) vs 1.9 (1.8 to 2.1)) (p<0.001). Adjusted logistical regression showed no significant association between AF-alb levels and mortality, but after separating the nutrition strata, AF-alb was significantly associated with mortality (highest vs lowest quartile group OR=4.84, p=0.014) in non-wasted children. Moderate to severe malnutrition is a more important risk factor for mortality than aflatoxin in acutely ill children, but aflatoxin exposure may contribute to mortality in non-wasted children. Controlling aflatoxin exposure should be integrated into clinical and public health interventions to reduce mortality in areas with high levels of exposure.

        "abstract": "A novel ready-to-use microbiome-directed food (MDF) has been developed for the management of acute malnutrition using ingredients that promote repair of the gut microbiota of undernourished children. This study aims to assess the acceptability of MDF compared with standard nutritional care among children with acute malnutrition. Two randomized crossover trials consisting of 2 14-d periods of at-home consumption were conducted. Children aged 6 to <24 mo with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) or moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) were individually randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the sequence of receiving MDF then standard nutritional care, or vice versa. Standard nutritional care consisted of ready-to-use therapeutic food for SAM and ready-to-use supplementary food for MAM. The primary outcome was at-home acceptability, defined as the return of ≥75% of sachets empty after the 14-d at-home consumption period. The primary analysis was a noninferiority analysis, in which MDF was considered noninferior if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in at-home acceptability comparing MDF with standard nutritional care was within -20 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included caregiver's perception of the child's liking, as well as caregiver willingness to use in the future and preference between the 2 foods. In all, 128 children with SAM and 146 children with MAM were randomized. MDF was noninferior to standard nutritional care in terms of at-home acceptability among children with SAM (risk difference: -7.0; 95% CI lower bound: -11.6%) and among children with MAM (risk difference: -2.3%; 95% CI lower bound: -6.1%). There were no differences in caregiver willingness to use either food in future. MDF is acceptable for the management of acute malnutrition in children aged 6 to <24 mo in Niger and should be further tested in other populations with a high prevalence of acute malnutrition. Effectiveness of the novel food will be assessed in forthcoming trials. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05551819.",

        "abstract": "Undernutrition in children is a major global health issue. Diarrhea exacerbates undernutrition, creating a vicious cycle of infection and malnutrition. This longitudinal study examined growth patterns and influencing factors among 138 children following diarrhea. Children under two seeking care for watery diarrhea at a rural hospital in Bangladesh were enrolled and followed for three months of home-based visits. Anthropometric measurements-length-for-age z-score (LAZ), weight- for-age z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length z-score (WLZ), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were taken at enrollment and follow-ups. Linear mixed-effects models assessed associations of clinical, sociodemographic, sanitation, hygiene, and food security factors with growth outcomes. Overall, LAZ declined over three months (-0.260, SD: 0.408), while WAZ, WLZ, and MUAC improved (0.100, SD: 0.484; 0.249, SD: 0.725; 0.672 cm, SD: 0.476). Children with malnutrition at enrollment strongly predicted persistent malnutrition (LAZ < -2, WAZ < -2, WLZ < - 2, MUAC < 12.5 cm) during follow-up compared to new incidence of malnutrition (RR: 3.8, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.80, 6.35). Poor growth outcomes were linked to longer diarrhea duration, more vomiting, and hospitalization. Hospitalization was associated with declines in LAZ (-0.095, p = 0.009) and MUAC (-0.098, p = 0.030). Children aged 7-12 months had greater declines in WAZ (- 0.109, p = 0.096) and WLZ (-0.181, p = 0.113). Improved sanitation and hygiene supported growth, while household hunger was linked to declines. This study highlights the multifactorial nature of post-diarrhea growth outcomes and emphasizes the need for integrated interventions addressing clinical care, sanitation, hygiene, and food security. Children under two years of age in low and middle-income countries are highly vulnerable to undernutrition, especially following diarrheal illness. This study shows that growth recovery after diarrhea is not guaranteed and is shaped by multiple factors, including the child's age, the severity of illness, household sanitation and hygiene practices, and food security. Children who were already malnourished at the time of illness were much more likely to remain so months later. Poor hygiene practices and limited access to protein-rich foods further reduced the likelihood of recovery. These findings are critical because they highlight the need for targeted follow-up and integrated interventions to support children after diarrhea. By identifying which children are at highest risk and which environmental and clinical conditions hinder growth, this study provides essential evidence to guide strategies for improving child nutrition and health in similar low-resource settings.",

However, the relationship is largely understudied in developing countries like Bangladesh. The aim of the study was to determine the correlation between maternal medical conditions and subsequent language disorders in children experiencing fetal distress in context of Bangladesh. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between June, 2021 to June, 2022 at Z.H. Sikder Women's Medical College and Hospital, Bangladesh. Eighty children between 4 to 12 years with documented histories of antenatal or intrapartum fetal distress were recruited and assessed for language disorder by experienced clinicians using standardized diagnostic criteria. SPSS Version 12 was used for statistical analysis. The mean age of children was 6.54 ± 1.9 years, with 70% being male. Most children (70%) lived in rural areas with parents of low socioeconomic status. The reported maternal medical conditions included hypertensive disorders (40%), diabetes mellitus (30%), hypothyroidism (20%), and malnutrition (10%). Language disorders included delayed language acquisition (90%), receptive/perceptive disorders (60%), motor speech production impairments (60%), metalinguistic competence disorders (70%), cognitive linguistic disorders (80%), and pragmatic disorders (80%). Statistical analysis revealed significant associations (P < .05) between maternal medical conditions and all domains of language disorders. The results indicate significant relationship between maternal medical conditions, presence of fetal distress, and language disorders in children. Early identification and speech-language therapy during the neurodevelopment period could potentially improve outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Stunting, wasting and underweight are the three widely recognised indicators of child undernutrition. This study aimed to simultaneously model all indicators while accounting for their association using a joint modelling technique to identify their risk factors. This was a cross-sectional study design. The anthropometric data of children were elicited from the Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. Stunting, wasting and underweight were the main outcome measures of child undernutrition. Initially, a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) was developed for each indicator separately to identify the underlying risk factors by considering children within the cluster (district level) as hierarchically nested. Finally, a joint model was developed by combining the separate GLMMs with the condition of correlated cluster-specific (district-specific) random effects. The developed joint model provided precise effects of the risk factors and quantified the association among stunting, wasting and underweight. The joint correlations of underweight with stunting [Formula: see text] and underweight with wasting [Formula: see text] were significantly positive based on the predictors in the joint model. The age of children, household wealth status, and maternal education were risk factors for both stunting and underweight. The mother's age at first birth and the episode of fever were significantly correlated with both underweight and wasting, while the episode of fever was significantly associated with underweight. The region, residence and sex of children were significantly associated with all undernutrition indicators. This study demonstrates the application of a joint model to simultaneously identify the risk factors associated with indicators of child undernutrition. The study findings reveal a substantial positive association between stunting and underweight, as well as between underweight and wasting, with shared risk factors contributing to the disparity in the prevalence of all forms of child undernutrition in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between economic growth and nutrition is not yet fully understood in the context of the new nutrition reality where most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) face an increasing double burden of malnutrition. We aimed to investigate the association between early life exposure to economic shocks and multiple forms of childhood malnutrition in LMICs. We pooled cross-sectional data on children younger than 5 years from the Demographic and Health Surveys from 1990 to 2022 and longitudinal income data from the World Inequality Database. An economic shock was defined as any negative income growth and was tested at intensity levels of less than -1%, -5%, and -10%. Malnutrition outcomes variables comprised stunting, wasting, overweight, obesity, concurrent wasting and stunting (WaSt), and double burden of malnutrition (child is both stunted and overweight). Adjusted associations of economic shocks, at different critical windows (year of the interview, birth, first 1000 days of life), with malnutrition outcomes were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression models with robust errors. The associations were interpreted using prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs. A total of 1 643 898 children across 230 surveys in 68 LMICs were included in this study. Negative income shocks in the year of interview were associated with a 5·4% (PR 1·054 [95% CI 1·029-1·080]) increase in the prevalence of wasting and a 12·7% (1·127 [1·079-1·176]) increase in severe wasting. A dose-response association according to the intensity levels of income shock in the year of birth was found for stunting (-1%: PR 1·019 [95% CI 1·011-1·027]; -5%: 1·033 [1·025-1·042]; and -10%: 1·061 [1·051-1·072]) and severe stunting (-1%: 1·041 [1·026-1·055]; -5%: 1·059 [1·044-1·074]; and -10%: 1·099 [1·081-1·118]). In children aged 2-4 years, income shocks during the first 1000 days of life strongly increased the prevalence of double burden of malnutrition by 30·3% (PR 1·303 [95% CI 1·221-1·391]), obesity by 14·3% (1·143 [1·046-1·249]), and overweight by 13·8% (1·138 [1·090-1·188]). We also found a strong dose-response association between the intensity of income shock during the first 1000 days and double burden of malnutrition (-1%: PR 1·216 [95% CI 1·141-1·295]; -5%: 1·299 [1·192-1·416]; -10%: 1·350 [1·185-1·537]). Exposure to negative income shocks can significantly increase the risk of various forms of malnutrition during childhood, with critical windows of vulnerability that vary based on the timing of economic instability and the specific type of malnutrition. Policymakers and public health practitioners must recognise these critical periods and develop targeted interventions to safeguard maternal and child nutrition, particularly during times of economic crises.

        "abstract": "We previously identified genetic polymorphisms associated with <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>-positive diarrhea at the locus containing the transcription factor, cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>). Genetic association testing in birth cohorts of Bangladeshi children showed the previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the <i>CREM</i> locus associated with <i>E. histolytica-</i>positive diarrhea were independently associated with undernutrition at 1 year of age. The reference allele for both tested SNPs was associated with lower weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) at 1 year of age (rs2148483: 0.161 reduction in WAZ per allele, <i>P</i> = 0.007; rs58000832: 0.203 reduction in WAZ, <i>P</i> = 0.001). Small intestinal transcriptome data from Bangladeshi and American children revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched for cAMP response element-binding sites. DEGs related to mitochondrial function were upregulated in the small intestine of children with the rs2148483 reference allele, while adaptive immune response processes were enriched among downregulated genes. Upregulation of mitochondrial function was mirrored by plasma metabolomics profiles concordant with a shift toward mitochondrial respiration. In mice, global conditional deletion of <i>Crem</i> resulted in reduced body weight, downregulation of genes related to innate immune function, and upregulation of metabolic gene expression in the intestine. Tissue-specific deletion of <i>Crem</i> in intestinal epithelial cells was sufficient to reduce overall body weight and alter intestinal expression of mitochondrial-related metabolic genes but not immune gene transcription. These data indicate that intestinal epithelial expression of <i>Crem</i> is linked to body weight, plausibly by regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, while <i>Crem</i> expression in other cell types influences the immune response to <i>E. histolytica</i>.IMPORTANCEUndernutrition and diarrheal disease are leading causes of global childhood morbidity and mortality. Undernutrition can present as a cause or consequence of diarrheal diseases, leading us to hypothesize these phenotypes share a common genetic basis. Our identification of cAMP responsive element modulator (<i>CREM</i>) as a transcriptional regulator that influences susceptibility to both undernutrition and diarrheal disease in children growing up in an impoverished Bangladeshi community advances our understanding of the interaction of two major causes of childhood illness and offers the potential of therapy targeted to the cAMP-regulated transcription factor, <i>CREM</i>.",

        "abstract": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing child mortality to <25 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030 requires strategies to prevent diarrheal disease-related morbidity and mortality. Accurate etiological diagnosis is essential. This study used postmortem diagnostics to investigate the contribution of diarrhea to under-5 mortality and examine co-morbidities and co-infections in Africa and South Asia. Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) generates data on child deaths through minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical record review, and verbal autopsies. Multidisciplinary panels assign cause(s) of death using WHO International Classification of Diseases. This analysis included deaths among children aged 1-59 months enrolled from 18 December 2016-31 December 2023 across six African sites (Ethiopia, Mali, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Africa) and Bangladesh. Of 1517 deaths assessed, diarrhea was in the causal pathway in 240 (15.8%). The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%). No pathogen was identified in 49.6% (119/240) of diarrhea-related deaths; among these, diarrhea was underlying cause in 42.9%. Among the 121 pathogen-attributed deaths, the most frequent were EAEC (34.7%), typical EPEC (15.7%), Shigella/EIEC (14.0%), ST-ETEC (12.4%), rotavirus (26.4%), and adenovirus (non-40/41: 19.0%; 40/41: 5.0%). These pathogens were frequently identified as co-infections. Diarrheal disease accounted for a substantial share of child deaths across CHAMPS sites. Reducing mortality will require preventing diarrhea and addressing key contributors such as malnutrition and HIV.",

        "abstract": "Child undernutrition remains a significant public health issue in Bangladesh, with high rates of stunting, wasting, and underweight. The Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) offers a comprehensive tool for assessing overall undernutrition. Although previous studies in Bangladesh have utilized CIAF, they have relied on older datasets. Estimating the current status is essential for designing and implementing targeted interventions due to the dynamic nature of undernutrition. This study aimed to provide updated insights by analyzing the CIAF and its determinants among children under 5 years, using the most recent 2022 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data. A total of 3950 under-5-year-old children were included. The modified Poisson regression was employed to identify the associated factors. The overall prevalence of CIAF was 33.7%, with subgroups of wasted and underweight (4.7%), stunted and underweight (10.8%), wasting, stunting, and underweight (3.4%), only wasted (3%), only stunted (8.8%), and only underweight (3%). Factors associated with higher risk of CIAF included older aged child, higher birth order (ARR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.08-1.58), smaller birth size (ARR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.24-1.70), uneducated mothers (ARR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.16-1.93), maternal underweight (ARR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13-1.46), short stature (ARR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.40-1.70). Children from the poorest households (ARR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.53) and Sylhet (ARR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02-1.47) also had a higher risk. This study suggests strengthening community-based nutrition-specific programs along with improving access to healthcare, family planning, food assistance, and income opportunities to reduce child undernutrition in Bangladesh.",

        "title": "Identifying key components of a global conceptual framework for adolescent nutrition: Review, nominal group technique and youth co-design.",
        "abstract": "Optimal nutrition during adolescence is critical to growth and development. While several adolescent nutrition frameworks exist, a comprehensive reference framework is needed, which reflects the priorities and views of young people and guides action to improve adolescent nutrition. We believe that partnering with young people is key to enabling agency and empowering change. This collaborative project between the Global Adolescent Nutrition Network (GANN) and youth partners aimed to develop a conceptual and actionable framework for adolescent nutrition. This paper presents the methods used to identify the need for and to prioritise the key components of a new framework. A literature review was conducted to identify and summarise available frameworks for adolescent nutrition (10-19 years). GANN members (N=7) and youth partners (N=4, 18-26 years) used nominal group technique (NGT) methodology to reach consensus on: (1) key characteristics, strengths and limitations of available frameworks; (2) key characteristics of an ideal framework; (3) the best available framework and (4) the need for a new framework. NGT participants listed 37 strengths and limitations of the 15 frameworks identified in the review. These were classified into three themes: theory, usability and visibility. According to NGT participants, the most important ('top') theoretical features of an ideal framework were considering all forms of malnutrition' and including all levels of influence in adolescent nutrition'. Most top usability and visibility features were applicable at global, regional and country levels, and a clear structure to depict levels of influence, respectively. The Innocenti Framework was deemed the best available framework. Most of the participants (90%) agreed that a new framework was needed. Youth partners advocated for greater representation of youth voices in frameworks and programmes related to adolescents. The salient features of the new framework, reached by consensus, emphasise an action-oriented approach that provides practical guidance to improve adolescent nutrition rather than solely explaining its determinants. It will be designed to be adaptable to different contexts, ensuring its visual design, language and content are accessible and engaging for a broad range of stakeholders. Through a novel youth codesign process, we identified key components to inform the development of a new conceptual framework to improve adolescent nutrition. While no new framework is presented in this article and is part of ongoing work, these findings provide guidance for future efforts to create a framework that can effectively inform actions and investments in global adolescent nutrition.",

Our study aimed to assess how different forms of malnutrition affect nerve electrophysiology in children under 5 years of age and whether nutritional intervention can improve neurophysiological outcomes. A community-based study was conducted from 2021 to 2022 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) stunting, and wasting were recruited from the Mirpur slum area, Dhaka, and Dhaka Hospital, Bangladesh, respectively. Sensory and motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) were performed before and after a 60-day nutritional intervention. A standard nerve electrophysiology tool was used for assessment and analysis. A total of 83 malnourished children (30 stunted, 22 with SAM, and 31 wasted) and 45 healthy children were enrolled. The median age was 2.1 years (range: 6 months-5 years), and 56% were male. Malnourished children had significantly slower nerve conduction velocities compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01). Following intervention, children with SAM showed significant improvements in motor (median, peroneal, tibial; p < 0.05) and sensory (sural, peroneal; p < 0.05) nerve conduction. Nutritional rehabilitation improved nerve conduction in undernourished children, particularly those with SAM, underscoring the need for early intervention. NCT05891457.",

        "abstract": "Globally malnutrition is considered one of the greatest threats to public health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The present study examined the extent of undernutrition and the associated determinants among children aged 6-59 months in Bangladesh using data from the Nutrition Survey of Bangladesh (NSB), 2017-18. The sampling frame of NSB 2017-18 was specified by a 30 (locations) × 30 (households) cluster approach where 20 locations were from rural areas and the other 10 were from urban areas. Out of the sampled households, 566 children aged between 6 and 59 months were included in the analysis. Determinants of three anthropometric measures, weight-for-age (stunting), weight-for-height (wasting), and weight-for-age (underweight), were analyzed using a multiple logistic regression model. The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting of children was 34.5%, 40.6%, and 20.1%, respectively. Although the child's age, family size, cleanliness of the residential area, and food insecurity were significant determinants of malnutrition, inadequate and low-quality protein consumption strongly predicted the development of underweight and stunting in infants and children. The odds of being stunted were 2 times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-3.46; <i>p</i> = 0.011) and underweight was almost 2.5 times (AOR: 2.41; 95% CI: 1.27-4.56; <i>p</i> < 0.01) higher, respectively, among children who consumed inadequate amounts of protein. Because the percentage of children from wealthy families was relatively low in the present study, cleanliness of residential areas, food insecurity, and inadequate protein intake are likely to be key drivers of malnutrition in Bangladesh, which might be significantly reduced with better coverage of preventive nutrition programs.",

        "abstract": "Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) may worsen undernutrition, with potential adverse effects on the developmental trajectories of millions of children in low-resource settings. This study aimed to assess associations between EED biomarkers and subsequent child development. In a prospective cohort of 2646 children nested within 2 randomized trials in rural Bangladesh (n = 1374) and Kenya (n = 1272), EED was measured by markers of intestinal permeability (fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin; urinary lactulose and mannitol assessed through the dual sugar absorption test), inflammation (fecal myeloperoxidase and neopterin), and repair (fecal regenerating gene 1β). In Bangladesh, EED biomarkers were measured at ages 3 and 14 mo, whereas in Kenya, they were measured at 6 and 17 mo. Child development was measured by Communicative Development Inventories and World Health Organization (WHO) motor milestones at 1 y of age and by the Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 2 y of age. We used generalized additive models to estimate associations between EED biomarkers and child development, adjusting for potential confounders and controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR). In Bangladesh, higher concentrations of lactulose, mannitol, and alpha-1 antitrypsin were associated with worse subsequent child motor development outcomes. Elevated mannitol at 3 mo was associated with a lower WHO motor milestones sum score {-0.22 adjusted mean difference between the 25th and 75th percentile of mannitol distribution [(95% confidence interval (CI): -0.36, -0.08); FDR-corrected P value = 0.03]} and lower attainment of hands-and-knees crawling at year 1 [hazard ratio 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.86); FDR-corrected P value < 0.001]. In Kenya, we observed weak positive associations that were neither consistent nor significant after FDR correction. Higher concentrations of biomarkers of intestinal permeability were associated with poor child motor development in Bangladesh. These relationships were not replicated in the Kenyan cohort. The associations between EED and child neurodevelopment vary across geographic contexts, highlighting the need for further research to determine the generalizability of these findings.",

        "abstract": "Integrating family planning with nutrition could address unmet family planning needs and malnutrition in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Integrating family planning with sexual reproductive health (SRH) services may provide valuable insights as well. This scoping review synthesised evidence from published and grey literature on interventions integrating family planning with nutrition or SRH services in LMICs. We searched MEDLINE, EBSCO and Google Scholar for studies on integrated family planning, nutrition or SRH services, including codelivery or referral-based models. Evidence was analysed using narrative synthesis. We reviewed 109 articles; most family planning within broader health initiatives, particularly targeting maternal and child health and health system strengthening efforts. Integration strategies varied, generally involving codelivery of services or referral systems linking different service platforms and using diverse health providers. Outcomes were often reported by individual components, concentrating on specific services like family planning use and less so on nutrition or overall maternal and child health, thus limiting a complete understanding of the integrated intervention's impact. Qualitative and process evaluations primarily explored the acceptability and feasibility of integration, highlighting challenges in service delivery, stakeholder engagement and training and supervision gaps. Our findings suggest three evidence-based priorities for improving the integration of family planning, nutrition and SRH services: (1) standardising definitions and frameworks for integration typologies; (2) investing in workforce training and (3) strengthening supply chains. These align with implementation challenges recurrently observed across studies. The review also underscores the necessity for more rigorous research focused on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated approaches, providing critical insights for decision-makers aiming to optimise health service delivery in resource-limited settings.",

        "abstract": "Achieving adequate nutrition for vulnerable populations is central to the second Sustainable Development Goal. Nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs combined with social and behavior change communication (SBCC) interventions can support this goal, particularly in developing countries. However, systematic evidence on the impact of integrating SBCC strategies into these programs is limited, especially concerning anthropometric outcomes, dietary diversity, food consumption, and food security. This systematic review aimed to assess the importance of integrating SBCC interventions into nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs for optimal nutritional outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched for original research articles before December 2024. A total of 15 publications, involving data from multiple households, mothers, and children, were identified. All extracted data were compiled, compared, and critically analyzed. The review included 7 randomized controlled trials, 5 cluster-randomized trials, and 3 descriptive studies. Most studies demonstrated significant improvements in maternal and child dietary diversity, household food consumption, and minimum meal frequencies. Knowledge and practices around exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding also improved substantially. Among children, stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence decreased significantly, with effect sizes indicating meaningful public health impacts. However, the sustainability of these outcomes depended on the follow-up duration. Notably, none of the included studies exhibited a high risk of bias, reinforcing the reliability of the findings. Integrating SBCC into nutrition-sensitive social-protection programs is effective in achieving clinically significant nutritional outcomes for vulnerable populations. While the findings suggest sustained benefits, further research is needed to determine optimal entry points, effective messaging, advocacy strategies, and communication channels.

Globally, around 22% of children under five are affected, with high rates persisting in South and Southeast Asia. This review examines government-led programs in high-performing LMICs (Nepal, Bangladesh, and Vietnam) to identify key strategies and opportunities for effective intervention. <b>Methods</b>: A literature search was conducted on PubMed using keywords and Medical Subject Heading terms, including \"stunting\", \"child undernutrition\", \"malnutrition\" and the names of the three specified countries. Articles were evaluated for relevance based on their focus on stunting prevalence, risk factors, and interventions in these countries, without restrictions on publication date or language. <b>Results</b>: Stunting prevalence among children under five has significantly declined in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Vietnam over the past two decades, reflecting the impact of sustained nutrition and health interventions. Nepal reduced stunting from 55.8% in 2000 to 26.7% in 2022, Bangladesh from 54.7% to 26.4%, and Vietnam from 41.5% to 19.3%. Successful strategies included multisectoral approaches integrating nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions, enhanced policy frameworks, and strong governance. Despite progress, challenges remain, such as high wasting prevalence in Nepal and disparities among marginalized communities in Vietnam, emphasizing the need for targeted, context-specific interventions. <b>Conclusions</b>: Effective stunting reduction requires multisectoral strategies addressing underlying, intermediate, and immediate determinants. Insights from Nepal, Bangladesh, and Vietnam highlight the importance of sustained government commitment, robust policies, and coordinated interventions. Adapting these successful strategies to local contexts can support stunting prevention and management, promoting healthier and more resilient communities.",

        "abstract": "Poor diets are associated with all forms of malnutrition and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Data on dietary patterns are scarce in South Asia. We sought to describe overall diet quality and intake of foods and food groups at different eating occasions among adults in rural South Asia. We collected cross-sectional data from 5 districts across Bangladesh (n = 2802 individuals), India (n = 1672), and Nepal (n = 1451). The Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) application was used to measure food intake on the previous day, with each food tagged to an eating occasion. Diet quality and risk of dietary inadequacy and diet-related NCDs were assessed using GDQS total (0-49 points), GDQS positive (0-32), and GDQS negative (0-17) metrics for overall, healthy, and unhealthy food group intake, respectively. Diet quality was low, with similar scores across countries for GDQS total (17-19), GDQS positive (7-8), and GDQS negative (10-12). Over 90% of adults had levels of GDQS scores associated with moderate/high risk of nutrient inadequacy and diet-related NCDs, with the proportion at high risk in Bangladesh being 2-3× higher than that in other countries. One-third of adults skipped breakfast in Nepal, and snacking was twice as common in males (63%) vs females (33%) in Bangladesh. Lower GDQS total scores (worse diets) were associated with female gender and lower household wealth but not with household production of crops or livestock. These findings may help inform interventions to improve diets in South Asia, focusing on increasing intake of healthy fresh foods, while limiting intake of processed foods high in sugar, salt, and saturated fat.",

In Bangladesh, young adults may experience exacerbated IBS symptoms due to particular hardships. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of IBS and its association with mental health status among private university students. A cross-sectional study conducted between November 2023 and May 2024 and involved 550 students aged 19-40 years from three private universities in Dhaka, Bangladesh selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected via in-person interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire that included the Rome III and the DASS-21 scale. Pearson's χ² test was used to explore associations and multiple logistic regression was employed to identify factors influencing IBS. The prevalence of IBS among the students was 31.63%. Female students had higher odds of developing IBS compared to males (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.36). Psychological distress was strongly associated with IBS, with students experiencing severe anxiety (AOR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.11 to 7.24) and stress (AOR = 3.39, 95% CI: 1.16 to 6.79) showing increased odds of IBS. Additionally, satisfaction with academic major (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.96) indicates 54% lower odds of IBS compared to those who were unsatisfied. Physical activity (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.90) shows a 36% reduction in the odss of IBS with moderate physical activity (20-60 minutes per day). Daily vegetable consumption (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.89) suggested a 19% lower odds of IBS. Malnutrition (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.82) was associated with a 77% increased odds of IBS. The findings emphasize the importance of implementing comprehensive campuswide health promotion programs that address psychological distress, promote healthy lifestyle choices, and provide nutritional guidance to alleviate the burden of IBS among them.",

        "abstract": "The double burden of malnutrition (DBM), defined by the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition within households, poses significant public health challenges in South and Southeast Asia. While previous studies have examined the individual effects of maternal education and household wealth on DBM, findings remain inconsistent, and little is known about how these factors interact across different contexts. To address this gap, we used nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from Bangladesh (2017-2018), Cambodia (2022), Nepal (2022) and Timor-Leste (2016) to analyse the interaction between maternal education and household wealth in shaping DBM risk. These countries were selected due to their ongoing nutritional transition, which has contributed to the increasing prevalence of DBM. For the analysis, we used DHS data, which employs a standardised multistage cluster sampling method and probabilistic methods to ensure representativeness. In this study, we selected mother-child pairs from the DHS survey, focusing on children aged 0-59 months and nonpregnant mothers at the time of the survey. We included those pairs for which both the mother and child had valid weight and height measurements. Maternal education and household wealth were identified as the primary exposures. To examine their interaction and the impact of other covariates on DBM, we employed multivariable logistic regression models. Our study found that DBM prevalence was higher in urban and wealthier households, with the highest rates observed in Timor-Leste and Cambodia. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that lower maternal education increased DBM risk, especially in affluent households (OR 2.07-3.29). Conversely, higher maternal education was associated with lower DBM prevalence. Additionally, breastfeeding and antenatal care visits emerged as protective factors. These findings indicate the necessity for specific interventions aimed at enhancing maternal education and promoting healthy dietary practices, particularly in rich households. Additionally, reinforcing breastfeeding practices and increasing antenatal care visits are essential strategies to mitigate the risks associated with DBM.",

        "abstract": "Early childhood development (ECD) in low to middle-income nations has been a pressing concern for the last two to three decades. It is estimated that approximately 250 million children under the age of five are not reaching their full developmental potential due to factors such as poverty, malnutrition, and insufficient home stimulation. It is estimated that in Bangladesh, 44% of the children under 5 years live in poverty and 31% are stunted, and both factors are risks for poor childhood development. We aim to develop a sustainable, scaled ECD programme using an evidence-based curriculum of psychosocial stimulation for disadvantaged Bangladeshi children. Approximately 10,000 malnourished children aged 6-24 months will be identified by mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 13.5 cm, assessed by government health staff in over 500 community clinics (CCs) in 21 sub-districts of Hobiganj, Brahmanbaria, Laxmipur and Narsingdi districts. The children and their mothers will participate in the psychosocial stimulation programme that will be delivered fortnightly for one year to small groups at the CCs by health workers. We will train approximately 1,500 health staff in rural CCs to deliver the ECD sessions. We will follow a cascade training model to train personnel at all levels of the primary health care system. A subsample will be evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 48 CCs (24 intervention and 24 control). From each CC, 10 children aged 6-24 months will be tested before and after the programme. The primary outcome is children's cognitive development and we will also measure language composite scores on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. Secondary outcomes are children's growth, maternal knowledge and depressive symptoms, and stimulation in the home. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess intervention effects. There are no existing ECD services for the children under three years delivered by the health care system in Bangladesh. This study will help policy makers to consider incorporating ECD activities into the treatment of malnourished children in rural CCs, under the government's primary health care system, thereby developing a sustainable structure for improving disadvantaged children's development. The findings will also provide information to facilitate scaling ECD in the primary health care systems in other low and middle-income countries.

        "abstract": "Micronutrient deficiencies affect over half of young children and two-thirds of reproductive-aged women worldwide. Nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions have the potential to increase nutrient-dense food intake and thus improve micronutrient status. We evaluated the impact of a homestead food production (HFP) programme on micronutrient status and anaemia of women and their children (registered secondary outcomes) in the Food and Agricultural Approaches to Reducing Malnutrition (FAARM) trial, additionally assessing its impact on inflammation. We conducted a 1:1 parallel two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial in Sylhet, Bangladesh, with 96 clusters. The 3-year HFP intervention included gardening, poultry, nutrition, and hygiene components. In 2015, we enrolled 2705 women and their children up to 3 years of age, and in 2019, we evaluated impacts on anaemia, iron, vitamin A, zinc and inflammation status through blood measures of women (aged 19-44 years) and their 6- to 37-month-old children, using multilevel regression. Anaemia was common (nonpregnant women: 20%, pregnant women: 35%, children: 16%), while iron deficiency was rare among nonpregnant women (3%), 12% among pregnant women and 20% among children. Vitamin A deficiency ranged from 1% to 5%, and zinc deficiency was very common (nonpregnant women: 43%, pregnant women: 69%, children: 25%). We found no evidence of an intervention impact on micronutrient status, anaemia or inflammation among the 2483 women and 930 children measured. The moderate improvements in dietary intake achieved by the intervention were thus not sufficient, and more substantial hygiene improvements and targeted dietary changes may be needed to improve micronutrient status. This trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02505711).",

        "title": "Nerve Ultrasound for Detecting Morphologic Changes in Malnourished Children Under 5 Years of Age: A Comparative Study of Nutritional Intervention Outcomes in Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Malnourished children may experience disrupted peripheral nerve myelination, leading to impaired nerve conduction. However, ultrasound data on nerve morphology in severely malnourished children are lacking. Therefore, we performed a systematic study, comparing nerve ultrasound in malnourished children to controls. Nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) was assessed in three categories of malnourished (severe acute malnutrition [SAM], stunted, and wasted) and healthy Bangladeshi children aged 6-59 months to compare morphological changes at baseline (pre-intervention) and post-nutritional intervention. A total of 74 children were enrolled, including 17 with SAM, 19 wasted, 18 stunted, and 20 healthy controls. SAM children showed smaller nerve CSA compared to wasted peers, particularly in the sciatic nerve (8.25 mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 11.48 mm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.035) and median nerve proximal wrist (2.65 mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 2.90 mm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.004) among 6-23-month-olds. In the 24-59-month group, the median nerve proximal wrist CSA in SAM children was 2.30 mm<sup>2</sup> versus 3.90 mm<sup>2</sup> in healthy children (p = 0.019), and sciatic nerve CSA was 9.05 mm<sup>2</sup> versus 16.60 mm<sup>2</sup> (p = 0.008). Nutritional intervention improved z-scores in SAM children numerically, though not significantly within the study period. SAM children had smaller nerve CSA compared with wasted, stunted, and healthy children at specific nerve locations. These findings underscore the substantial impact of SAM on nerve morphology and the importance of early, sustained nutritional interventions, warranting further validation through animal models and large-scale studies in both children and adults.",

        "title": "Advancing Nutritional Status Classification With Hybrid Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Methodological Approach.",
        "abstract": "Malnutrition remains a critical public health issue in low-income countries, significantly hindering economic development and contributing to over 50% of infant deaths. Under nutrition weakens immune systems, increasing susceptibility to common illnesses and prolonging recovery periods. This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel artificial intelligence-based classification method for nutritional status assessment using hybrid machine learning strategies, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of malnutrition detection. This study utilizes the fire hawk optimizer-based k-means (FHO-K-Means) clustering method to identify key physiological indicators associated with under nutrition in children. The analysis is conducted using the UNICEF dataset, encompassing data from Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, and Zimbabwe. Following data normalization, the dataset is clustered via FHO-K-Means to establish optimal groupings. The clustered data is then partitioned into training and testing sets for classification using the extreme gradient boosting fuzzy (EGBF). The EGBF model is employed to classify nutritional states, including stunting, wasting, severe wasting, overweight, and underweight, providing a robust framework for predictive analysis. The proposed FHO-K-Means and EGBF model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 99.84% accuracy, 99.5% precision, 99.8% specificity, and 100% sensitivity, with an F1 measure of 98.6% and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.01%, outperforming existing classification techniques. These results indicate that the model offers a highly effective and scalable tool for identifying at-risk populations, informing targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence of childhood malnutrition, and lowering morbidity in poor countries. This study developed an innovative FHO-K mean clustering and EGBF classification method for assessing childhood nutritional status in underdeveloped countries. The exceptional accuracy and predictive capability of the model make it a valuable tool for early malnutrition detection, enabling data-driven decision-making in public health and policy formulation. By improving malnutrition diagnosis and intervention strategies, this approach has the potential to reduce morbidity and enhance child health outcomes in resource-constrained settings.",

        "abstract": "Ancylostoma duodenale, a parasitic nematode worm, is found to be involved in various infections, including intestinal blood loss, protein malnutrition, and anemia. Antimicrobial resistance to the available therapeutics has prompted the search for new drug and vaccine targets against A. duodenale. Despite significant advances in vaccine development against A. duodenale, no commercial and FDA-approved vaccine exists to safeguard humans from infections caused by this pathogen. In this investigation, a stringent bioinformatics analysis identified 36 unique essential and host-interacting proteins. Based on their subcellular localization, 6 proteins located in the extracellular space and outer membrane were categorized as vaccine targets, while the remaining proteins were predicted to act as potential drug candidates. These vaccine candidates were further assessed for antigenicity, allergenicity, and physicochemical analysis to determine their suitability for the designing of a multi-epitope vaccine. Two candidate proteins were chosen as optimal targets in the development of vaccine design. The identified T- and B-cell epitopes from these proteins were then combined with appropriate linkers and adjuvants to design chimeric vaccine constructs aimed at inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses. Molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations, PCA analysis, DCCM analysis, and binding free energy calculations proved stable interactions of the designed vaccine with human immune cell receptors. Within a bacterial cloning system, the vaccine constructs demonstrated the ability to be cloned and expressed. The immunological stimulation elicited significant immunological responses to the proposed vaccine. Our investigation identified new therapeutic targets and developed a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine against A. duodenale infection. Additional experimental verification will open up new therapeutic alternatives for this emerging resistant pathogen.",

In Malaysia, high prevalence of oral diseases including dental caries among individuals with disabilities (IWDs) has been reported, indicating a possible gap in the current system. This study aimed to analyze caries experience using DMFT index of IWDs in community-based rehabilitation (CBR) centers across Selangor, Malaysia. A CBR centers-based cross-sectional study was conducted on IWDs or CBR trainees in the period between August 2022 and December 2023. Recruitments of the study participants were done via census sampling method, involving all the trainees within the specific centers. Data collection was done using the World Health Organization oral health survey tool (WHO, 2013) and analyzed using SPSS 24. Two hundred and twenty-six students with the age range of 2-47 years old were included in the study. Clinical examination of CBR trainees revealed (1) the mean DMFT scores were low for primary dentition (2.02), moderate for both mixed (3.86), and permanent dentitions (4.17); (2) prevalence of caries among those with primary, mixed, and permanent dentitions as 44.44%, 74.4%, and 74.80%, respectively.

        "abstract": "The food environment is a driver of the double burden of malnutrition, influencing dietary intake by increasing or restricting access to foods. The objective of this study was to assess the association between geospatial food environment indicators and the diet quality among postpartum women in rural Bangladesh. Participants were women of infants enrolled in a cluster-randomized controlled trial from 2018 to 2020. Food vendor availability was defined as the number of food vendors within a specific household radius, and proximity was defined as the distance to the nearest vendor. Dietary intake was measured using a 7-d food frequency questionnaire collected at 3 mo, 6 mo, and 12 mo postpartum. Our primary outcome was nonstarchy staple food variety scores (FVS). Secondary outcomes included dietary diversity scores and individual food group consumption. To assess the association between food environment indicators and diet quality indicators, we fit linear regression models for the FVS outcome, Poisson regression models for the dietary diversity outcome, and logistic regression models for individual food group outcomes. A total of 5064 women were included in this analysis. Women reported consuming an average of 9.7 (standard deviation: 3.7) nonstarchy staple foods in the previous week. Women who lived in households with the highest market availability (≥7 markets within 1600 m) had an average of 0.84-unit (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 1.16) higher FVS compared with those in households with the lowest market availability (≤ 2 markets) (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Geospatial food environment indicators were not significantly associated with the odds of consuming less healthy food options. We found a positive relationship between market availability and diet quality for postpartum women in rural Bangladesh.

        "abstract": "Maternal mental health and other underlying factors might affect a child's nutritional status. This study assesses child undernutrition and its associated characteristics, including maternal mental health, in low-income settings in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 397 lactating mothers with children aged 6-23 months from low-income settings in Dhaka. Anthropometric measurements were taken following standard protocols, and Z-scores for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and BMI-for-age were calculated. Maternal depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, respectively. The child feeding index was developed based on breastfeeding, dietary diversity, and meal frequency. Multivariate logistic regression models explored the relationship between child undernutrition and maternal mental health and other risk factors. In low-income regions of Dhaka, the prevalence was 31.9% for stunting, 14.0% for wasting, and 24.1% for underweight children. Approximately half of the mothers experienced depression (55%) and anxiety (50%). High maternal depression levels were associated with increased odds of stunted (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.10-2.94, p < 0.05) and wasted (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI = 1.38-5.28, p < 0.05) children. Similarly, anxiety was linked to a higher risk of underweight children (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.04-3.11, p < 0.05). Female children had approximately twice the risk of stunting than boys (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.32-3.44, p < 0.01). Younger maternal age also doubled the risk of stunting (AOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.20-3.22, p < 0.01). Low adherence to a feeding index increased the odds of stunting (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.99-5.16, p < 0.001) and underweight (AOR = 4.20, 95% CI = 2.50-7.07, p < 0.01). Children born to underweight mothers were almost twice as likely to become underweight (AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.01-4.03, p < 0.05) compared to those born to normal/overweight mothers. Maternal depression and anxiety adversely affect the nutrition of their children. Sociodemographic factors such as the child's sex, maternal age, maternal health, and child feeding practices significantly contribute to child undernutrition. Policy initiatives should prioritize maternal mental health and address child undernutrition in these settings.",

Here, we intended to measure the possible association of these pathotypes with EED biomarkers and nutritional status of adults residing in a slum in Bangladesh. Fecal samples were collected from 524 malnourished adults (BMI ≤18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) living in a slum-setting in Dhaka from March 2016 to September 2019 and analyzed by TaqMan Array Card assays to evaluate the presence of E. coli pathotypes and other entero-pathogens. The multivariable linear regression model was used to assess the association. In these malnourished adults, the most prevalent pathotype of E. coli was EAEC (61.7%) and the least prevalent was STEC (6.7%). The prevalence of atypical EPEC, ETEC and Shigella/EIEC were 52%, 48.9% and 45.1% respectively. The infection with atypical EPEC had significant positive association with levels of Myeloperoxidase (b = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.11, 0.65; p-value = 0.006). Similarly, a significantly higher concentration of alpha-1-antitrypsin (b = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.22; p-value = 0.011) was found in the STEC-infected adults. However, no notable association was found between the <i>E. coli</i> pathotypes and nutritional status of these adult participants. Moreover, <i>Plesiomonas</i> infected adults were more likely to be infected with EAEC (p-value = 0.017), ETEC (p-value <0.001) and STEC (pvalue = 0.002). Significant coinfection was also detected among the pathotypes and other entero-pathogens such as <i>Giardia</i>, <i>Ascaris</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Enterocytozoon bieneusi</i>, and <i>Adenovirus</i>. The study results imply that there is an influence of particular <i>E. coli</i> pathotypes (EPEC and STEC) on intestinal inflammation and gut permeability of the malnourished Bangladeshi adults, but no association with nutritional status is found. Potential pathogenicity of the E. coli pathotypes is also observed when co-infection with other pathogens exists in these adults.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition remains one of the most pressing global health challenges, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh, where it continues to significantly impact child health and contribute to chronic illness and high child mortality. Despite the potential of machine learning to improve malnutrition predictions, research in this area remains limited in the country. This study utilizes Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2022 data to identify and quantify key determinants of under-five malnutrition (underweight, wasting, stunting) and evaluates various machine learning models for predicting malnutrition. By addressing a critical gap, this research provides deeper insights into the root causes of malnutrition in Bangladesh. Descriptive statistics were conducted to summarize the key characteristics of the dataset. Boruta algorithm was employed to identify important features related to malnutrition which were then used to evaluate several machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks (NN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), XGBoost (XGBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), in addition to the traditional logistic regression (LR) model. The best-performing model was selected to identify the most important factors contributing to malnutrition. The significance of these variables was further assessed using Feature Importance plot (Based on Gini Importance) and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values. Model performance was evaluated through various metrics, including accuracy, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), Cohen's kappa, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and precision. The study examined a cohort of 7,910 children, reporting prevalence rates of 19% for stunting, 8% for wasting, and 17% for underweight. The Boruta algorithm identified 18 confirmed features for stunting, 22 for wasting, and 19 for underweight. For stunting, the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed other methods with an accuracy of 64.19%, 95% CI of (0.623, 0.666), Cohen's kappa of 0.158, sensitivity of 56.25%, specificity of 66.00%, F1 score of 0.750 and precision of 0.60. In wasting prediction, RF achieved the highest accuracy at 76.68%, 95% CI of (0.743, 0.787), Cohen's kappa of 0.049, sensitivity of 27.22%, specificity of 80.98%, F1 score of 0.865 and precision of 0.810. Similarly, for underweight, RF demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 68.18%, 95% CI of (0.662, 0.703), Cohen's kappa of 0.130, sensitivity of 43.02%, specificity of 73.48%, F1 score of 0.792 and precision of 0.735. Across all malnutrition types, the RF model consistently outperformed traditional logistic regression (LR) and other ML techniques in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other performance metrics. For stunting, key predictors identified in both the Shapley and Gini importance plots included mother's education, father's occupation, place of delivery, wealth index, birth order, and toilet facility; for wasting, significant predictors were antenatal care, unmet family planning, mother's BMI, birth interval, father's occupation, and television ownership; and for underweight, important factors included father's occupation, mother's education, child's age, birth order, wealth index, and place of delivery. This study highlights the effectiveness of Random Forest (RF) in predicting malnutrition outcomes-stunting, wasting, and underweight-using key features identified by the Boruta algorithm. While RF demonstrates moderate performance in predicting stunting and underweight, it shows strong predictive ability for wasting. This underscores RF's potential in guiding targeted interventions for wasting, though further improvements are needed for stunting and underweight predictions. Moreover, the study identifies key contributors for each malnutrition outcome. By pinpointing these determinants, the study provides actionable insights for designing targeted interventions to combat malnutrition more effectively. These findings align with the global development agenda, particularly Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, reinforcing efforts to reduce malnutrition and improve child health outcomes in Bangladesh.",

        "title": "Incremental financial costs of strengthening large-scale child nutrition programs in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam: retrospective expenditure analysis.",
        "abstract": "Inattention to young child growth and development in a transitioning global environment can undermine the foundation of human capital and future progress. Diets that provide adequate energy and nutrients are critical for children's physical and cognitive development from 6 to 23.9 months of age and beyond. Still, over 70% of young children do not receive foods with sufficient nutrition particularly in low-and-middle income countries. Program evaluations have documented the effectiveness of large-scale behavior change interventions to improve children's diets, but the budgetary implications of programs are not known. This paper provides the incremental financial costs of strengthening three large-scale programs based on expenditure records from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. The programs reached between one and 2.5 million mothers and children annually per country at unit costs of between $0.9 to $1.6 per mother and child reached. An additional 0.7 to 1.6 million people who were influential in supporting mothers and achieving scale were also engaged. The largest cost component was counselling of mothers. Rigorous external impact evaluations showed that over 434,500 children benefited annually from consuming a minimum acceptable diet in all countries combined, at an annual cost per country of $6.3 to $34.7 per child benefited. Large scale programs to improve young children's nutrition can be affordable for low- and middle-income countries. The study provides the incremental costs of selectively strengthening key program components in diverse settings with lessons for future budgeting. The costs of treating a malnourished child are several-fold higher than prevention through improved improving young children's dietary practices. Differences across countries in program models, coverage, costs, and outcomes suggest that countries need a minimum investment of resources for strengthening high-reach service delivery and communication channels and engaging relevant behavioral levers and community support for mothers to achieve impact at scale.",

The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program provides specific data on child health across numerous countries. This meta-analysis aims to comprehensively assess machine learning (ML) applications in DHS data to predict malnutrition in children. A comprehensive search of the peer-reviewed literature in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases was conducted in January 2024. Studies employing ML algorithms on DHS data to predict malnutrition in children under 5 years were included. Using PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool), the quality of the listed studies was evaluated. To conduct meta-analyses, Review Manager 5.4 was used. A total of 11 out of 789 studies were included in this review. The studies were published between 2019 and 2023, with the major contribution from Bangladesh (<i>n</i> = 6, 55%). Of these, ten studies reported stunting, three reported wasting, and four reported underweight. A meta-analysis of ten studies reported a pooled accuracy of 68.92% (95% CI: 66.04, 71.80; I<sup>2</sup> = 100%) among ML models for predicting stunting in children. Three studies indicated a pooled accuracy of 84.39% (95% CI: 80.90, 87.87; I<sup>2</sup> = 100%) in predicting wasting. A meta-analysis of four studies indicated a pooled accuracy of 73.60% (95% CI: 70.01, 77.20; I<sup>2</sup> = 100%) for ML models predicting underweight status in children.

        "abstract": "While existing studies conducted in South Asian countries have provided valuable insights into the nutritional status of the marginalized third-gender population and highlighted suboptimal nutritional conditions, regrettably such data is lacking in Bangladesh. Addressing this data gap is crucial to understanding and improving the nutritional condition of the third-gender community. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate their nutritional status, dietary protein intake, lifestyle, social behavior, nutritional knowledge, and prevalence of diseases. The cross-sectional study was conducted in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Fifty participants from the third-gender community were selected. Study subjects were individually interviewed through a structured questionnaire to gather specific data. SPSS was used for statistical analysis. Logistic Regression, Shapiro-Wilk Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Chi-square tests were carried out to measure the associations among the variables. The average age of the participants was 32.74 ± 9.30 years, with 26% lacking formal education and 72% engaged in money collection as a primary occupation. 36% earned less than BDT 5,000 monthly, with only 2% exceeding BDT 20,000. The mean height and mean body weights were 163 ± 5.21 cm and 60.64 ± 13.61 kg (mean ± SD) respectively. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.02 ± 5.04 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, among whom 14% were underweight, 56% were normal, 20% were overweight, and 10% were obese. 48% of the participants had poor nutritional knowledge, and 46% had average. 50% of the participants had smoking habits and 34% of the participants consumed alcohol. Nutritional intake was skewed towards plant proteins (72%), with inadequate access to healthcare reported by 56% of subjects. Two-thirds (66%) of the respondents had no illness, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) affected 34% of participants, with diabetes (12%) and low pressure (8%) prevalent. Smoking significantly correlated with lower normal BMI (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07-0.84, p < 0.05). Unhealthy food intake was significantly associated with underweight risks (AOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.92, p < 0.05). When compared with male and female Bangladeshi populations, third-gender individuals had higher overweight prevalence, moderate normal BMI rates, and lower malnutrition than males. The research identified suboptimal nutritional status among the third-gender population in Bangladesh, highlighting higher rates of both obesity and underweight, as well as a prevalence of non-communicable diseases, particularly diabetes.",

        "title": "Perceptions of Underlying Factors and Consequences of Childhood Malnutrition and Care-Seeking Behaviour for Children Under 5 Years With Acute Malnutrition: A Qualitative Study in Rural Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "Acute Malnutrition affects 45 million children under five globally, with Bangladesh contributing more than 1.7 million cases. While community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) guidelines in Bangladesh exist, they primarily emphasise nutritional counselling and face challenges in coverage and implementations. It is important to understand barriers to CMAM uptake and implementation. This study aims to explore the perceptions of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences among parents, healthcare providers, and policymakers, alongside parents' care-seeking behaviours for under-five children with acute malnutrition. Conducted in areas with and without CMAM programs, the research follows a phenomenological design with thematic analysis of focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Thirty FGDs with parents, 28 KIIs with healthcare providers, and 16 KIIs with policymakers were conducted. Identified causes of acute malnutrition included infections, diseases, lack of awareness about nutritious foods, supernatural beliefs, poverty, and inadequate care and feeding practices. Consequences included stunted growth, impaired mental development, and increased illness risk. Although parents acknowledged the urgency of treating acute malnutrition, they sought care at healthcare facilities regardless of illness. Factors influencing care-seeking behaviour were inability in problem prioritisation, transportation cost and availability, healthcare access, wage loss, and out-of-pocket expenses. Despite awareness of acute malnutrition's underlying factors and consequences, parental care-seeking remains limited. The study recommends integrating acute malnutrition guidelines with communicable disease programs, implementing targeted social and behavioural change programs, addressing superstitions, fostering collaboration with traditional healers strengthening social safety nets, and empowering women in healthcare decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Underweight, wasting and stunting are crucial malnutrition indicators responsible for morbidities among children. Data regarding coexisting forms of malnutrition (CFM) are scarce. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of CFM across two survey years among under-5 Bangladeshi children. Cross-sectional study. Data were acquired from two rounds of Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), Bangladesh conducted in 2012-13 and 2019. <i>Subjects:</i> The analysis included 43 946 (2012-13: 20 885; 2019: 23 061) under-5 children. Binomial proportion test, slope index of inequality and multinomial logistic regression models were used for analysis. The prevalence of CFM was 27·45 % and 18·56 % in 2012-13 and 2019, respectively. A significant decrease in the prevalence of CFM was seen across the surveys (<i>P</i>-value < 0·001). Children from urban residence ((2012-13:aOR = 0·70, 95 % CI: 0·64, 0·77); (2019:aOR = 0·71, 95 % CI: 0·65, 0·78), higher maternal education ((2012-13:aOR = 0·28, 95 % CI: 0·24, 0·32); (2019:aOR = 0·28, 95 % CI: 0·24, 0·32), larger size at birth ((2012-13:aOR = 0·62, 95 % CI: 0·52, 0·73); (2019:aOR: 0·60, 95 % CI: 0·50, 0·73) and richest wealth quintile ((2012-13:aOR = 0·25, 95 % CI: 0·22, 0·28); (2019:aOR: 0·30, 95 % CI: 0·27, 0·34)) had lower odds of suffering from CFM compared with their counterparts. Children from poorer quintiles were more influenced by CFM than richer quintiles (Coef.:-0·175, 95 % CI: -0·192, -0·157, <i>P</i>-value < 0·001). Higher percentage of CFM was observed among rich families in 2019 compared with 2012-13 (24·50 % and 20·15 %, respectively; <i>P</i>-value < 0·001). The findings of this study should help the researchers and policymakers to understand CFM more clearly and plan prospective studies to explore CFM outcomes. Targeted interventional approaches are needed among parents of rural communities to control the burden of CFM.",

This randomized clinical trial aimed to observe the therapeutic effect of vitamin D₃ supplementation on non linear measures of HRV in 60 male vitamin D₃ deficient (<30 - 10 ng/ml) ACO patients. Patients were given orally either vitamin D₃ capsule or placebo per week for 6 months and serum vitamin D₃ level and non linear measures of HRV were assessed before and after intervention. HRV was measured by power lab 8/35, AD instruments and vitamin D₃ was assessed by chemiluminescent micro-particle immunoassay (CMA) method by auto analyzer. For statistical analysis paired sample 't' test and independent sample 't' test were done. Before intervention vitamin D₃ level and non linear parameters of HRV were similar in all patients but both these outcome measures significantly increased in vitamin D₃ treated but not in placebo treated patients after 6 months.

        "abstract": "Migraine is one of the commonest primary headache disorders associated with significant morbidity as well as reduced quality of life. As low serum vitamin D level was found in association with various neurologic and non-neurologic disorders, it may be associated with migraine as well. This study was designed to determine the association between low serum vitamin D levels and migraine. This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in the Department of Neurology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from July 2019 to June 2021. Total 328 patients were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria following informed written consent and divided into two groups. One hundred and sixty-four (164) migraine patients were enrolled in migraine group and same number of age and gender-matched apparently healthy individuals were included in non-migraine group. Detailed history taking and clinical examinations were done and serum vitamin D level was measured in all participants. Demographic variables of both groups were calculated without any significant difference. The mean serum vitamin D level was measured 16.11±6.33 ng/ml in case group and 23.13±8.71 ng/ml in control group with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). A significant difference was also found in relation to the frequency of migraine attacks (18.49±6.70 ng/ml with ≤3 episodes/month and 14.84±5.76 ng/ml with >3 episodes/month, p<0.001). Mean serum vitamin D was measured lower in moderate and severe disease (23.67±4.86 ng/ml in mild disease, 19.79±5.97 ng/ml in moderate disease,12.94±4.24 ng/ml in severe disease, p<0.001). No significant difference in serum vitamin D level was found in terms of presence or absence of aura. But serum vitamin D level was significantly lower in migraine patients having positive family history (p=0.002). Considering the above findings, it is evident that serum vitamin D level is most likely to be associated with migraine. Early detection of low serum vitamin D levels and measures to correct it may be an adjunctive management strategy in migraine.",

        "abstract": "The 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration at which parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration plateaus has been considered to benchmark vitamin D deficiency. However, in young children, there is limited evidence for a suppression point in the 25(OH)D-PTH relationship or its relevance to bone mass accrual. To determine whether the threshold of 25(OH)D at PTH suppression in young children is corroborated by associations of 25(OH)D (or PTH) with bone mineral content (BMC) and areal bone mineral density (aBMD). In a cross-sectional secondary analysis of data from the BONe and mUScle health in Kids (BONUSKids) study of 4-y-old children in Bangladesh, serum 25(OH)D and intact PTH (iPTH) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a chemiluminescent immunoassay, respectively. BMC and aBMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations between 25(OH)D, iPTH, and bone outcomes (BMC, BMC z-score, aBMD, and aBMD z-score) were modeled using multivariable-adjusted linear regression and spline models. Model fit was compared using Akaike's Information Criteria. Of 534 participants (51% female), 28% had 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/L and 34% had iPTH >6.7 pmol/L. Model fit of the inverse relationship between 25(OH)D and iPTH was optimized with an inflection point at 25 nmol/L [<25 nmol/L: -0.16 pmol/L per 1 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.22, -0.10; P < 0.001), above which the slope attenuated (≥25 nmol/L: -0.02 pmol/L; 95% CI: -0.04, -0.003; P = 0.019]. However, the positive linear associations between 25(OH)D and bone mass outcomes were monotonic (P < 0.05), and iPTH was not associated with any bone outcome in adjusted models (P > 0.05 for all). Associations were similar in males and females. Among 4-y-old children in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we did not identify a 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D deficiency based on its association with bone mass. However, efforts to raise 25(OH)D to ≥25 nmol/L may be warranted based on the relatively strong inverse association of 25(OH)D with iPTH below this threshold.

However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository. A detailed description of each component is presented below.",

        "abstract": "Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have a weakened immune system. The relationship between malnutrition and alterations in the frequency of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) remains unclear. This study investigated the altered immune responses in Bangladeshi children with SAM compared to healthy children. PBMCs were collected from 24 healthy children and 25 children with SAM upon their hospital admission and after 21 days of nutritional therapy at a nutritional rehabilitation unit. Flow cytometry was employed to assess various subsets of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Children with SAM exhibited significantly lower levels of activated (CD25+) B cells (SAM vs. healthy: 0.18 % vs. 0.30 %, p = 0.031) and NK cells (SAM vs. healthy: 4.9 % vs. 9.6 %, p = 0.003) compared to healthy controls. Similar immune responses were observed in SAM children during both hospitalization and discharge, with NK cell percentages showing slight increases but remaining significantly lower than in healthy children (SAM endline vs. healthy: 5.9 % vs. 9.6 %, p = 0.032). Notable reductions were also observed in CD62+ helper T cells, CD62L+ cytotoxic T cells, and CD62L+ B cells. These results suggest that although SAM children recover clinically, their immune systems remain compromised during discharge.",

        "title": "The rural food environment and its association with diet, nutrition status, and health outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs): a systematic review.",
        "abstract": "The food environment consists of external and personal domains that shape food purchasing decisions. While research on food environments has grown rapidly within high-income countries (HICs) in response to increasing rates of overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), critical research gaps remain. The role of food environment on diet, health and nutrition has been understudied in LMICs. To date, there has not been a systematic review specifically focusing on rural LMICs. This systematic review aims to synthesize findings from studies examining the association between rural food environment domains and diet, nutrition and health in LMICs or effects of food environment interventions on these outcomes. Searches were conducted from 9 databases: Medline (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), Global Health (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), EconLit (EBSCOhost), Web of Science (Social Science Citation Index), Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ProQuest) to identify studies published between 2000 and 2023 that reported associations between this/these dimensions with diets, nutrition or health outcomes. Both quantitative and qualitative studies that were published in English were included. Data extraction and quality appraisal was conducted independently by two authors, before the study findings were collated and summarized through a narrative data synthesis. Nineteen eligible studies were identified from 9 databases covering 11 LMICs. The included studies employed quantitative (n = 12), mixed method (n = 6) and qualitative (n = 1) designs in the neighbourhood food environment. In this review, availability dimension of the external food environment featured most prominently, followed by accessibility, affordability, desirability, and convenience dimensions of the personal food environment. Food availability was positively associated with diet (n = 10), nutrition (n = 7) and health (n = 1). There was good evidence regarding associations between food accessibility, diet (n = 7) and nutrition (n = 3). We identified some evidence that food price and affordability (n = 8) were considered key barriers to achieving healthy diets. Desirability (n = 4) and convenience (n = 2) dimensions were also associated with dietary outcomes, although we found only a few studies. Only one South African qualitative study was identified which highlighted limited availability and accessibility to local supermarkets and surrounding informal fruit and vegetable vendors to be a barrier to expensive, healthy foods consumption. Finally, evidence regarding health outcomes, sustainability dimension, impacts of food environment interventions on relevant outcomes and interactions between food environment dimensions was missing. Overall, seven out of nineteen studies were rated as good quality, six were rated as fair and six were rated as poor. Future interventions should consider improving availability and accessibility of nutritious foods to improve public health nutrition in rural LMICs. Evidence from studies assessing the workplace, home, and school food environments, food environment interventions, sustainability dimension and other key dimensions of the external food environment such as prices, vendor and product properties and marketing and regulation is needed to identify effective interventions to address malnutrition in all its forms characterized by the coexistence of undernutrition, overnutrition, undernutrition and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs).",

        "title": "Influence of environmental exposures on T follicular helper cell function and implications on immunity: a comparison of Bangladeshi and American children.",
        "abstract": "T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for B cell activation and subsequent antibody production. This functionality is influenced by surface markers such as CD40L, a costimulatory factor which promotes B cell activation, and CD57, which is a well-known marker of senescence. This study examined age-specific differences in Tfh cell function in Bangladeshi and American children. At age two, Bangladeshi children displayed impaired CD40L upregulation and significant CD57 downregulation upon stimulation. These patterns, not observed in American children of the same age, suggested an exhaustion-like phenotype potentially driven by environmental factors. Random forest and generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling was used to analyze predictors of Tfh cell response to stimulation. Days since the last antibiotic treatment, total antibiotic treatments, diarrheal episodes, and malnutrition were identified as variables that significantly impacted the Tfh response to stimuli. To assess Tfh cell ability to promote antibody responses, we correlated Tfh functionality with antibody concentration post-vaccination and in response to infection with <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, an endemic apicomplexan parasite. Increased CD40L expression upon stimulation correlated positively with anti-Poliovirus type 2/3 neutralizing antibody and anti-Cp17 (a <i>Cryptosporidium</i> sporozoite antigen) IgA concentrations. In contrast, increased CD57 expression was significantly correlated with decreased anti-Cp17 IgA. This indicates that an activation-supportive phenotype (CD40L+) may be more effective in promoting immunity than a senescent phenotype (CD57+). Together, these findings suggest that early-life environmental exposures may program Tfh cell functionality, impacting immune response potential in settings with high pathogen exposure. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are upstream mediators that shape the humoral immune response to specific antigens. The generation of an effective memory response to infection is vital to prevent subsequent reinfections. However, in areas with high burdens of exposure to infections, such as the urban community from Bangladesh studied here, children are consistently exposed to inflammatory pathogens. Specific environmental exposures significantly influenced Tfh cell activation and senescence phenotypes. Additionally, Tfh cell responses correlated with antibody concentrations following vaccination or infection, indicating that environmental factors may play a critical role in shaping effective immunity in early childhood.",

        "abstract": "More than 80% of deaths due to preventable and treatable causes among under 5 (U5) children occur in the sub-Saharan Africa and the South-Asia, pneumonia remains one of the most common such causes. Bangladesh has demonstrated success in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in relation to target 4. Nevertheless, the country is still among the 10 countries with the highest number of deaths among U5 children in 2019. The current study aimed to identify factors associated with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and the care-seeking behaviour of the children's care takes in Bangladesh. The cross-sectional study used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, Bangladesh (2019) . U5 children were included in the analysis (n=22 779). A p<0.05 as considered statistically. The prevalence of ARI in the past 2 weeks of survey was 2.03%. It was found that age of the child (in months), sex, residence, division, stunting, age of the mother and age of the father had statistically significant association (p<0.05). The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of ARI were lower among older children aged 24-59 months (AOR 0.53; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.64; p<0.001), female (AOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83; p<0.001) and children with father aged ≥25 years (AOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; p=0.008) and higher (AOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.61; p=0.010) among children with stunting. Among the children with ARI, 16.63% primary caregivers did not seek any treatment. Most of the children with ARI (65.01%) were treated with antibiotics. The prevalence of ARI was low. However, still a significant proportion of primary caregivers of U5 children with ARI fail to seek healthcare. The proportion of U5 children who are treated with antibiotics requires attention. Focus should be on younger fathers for promoting healthcare-seeking and good feeding practice to reduce malnutrition.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition is related to the development of chronic diseases, including cancer and is a major cause of mortality in patients with cancer. The study aimed to understand the prevalence and factors associated with malnutrition among patients with cancer. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with cancer and its relationship with sociodemographic status and treatments. Patients' nutritional diagnosis was performed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool. The performance status (PS) was obtained from the scale developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Data were collected from two hospitals from January to March 2023. A χ<sup>2</sup> test and multinominal regression analysis were performed by SPSS V.25. Out of 275 patients, 164 (60%) were male, with the mean age of 49.54 years (SD 15.61). Of these, 184 patients (67%) were malnourished of whom 149 patients (54%) had moderate and 35 patients (13%) had severe malnutrition. Patients' age, sex, PS, cancer site, treatment modalities, duration and hospitalisation were significantly associated with nutritional status (p<0.05). Patients between the ages of 40 and 60 were 2.96 times more likely to be malnourished compared with those younger than 40 (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) 2.96; 95% CI 1.40 to 6.24). Female patients had 7.74 times higher risk of malnutrition compared with male patients (AOR 7.74; 95% CI 2.03 to 19.80). Malnutrition was 2.6 times higher for surgical patients compared with nonsurgical ones (AOR 2.60; 95% CI 1.29 to 5.26). The risk of malnutrition was 4.06 times greater in patients treated longer than 12 months compared with those treated less than 6 months (AOR 4.06; 95% CI 1.82 to 9.08). There is a high prevalence of malnutrition among patients with cancer, and it is essential to include regular nutritional assessment in the treatment process for better outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Childhood illness and hospitalisation result in both direct and indirect costs to families before, during and after admission. We aimed to estimate the catastrophic expenditure during hospitalisation for children with acute illness. This was a prespecified cross-sectional substudy nested within two prospective studies. Participants were recruited and interviewed from three rural and three urban hospitals in Kenya and Uganda. A costing questionnaire was administered to the caregivers of 731 children hospitalised for acute illness to evaluate direct and indirect costs incurred by caregivers and families. Costs incurred were compared for families with children both with and without complicated severe malnutrition (CSM). Catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure exceeding 10% and 25% of monthly income was assessed. The median (IQR) total cost during hospitalisation per child was US$47 (US$24-US$84), with higher costs for children with CSM, especially during hospitalisation (US$56 (US$26-US$99) vs US$36 (US$20-US$65); p<0.001). During hospitalisation, bed charges followed by food were the main cost drivers. Caregivers reported losing a median of 7 (4-11) days of productive time during a child's hospitalisation with a mean loss of income of US$10 (SD US$25.6, median US$0 (US$0-US$10)). 92% and 74% of households experienced catastrophic expenditure at thresholds of 10% and 25% of monthly income, respectively. Caregivers reported borrowing, selling property and withdrawing other children from school to cope with costs. Despite intentions of free healthcare services for under 5, families of acutely ill children very commonly faced catastrophic expenditure, especially for children with CSM. Interventions aimed at supporting financial protection, reducing additional healthcare costs, and lowering health service charges may help prevent catastrophic expenditures.",

        "abstract": "Children living in refugee camps in South Asian countries suffer from undernutrition. However, the emerging prevalence of double burden of malnutrition could potentially cause a crisis in the healthcare of the refugee population. Double burden increases the risk for co-morbidities, poor functional health, and increased risk for premature death among these children. The study aims to assess the prevalence of malnutrition among refugee children in South Asia. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the standard Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines using CoCoPop mnemonic approach. We searched JSTOR, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases for studies on the prevalence of malnutrition in refugee children from 1984 to August 2024 with restricted English language. The screening of research articles was undertaken using COVIDENCE 2.0 software. The JBI checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the included articles. The meta analysis was carried out using MedCalc 22.018 software. The gray literature was manually searched from the reputed organizations focusing on refugee children and was narratively analyzed for malnutrition statistics. Furthermore, the corroboration of primary research articles and gray literature was conducted for comprehensive understanding. The review included 10 full-text research articles, all with cross-sectional study design and 11 gray literatures. The 10 studies covered a total of 4,274 participants with 3,536 urban and 738 rural refugee children aged between 0 and 19 years [refugee children (<i>n</i> = 8) and refugee adolescents (<i>n</i> = 2)]. The sample size of the included studies varied between 58 and 1,087 and mostly from Bangladesh. The prevalence of stunting ranged from 3.9-75.4% in the included studies [pooled prevalence: 31.8% (95% CI: 18.6-46.6%)]; wasting between 0.3-24.3% [pooled prevalence:10.1% (95% CI: 4.6-17.3)]; underweight between 4.4-65% [pooled prevalence: 19.1% (95% CI: 10.8-29.2%)]; and overweight between 3 and 24% [pooled prevalence: 6.5% (95% CI: 2.6-12.1%)]. Time trend analysis of the prevalence of malnutrition showed a decreasing trend in underweight, an increasing trend for stunting and wasting, and overweight including a rising prevalence of dual burden of under-and overnutrition. The study indicates a high prevalence of undernutrition and a rising prevalence of overnutrition -the Asian paradox of the double burden of malnutrition in refugee children living in South Asia. The coexisting double burden of malnutrition among refugee children calls for comprehensive programs and policies for the prevention and management of the double burden of malnutrition.",

We evaluated the impact of a food hygiene intervention on complementary food contamination in Bangladesh. A 3-year homestead food production intervention was complemented by an 8-month behavior change module to improve household food hygiene practices and evaluated in a cluster-randomized controlled trial, including a dedicated study measuring outcomes along the hygiene pathway to intestinal health. We used multilevel regression to assess the intervention's impact on microbial food contamination as well as food hygiene knowledge (n = 518) and reported practices (n = 531) among mothers of children 6-23 months of age. Complementary food samples were collected from 342 households with children 6-18 months of age and tested for Escherichia coli. Overall, 46% of food samples were contaminated with E. coli (43% intervention, 51% control), and there was no evidence that the intervention reduced food contamination (odds ratio: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.35-1.21). A higher proportion of intervention mothers could name all key food hygiene practices (23% intervention versus 1% control), had access to a basic handwashing station near the kitchen (24% versus 14%), reported washing hands before food preparation and child feeding (21% versus 8%), reported washing and storing feeding utensils safely (61% versus 49%), and reported preparing food fresh or reheating stored food (88% versus 79%) compared with control mothers. The intervention thus improved knowledge and reported food hygiene practices among mothers, but this improvement did not result in a substantial reduction of complementary food contamination.",

While several strategies exist to combat these deficiencies, biofortification has emerged as a powerful and sustainable approach to enhance the nutritional value of staple crops. This review examines recent advances in crop biofortification and their potential to address global nutritional challenges. We present successful case studies including iron-enriched cassava, nutrient-enhanced tomatoes, and omega-3-fortified oilseed crops, demonstrating the diverse possibilities for improving nutritional outcomes. The integration of novel plant-based protein production techniques has further expanded opportunities for sustainable nutrition. However, significant challenges remain, including complex environmental interactions, regulatory considerations, and sociocultural barriers to adoption. Economic analyses suggest biofortification offers substantial return on investment, with every dollar invested generating up to seventeen dollars in benefits through reduced disease burden. As global food security challenges intensify due to climate change, biofortified crops represent a crucial tool for improving nutritional outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We conclude by examining emerging opportunities and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium spp. is a cause of diarrhea morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age. In addition, asymptomatic infections can have a negative impact on growth and development. In low- and middle-income countries where a greater number of infants may be malnourished, the results of treating cryptosporidiosis with the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) have been inconsistent. Malnutrition is both a risk factor for cryptosporidiosis and a consequence of infection with this parasite. Treatment with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 has been shown to assist in nutritional recovery and the restoration of gut health. In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we examined whether combined probiotic and NTZ treatment could result in the reduction in parasitemia and infection-associated growth stunting in undernourished children. Cryptosporidium spp.-positive Bangladeshi children with a weight-for-length Z score between -1 and -3 were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 (n = 26) received NTZ and Lactobacillus, group 2 (n = 28) received NTZ along with a placebo, and the third control group (n = 10) received standard care. There was no difference in the duration of infection or improvement in child anthropometric measurements in any treatment group compared with control. Therefore, this pilot study does not provide support for treatment with NTZ, Lactobacillus, or the two in combination as an effective means of reducing the duration of Cryptosporidium spp. infection or improving growth in growth-stunted children.",

        "abstract": "The current study is an attempt to explore under-five child malnutrition in a low-income population setting using the Extended Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (ECIAF). Data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2017-2018 were analysed. Malnutrition using ECIAF was estimated using stunting, wasting underweight and overweight. Multilevel logistic regression models identified factors associated with malnutrition. Geospatial analysis was conducted using R programming. Bangladesh. Children under 5 years of age. In Bangladesh, as indicated by the ECIAF, approximately 40·8 % (95 % CI: 39·7, 41·9) of children under five experience malnutrition, whereas about 3·3 % (95 % CI: 2·9, 3·7) were overweight. Children of parents with no formal education (56·3 %, 95 % CI: 50·8, 61·8), underweight mothers (53·4 %, 95 % CI: 50·4, 56·3), belonging to the lowest socio-economic strata (50·6 %, 95 % CI: 48·3, 53·0), residing in rural areas (43·3 %, 95 % CI: 41·9, 44·6) and aged below 3 years (47·7 %, 95 % CI: 45·2, 50·2) demonstrated a greater age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of malnutrition. The Sylhet division (Eastern region) exhibited a higher prevalence of malnutrition (> 55·0 %). Mothers with no formal education (adjusted OR (AOR): 1·51, 95 % CI: 1·08, 2·10), underweight mother (AOR: 1·54, 95 % CI: 1·03, 1·83), poorest socio-economic status (AOR: 2·14, 95 % CI: 1·64, 2·81), children aged 24-35 months (AOR: 2·37, 95 % CI: 1·97, 2·85) and fourth and above birth order children (AOR: 1·41, 95 % CI: 1·16, 1·72) were identified key factors associated with childhood malnutrition while adjusting community- and household-level variations. In Bangladesh, two out of five children were malnourished, and one in thirty-five children was overweight. Continuous monitoring of the ECIAF over time would facilitate tracking changes in the prevalence of different forms of malnutrition, helping to plan interventions and assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at addressing both undernutrition and overweight.",

        "title": "Advancing vegetable genetics with gene editing: a pathway to food security and nutritional resilience in climate-shifted environments.",
        "abstract": "As global populations grow and climate change increasingly disrupts agricultural systems, ensuring food security and nutritional resilience has become a critical challenge. In addition to grains and legumes, vegetables are very important for both human and animals because they contain vitamins, minerals, and fibre. Enhancing the ability of vegetables to withstand climate change threats is essential; however, traditional breeding methods face challenges due to the complexity of the genomic clonal multiplication process. In the postgenomic era, gene editing (GE) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving vegetables. GE can help to increase traits such as abiotic stress tolerance, herbicide tolerance, and disease resistance; improve agricultural productivity; and improve nutritional content and shelf-life by fine-tuning key genes. GE technologies such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) have revolutionized vegetable breeding by enabling specific gene modifications in the genome. This review highlights recent advances in CRISPR-mediated editing across various vegetable species, highlighting successful modifications that increase their resilience to climatic stressors. Additionally, it explores the potential of GE to address malnutrition by increasing the nutrient content of vegetable crops, thereby contributing to public health and food system sustainability. Additionally, it addresses the implementation of GE-guided breeding strategies in agriculture, considering regulatory, ethical, and public acceptance issues. Enhancing vegetable genetics via GE may provide a reliable and nutritious food supply for an expanding global population under more unpredictable environmental circumstances.",

        "abstract": "Risk prediction tools for acutely ill children have been developed in high- and low-income settings, but few are validated or incorporated into clinical guidelines. We aimed to assess the performance of existing paediatric early warning scores for use in low- and middle-income countries using clinical data from a recent large multi-country study in Africa and South-Asia. We used data (children across three nutritional strata) from the Childhood Acute Illness and Nutrition (CHAIN) Network cohort study (n = 3101). We assessed 10 scores where similar predictor variables were available in the CHAIN cohort. We evaluated performance using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) (primary outcome), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (secondary outcomes). Most scores showed poor discrimination, and all scores had low sensitivity. The paediatric early death index for Africa (AUC = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77-0.83), respiratory index of severity in children (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.74-0.81), and respiratory index of severity in children in Malawi (AUC = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.75-0.82) showed acceptable/good overall discrimination. Among children without wasting, most scores had acceptable/good performance, some even excellent. Poor discrimination was found for most scores among children with moderate and severe wasting or kwashiorkor. All scores demonstrated lower validation performance than originally reported. Among children without wasting, most risk prediction scores performed acceptably whilst in malnourished children they performed poorly. There is a need for a malnutrition specific score. Further research is needed on specific actions in responding to scores. Integration into future guidelines will require acknowledging staffing, resources and workflows.",

        "abstract": "The coverage of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is still short of the target set by the government to reach 90% coverage of VAS in Bangladesh. The present study aims to examine the socioeconomic and geographical inequalities in receiving VAS among children aged 6-59 months in Bangladesh from 2004 to 2017. The Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys for the years 2004-2017 were accessed through the WHO's Health Equity Assessment Toolkit. Inequalities were explored from socioeconomic and geographical perspectives. Specifically, it considered wealth quintile and education as socioeconomic dimensions and place of residence as geographical dimensions. We calculated difference, population attributable fraction (PAF), population attributable risk (PAR) and ratio as summary measures and their associated 95% CIs to quantify and assess the extent of health disparities. The study revealed a fluctuating trend over the years in the prevalence of receiving VAS among children in Bangladesh. The prevalence shifted from 78.68% in 2004 to a low of 62.09% in 2011, subsequently increasing to 79.29% in 2017. The PAF in 2017 for the variable wealth was 4.61 (95% CI 2.38 to 6.85), highlighting the extent of the disparity that favoured wealthier individuals. The study also detected inequalities based on educational levels; in 2017, the difference measure of inequality was 9.24 (95% CI 3.69 to 14.79), indicating a notable advantage for children from the higher educated group. Children from urban areas were also observed to have a higher likelihood of receiving VAS compared with their rural counterparts. This study identified a persistent regional inequality in receiving VAS in Bangladesh over time. These inequalities remained a concern, especially for children from poor wealth groups, low-educated families and rural regions. This understanding will inform the development of a comprehensive programme aimed at increasing the prevalence of VAS among all children in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition in the early days of life is a global public health concern that affects children's growth. It results from a variety of factors, including pathogenic infections. Enterocytozoon bieneusi is a microsporidian parasite that can cause diarrhea and malnutrition in children. The study aimed to assess the impact of E. bieneusi on child growth. The MAL-ED study, a multicountry birth cohort research project, investigated the relationship between enteric infections and malnutrition in participating children from eight countries. A customized real-time polymerase chain reaction-based TaqMan array card was used in this study to identify enteropathogens from stool samples, where E. bieneusi was one of the target pathogens. The impacts of E. bieneusi infection on growth measures were assessed. Mixed-effect linear models were used to investigate the relationship between E. bieneusi and growth outcomes, including length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length (WLZ) Z scores. At the endpoint (last month of measurement), the infected group had significantly lower scores than the noninfected group for all outcomes. The adjusted difference-in-difference (D-in-D) values were -0.53 (95% CI: -0.67 to -0.38) for LAZ, -0.38 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.23) for WAZ, and -0.22 (95% CI: -0.38 to -0.06) for WLZ. Enterocytozoon bieneusi infection has been identified as a factor associated with reduced linear growth, weight gain, and weight gain relative to linear growth in children, underscoring the importance of treating this infection.",

Nutrition interventions for women are delivered through maternal health services such as antenatal care and institutional deliveries, but whether they reach and protect the disadvantaged against malnutrition is not well documented. To assess the similarities in socioeconomic disparities and inequalities in the nutritional status and health care of women. We analyzed nationally representative data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, and Nigeria to calculate Erreygers index. This index measures the inequality in outcomes across socioeconomic spectrums. We investigated inequalities in low and high body mass index (BMI), anaemia, iron and folic acid supplementation, four or more antenatal care visits, institutional deliveries, and access to health services. Anaemia (-0.068 to -0.123), low BMI (-0.088 to -0.139), perceived distance to health services (-0.219 to -0.406), and needing permission to visit health facilities (-0.062 to -0.147) were concentrated among the less well-off, as shown by negative values. Iron and folic acid supplementation (0.043 to 0.230), antenatal care visits (0.260 to 0.495), and institutional deliveries (0.168 to 0.573) favored the better-off, as shown by positive values. Inequalities in urban vs. rural areas differed by indicator and country. Nutritional status and health care inequalities among women followed patterns of socioeconomic disparities. Inequalities in nutritional status favored the better-off and educated women, and inequalities favoring the better-off were even greater for health care across countries.",

Cross-sectional survey. Two coastal villages of the Bagerhat and Khulna districts of Bangladesh. Participants were selected using the simple random sampling technique with the following criteria: mothers who had at least one under-5 child and resided in the study area for not less than three consecutive years. To assess the nutritional status particularly, stunting (height for age) in children under-5, a standardised anthropometric measurement tool, such as a height-measuring vertical scale, was used and categorised into severely stunted, moderately stunted and normal height. The study found that 57.5% of children were severely and 29% were moderately stunted. Findings revealed that mothers' age, prior experience of under-5 mortality, mothers' working status and age of the children were significant determinants of stunting prevalence among children under-5. Moreover, children of mothers aged 21-30 years (AOR = 2.190; 95% CI: 1.039 to 4.613; <i>p</i> = 0.039) and children of mothers without prior experience of under-5 mortality (AOR = 4.426; 95% CI: 1.461 to 13.405; <i>p</i> = 0.009) were more possibly to be severely and moderately stunted, respectively. Additionally, children of non-working mothers were more likely to be moderately (AOR = 4.037; 95% CI: 1.382 to 11.792; <i>p</i> = 0.011) and severely stunted (AOR = 2.538; 95% CI: 1.033 to 6.238; <i>p</i> = 0.042). Moreover, children aged ≤24 months (AOR = 0.151; 95% CI: 0.034 to 0.661; <i>p</i> = 0.012) and 25-36 months (AOR = 0.195; 95% CI: 0.046 to 0.829; <i>p</i> = 0.027) were less possibly to be moderately stunted.

Survivors often suffer lasting neurocognitive consequences that impact academic performance and socioeconomic outcomes. Mechanistic understanding of the emergence of these consequences is poorly understood. Using multi-system SHAP interpreted random forest models and network analysis, we show that Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) associates with enrichment of faecal Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus salivarius and depletion of Bacteroides fragilis in a cohort of one-year-old children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. These microbiome changes form interconnected pathways that involve reduced plasma odd-chain fatty acid levels, decreased gamma and beta electroencephalogram power in temporal and frontal brain regions, and reduced vocalization. These findings support the hypothesis that prolonged colonization by oral commensal species delay gut microbiome and brain development.

Fat-soluble vitamin (FSV) deficiency develops as a consequence of cholestasis. Vitamin D deficiency is common and remains a challenge in patients with cholestasis. Objectives of the study were to evaluate the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status in infants with cholestatic jaundice. This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2017 to June 2018 on purposively sampled infants. Infants who developed jaundice before three months of age, had direct bilirubin of more than 20.0% of the total bilirubin if total bilirubin is ≥5 mg/dl or more than 1.0 mg/dl if total bilirubin is <5 mg/dl, with pale stool and dark urine were included as cases while infants who visited hospital with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease and acute viral infection but no evidence of liver, gastrointestinal disease or renal disease checked by means of medical history, physical examination and a review of medical records were included as controls. Blood was collected from patients with cholestatic liver disease for liver biochemistries, prothrombin time, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium. Blood was also collected from controls for 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <15, 15 to 20 and >20 ng/ml were defined as vitamin D \"deficiency\", \"insufficiency\" and \"sufficiency\" respectively. Thirty patients and 30 controls were evaluated. Mean age in cases and controls were 113.43±74.08 and 145.50±88.62 days respectively (p=0.134). Biliary atresia was found to be the commonest cause, 18(60.0%), followed by idiopathic neonatal hepatitis (INH) 7(23.3%), choledochal cyst 4(13.3%) and 1 case of neonatal hepatitis (NH) due to CMV infection. The mean serum bilirubin (total) was 12.07±3.92 mg/dl, mean serum bilirubin (direct) 6.51±2.03 mg/dl, serum ALT 130.7±67.81 U/L, serum AST 135.07±52.54 U/L, prothrombin time 17.36±11.88 seconds, serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 700.3±555.89 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 560.37±283.12 U/L and serum albumin was 3.6±0.4 gm/dl. Mean serum calcium was 9.18±0.84 mg/dl. Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in cholestatic patients was 14.7±5.75 ng/ml, compared to 27.68±10.44 ng/ml in controls (p=0.001). Vitamin D deficiency was found in 43.3% patients. The correlation between age at presentation and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels was not significant (r = 0.051; p = 0.784). Statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.389; p=0.034) was found between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Serum calcium was found to have statistically significant positive correlation with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (r=0.692; p=0.001). Blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in patients with cholestasis were lower than those of controls. So, adequate vitamin D supplementation and monitoring in this population is of great importance.",

This cross sectional study was carried out in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College and in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh from July 2021 to June 2022. A total of 100 subjects were included in this study. Among them 50 were diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients denoted as case group and 50 were apparently healthy individuals denoted as control group selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Serum vitamin D was estimated by chemiluminescence immunoassay from the subjects. Data were then processed and analyzed. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) version 26 windows package. The study revealed that, mean±SD values of vitamin-D were 25.50±3.63 ng/ml and 27.72±5.25 ng/ml in Group I and Group II respectively. Student's unpaired 't' test was done to measure the level of significance. Serum vitamin-D was significantly lower in Group I than that of Group II. This result has an association with type 2 diabetes mellitus progression and also may has important role in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications.",

        "abstract": "Sepsis is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). It is estimated to cause almost 1 million deaths that accounts for more than 25.0% of neonatal deaths worldwide. In Bangladesh the incidence of neonatal sepsis is 13.4% and sepsis contributes to almost 19.9% of all neonatal death. Vitamin D deficiency in mothers and neonates is being recognized increasingly as a leading cause of many adverse health effects in the newborn infant, including sepsis. Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium and phosphorus homeostasis as well as immunomodulatory actions on immune system. The aim of the study was to determine the association of serum 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency with late onset neonatal sepsis in term and late preterm neonates. This cross-sectional analytic study was conducted in the department of Neonatology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from November 2021 to October 2022. Neonates who were admitted with suspected late onset neonatal sepsis were the study population. Neonates who visited during the same period due to physiological hyper-bilirubinemia (without sepsis) were enrolled as control group. Vitamin D deficiency was found in both sepsis group and control group. But in comparison the sepsis group had significantly lower mean±SD serum vitamin D levels 13.99±6.07 ng/ml than the control group 20.56±5.93 ng/ml (p=0.001). Similarly, vitamin deficiency was also found in mothers of both groups. But mothers of septic neonates also had significantly lower mean±SD vitamin D levels 16.36±6.25 ng/ml than the mothers of non-septic neonates 23.06±5.85 ng/ml (p=0.001). There was strong positive correlation of neonatal 25(OH) D with maternal 25(OH) D in both case (r =0.983; p<0.001) and control (r = 0.970; p<0.001).",

        "abstract": "Infant undernutrition, defined by length- and weight-based indices, is common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but corresponding deficits in head size have received less attention. In a cohort of term newborns in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we compared the severity of deficits (vs. World Health Organization Growth Standards) in head circumference (HC), length and weight at birth and every 3 months until 2 years of age (n range across timepoints: 843-920). We estimated the mean and 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of HC-, length- and weight-for-age z-scores (HCZ, LAZ and WAZ, respectively). Differences between HCZ and LAZ (or WAZ) were analyzed using paired t tests and quantile regression. We also derived HCZ using height-age instead of chronological age at 3-24 months. Mean HCZ was significantly higher than mean LAZ and WAZ at birth, but HCZ was significantly lower than LAZ at 6, 9 and 12 months and the HCZ and LAZ deficits were similar from 15 to 24 months. Mean HCZ was lower than WAZ at all ages beyond birth. Patterns were broadly consistent at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles. The HCZ deficit remained evident when HC was standardized using height-age at all ages beyond birth, indicating HC was reduced relative to body size. In conclusion, among term-born children in Dhaka, HCs were smaller than international standards at all ages up to 2 years, and there was no evidence of postnatal head sparing. Consideration should be given to routine measurement of HC in population health surveys in LMICs.",

        "title": "Diagnostic techniques for visceral leishmaniasis: An overview of methods used in East Africa.",
        "abstract": "Leishmanias is a parasitic infection caused by a protozoan belonging to the genus Leishmania and transmitted by sand fly, Phlebotomus fly in the old world and Lutzomyia in the New world. The disease is prevalent in the tropics, subtropics, and Southern Europe, where it affects about 1.5 million to 2 million people annually. India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil and Ethiopia account for up to 90% of all the VL cases. While Leishmania cases in Asia are declining, cases in East Africa especially in Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya have been increasing. The rise in East African cases is partially attributed to ongoing armed conflicts especially in Somalia, Sudan and Southern Sudan, which has displaced people and increased their exposure to sand fly bites. Migration from endemic to non-endemic regions, misdiagnosis, famine, malnutrition, climate change and an increase in HIV cases are other contributing factors. The clinical diagnosis of Leishmania in East Africa combines the patient's clinical signs with either serological or parasitological test, with rK39 strip and microscopy being the major methods used. Diagnosis of the condition remains challenging, as current techniques have limitations, including the inability to detect parasites in tissue, the need for specialized expertise, prohibitive costs of testing equipment, low antibody titers, and the risk of misdiagnosis due to co-infections with diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and typhoid. Various techniques, including serological and molecular parasitological methods, have been employed in attempts to address these challenges, but with limited success. This article therefore, reviews some of the techniques that have been used in Leishmania diagnosis in East Africa and discusses other available new techniques with aim of overcoming the current challenges.",

        "abstract": "Child undernutrition is a leading global health concern, especially in low and middle-income developing countries, including Bangladesh. Thus, the objectives of this study are to develop an appropriate model for predicting the risk of undernutrition and identify its influencing predictors among under-five children in Bangladesh using explainable machine learning algorithms. This study used the latest nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh demographic health survey (BDHS), 2017-18 data. The Boruta technique was implemented to identify the important predictors of undernutrition, and logistic regression, artificial neural network, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were adopted to predict undernutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight) risk. The models' performance was evaluated through accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to illustrate the influencing predictors of undernutrition. The XGB-based model outperformed the other models, with the accuracy and AUC respectively 81.73% and 0.802 for stunting, 76.15% and 0.622 for wasting, and 79.13% and 0.712 for underweight. Moreover, the SHAP method demonstrated that the father's education, wealth, mother's education, BMI, birth interval, vitamin A, watching television, toilet facility, residence, and water source are the influential predictors of stunting. While, BMI, mother education, and BCG of wasting; and father education, wealth, mother education, BMI, birth interval, toilet facility, breastfeeding, birth order, and residence of underweight. The proposed integrating framework will be supportive as a method for selecting important predictors and predicting children who are at high risk of stunting, wasting, and underweight in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Malnutrition contributes to 45% of all childhood deaths globally, but these modelled estimates lack direct measurements in countries with high malnutrition and under-5 mortality rates. We investigated malnutrition's role in infant and child deaths in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network. We analysed CHAMPS data from seven sites (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and South Africa) collected between 2016 and 2023. An expert panel assessed each death to determine whether malnutrition was an underlying, antecedent or immediate cause or other significant condition. Malnutrition was further classified based on postmortem anthropometry using WHO growth standards for underweight (z-scores for weight-for-age <-2), stunting (length-for-age <-2), and wasting (weight-for-length or MUAC Z-scores <-2). Of 1601 infant and child deaths, malnutrition was considered a causal or significant condition in 632 (39.5%) cases, including 85 (13.4%) with HIV infection. Postmortem measurements indicated 90.1%, 61.2% and 94.1% of these cases were underweight, stunted and wasted, respectively. Most malnutrition-related deaths (n=632) had an infectious cause (89.1%). The adjusted odds of having malnutrition as causal or significant condition were 2.4 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.2) times higher for deaths involving infectious diseases compared with other causes. Common pathogens in the causal pathway for malnutrition-related deaths included <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (30.4%), <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (21.5%), <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (18.7%) and <i>Escherichia coli/Shigella</i> (17.2%). Malnutrition was identified as a causal or significant factor in 39.5% of under-5 deaths in the CHAMPS network, often in combination with infectious diseases. These findings highlight the need for integrated interventions addressing both malnutrition and infectious diseases to effectively reduce under-5 mortality.",

Interventions focusing on preconception nutrition can help break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition by improving the health and nutritional status of women before pregnancy. This study investigated the recent trends and patterns in the nutritional status of nulliparous adolescents and young women across six countries in South Asia: Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This study utilized the cross-sectional data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted between 2010 and 2022 for six South Asian countries. A total sample of 20,024 nulliparous married women aged 15-24 years was analyzed to estimate the pooled prevalence for various anthropometric outcomes. Annual changes in the prevalence of the outcome indicators were presented for each country. Predictors of thinness and overweight were analyzed using logistic regression models. Based on the latest rounds of DHS for respective countries, the pooled weighted prevalence of thinness was 24.4%, overweight was 24.8%, and short height was 11.3%. The prevalence of underweight ranged from 14.6% in Pakistan (DHS 2018) to 25.9% in India (DHS 2021). The least reduction in the prevalence of underweight was observed in India at 2.8% and Nepal at 0.7%. Based on the latest surveys, the mean BMI among women aged 15-24 years was the highest in Maldives (24.1, 95% CI: 23.4, 24.8) and Pakistan (22.9, 95% CI: 22.2, 23.5) and the lowest in India (20.9, 95% CI: 20.9, 21.0) and Nepal (20.8, 95% CI: 20.4, 21.2). The pooled prevalence of thinness and short height was high in rural areas (26.2 and 11.8%), among less educated (28.1 and 14.5%), and bottom 40% wealth quintile groups (29.8 and 15.8%). Compared to young women (20-24 years), adolescent girls were 39% more likely to be underweight (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.25, 1.54). The findings highlight the need to broaden the scope of policies and programs designed for pregnant and lactating women so that nulliparous married women can be screened frequently for their anthropometric progress. Given the uneven distribution of the burden, it is recommended to implement comprehensive nutrition packages to reach all population subgroups across the regions.",

We analyzed 6 788 947 respondents' data from a cross-sectional and nationally representative 2021 Bangladesh Disaster-related Statistics (BDRS). The key explanatory variables were the types of disasters respondents faced, while the outcome variables were the disease burden during and following disasters. Descriptive statistics were used to determine disease burden. A multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model assessed the association between disease burden and disaster types, along with socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. Nearly 50% of respondents experienced diseases during disasters, rising to 53.4% afterward. Fever, cough and diarrhea were prevalent during and after disasters, with increases in skin diseases, malnutrition, and asthma post-disaster. Vulnerable groups, such as children aged 0-4, hijra individuals, those with lower education, people with disabilities, and rural residents, especially in Chattogram, Rangpur, and Sylhet divisions, were most affected. Floods, cyclones, thunderstorms, and hailstorms significantly increased disease likelihood during and after disasters.

        "abstract": "Vitamin D insufficiency is a worldwide problem that is likely underestimated since physical symptoms may only be apparent in individuals with severe deficiencies. Previously, people in South Asian countries were thought to be vitamin D sufficient because of plentiful sunshine, but vitamin D insufficiency has also been reported in these countries. In a South Asian country like Bangladesh, people living in the rural and urban parts of the country can have considerable differences in their sun exposure, types of clothing worn, and levels of air pollution. This pilot study aimed to explore the vitamin D status (measured by serum 25[OH]D) of healthy urban and rural Bangladeshi people and to examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with calcium and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. A total of 101 apparently healthy adult individuals, aged 20-58 years, were enrolled from both urban and rural areas. The participants were selected from students, staff and patient attendants from the outpatient department (OPD) of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Mirsarai Upazila Health Complex, Chittagong. The overall rate of vitamin D insufficiency was 39.6% and of vitamin D deficiency was 51.5%. However, it was observed that the proportion of vitamin D-deficient participants in urban areas (70.6%) was more than double that of participants living in rural areas (32%) and that serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in rural compared to urban participants with similar sunlight exposure times. However, participants aged 50 years or more showed similar concentrations of serum vitamin D levels irrespective of their habitat. This pilot study highlights the need for further larger-scale studies in Bangladesh to determine the reasons for the high rates of vitamin D inadequacy overall and the differences between rural and urban populations.",

The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight in Bangladesh was 31%, 8%, and 22%, respectively, with notable urban-rural variations. Under-5 children who lived in houses constructed with unimproved materials (aRR: 1·17), exposed to household air pollution (aPR: 1·37), had unimproved drinking water sources (aPR: 1·28) or had poor handwashing facilities (aPR: 1·24) had a greater likelihood of stunting compared to their counterparts. Similar associations were observed for underweight. The likelihood of stunting and underweight increased with increasing scores of poor HECs, with variations in the effect size across urban-rural areas. The high prevalence of stunting and underweight in Bangladesh is linked to poor HECs, therefore, integrated approaches should be adopted to address these environmental factors collectively. Policies and programmes should prioritse enhancing housing quality to achieve sustainable improvements in child nutritional outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Small-for-gestational age (SGA) is a causal factor for malnutrition (undernutrition). The available evidence on this causal relationship is based on observational studies and suffers from confounding and collider biases. This study aimed to construct a theoretical causal model to estimate the effect of SGA on malnutrition in children aged less than 5 years. For the causal model, we designated term-SGA status as the exposure variable and malnutrition at 6 months to 5 years of age (diagnosed by World Health Organization criteria) as the outcome variable. Causal estimands were formulated for three stakeholders. A \"rapid narrative review\" methodology was adopted for literature synthesis. Studies (observational and randomized) listing the causal factors of malnutrition in children aged less than 5 years from the Indian subcontinent were eligible. Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest) were searched and restricted to the last 10 years (search date: December 15, 2023). Information about the causal factors (covariates) of malnutrition and study characteristics was extracted from the article abstracts. Next, a causal model in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (DAGitty software) was constructed by connecting exposure, outcome, and covariate nodes using the sequential causal criteria of temporality, face validity, recourse to theory, and counterfactual thought experiments. The search yielded 4818 records, of which 342 abstracts were included. Most of the studies were conducted in India (39%) and Bangladesh (27%). The literature synthesis identified 81 factors that were grouped into 17 nodes, referring to 5 domains: socioeconomic, parental, child-related, environmental, and political. The DAG identified 12 different minimal sufficient adjustment sets (conditioning sets for regression analysis) to estimate the total effect of SGA on malnutrition. We offer an evidence-based causal diagram that will minimize bias due to improper selection of factors in studies focusing on malnutrition in term-SGA infants. The DAG and adjustment sets will facilitate the design and data analysis of future studies.",

A longitudinal investigation was conducted among well-nourished and SAM children of 6-59 months in Rohingya refugee camps. These two groups (350 children in each group) of children were observed over 12 weeks and individual data were collected during admission, follow-up visits, and at the time of discharge. Anthropometric information was collected following standard procedures. The thicknesses of the biceps, triceps, subscapular, and supra iliac skinfolds were measured using a Herpenden-type skinfold caliper. Separate linear mixed models were conducted to assess associations of the independent variables (i.e., group and time) with each of the dependent variables (i.e., biceps, triceps, subscapular, supra-iliac skinfold thickness (ST), fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM)). Both in well-nourished and SAM children, the mean biceps, triceps, subscapular, and supra-iliac ST, FM, and FFM increased over the 12 weeks. The increase in biceps ST was significantly faster in the SAM children compared to the well-nourished children (difference in slope = 0.366 mm every four weeks; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The increment rate in triceps ST was also faster in the SAM children compared to the well-nourished children (difference in slope = 0.430 mm every four weeks; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, the pace of increase in subscapular (difference in slope = 0.027 mm every four weeks; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and supra-iliac (difference in slope = 0.211 mm every four weeks, <i>p</i> < 0.001) ST was also significantly higher in the SAM group. Similarly, the change in FM (difference in slope = 0.065 kg every four weeks, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and FFM (difference in slope = 0.152 kg every four weeks, <i>p</i> = 0.023) was also significantly faster in SAM children compared to the well-nourished children over the treatment period. Furthermore, the girls gained significantly higher triceps ST, subscapular ST, FM, and FFM compared to the boys. The benefit of RUTF was evident from this longitudinal study in the recovery of FM and FFM contents among the SAM children of Rohingya refugee camps.",

        "abstract": "In India, currently, there are no standard guidelines for the management of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Previous research in Bangladesh has shown that children with MAM have impaired gut microbiota development, and microbiota-directed complementary foods (MDCF) can potentially repair their gut microbiota. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptability and safety of supplementing shelf-stable formulation of MDCF in Indian children with MAM as compared with a locally prepared ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) in 3 geographically distinct Indian populations and to establish and pilot systems of intervention delivery, collection, transport, and storage of stool samples using stringent protocols. This pre-proof-of-concept (prePOC), multicentric, open-labeled, age-stratified, randomized controlled trial was done in children aged 6-18 mo with MAM. After a run-in period of 2 wk, the participants were supplemented with MDCF or RUSF for 4 wk through direct observation and followed up for another 2 wk post intervention. Maternal responses to the acceptability of the organoleptic properties of supplements were recorded weekly during the intervention phase of 4 wk. Compliance was reported based on the amount of supplement consumed by the children. Feasibility of weekly stool sample collection (except 7th week) within 30 min of passage was recorded. Anthropometric measurements were done at baseline and endline. Monitoring for adverse events was done throughout the course of the study. A total of 240 children with MAM were randomly selected to receive either MDCF or RUSF, of which 221 (92.1%) completed follow-up. The overall acceptability for >80% of the maternal responses was reported as good or very good for all organoleptic properties in both MDCF and RUSF arms. MDCF and RUSF interventions had good-to-high compliance in 83.0% and 79.8% of participants, respectively. At the end of the intervention phase, 53.2% (58/109) of children in MDCF arm against 42.0% (47/112) in RUSF arm had weight-for-length Z score >-2. The overall incidence of acute gastroenteritis reported was low; higher in MDCF compared with RUSF but not statistically significant. The prePOC study demonstrates good acceptability and safety of MDCF among Indian children with MAM including the age group of 6-12 mo of age. The study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a long-term supplementation study in this population. The study was registered at the clinical trial registry of India as CTRI/2023/01/048716.",

        "abstract": "Globally, moderate wasting affects approximately 33 million children. Complex bidirectional interactions exist between wasting and infection in children. Children who experience both conditions have an increased risk of adverse outcomes including progression to severe wasting and mortality. Breaking the cycle between moderate wasting and infection could help improve growth and survival in these children. The NUTRIMAM trial will aim to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week regimen of three different nutritional interventions in at-risk young children (i.e., children who are moderately wasted and have one/more acute infections) on anthropometric recovery. Further, the study will explore whether recovery can be sustained with a post-intervention package that includes counseling and food vouchers. Sustaining anthropometric recovery beyond supplement administration will have important implications for programs. NUTRIMAM is a multi-country, multi-center individually randomized, open-label, trial in five countries including Bangladesh, India, Mali, Pakistan, and Tanzania. A total of 6360 moderately wasted children aged 6 to 24 months with acute illness will be enrolled at health centers. Children will be randomly allocated to receive one of three dietary supplements (locally available foods, ready-to-use supplementary foods, or microbiota-directed supplementary foods) for 12 weeks. Anthropometric recovery will be assessed over this period. Participants who recover will then be re-randomized to a post-recovery support intervention comprising either counseling and food vouchers or routine standard of care for recovered children for an additional 12 weeks to determine if this intervention facilitates sustained recovery at 24 weeks. Children who are moderately wasted and have an infection are at higher risk of adverse outcomes. There are very few clinical trials that have been performed among children with moderate wasting with infectious illnesses to investigate if it is possible to break the undernutrition-infection cycle and thereby reduce the risk of nutritional deterioration to severe wasting or mortality and decrease the risk of acute infections. The results of the trial are anticipated to fill important evidence gaps in feeding recommendations for moderately wasted children with acute illness as well as interventions to sustain anthropometric recovery in children beyond the period of the nutritional intervention.

        "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to document the changing paradigm of malnutrition in Bangladesh and estimating how this is creating an intergenerational risk. This paper also examines national policy responses to tackle the silent epidemic of double burden of malnutrition. Publicly available datasets of five Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys were used to see the changing paradigm of malnutrition among Bangladesh women. In addition to that, four national policies concerning, maternal and child health; and nutrition were reviewed using CDC's 2013 Policy Analytical Framework. In Bangladesh, the share of ever-married women aged 15-49 who were underweight declined sharply between 2007 and 2017-2018, from 30 to 12%. In the same period, the proportion of women who were overweight or obese increased from 12 to 32%. Despite remarkable progress in reducing undernourishment among women, the share of well-nourished remained unchanged: 58% in 2007 and 56% in 2017-2018, mainly due to the shift in the dominant burden from undernutrition to overnutrition. This shift occurred around 2012-2013. Currently, in Bangladesh 0.8 million of births occur to overweight women and 0.5 million births occur to underweight women. If the current trend in malnutrition continues, pregnancies/births among overweight women will increase. Bangladesh's existing relevant policies concerning maternal health and nutrition are inadequate and mostly address the underweight spectrum of malnutrition. Both forms of malnutrition pose a risk for maternal and child health. Underweight mothers are at risk of having anemia, antepartum/postpartum hemorrhage, and premature rupture of membranes. Maternal obesity increases the risk of perinatal complications, such as gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and cesarean deliveries. Currently, around 24% of the children are born to overweight/obese mothers and 15% to underweight mothers. Bangladesh should revise its national policies to address the double burden of malnutrition among women of reproductive age across pre-conception, pregnancy, and post-natal stages to ensure optimum maternal and child health.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the complex link between vitamin D and neurological illnesses, focusing on how vitamin D affects possible risk factors, therapeutic applications, and the trajectory of the disease. An epidemiological study has linked vitamin D insufficiency to several neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It is hypothesized that immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D contribute to its neuroprotective effects. Two major mechanisms in dementia include neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Adequate levels of vitamin D have been shown in both animal models and human studies to enhance both clinical outcomes and the duration of illness in those who have it. Other ways that vitamin D contributes to its therapeutic potential include the production of neurotrophic factors, control over neurotransmitter synthesis, and preservation of the blood-brain barrier. Despite the encouraging outcomes, research is still being conducted to determine the optimal dosage and long-term benefits of vitamin D supplementation on brain function. In order to furnish precise directives and clarify the processes behind the neuroprotective impacts of vitamin D, future research must focus on large-scale randomized controlled studies. . This study highlights the significance of maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D as a modifiable risk factor for neurological disorders. Further study is also required to comprehend the possible medical benefits of this vitamin fully.",

Stunting is a valid and widely acknowledged measure of chronic child malnutrition. This study extracted data of 7778 under-5 children from the 2017-2018 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey and aims to explore the relationship between socio-demographic factors and the nutritional status of children under the age of 5. The anthropometric indicator height-for-age z-score (HAZ) was used as the target variable. The quantile regression method was employed to examine the heterogeneous relationship between the covariates and the conditional HAZ distribution across five different quantiles. This study found that 31.4% of children were severely to moderately stunted and a negative association between children's age and their HAZ. Additionally, children whose mothers had attained at least a secondary education exhibited a positive correlation with their HAZ. Another important factor was the mother's body mass index, which had a two-fold effect on the HAZ. Among the administrative divisions, children from the Sylhet division exhibited a negative association with the HAZ. Additionally, children with a high wealth index exhibited a positive association with the HAZ. Collaborative efforts from different organisations, as well as small and large communities in rural and urban areas, are necessary to improve nutritional status of children in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Suboptimal water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices constitute a serious public health risk, affecting one-third of the world's population. Remarkable progress has been made to improve WASH; however, challenges remain, with rapid population growth adding pressure on WASH systems. This study explores the current state of WASH practices and diseases in Africa, identifies challenges, and proposes public health recommendations for sustainable implementation. The staggering burden of WASH-related diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Africa, threatens public health, with millions of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to poor WASH practices annually. Notable challenges plaguing WASH practices in the region include poverty, malnutrition, poor data reporting, illiteracy, climate change, and poor healthcare financing. This results in adverse health consequences, including waterborne infections like cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and diarrheal diseases. Additionally, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, trachoma, lost productivity, and environmental pollution from soil and underground water contamination have been implicated. Geographical disparities, cultural norms, and inadequate funding further complicate efforts to improve WASH infrastructure and practices. Globally concerted efforts are required to address these issues and permit WASH practices to protect human health by preventing infectious diseases and contributing to economic growth. Strong financial frameworks, skills training, and tools like WASH Fit are recommended for a stronger WASH approach in Africa. The consequences of poor WASH extend beyond public health, impacting economic growth, gender equality, and environmental sustainability. WaterAid's policy recommendations prioritizing government administration, institutional capacity enhancement, and more financial resources are expedient.",

Complete anthropometric recovery after standard, short-term interventions is rare, with children often left with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM; WLZ -2 to -3). We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 12- to 18-month-old Bangladeshi children from urban and rural sites, who, after initial hospital-based treatment for SAM, received a 3-month intervention with a microbiome-directed complementary food (MDCF-2) or a calorically more dense, standard ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). The rate of WLZ improvement was significantly greater in MDCF-2-treated children (<i>P</i> = 8.73 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), similar to our previous RCT of Bangladeshi children with MAM without antecedent SAM (<i>P</i> = 0.032). A correlated meta-analysis of plasma levels of 4520 proteins in both RCTs revealed 215 positively associated with WLZ (largely representing musculoskeletal and central nervous system development) and 44 negatively associated (primarily related to immune activation). Moreover, the positively associated proteins were significantly enriched by MDCF-2 (<i>q</i> = 1.1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Characterizing the abundances of 754 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes in serially collected fecal samples disclosed the effects of acute rehabilitation for SAM on the microbiome and how, during treatment for MAM, specific strains of <i>Prevotella copri</i> function at the intersection between MDCF-2 glycan metabolism and anthropometric recovery. These results provide a rationale for further testing the generalizability of MDCF efficacy and for identifying biomarkers to define treatment responses.",

        "abstract": "Evidence-based decision-making is essential to improve public health benefits and resources, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but the mechanisms of its implementation remain less straightforward. The availability of high-quality, reliable, and sufficient data in LMICs can be challenging due to issues such as a lack of human resource capacity and weak digital infrastructure, among others. Health information systems (HISs) have been critical for aggregating and integrating health-related data from different sources to support evidence-based decision-making. Nutrition information systems (NISs), which are nutrition-focused HISs, collect and report on nutrition-related indicators to improve issues related to malnutrition and food security-and can assist in improving populations' nutritional statuses and the integration of nutrition programming into routine health services. Data visualization tools (DVTs) such as dashboards have been recommended to support evidence-based decision-making, leveraging data from HISs or NISs. The use of such DVTs to support decision-making has largely been unexplored within LMIC contexts. In Bangladesh, the Mukto dashboard was developed to display and visualize nutrition-related performance indicators at the national and subnational levels. However, despite this effort, the current use of nutrition data to guide priorities and decisions remains relatively nascent and underused. The goal of this study is to better understand how Bangladesh's NIS, including the Mukto dashboard, has been used and areas for improvement to facilitate its use for evidence-based decision-making toward ameliorating nutrition-related service delivery and the health status of communities in Bangladesh. Primary data collection was conducted through qualitative semistructured interviews with key policy-level stakeholders (n=24). Key informants were identified through purposive sampling and were asked questions about the experiences and challenges with the NIS and related nutrition dashboards. Main themes such as trust, data usability, personal power, and data use for decision-making emerged from the data. Trust in both data collection and quality was lacking among many stakeholders. Poor data usability stemmed from unstandardized indicators, irregular data collection, and differences between rural and urban data. Insufficient personal power and staff training coupled with infrastructural challenges can negatively affect data at the input stage. While stakeholders understood and expressed the importance of evidence-based decision-making, ultimately, they noted that the data were not being used to their maximum potential. Leveraging DVTs can improve the use of data for evidence-based decision-making, but decision makers must trust that the data are believable, credible, timely, and responsive. The results support the significance of a tailored data ecosystem, which has not reached its full potential in Bangladesh. Recommendations to reach this potential include ensuring a clear intended user base and accountable stakeholders are present. Systems should also have the capacity to ensure data credibility and support ongoing personal power requirements.",

Leveraging an EED histology scoring system, this multicountry analysis examined biomarker associations with duodenal histology features among children with EED. We also examined differences in 2-h compared with 1-h urine collections in the lactulose rhamnose (LR) dual sugar test. Three cohorts of undernourished children unresponsive to nutrition intervention underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and duodenal biopsies. Histopathology scores were compared to fecal calprotectin (CAL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), neopterin (NEO), and urinary LR ratio and lactulose percentage recovery. Log-transformed biomarkers were used in linear regressions adjusted for age, center, and sample collection-biopsy time interval in multivariable models. Data on >1 biomarker were available for 120 Bangladeshi (CAL, MPO, NEO, and LR), 63 Pakistani (MPO, NEO, and LR), and 63 Zambian children (CAL). Median age at endoscopy was similar (19 mo) across centers. Median sample collection prior to endoscopy was consistent with each center's study design: 2 wk in Bangladesh (urine and stool) and Zambia (stool), and 6 (urine) and 11 (stool) mo in Pakistan. In multivariable models, intraepithelial lymphocytes were associated with CAL (exponentiated [exp.] coefficient: 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1, 1.41), intramucosal Brunner's glands with MPO (exp. coefficient: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.69) and NEO (exp. coefficient: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7), and chronic inflammation with NEO (exp. coefficient: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.17). Intraepithelial lymphocytes were associated with lactulose % recovery (exp. coefficient: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.41). LR recovery was substantially lower in 1-h collections than in 2-h collections. Four commonly used markers of enteric dysfunction were associated with specific histologic features. One-hour urine collection may be insufficient to reflect small bowel permeability in LR testing. While acknowledging the challenges with obtaining relevant tissue, these findings form the basis for further EED biomarker validation research.",

        "abstract": "Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an asymptomatic intestinal disorder associated with growth impairment, delayed neurocognitive development, and impaired oral vaccine responses. We set out to develop and validate a histopathologic scoring system on duodenal biopsies from a cohort study of children with growth failure in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Zambia (\"EED\") with reference to biopsies from United States children with no clinically reported histologic pathology (referred to hereafter as \"normal\") or celiac disease. Five gastrointestinal pathologists evaluated 745 hematoxylin and eosin slide images from 291 children with EED (mean age: 1.6 y) and 66 United States children (mean age: 6.8 y). Histomorphologic features (i.e., villus/crypt architecture, goblet cells, epithelial and lamina propria acute/chronic inflammation, Brunner's glands, Paneth cells, epithelial detachment, enterocyte injury, and foveolar metaplasia) were used to score each histopathologic slide. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine differences between EED, normal, and celiac disease, and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive value. Biopsies from the duodenal bulb showed higher intramucosal Brunner's gland scores and lower intraepithelial lymphocyte scores than from the second or third parts of the duodenum (D2/3), so only D2/3 were included in the final analysis. Although 7 parameters differed significantly between EED and normal biopsies in regression models, only 5 (blunted villus architecture, increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis, goblet cell depletion, Paneth cell depletion, and reduced intramucosal Brunner's glands) were required to create a total score percentage (TSP-5) that correctly identified EED against normal biopsies (AUC: 0.992; 95% CI: 0.983, 0.998). Geographic comparisons showed more severe goblet cell depletion in Bangladesh and more marked intraepithelial lymphocytosis in Pakistan. This scoring system involving 5 histologic parameters demonstrates very high discrimination between EED and normal biopsies, indicating that this scoring system can be applied with confidence to studies of intestinal biopsies in EED.",

Although ETEC are associated with long-term sequelae including malnutrition, the acute diarrheal illness is largely self-limited. Recent studies indicate that in addition to causing diarrhea, the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) modulates the expression of many genes in intestinal epithelia, including carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) which ETEC exploit as receptors, enabling toxin delivery. Here, however, we demonstrate that LT also enhances the expression of CEACAMs on extracellular vesicles (EV) shed by intestinal epithelia and that CEACAM-laden EV increase in abundance during human infections, mitigate pathogen-host interactions, scavenge free ETEC toxins, and accelerate ETEC clearance from the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, these findings indicate that CEACAMs play a multifaceted role in ETEC pathogen-host interactions, transiently favoring the pathogen, but ultimately contributing to innate responses that extinguish these common infections.",

        "abstract": "Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) can be diagnosed using weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) and/or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Although some favor using MUAC alone, valuing its presumed ability to identify children at greatest need for nutritional care, the functional severity and physiological responses to treatment in children with varying deficits in WHZ and MUAC remain inadequately characterized. We aimed to compare clinical and biochemical responses to treatment in children with 1) both low MUAC and low WHZ, 2) low MUAC-only, and 3) low WHZ-only. A multicenter, observational cohort study was conducted in children aged 6-59 mo with nonedematous, uncomplicated SAM in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Liberia. Anthropometric measurements and critical indicators were collected 3 times during treatment; metrics included clinical status, nutritional status, viability, and serum leptin, a biomarker of mortality risk in SAM. Children with combined MUAC and WHZ deficits had greater increases in leptin levels during treatment than those with low MUAC alone, showing a 34.4% greater increase on the second visit (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.6%, 43.6%; P = 0.02) and a 34.3% greater increase on the third visit (95% CI: 13.2%, 50.3%; P = 0.01). Similarly, weight gain velocity was higher by 1.56 g/kg/d in the combined deficit group (95% CI: 0.38, 2.75; P = 0.03) compared with children with low MUAC-only. Children with combined deficits had higher rates of iron deficiency and wasting while those with low WHZ alone and combined deficits had higher rates of tachypnea and pneumonia during treatment. Given the comparable treatment responses of children with low WHZ alone and those with low MUAC alone, and the greater vulnerability at admission and during treatment in those with combined deficits, our findings support retaining WHZ as an independent diagnostic and admission criterion of SAM, alongside MUAC.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh continues to face the persistent issue of child malnutrition. This study aims to investigate the influence of parental characteristics on undernutrition among children under the age of five in both urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. This study utilizes data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2017-18, which includes 7806 children under the age of five and their parents. The effects of parental education and occupation on undernutrition (e.g., stunting, underweight, and wasting) are examined using the binary probit regression technique. Among rural children, 32.6% are stunted, 22.5% are underweight, and 8.1% are wasted. The corresponding figures for urban children are 25.3%, 18.9%, and 8.9%, respectively. In all forms of undernutrition, children living in rural areas face greater challenges than those living in urban areas. The prevalence of stunting and underweight is low among children, irrespective of their rural or urban background, when both parents have the same level of education. The prevalence is also low when fathers are employers or traders and mothers are homemakers, or when highly educated fathers are employers or traders and highly educated mothers are homemakers. In both rural and urban areas, the risk of stunting, underweight and all forms of malnutrition among children decreases as parents' education levels increase. Children whose fathers work in service or business activities are less likely to experience stunting, being underweight, or wasting compared to children whose fathers work in agriculture or other professions in both areas. In urban areas, children born to mothers with lower levels of education are more vulnerable to wasting than children whose mothers have at least secondary education. To reduce child undernutrition nationwide, it is recommended that both parents have at least a secondary school education and that the father has a stable and sufficient income.",

        "abstract": "Currently, food price inflation is a widespread issue in Bangladesh as well as the rest of the world. Malnutrition is a common issue among children that can have long-lasting effects on their development and overall health. There have been lots of studies conducted to identify the factors responsible for child malnutrition, but inflation is rarely considered a factor in child malnutrition. We aimed to determine the relationship between food price inflation and stunting (Height-for-Age Z-score (HAZ)) in children under five years of age in Bangladesh. The study utilized food price data from the World Food Programme database and malnutrition (stunting) information from the 2014 and 2017-18 Bangladesh Demographic Health Surveys (BDHS). This includes the total study period from 2009 to 2018. Food prices were linked to the BDHS dataset using each child's birth month. For each child, the average food prices from 9 months prior to 5 months post-birth, including their birth month, were recorded to calculate month-to-month inflation. This inflation was computed for rice (coarse), oil, wheat flour, and lentils by comparing the price sum of each item from one month to the previous month and dividing by the total price of the preceding month. A generalized linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between food price inflation and stunting, with stunting as the dependent variable. Other explanatory variables included wealth index, sex of the child, height, weight, mother's education, respondent's current pregnancy, and breastfeeding status. Our study has revealed that food price inflation has a significant negative effect on stunting, with a coefficient of -0.127 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, we have identified several other factors that have also significantly negative associations with stunting, including the wealth index (p < 0.001), mother's education level (p < 0.001), mother's pregnancy status (p < 0.001), breastfeeding (p < 0.001), child's age (p < 0.001). child's weight (p < 0.001) has significantly positive effect on stunting. However, we did not find any significant differences in stunting between boys and girls. In conclusion, the findings of this study underscore the significant negative impact of food price inflation on child stunting, emphasizing the need to acknowledge this factor alongside others. These results highlight the critical role of addressing food price inflation as a key determinant of stunting, in conjunction with various other contributing factors, in efforts to combat childhood malnutrition.",

Thirteen different amino acids were identified, with leucine, glycine, alanine, lysine, and phenylalanine dominating, and their contents varying by species. Therefore, regular consumption of these aquatic plants might be a healthy approach to addressing malnutrition and enhancing biofunctional activities.",

        "abstract": "Limited knowledge on nutritional epidemiology in Ghanaian children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) necessitates a comprehensive investigation for an improved understanding of malnutrition in this population. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of malnutrition among children with CP in Ghana. The study used data collected as part of the Ghana CP Register (GCPR). The GCPR is an institution-based surveillance of children with CP aged < 18 years in Ghana. Between October 2018 and April 2020, <i>N</i> = 455 children with CP were registered. Data were collected on (i) weight, length or height, mid-upper-arm-circumference of children with CP; (ii) socio-demographic characteristics; (iii) motor type and topography, gross motor function classification system level (GMFCS); (iv) associated impairments; (v) educational and rehabilitation status for each child. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. Mean and standard deviation age of the registered children at assessment was 5.9 ± 4.1 years, and 42.1% were female. Two-thirds of the children had ≥ one form of undernutrition (underweight or severely underweight: 38.9%, stunted or severely stunted: 51.2%, thin or severely thin: 23.8%). In the adjusted analysis, low maternal education, GMFCS-IV, speech impairment and epilepsy significantly increased the odds of undernutrition among participating children (aOR: 2.6 [95% CI:1.3-5.4]; 2.2 [95% CI:1.0-4.8]; 2.0 [95% CI:1.1-3.6]; 2.9 [95% CI:1.1-7.5] respectively). The high malnutrition rate indicates an urgent need for nutrition interventions and translational research to improve nutritional status and prevent adverse outcomes among children with CP in Ghana. Our study contributes important data and a framework to develop guidelines and evidence-based interventions for children with CP in Ghana.",

        "title": "Exploring beneficial effects of phytobiotics in marine shrimp farming: A review.",
        "abstract": "Marine shrimp farming, mainly <i>Penaeus monodon</i> and <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i>, is an important component of the aquaculture industry. Marine shrimp farming helps produce a protein source for humans, provides job opportunities, and generates lucrative profits for investors. Intensification farming practices can lead to poor water quality, stress, and malnutrition among the farmed marine shrimp, resulting in disease outbreaks and poor production, impeding the development of marine shrimp farming. Antibiotics are the common short-term solution to treat diseases in marine shrimp farming. Moreover, the negative impacts of using antibiotics on public health and the environment erode consumer confidence in aquaculture products. Recently, research on using phytobiotics as a prophylactic agent in aquaculture has become a hot topic. Various phytobiotics have been explored to reveal their beneficial effects on aquaculture species. In this review paper, the sources and modes of action of phytobiotics are presented. The roles of phytobiotics in improving growth performance, increasing antioxidant capacity, enhancing the immune system, stimulating disease resistance, and mitigating stress due to abiotic factors in marine shrimp culture are recapitulated and discussed.",

        "title": "Improving Rice Grain Quality Through Ecotype Breeding for Enhancing Food and Nutritional Security in Asia-Pacific Region.",
        "abstract": "Rice grain is widely consumed as a staple food, providing essential nutrition for households, particularly marginalized families. It plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, promoting human nutrition, supporting good health, and contributing to global food and nutritional security. Addressing the diverse quality demands of emerging diverse and climate-risked population dietary needs requires the development of a single variety of rice grain that can meet the various dietary and nutritional requirements. However, there is a lack of concrete definition for rice grain quality, making it challenging to cater to the different demands. The lack of sufficient genetic study and development in improving rice grain quality has resulted in widespread malnutrition, hidden hunger, and micronutrient deficiencies affecting a significant portion of the global population. Therefore, it is crucial to identify genetically evolved varieties with marked qualities that can help address these issues. Various factors account for the declining quality of rice grain and requires further study to improve their quality for healthier diets. We characterized rice grain quality using Lancastrians descriptor and a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic quality traits. Next, we examined various components of rice grain quality favored in the Asia-Pacific region. This includes preferences by different communities, rice industry stakeholders, and value chain actors. We also explored the biological aspects of rice grain quality in the region, as well as specific genetic improvements that have been made in these traits. Additionally, we evaluated the factors that can influence rice grain quality and discussed the future directions for ensuring food and nutritional security and meeting consumer demands for grain quality. We explored the diverse consumer bases and their varied preferences in Asian-Pacific countries including India, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Korea, Myanmar and Japan. The quality preferences encompassed a range of factors, including rice head recovery, grain shape, uniform size before cooking, gelatinization, chalkiness, texture, amylose content, aroma, red-coloration of grain, soft and shine when cooked, unbroken when cooked, gelatinization, less water required for cooking, gelatinization temperature (less cooking time), aged rice, firm and dry when cooked (gel consistency), extreme white, soft when chewed, easy-to-cook rice (parboiled rice), vitamins, and minerals. These preferences were evaluated across high, low, and medium categories. A comprehensive analysis is provided on the enhancement of grain quality traits, including brown rice recovery, recovery rate of milled rice, head rice recovery, as well as morphological traits such as grain length, grain width, grain length-width ratio, and grain chalkiness. We also explored the characteristics of amylose, gel consistency, gelatinization temperature, viscosity, as well as the nutritional qualities of rice grains such as starch, protein, lipids, vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and bio-fortification potential. The various factors that impact the quality of rice grains, including pre-harvest, post-harvest, and genotype considerations were explored. Additionally, we discussed the future direction and genetic strategies to effectively tackle these challenges. These qualitative characteristics represent the fundamental focus of regional and national breeding strategies employed by different countries to meet consumer preference. Given the significance of rice as a staple food in Asia-Pacific countries, it is primarily consumed domestically, with only a small portion being exported internationally. All the important attributes must be clearly defined within specific parameters. It is crucial for geneticists and breeders to develop a rice variety that can meet the diverse demands of consumers worldwide by incorporating multiple desirable traits. Thus, the goal of addressing global food and nutritional security, and human healthy can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) cause hundreds of millions of diarrheal illnesses annually ranging from mildly symptomatic cases to severe, life-threatening cholera-like diarrhea. Although ETEC are associated with long-term sequelae including malnutrition, the acute diarrheal illness is largely self-limited. Recent studies indicate that in addition to causing diarrhea, the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) modulates the expression of many genes in intestinal epithelia, including carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) which ETEC exploit as receptors, enabling toxin delivery. Here however, we demonstrate that LT also enhances the expression of CEACAMs on extracellular vesicles (EV) shed by intestinal epithelia and that CEACAM-laden EV increase in abundance during human infections, mitigate pathogen-host interactions, scavenge free ETEC toxins, and accelerate ETEC clearance from the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, these findings indicate that CEACAMs play a multifaceted role in ETEC pathogen-host interactions, transiently favoring the pathogen, but ultimately contributing to innate responses that extinguish these common infections.",
